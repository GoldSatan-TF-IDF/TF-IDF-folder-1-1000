venice respectfully presents his greetings i wish to recount the journey which i made to england in the year the events which i witnessed and the people i met these being i hope of some interest to those concerned with curiosity equally i intend my account to expose the lies told by those whom i once numbered wrongly amongst my friends i do not intend to pen a lengthy selfjustification or tell in detail how i was deceived and cheated out of renown which should rightfully be mine my recital i believe will speak for itself i will leave out much but nothing of significance much of my tour around that country was of interest only to myself and finds no mention here many of those i met similarly were of little consequence those who in later years did me harm i describe as i knew them then and i beg any reader to remember that although i was hardly callow i was not yet wise in the ways of the world if my narrative appears simple and foolish then you must conclude that the young man of so many years past was similarly so i do not go back to my portrait to add extra layers of tint and varnish to cover my errors or the weakness of my draftsmanship i will make no accusations and indulge in no polemic against others rather i will say what happened confident that i need do no more my father giovanni da cola was a merchant and for the last years of his life was occupied in the importation of luxury goods into england which though an unsophisticated country was nonetheless beginning to rouse itself from the effects of revolution he had shrewdly recognized from afar that the return of king charles ii meant that vast profits would once again be there for the taking and stealing a march on more timid traders he established himself in london to provide the wealthier english with those luxuries which the puritan zealots had discouraged for so many years his business prosperedhe had a good man in london in giovanni di pietro and also entered into a partnership with an english trader with whom he split his profit as he once told me it was a fair bargainthis john mansion was sly and dishonest but possessed unrivaled knowledge of english tastes more importantly the english had passed a law to stop goods coming into their ports in foreign boats and mansion was a way through this difficulty as long as my father had di pietro in place to keep an eye firmly on the accounts he believed there was little chance of being cheated he was long past the time when he took a direct interest in his business having already converted a portion of his capital into land on terra firma to prepare for admission to the golden book although a merchant himself he intended his children to be gentlemen and discouraged me from active participation in his business i mention this as an indication of his goodnesshe had noticed early on that i had little mind for trade and encouraged me to turn my face against the life he led he also knew that my sisters new husband was more fitted for ventures than i so while my father secured the family name and fortune imy mother being dead and one sister usefully marriedwas in padua to acquire the smatterings of polite knowledge he was content to have his son a member of our nobility but did not wish to have me as ignorant as they at this point and of mature yearsi was now rising thirtyi was suddenly struck by a burning enthusiasm to become a citizen of the republic of learning as it is called this sudden passion i can no longer recall so completely has it left me but then the fascination of the new experimental philosophy held me under its spell it was of course a matter of the spirit rather than of practical application i say with beroaldus non sum medicus nec medicinae prorsus expers in the theory of physick i have taken some pains not with an intent to practice but to satisfy myself i had neither desire nor need to gain a living in such a fashion although occasionally i confess with shame i taunted my poor good father by saying that unless he was kind to me i would take my revenge by becoming a physician i imagine that he knew all along i would do no such thing and that in reality i was merely captivated by ideas and people which were as exciting as they were dangerous as a result he raised no objections when i wrote to him about the reports of one professor who though nominally charged with lecturing in rhetoric spent much of his time enlarging upon the latest developments in natural philosophy this man had traveled widely and maintained that for all serious students of natural phenomena the low countries and england were no longer to be disdained after many months in his care i caught his enthusiasm and having little to detain me in padua requested permission to tour that part of the world kind man that he was my father immediately gave his assent procured permission for me to leave venetian territory and sent a bill of credit to his bankers in flanders for my use i had thought of taking advantage of my position to go by sea but decided that if i was to acquire knowledge then it would be best to see as much as possible and this was better done in a coach than by spending three weeks in a ship drinking with the crew i must add that i also suffer abominably from seasicknesswhich weakness i have always been loath to admit for although gomesius says such sickness cures sadness of spirit i have never found it to be the case even so my courage weakened then evaporated almost entirely as the journey progressed the journey to leiden took only nine weeks but the sufferings i endured quite took my mind off the sights i was viewing once stuck in the mud halfway through an alpine pass the rain coming down in torrents one horse sick myself with a fever and a violentlooking soldier as my only companion i thought that i would rather suffer the worst gale in the atlantic than such misery but it would have been as long to go back as to continue and i was mindful of the scorn in which i would be held if i returned shamefaced and weak to my native town shame i do believe is the most powerful emotion known to man most discoveries and journeys of importance have been accomplished because of the ignominy that would be the result if the attempt was abandoned so sick for the warmth and comfort of my native landthe english have the word nostalgia for this illness which they believe is due to the imbalance caused by an unfamiliar environmenti continued on my way illtempered and miserable until i reached leiden where i attended the school of medicine as a gentleman so much has been written about this seat of learning and it has so little to do with my recital that it suffices to say that i found and profited greatly from two professors of singular ability who lectured on anatomy and bodily economy i also traveled throughout the low countries and fell into good company much of which was english and from whom i learnt something of the language i left for the simple reason that my kind good father ordered me so to do and for no other reason there was some disarray in the london office a letter told me and he needed family to interveneno one else could be trusted although i had little practical knowledge of trade i was glad to be the obedient son and so discharged my servant organized my affairs and shipped from antwerp to investigate i arrived in london on march nd with only a few pounds left the sum i paid to one professor for his teaching having all but exhausted my funds but i was not concerned for i thought that all i needed to do was make the short journey from the river to the office maintained by my fathers agent and all would be well fool that i was i could not find di pietro and that wretched man john mansion would not even receive me he is now long since dead i pray for his soul and hope the good lord disregards my entreaties on his behalf knowing as i do that the longer he suffers fiery torment the more just his punishment will be i had to beg a mere servant for information and this lad told me that my fathers agent had died suddenly some weeks previously even worse mansion had swiftly moved to take all the fortune and business for his own and refused to admit that any had belonged to my father before lawyers he had produced documents naturally forged to prove this assertion he had in other words entirely defrauded my family of our moneythat part of it which was in england at least this boy was unfortunately at a loss about how i should proceed i could lay a complaint before a magistrate but with no evidence except my own convictions this seemed fruitless i could also consult a lawyer but if england and venice differ in many ways they are alike in one which is that lawyers have an insatiable love of money and that was a commodity i did not possess in sufficient quantity it also rapidly became clear that london was not a healthy place i do not mean the famous plague which had not yet afflicted the city i mean that mansion that very evening sent round hired hands to demonstrate that my life would be more secure elsewhere fortunately they did not kill me indeed i acquitted myself well in the brawl thanks to the fees my father had paid to my fencing master and i believe at least one bravo left the field in a worse state than i but i took the warning nonetheless and decided to stay out of the way until my course was clearer i will mention little more of this matter except to say that eventually i abandoned the quest for recompense and my falher decided that the costs involved were not worth the money lost the matter was reluctantly forgotten for two years when we heard that one of mansions boats had put into trieste to sit out a storm my family moved to have it seizedvenetian justice being as favorable to venetians as english law is to englishmenand the hull and cargo provided some compensation for our losses to have had my fathers permission to leave instantly would have raised my spirits immeasurably for the weather in london was enough to reduce the strongest man to the most wretched despair the fog the incessant debilitating drizzle and the dull bitter cold as the wind swept through my thin cloak reduced me lo the lowesl slate of despondency only duty to my family forced me to continue rather than going to the docks and begging for a passage back home instead of taking this sensible course however i wrote to my father informing him of developments and promising to do what i could but pointed out that until i was rearmed from his coffers there was little i might practically accomplish i had i realized many weeks to fill in before he could respond and about five pounds to survive on the professor under whom i had studied in leiden had most kindly given me letters to gentlemen with whom he had corresponded and these being my only contacts with englishmen i decided that my best course would be to throw myself on their mercy an additional attraction was that neither was in london so i picked the man who lived in oxford that being the closest and decided to leave as swiftly as possible the english seem to have strong suspicion of people moving around and go out of their way to make travel as difficult as possible according to the piece of paper pasted up where i waited for the coach the sixtymile trip to oxford would take eighteen hoursgod willing as it added piously the almighty alas was not willing that day rain had made much of the road disappear so the coachman had to navigate his way through what seemed very like a plowed field a wheel came off a few hours later tipping my chest on the ground and damaging the lid and just outside a mean little town called thame one of the horses broke a leg and had to be dispatched add to that the frequent stops at almost every inn in southern england the innkeepers bribe the drivers to halt and the journey took a total of twentyfive hours with myself ejected into the courtyard of an inn in the main street of the city of oxford at seven oclock in the morning from the way the english talk their reputation for boasting is hard earned an inexperienced traveler would imagine that their land contains the finest buildings the biggest towns the richest bestfed happiest people in the world my own impressions were very different one used to the cities of lombardy tuscany and the veneto cannot but be astonished at the tiny proportions of all settlements in that country as well as their paucity for the land is almost empty of inhabitants and there are more sheep than people only london epitome britannia and a noble emporium can compare with the great cities of the continent the rest are in mean estate ruinous for the most part poor and full of beggars by reason of the decay in trade caused by the late political turmoils though some of the buildings of the university are fine enough oxford has really only a few streets worth the notice and you can scarcely walk for more than ten minutes in any direction without finding yourself outside the town and in open fields i had the address of a small lodging in the north of the city on a broad street hard by the town walls occupied by a foreign merchant who at one time had traded with my father it was a sad sort of house and immediately opposite a site being razed for a new university building the english made something of a fuss of this edifice designed by a young and rather arrogant man i later encountered who went on to make a name for himself by rebuilding the cathedral of london after the great fire this christopher wrens reputation is quite undeserved as he has no sense of proportion and little ability to construct a pleasing design nonetheless it was the first building in oxford executed on modern principles and aroused great excitement amongst those who knew no better mr van leeman the merchant offered me a warm drink but said regretfully that he could not provide more as he had no room for me my heart sank still lower but at least he talked to me awhile sat me by the fire and permitted me to attend to my toilet so that i could present a less alarming appearance when i ventured back into the world he also told me something of the country i had come to visit i was woefully ignorant of the place except for what i had been told by the english of my acquaintance in leiden and knew little more than that twenty years of civil war were at an end van leeman disabused me of any notion that the country was now a haven of peace and tranquillity however the king was indeed back he said but had so swiftly established a reputation for debauchery he had disgusted all the world already the strife which had led his father to war and the executioners block was reappearing and the outlook was gloomy indeed scarce a day passed without some rumor of insurrection plot or rebellion being talked over in the taverns not he told me reassuringly that this should concern me the innocent traveler such as myself would find much of interest in oxford which boasted some of the most notable people in the new philosophy in the world he knew of the honorable robert boyle the man for whom i had an introduction and told me that if i wished to make my way into his society then i should go to the coffee shop owned by mrs tillyard in the high street where the chemical club had held its meetings for several years and which moreover could be relied upon to provide some warming food whether it was a help or a hint i prepared myself and begging only permission to leave my bags in his care until i had suitable accommodation walked in the direction he indicated at this time coffee in england was something of a craze coming into the country with the return of the jews that bitter bean had little novelty for me of course for i drank it to cleanse my spleen and aid my digestion but was not prepared to find it so much in fashion that it had produced special buildings where it could be consumed in extraordinary quantities and at the greatest expense mrs tillyards establishment in particular was a fine and comfortable place although having to hand over a penny to enter took me aback but i felt unable to play the pauper my father having taught me that the poorer you appear the poorer you become i paid with a cheerful countenance then selected the library to take my drink for which i had to pay another two pennies the clienteles of coffee houses choose themselves carefully unlike taverns which cater to all sorts of low folk in london for example there are anglican houses and presbyterian houses houses where the scribblers of news or poetry gather to exchange lies and houses where the general tone is set by men of knowledge who can read or pass an hour or so in conversation without being insulted by the ignorant or vomited on by the vulgar thus the theorem underlying my presence in this particular building the partum practicum was rather differentthe company of philosophers supposedly in residence did not leap up to welcome me as i had hoped in fact there were only four people in the room and when i bowed at one of thema weighty man with a red face inflamed eye and lank graying hairhe pretended not to have seen me no one else paid much attention to my entrance either apart from curious looks at one who was so obviously a man of some fashion my first venture into english society seemed a failure and i resolved not to waste too much time on it the one thing which detained me was the newspaper a journal printed in london and then distributed around the country a most novel idea it was surprisingly frank about affairs containing reports not only of domestic matters but also detailed accounts of events in foreign places which interested me greatly i was later informed however that they were milk and water productions in comparison to a few years previously when the passion of faction brought forth a whole host of such organs for the king against the king for parliament for the army for or against this or that cromwell and then the returned king charles did their best to restore some form of order rightly surmising that such stuff merely lulls people into thinking that they understand matters of state and a more foolish notion can scarcely be imagined it being obvious that the reader is only informed of what the writer wishes him to know and is thus seduced into believing almost anything such liberties do nothing but convert the grubby hacksters who produce these tracts into men of influence so that they strut around as though they were gentlemen of quality anyone who has ever met one of these english journalists so called i believe because they are paid by the day like any common ditchdigger will know just how ridiculous that is nonetheless i read for above half an hour intrigued by a report on the war in crete until a patter of feet up the stairs and the opening of the door disturbed my concentration a brief glance disclosed a woman of i suppose about nineteen or twenty years of age of average height but unnaturally slim of buildnone of the plumpness that endows true beauty indeed my medical self halfwondered whether she might have a tendency to consumption and might benefit from a pipe of tobacco every evening her hair was dark and had only natural curls in it her clothes were drab though well cared for and while she was pretty enough in the face there was nothing obviously exceptional about her even so she was one of those people whom you look at turn away from then somehow find yourself looking at once more partly it was her eyes which were unnaturally big and dark but it was more her deportment because it was so unfitting which made me take notice for that underfed girl had the bearing of a queen and moved with an elegance which my father had spent a small fortune on dancing masters trying to instill in my youngest sister i watched with little interest as she walked steadily up to the redeyed gentleman on the other side of the room and with only half an ear heard her address him as doctor then pause and stand there he looked up at her with an air of alarm as she began to talk i missed most of itthe distance my english and her softness of voice all conspiring to snatch the meaning awaybut i assumed from the few fragments i did hear that she was asking for his help as a physician unusual of course that someone of her servile state should think of coming to a physician but i knew little of the country perhaps it was accepted practice here the request met with no favor and this displeased me by all means put the girl in her proper place this is natural any man of breeding might well feel obliged to do so if addressed in an inappropriate manner however there was something in the mans expressionanger disdain or something akinwhich aroused my contempt as tully tells us a gentleman should issue such a reproof with regret not with a pleasure which demeans the speaker more than it corrects the offender what he said gazing around the room in a way which suggested he hoped no one would see go away girl at once she again spoke in a low voice so that i did not catch her words there is nothing i can do for your mother you know that now please leave me alone the girl raised her voice slightly but sir you must help dont think i am asking then seeing he was adamant the girls shoulders slumped with the weight of her failure and she made for the door why i got up followed her down the stairs and approached her on the street outside i do not know perhaps like rinaldo or tancred i entertained some foolish notion of chivalry perhaps because the world had been bearing so oppressively on me in the past few days i had sympathy for the way it was treating her perhaps i was feeling cold and tired and so sunk down by my troubles that even approaching such as she became acceptable i do not know but before she had gone too far i approached her and coughed politely she swung round fury in her face leave me alone she snapped very violently i must have reacted as though she had slapped me i know i bit my lower lip and said oh in surprise at her response i do beg your pardon madam i added in my best english at home i would have behaved differentlycourteously but with the familiarity that establishes who is the superior in english of course such subtleties were beyond me all i knew was how to address ladies of quality and so that was the way j talked to her rather than appear a semieducated fool the english assume that the only reasons for not understanding their language are either stupidity or willful stubbornness i decided that i had best match my gestures to my language as though i actually intended such politesse accordingly i gave the appropriate bow as i spoke it was not my intention but it rather took the wind out of her sails to use a nautical expression beloved of my dear father her anger faded on finding itself met with gentility rather than rebuke and she looked at me curiously instead a little wrinkle of confusion playing most attractively over the bridge of her nose having started in this vein i resolved to continue you must forgive me for approaching you in this fashion but i could not help overhearing that you have need of physick is that correct you are a doctor i bowed marco da cola of venice it was a lie of course but i was sure i was at least as able as the sort of charlatan or quack she would normally have engaged and you sarah blundy is my name i suppose you are too grand to treat an old woman with a broken leg for fear of lowering yourself in the eyes of your fellows she was indeed a difficult person to help a surgeon would be better and more appropriate i agreed however i have trained in the anatomical arts at the universities of padua and leiden and i have no fellows here so they are unlikely to think any the worse of me for playing the tradesman she looked at me then shook her head im afraid that you must have overheard wrongly although i thank you for your offer i cannot pay you anything as i have no money i waved my hand airily andfor the second time that dayindicated that money was of no concern to me i offer my services nonetheless i continued we can discuss that payment at a later stage if you wish no doubt she said in a way which again left me perplexed then she looked at me in the open and frank way which the english can adopt and shrugged perhaps we could go and see the patient i suggested and you could tell me what happened to her as we go i was as keen as young men are to engage the attention of a pretty girl whatever her station but i won little reward for my efforts although she was not nearly as well dressed as i her limbs showing through the thin cloth of her dress her head only as covered as decorum dictated she seemed not at all cold and scarcely appeared even to notice the wind which cut through me like a knife through butter she walked fast as well and even though she was a good two inches shorter than myself i had to hurry to keep up and her replies were brief and monosyllabic which i put down to concern and preoccupation with her mothers health we walked back to mr van leemans to collect my instruments and i also hastily consulted barbette on surgery not wishing to have to refer to a book of instruction in midoperation as this does not reassure the patient the girls mother had it appeared fallen heavily the previous evening and had lain alone all night i asked why she had not called out to some neighbors or passersby as i assumed that the poor woman would scarcely have been living in splendid seclusion but this received no useful response who was that man you were talking to i asked i got no answer to that either so adopting a coldness that i thought appropriate i walked by her side down a mean street called butchers row past the stinking carcasses of animals hung on hooks or laid out over rough tables outside so that the rain could wash the blood into the gutters then continued into an even worse row of low dwellings that lay alongside one of the rivulets that run around and about the castle it was utterly filthy down there the streams clogged and unkempt with all manner of refuse poking through the thick ice in venice of course we have the flow of the sea which every day purges the citys waterways the rivers in england are left to block themselves up without anyone thinking that a little care might sweeten the waters of the miserable huts down in that part of the town sarah blundy and her mother lived in one of the worstsmall with the casements boarded with planks of wood rather than paned with glass the roof full of holes blocked with cloth and the doorway thin and mean inside however everything was spotlessly clean though damp a sign that even in such reduced circumstances some pride in life can continue to flicker the little hearth and the floorboards were scrubbed the two rickety stools were similarly looked after and the bed although rough had been polished apart from that the room had no furniture beyond those few pots and platters which even the lowest must have one thing did astonish mea shelf of at least halfadozen books made me realize that at some stage at least some man had inhabited these quarters well i said in the cheerful way my master in padua had employed as a means of inspiring confidence where is the invalid then she pointed to the bed which i had thought empty huddled under the thin covering was a little broken bird of a woman so small it was difficult to imagine she was anything but a child i approached and gently pulled down the covers good morning madam i said im told youve had an accident let us have a look at you then even i realized instantly that it was a serious injury the end of the shattered bone had pushed through the parchmentlike skin and protruded broken and bloody into the open air and if that wasnt bad enough some bungling fool had evidently tried to force it back into place tearing more flesh then simply wrapped a piece of dirty cloth around the wound so that the threads had stuck to the bone as the blood had matted and congealed holy mary mother of god i cried in exasperation fortunately in italian what idiot has done this she did it herself the girl said quietly when i repeated this last in english she was all on her own and did what she could it looked very bad indeed even with a robust young man the inevitable weakness from such a wound would have been serious then there was the possibility of rot setting in and the chance that some of the threads would create an irritation in the flesh i shivered at the thought then realized that the room was bitterly cold go and light a fire immediately she must be kept warm i said she stood there unmoving cant you hear me do as i say we dont have anything to burn she said what could i do it was hardly fitting or dignified but sometimes the task of the physician goes beyond merely tending to physical ailment with some impatience i pulled a few pence from my pocket go and buy some wood then i said she looked at the pennies i had thrust into her palm and without so much as a word of thanks silently went out of the room into the alleyway beyond now then madam i said turning back to the old lady we will soon have you nice and warm that is most important first we have to clean this leg of yours and so i set to work fortunately the girl came back quickly with wood and some embers to light a fire so that i soon had hot water i thought that if i could clean it up fast enough if i could reset the broken bone without causing her so much discomfort that she died if she didnt develop a fever or some distemper in the wound if she was kept warm and well fed she might live but there were many dangers any one of them could kill her once i began she seemed alert enough which was a good start although considering the pain i was giving her a corpse would have become aware of its surroundings she told me that she had slipped on a patch of ice and fallen badly but apart from that she was initially as uncommunicative as her daughter although with more excuse perhaps the more thoughtful and those who were more proud might have walked away the moment that the girl confessed she had no money perhaps i could have left when it became clear there was no heating certainly i should have refused outright even to have contemplated the provision of any sort of medicines to the woman it is not for oneself of course there is the reputation of the profession to be considered in these matters but in all conscience i could not bring myself to act as i should have done sometimes being a gentleman and physician do not always coexist easily also although i had studied the proper way of cleansing wounds and setting bones i had never had the opportunity to do so in practice it was very much more difficult than the lectures had made it seem and i fear that i caused the old lady considerable suffering but eventually the bone was set and the leg bound and i dispatched the girl with more of my scarce pennies to buy materials for a salve while she was gone i cut some lengths of wood and bound them to the leg to try and ensure that were she lucky enough to survive the shattered bone would knit correctly by this stage i was in no good humor what was i doing here in this provincial unfriendly miserable little town surrounded by strangers such a long way away from everything i knew and everyone who cared for me more to the point what was going to happen when as was bound to occur very shortly i found myself without money to pay for lodging or food bound up in my own despair i completely ignored my patient feeling i had done more than enough for her already and found myself examining the little shelf of books not out of interest but merely as a way of turning my back on her so that i could avoid looking at the poor creature who was rapidly becoming the symbol of my misfortunes this sentiment was compounded by the fact that i feared that all my efforts and expense were going to prove a wasteeven though i was young and inexperienced i already knew death when i stared it in the face smelt its breath and touched the sweat it produced on the skin you are unhappy sir the old lady said in a frail voice from her bed im afraid that i am a great trouble to you no no not at all i said with the flatness of deliberate insincerity it is kind of you to say so but we both know that we cannot pay you money for your help as you deserve and i saw from the look in your face that you are not a rich man yourself at the moment despite your dress where do you come from you are not from around here within a few minutes i found myself perched on one of the rickety stools by the bedstead pouring out my heart about my father my lack of money my reception in london my hopes and fears for the future there was something about her that encouraged such confidences almost as though i were talking to my old mother not to some poor dying heretical englishwoman throughout she nodded patiently and spoke to me with such wisdom that i felt comforted it pleased god to send us trials just as he did with job our duty is to bear them quietly use the skills he has given us to overcome them and never to abandon our faith that his design was good and necessary more practically she told me i must certainly visit mr boyle he was known as a good christian gentleman i suppose i should have scorned this combination of puritanical piety and impertinent advice but i could see that in her way she was trying to make amends she could offer no money and no service what she could give was understanding and in the coin that she had she paid freely i shall soon be dead shall i not she asked after she had listened to my woes for a good long while and i had exhausted the topic of my hardship my master in padua had always warned about such questionsnot least because one might be wrong he always believed that the patient has no right to confront the physician in such a way if one is right and the patient does die it merely makes them morose for the last few days of their life rather than composing themselves for their imminent ascent into the presence of god an event to be desired rather than regretted one might think most people complain bitterly at having this divine goodness thrust upon them on top of this they do tend to believe their physicians in moments of frankness i confess that i do not know why this is the case nonetheless it seems that if a physician tells them they will die many dutifully oblige even though there may be little wrong with them we will all die in due course madam i said gravely in the vain hope that this might satisfy her however she was not the sort of person who could be fobbed off she had asked the question calmly and was plainly able to tell truth from the opposite but some sooner than others she replied with a little smile and my turn is near is it not i really cannot say it may be that no corruption will set in and you will recover but in truth i fear that you are very weak i could not actually say to heryes you will die and very soon but the sense was clear enough she nodded placidly i thought so she said and i rejoice in gods will i am a burden to my sarah come ioro nel foco così la fede nel dolor saffina i hardly felt like defending the daughter but muttered that i was sure she performed her obligations with a happy heart yes she said she is too dutiful she was a woman who spoke with a decorum far beyond her station and education i know that it is not impossible for rude surroundings and coarseness of upbringing to bring forth gentleness but experience teaches us that it is rare just as refinement of thought naturally requires refinement of circumstance so brutality and squalor in life beget the same in the soul yet this old woman although surrounded by the meanest of states talked with a sympathy and understanding i have often failed to meet with in the very best of people it made me take an unwonted interest in her as a patient subtly and without even becoming aware of it i moved from seeing her as a hopeless casei may not be able to cheat death i found myself thinking grimly but at least i will make him work for his prize then the girl returned with the little packet of medicines that i had demanded staring at me as though challenging me to criticize she said that i had not given her enoughbut mr crosse the apothecary had allowed her to have two pence credit when she had promised i would settle the account i was speechless with indignation at this because the girl seemed to be rebuking me for some failure on my part but what could i do about it the money was spent the patient was waiting and it was beneath me to enter an argument maintaining an outward show of imperturbability i took my portable pestle and mortar and began to grind up the ingredients some mastick for sticking a grain of sal ammoniack two of frankincense a dram of white vitriol and two grains of niter and verdigris both once these were pounded into a smooth paste i then added the linseed oil drop by drop until the mixture had reached the right degree where is the powder of worms i asked searching in the bag for the final ingredients did they not have any yes she said at least i imagine so but it is no use you know so i decided not to buy it it saved some money for you this was too much to be treated with insolence was one thing and quite common with daughters but to be questioned and doubted in ones area of skill was quite another i told you i needed it it is a crucial ingredient are you a physician girl have you trained at the best schools in medicine do physicians come to you asking for advice i asked with a superior sneer in my voice yes they do she replied calmly i snorted i dont know whether it is worse to be dealing with a fool or a liar i said angrily nor do i all i know is that i am neither putting worm powder on a wound is tantamount to making sure my mother loses her leg and dies are you galen then paracelsus perhaps hippocrates himself i stormed how dare you question the authority of your betters this is a salve that has been in use for centuries even though it is useless while this was going on i had been applying the salve to her mothers wound then rebandaging it i was doubtful about whether it would work incomplete as it was but would have to do until i could make it up properly once finished i stood up to my full height and of course bumped my head against the low ceiling the girl suppressed a giggle which made me the more angry let me tell you one thing i said with barely suppressed fury i have treated your mother to the best of my ability even though i was not obliged to i will come back later to give her a sleeping draft and to air the wound this i do knowing that i will receive nothing in return but your contempt although i cannot see that i have deserved it or that you have any right to speak to me in such a fashion she curtseyed thank you kind sir and as for payment im sure you will be satisfied you said we can deal with that later and ive no doubt we will with that i walked out of the house and back into the street shaking my head and wondering what den of lunatics i had tumbled into so carelessly i hope that this account explains the first two stages of my progressmy coming to england and then to oxford and my acquisition of the patient whose treatment was to cause me such grief the girl herselfwhat can i say she was touched by doom her end was written and the devil was already reaching out his hand to drag her down the man of skill can see this can read a face like an open book and discern what the future holds in store sarah blundys face was deep scored already with the evil that had gripped her soul and would shortly destroy her so i told myself after and it may be true but at that time i saw nothing more than a girl as insolent as she was pretty and as careless of her obligations to her superiors as she was mindful of her duty to her family i need now to explain my further progress which was just as accidental although ultimately more cruel in its effectsthe more so because it seemed for a while as though fortune had begun to smile on me once more i had been left with the task of paying off the debts she had so impertinently run up for me at the apothecarys and i knew that you annoy apothecaries at your peril if you are concerned with experimental knowledge omit to pay and they are quite likely to refuse you in the future and not only them but all their fellows for miles around so closely do they stick together in the circumstances that would be the final straw even if it was my last penny i could not afford to enter the society of english philosophy as a man of bad credit so i asked the way to this mr crosses shop and walked halfway along the high street once more opening the wooden door in the shop front and going into the warmth of the interior it was a handsome place nicely laid out as all english shops are with fine cedarwood counters and beautiful brass balances of the most uptodate variety even the aromas of the herbs and spices and drugs welcomed me as i moved strategically across the polished oak floor until i stood with my back against the fine carved mantelpiece and the roaring fire in the grate the owner a portly man in his fifties who looked decidedly at ease with life was dealing with a customer who seemed in no hurry leaning nonchalantly on the table chattering quite idly the customer was perhaps a year or two older than myself with a lively active face and bright if cynical eyes below heavy arching brows in dress he was in a somber garb that steered between the extremes of puritanical drabness and the extravagance of fashion it was in other words well cut but of a tedious brown for all that he had an easy manner this customer seemed very selfconscious and i discerned that mr crosse was amusing himself at the mans expense keep you warm in winter as well the apothecary was saying with a broad grin the customer wrinkled up his face in pain course when spring comes youll have to put netting over in case the birds start nesting in it he went on clutching his sides in merriment come now crosse thats enough protested the man then began laughing himself twelve marks it cost this sent crosse into greater paroxysms of laughter and soon both of them were leaning over helpless and in virtual hysteria twelve marks wheezed the apothecary before collapsing once more i even found myself beginning to giggle with amusement even though i had not the slightest idea what they were talking about i didnt even know whether it was considered ill manners in england to interpose oneself into the merriment of others but the fact was that i didnt care the warmth of the shop and the open good humor of these two as they clung to the counter to avoid slipping onto the floor in their helplessness made me want to laugh with them to celebrate the first normal human society i had experienced since my arrival instantly i felt restored by it for as gomesius says merriment cures many passions of the mind my slight giggling attracted their attention however and mr crosse attempted to restore himself to the dignified posture that his trade required his comrade did likewise and both turned to look at me a somber silence reigned for a few seconds then the younger man pointed at me and both of them lost control once more twenty marks cried the young man waving in my direction then banging his fist on the counter at least twenty i counted this as being the nearest thing to an introduction that i was likely to receive and with some wariness made a polite bow in their direction i halfsuspected some appalling joke at my expense the english love making fun of foreigners whose mere existence they regard as an enormous jest my bow to equalsperfectly executed with just the right balance between the extended left leg and the graciously elevated right armnonetheless set them off again so i stood with the impassivity of a stoic as i waited for the storm to pass and in due course the gurglings faded they wiped their eyes blew their noses and did their best to appear like civilized people i must beg your pardon sir said mr crosse who was the first to regain the power of speech and the grace to use it civilly but my friend here has just decided to become a man of fashion and has taken to appearing in public with a thatched roof on his head i was doing my best to assure him that he cuts a very fine figure indeed he began heaving with mirth again and his friend then tore off his wig and threw it on the ground fresh air at last he exclaimed thankfully as he ran his fingers through his thick long hair dear lord it was hot under there at last i was beginning to make sense of it the wig had arrived in oxfordseveral years after it had established itself throughout most of the world as an essential part of elegant masculine dress i was wearing one myself having adopted it as a sign so to speak of my graduation into the adult world i could see of course why it caused such amusement although the understanding was overborne by that sense of superiority felt by a man of parts when he encounters the provincial when i began wearing my wig myself it took some considerable time to grow used to it only pressure from my fellows persuaded me to continue and of course looking at it as a turk or an indian might were he suddenly transported to our shores it did seem slightly odd that a man graced by nature with a full head of hair should shave much of it off in order to wear somebody elses but fashionable attire is not for comfort and as it was profoundly uncomfortable we may conclude that the wig was very fashionable i think i said that you might find it more comfortable if you shortened your own hair then there would not be so much pressure under the mat shorten my own hair good heavens is that how its done im afraid so we must sacrifice for beauty you know he kicked the wig roughly across the floor then let me be ugly he said for i will not be seen in public wearing this if it produces convulsions in crosse here think what the students of this town will do to me ill be lucky to escape with my life they are the very height of fashion elsewhere i commented even the dutch wear them i think it is a question of timing in a few months or maybe a year you may find that they hoot and throw stones at you if you do not wear one bah ridiculous he said but nonetheless scooped the wig up off the floor and placed it more safely on the counter im sure this gentleman has not come here to discuss fashion crosse said perhaps he even wishes to buy something it has been known i bowed no i have come to pay for something i believe you extended credit to a young girl not so long ago oh the blundy girl you are the man she mentioned i nodded it seems that she spent my money a little freely i have come to settle heror rather mydebt crosse grunted you wont be paid you know not in money so it appears but it is too late for that now besides i set her mothers leg and it was interesting to see whether i could do so id learned a great deal about it in leiden but never tried it on a living patient leiden said the younger man with sudden interest do you know sylvius indeed i replied i studied anatomy with him and i have a letter from him with me for a gentleman called mr boyle why didnt you say so he asked and walked to the door at the back of the shop and opened it i could see a flight of stairs in the corridor beyond boyle he yelled are you up there no need to shout you know crosse said i can tell you he isnt he went to the coffee house oh no matter we can go and find him whats your name by the way i introduced myself he bowed in return and saidrichard lower at your service a physician almost we bowed once more and that done with he clapped me on the shoulders come along boyle will like to meet you weve been feeling a little cut off up here recently as we walked the short distance back to tillyards he explained that the ferment of intellectual life in the town had ceased to bubble as it had in the past due to the return of the king but i heard his majesty is a lover of learning i said so he is when he can tear his attention away from his mistresses thats the trouble under cromwell we eked out our existence here while all the lucrative places in the state went to butchers and fish sellers now the king is back and naturally all those wellplaced enough to take advantage of his generosity have gone to london leaving a rump of us up here im afraid i shall have to try to make a name for myself there as well sooner or later hence the wig he grimaced yes i suppose so one must cut a dash in london to be noticed at all wren was back here a few weeks agohes a friend of mine a fine fellowdecked out like a peacock hes planning a trip to france soon and well probably have to shade our eyes just to look at him when he gets back and mr boyle i asked my heart sinking a little he hasah decidedto stay in oxford yes for the time being but hes lucky hes got so much money he doesnt have to fish for positions like the rest of us oh i said greatly relieved lower gave me a look which indicated that he understood perfectly what had been going through my mind his father was one of the richest men in the kingdom and a fervent supporter of the old king bless his memory as i suppose we should naturally a lot of it was dispersed but theres enough left for boyle not to have the concerns of ordinary mortals ah a fine person to know if you are inclined to philosophical knowledge which is his main interest if youre not of course he wont pay much attention to you i have done my best i said modestly with some experimentation but im afraid that i am only a novice what i do not know or understand greatly outweighs what i do the answer seemed to please him mightily in that case you will be in good company he said with a grin add us all together and our ignorance is almost complete still we scratch at the surface here we are he went on as he led the way back into the very same coffee house mrs tillyard again approached wanting another copper off me but lower waved her away fiddlesticks madam he said cheerfully you will not charge a friend of mine for entry into this bawdy house loudly demanding that coffee be brought to us instantly lower bounded up the stairs to the room i had previously selected it was then that i had the horrible thoughtwhat if this boyle were the unpleasant gentleman who had turned away the girl but the man sitting in the corner whom lower immediately approached could not have been more different i suppose i should here pause and describe the honorable robert boyle a man who has had more praise and honor heaped upon him than any philosopher for centuries the first thing i noticed was his relative youth his reputation had led me to expect a man certainly over fifty in fact he was probably no more than a few years older than myself tall gaunt and obviously with a weak constitution he had a pale thin face with a strangely sensual mouth and sat with a poise and a degree of ease that instantly indicated his noble upbringing he did not appear so very agreeable haughty rather as though he was fully aware of his superiority and expected others to be as well this i later learned was only part of the story for his pride was matched by his generosity his haughtiness by his humility his rank by his piety and his severity by his charity nonetheless he was a person to be approached with care for while boyle tolerated some truly dreadful creatures because of their merit he would not put up with charlatans or fools i count it as one of the greatest honors of my life that i was allowed for a while to associate with him on terms of ease losing this connection through the malice of others was one of the bitterest blows i have had to endure for all his wealth reputation and birth he tolerated familiarity from his intimates of whom lower evidently was one mr boyle he said as we approached someone from italy to pay homage at your shrine boyle looked up with raised eyebrows then permitted himself a brief smile good morning lower he said dryly i noticed then and later that lower constantly misstepped himself in his dealings with boyle as he considered himself an equal in matters of science but was all too conscious of his own inferiority in rank and so moved from an excessive familiarity to a respect which although not obsequious was still far from assured and comfortable i bring you greetings from dr sylvius of leiden sir i said he suggested that as i was to come to england you might permit me to make your acquaintance i always feel that introductions are one of the most difficult of areas of etiquette naturally they exist and will always continue how else could a total stranger be accepted except under the patronage of a gentleman who can vouch for his character in most circles however the mere existence of a letter is enough if they are read it is generally after the introductions have been performed i hoped that a letter from sylvius a physician as famous in medicine as was boyle in chemistry would ensure me a welcome but i was also aware that divisions ran deep and that my religion might well cause me to be rejected england had only recently been in the grip of fanatical sectarians and i knew their influence was far from dissipatedmy colleagues in the coach to oxford overnight had informed me with glee of the new persecutory laws against us that the parliament had forced the king to adopt boyle not only took the letter and began to read it but also commented on its contents as he progressed making me ever more nervous as he did so it was i saw rather a long missive sylvius and i had not always seen eye to eye and i greatly feared that much of the letter would be uncomplimentary and so it seemed as boyle read hmm he said listen to this lower sylvius says your friend here is impetuous argumentative and much given to querying authority impertinent and a positive gadfly in his interests i made to defend myself but lower gestured for me to be quiet family of gentlemen merchants in venice eh boyle went on papist i suppose my heart sank a veritable fiend for blood boyle went on ignoring me totally constantly fiddling with buckets of it but a good man with a knife it seems and a fine draftsman hmm i resented sylvius for his statements to call my experimentation fiddling made me hot with indignation i had begun methodically and proceeded in what i thought was a rational manner it was after all hardly my fault that my fathers summons made me leave leiden before i had come to any conclusions of substance since it is of some moment to my story i should make it clear that my interest in blood was no newfound fancy but by this stage had preoccupied me for some time i can scarcely recall when the fascination began i remember once listening to some tedious galenist lecturing on blood in padua and the very next day being lent a copy of harveys magnificent work on circulation it was so clear so simple and so obviously true that it took my breath away i have not had an experience like it since however even i could see that it was incompleteharvey demonstrated that the blood starts in the heart circulates around the body then returns whence it came he did not establish why it does this and without that science is a poor thing indeed nor did he proffer any therapeutic gain from his observations perhaps impertinently but certainly with reverence i had dedicated many months in padua and nearly all my time in leiden to exploring this subject and i would have already achieved some notable experiments had i not obeyed my fathers desires and come to england good boyle said eventually folding the letter carefully and putting it in his pocket you are welcome sir more than welcome above all to mr lower i imagine as his insatiable lust for entrails seems to be matched only by your own lower grinned at me and offered the saucer of coffee which had been growing cold as boyle read it seemed that i had been put to the test and found adequate the relief i felt was almost overwhelming i must say boyle went on pouring quantities of sugar in his coffee that i am all the more pleased to welcome you because of your behavior my what i asked your offer of assistance to the blundy girlremember her lowerwas charitable and christian he said if a little unwise i was astounded by this comment so convinced had i been that no one had paid me the slightest attention i had entirely misjudged the degree to which the slightest breath of anything can exert fascination in such a little town but who is this girl whom you both know i asked she seemed a very poor creature and hardly the type who would ordinarily come to your attention or have years of republicanism leveled ranks to such an extent lower laughed fortunately not people like the blundy girl are not normally members of our society im pleased to say shes pretty enough but i would be reluctant to be known to consort with her we know her as she has a certain notorietyher father ned was a great subversive and radical while she supposedly has some knowledge of natural remedies boyle here consulted her over some herbal simples it is a pet project of his to provide the poor with medicines fitting their rank why supposedly many have attested to her skill in curing so boyle thought he would do her the honor of incorporating some of her better recipes into his work but she refused to help and pretended she had no ability at all i imagine she wanted payment which boyle properly refused to countenance for a work of benevolence at least that explained the girls comment which i had dismissed as a lie why is it unwise to associate with her though her society will do you little credit boyle said she has a reputation for lewdness but i particularly meant that she will not prove a lucrative client i have discovered that already i replied and told him of the way she had spent my money boyle looked mildly shocked by the tale not the way to grow rich he observed dryly what is the supply of physicians here do you think i could gain some clients lower grimaced and explained that the trouble with oxford was that there were far too many doctors already which was why when he had finished a project he was undertaking and christ church ejected him from his place he would be forced to go to london there are at least six he said and any number of quacks surgeons and apothecaries all for a town of ten thousand inhabitants and you would be at some risk if you did not obtain a university license to practice did you qualify at padua i told him that i had not having no plans to practice even had my father not considered it demeaning to take a degree only necessity made me think of earning money by medicine now i suppose i phrased it wrongly for while boyle understood my predicament lower took my innocent remark to indicate a disdain for his own calling im sure sinking so low will not taint you permanently he said stiffly on the contrary i said swiftly to repair the accidental slight the opportunity is more than welcome and quite makes up for the unfortunate circumstances in which i find myself and if i have the opportunity to associate myself with gentlemen such as yourself and mr boyle i will be more than fortunate he was soothed by this remark and gradually resumed his earlier nonchalance nonetheless i had seen briefly beneath the surface and had a glimpse of a nature which for all its easygoing charm was both proud and prickly the signs vanished as quickly as they had appeared however and i overcongratulated myself on my success in winning him over to explain myself clearly i briefly laid out my current position and a precise question from boyle induced me to say that i would soon be totally out of funds hence my desire to minister to the sick he grimaced and asked why precisely i was in england in the first place i told him that filial obligation demanded that i try to reestablish my fathers position in law and for that i suspected i would need a lawyer and for that you need money for which you need an income absque argento omnia rara lower said hmm mr boyle do you have any ideas sir for the time being i would be happy to offer you some occupation in my elaboratory said this kind gentleman i feel almost ashamed to offer as it is far below what a man of your position should do im sure lower here could find you somewhere to stay at his old lodgings and perhaps the next time he does a circuit in the countryside he could take you along what do you think lower you always say youre overworked lower nodded although i detected no great enthusiasm on his part i should be delighted with both the help and the company i was planning a tour in a week or so and if mr cola wished to come boyle nodded as though all was decided excellent then we can tackle your london problem i will write to a lawyer i know and see what he can recommend i thanked him enthusiastically for his great kindness and generosity it obviously pleased him although he affected that it was a mere nothing my gratitude was entirely genuine from being poor friendless and miserable i had acquired the patronage of one of the most distinguished philosophers of europe it even crossed my mind that part of this was due to sarah blundy whose appearance that morningand my reaction had swung boyle into thinking more favorably of me than could otherwise have been the case within a short time i thus established myself in good company and had a vantage point from which to await more money eight weeks for the mails to go another eight to come back if i was lucky add onto that a week or so for the moneys to be arranged plus some months to sort out my business in london and i thought i would be in england for half a year at the very least by which time the weathers would be declining badly either i would have to go back home overland or risk the miserable prospect of a winter sea voyage alternatively i would have to resign myself to another northern winter and remain until the spring but to begin with i was more than content with my position except where mrs bulstrode my new landlady was concerned everyone sincerely believed this worthy was an excellent cook and it was with high hopesand empty stomach for i had not eaten properly for two daysthat i presented myself at four sharp for what i believed was going to be a fine meal if the climate of england was difficult for a venetian to become used to then the food was impossible if quantity were anything to judge by then i would say that england is indeed the richest country on earth even the more modest sort habitually eat meat once a month at least and the english boast that they have no need of sauces to cover up its stringy texture and unpleasant taste as the french have to do simply roast it and eat it as god intended they say firmly believing that ingeniousness in cooking is sinful and that the heavenly host themselves tuck into roast beef and ale for their sunday repast unfortunately there is frequently little else naturally fresh fruit is often unavailable because of the climate but the english do not even like preserved fruit believing it causes the wind which exhalations they consider a depletion of the bodys vital heat nor is there much in the way of green vegetables for the same reason rather they eat bread or more frequently drink their grain as ale of which their consumption is truly stupendous even the most delicate of ladies cheerfully downs a quart or two of strong beer during a meal and infants learn insobriety in the cradle the trouble for a foreigner like myself was that the beer was strong and it was considered unmanly and unwomanly not to drink it i mention all this to explain why the meal of boiled brawn and threequarters of a gallon of beer left me feeling not at all well my success in attending my patient after the meal had finished was therefore of considerable merit how exactly i managed to prepare my bag and walk to the miserable cottage i do not recall fortunately the girl was not there as i had no desire to renew my acquaintanceship with her but as far as her mother was concerned it was far from lucky she was badly in need of care and attention and the girls absence struck me as being hardly an example of the dutifulness which the old woman had mentioned she had sleptin fact she was still drowsy her daughter having given her some peasant potion of her own devising which nonetheless seemed to have been very effective but she was in considerable discomfort pus and corrosive matter had suppurated through my binding and caked dry over the wound giving off an evil smell which filled me with foreboding it was a long and distasteful business to remove the bandage but it was eventually completed and i decided that i would try exposing the wound to the air having heard the theory that tight warm binding in such cases might very well aid corruption rather than prevent it such a view does go against orthodox practice i know and the willingness to allow the vapors to swirl round might be considered rash all i can say is that experiments conducted since by others have tended to support the technique i was so absorbed in my task that i failed to hear the door creaking open or the soft pad of feet as they came up behind me so that when sarah blundy spoke i jumped up with alarm how is she i turned round to look her voice was soft and her manner more appropriate than before she is not well at all i said frankly can you not attend to her more i have to work she said our position is already grave now my mother cannot earn i asked someone to look in but it seems they did not i grunted slightly ashamed of myself for not having thought of this as a reason will she recover it is too soon to say i am drying out the wound then i will rebind it i fear she is developing a fever it may pass but i am concerned you must check every half hour for signs of the fever getting worse and strange as it may seem you must keep her warm she nodded as though she understood although she could not you see i said kindly in cases of a fever one can either reinforce or oppose reinforcement brings the malady to a head and purges it leaving the patient void of the cause opposition counters it and seeks to restore the natural economy of the body so with a fever one can either expose the patient to ice and cold water or one can wrap her up well i choose the latter because of her grave weaknessa more strenuous cure could well kill her before taking effect she leaned over and protectively tucked her mother in then with a surprising gentleness stroked the old womans hair into place id been planning to do that anyhow she said and now youll have my approval for it i am fortunate indeed she said she glanced at me saw the suspicious look in my eye then smiled forgive me sir i mean no insolence my mother told me how well and generously you acted to her and we are both deeply grateful for your kindness i am truly sorry i misspoke i was frightened for her and upset about the way i was treated in the coffee house i waved my hand touched strangely by her submissive tone that is quite all right i said but who was that man i worked for him once she said still not taking her eyes off her mother and was always dutiful and conscientious i believe i deserved better from him she looked up and smiled at me a smile of such gentleness that i felt my heart begin to melt but it seems that we are spurned by our friends and saved by strangers so thank you again sir you are more than welcome as long as you do not expect miracles for a moment we balanced on the brink of a greater intimacy that strange girl and i but the moment passed as swiftly as it presented itself she hesitated before speaking and it was instantly too late instead we both made an effort to reestablish the correct relations and stood up i will pray for one even if i do not deserve it she said will you come again tomorrow if i can and if she worsens come and find me at mr boyles i will be attending him now about payment i continued hurrying on i had decided on my walk down to the cottage that as there was not the slightest chance of being paid in any case it would be best to accept the fact with grace rather than accept the inevitable i should turn it into virtue in other words i had decided to waive any fee it made me feel quite proud of myself especially considering my own impecunious state but as fortune had smiled on me i thought it fair to spread my good luck a little further alas my speech died in my throat before even the end of the first sentence she immediately looked at me eyes blazing with contempt oh yes your payment how could i think you would forget about that we must deal with that urgently must we not indeed i said completely astonished by the speed and completeness of her transformation i think that but i got no farther the girl led me through to the damp and squalid little space at the back of the house which was evidently where sheor some other animal i could not tellslept on the damp floor was a pallet hard sacking stuffed with straw there were no windows at all and the little space smelled very distinctly of sour water with a gesture of the most brusque contempt she immediately lay down on the bed and pulled up her thin skirt come then physician she jeered take your payment i recoiled visibly then blushed scarlet with rage as her meaning became clear even to someone as slowwitted as the beer had made me that evening i became even more confused as i wondered whether my new friends thought this was my interest in the case more particularly i was outraged at the way my fine gesture had been trodden in the dirt you disgust me i said coldly as the power of speech returned how dare you behave like this i will not remain here to be insulted henceforth you may cater to your mother as you wish but kindly do not expect me to return to this house and subject myself to your presence good night then i turned round and boldly marched out even managingjustto avoid slamming the thin door as i left i am more than susceptible to female charms some might even say overly so and in my youth i was not averse to taking my pleasures wherever they might arise but this was not one of those cases i had treated her mother out of kindness and to have my motives and intentions so abused was intolerable even if such was the form of payment i had in mind it was certainly not the girls place to talk to me in that fashion seething with fury i marched away from her hovelmore convinced than before that the girl was as corrupt and foul as her living accommodation to the devil with her mother i thought what sort of woman could she be to have spawned such a hellish monstrosity a scrawny little wretch i told myself forgetting i had earlier thought of her as pretty and even if she were beautiful what of it the devil himselí can become beauty so we are told to corrupt mankind on the other hand a little voice in the back of my mind was whispering critical words into my ear so it said you will kill the mother to have your revenge on the daughter well done physician i hope you are proud but what was i meant to do apologize the good san rocca might be capable of such charity but he was a saint those who have some inkling that my command of the english language by this stage was adequate but by no means sophisticated are no doubt thinking that i am a fraud in recounting my conversations i admit my english was not good enough to present complex ideas but then i had no need to certainly in conversations with such as the blundy girl i had to do my best in english although their manner of speaking was usually sufficiently uncomplicated that i could manage perfectly well with others the conversation switched as occasion required from latin and sometimes even french the english of quality being renowned as linguists of considerable attainment with a frequent ability in foreign tongues which many other peoplesabove all the germanscould do well to emulate lower for example was perfectly at ease in latin and managed a passable french boyle could in addition manage greek and spoke a dainty italian as well as having a smattering of german now i fear latin is passing out of use to the detriment of our republic for how will men of learning manage when they sacrifice conversation with their equals and have only the ability to talk to their ignorant countrymen but then i felt safe in my place surrounded as i thought by gentlemen who brushed aside the prejudices of lesser men that i was a roman catholic occasioned no more than the occasional barbed joke from lower whose love of fun sometimes overbalanced into the offensive and not even that from the pious boyle who was as mindful of others faith as he was fervent of his own even a mussulman or a hindoo would have been welcomed at his table i sometimes think as long as he was pious and showed an interest in experiment such an attitude is rare in england and this bigotry and suspicion is the most serious flaw in a nation which has many faults fortunately my associations meant that i was sheltered initially from its effects beyond an occasional insult or stone thrown at me in the street when i began to be known i should say that lower was the first man i considered my friend since my infancy and i fear i misunderstood the english in this respect when a venetian calls a man his friend he does so after long thought as to accept such a person is all but to make him a member of the family owed much loyalty and forbearance we die for our friends as for our family and value them as did dantenoi non potemo aver perfetta vita senza amida perfect life needs friends such friendships are justly celebrated among the ancients as homer lauds the bond between achilles and patroclus or plutarch the amity of theseus and perithoos but it was rare among the jews for in the old testament i find few friends except david and jonathan and even here davids obligation is not so great that he refrains from killing jonathans son like most of my station i had had childhood companions but put these by me when the obligations of family descended as an adult for they are a heavy burden the english are very different they have friends at all stages of their lives and maintain a distinction between the obligations of amity and those of blood by taking lower to my heart as i didfor i never encountered anyone so close to me in spirit or in interesti made the mistake of assuming he did the same with me and acknowledged the same obligations but it was not the case the english can lose their friends then such sad knowledge was unsuspected and i concentrated on repaying my friends for their kindness and at the same time advancing my knowledge through assisting boyle in his chemical experiments having long and fruitful conversations at all hours and times with lower and his associates although he was serious of demeanor boyles elaboratory positively bubbled with good humor except when work was about to take place for he considered experiment to be the discovery of gods will needing to be performed with reverence when an experiment was to begin all women were excluded for fear their irrational natures would influence the result and an air of fervent concentration descended my task was to take notes on experiments as they happened to assist in setting up equipment and to keep accounts for he spent a fortune on his science he usedand often brokespecially made glass bottles and the leather tubes pumps and lenses he required all consumed huge amounts of money then there was the cost of chemicals many of which had to be brought from london or even amsterdam there can be few prepared to spend that much to produce so little in obviously advantageous result i must here declare myself as someone who does not for a moment subscribe to the general view that a willingness to perform oneself is detrimental to the dignity of experimental philosophy there is after all a clear distinction between labor carried out for financial reward and that done for the improvement of mankindto put it another way lower as a philosopher was fully my equal even if he fell away when he became the practicing physician i think ridiculous the practice of certain professors of anatomy who find it beneath them to pick up the knife themselves but merely comment while hired hands do the cutting sylvius would never have dreamt of sitting on a dais reading from an authority while others cutwhen he taught the knife was in his hand and the blood spattered his coat boyle also did not scruple to perform his own experiments and on one occasion in my presence even showed himself willing to anatomize a rat with his very own hands nor was he less a gentleman when he had finished indeed in my opinion his stature was all the greater for in boyle wealth humility and curiosity mingled and the world is the richer for it now boyle said when lower turned up in midafternoon and we took a break from our work it is time for cola here to earn the pittance i am paying him this alarmed me as i had been laboring hard for at least two hours and i wondered whether perhaps i was doing something wrong or boyle had not noticed my efforts but rather he wanted me to sing for my supper as the phrase goes i was there not only to learn from him but also to teach him such was the marvelous humility of the man your blood cola lower said to relieve my anxiety tell us about your blood what have you been up to what experimentations are your conclusions based on what are your conclusions in fact im very much afraid i am going to disappoint you began hesitantly when i saw they were not to be diverted my researches are scarcely advanced i am mainly interested in the question of what the blood is for we have known for thirty years that it circulates around the body your own harvey showed that we know that if you drain an animal of its blood it rapidly dies the vital spirits in it are the means of communication between the mind and the force of mobility permitting movement to take place here lower wagged his finger ah you have fallen too much under the influence of mr helmont sir there we will be in dispute you do not accept this i do not not that it matters at the moment please continue i regrouped my forces and rethought my approach we believe i started we believe that it moves heat from the ferment of the heart to the brain thus providing the warmth we need to live then vents the excess into the lungs but is that really the case as far as i know no experiments have proven this the other question is simplewhy do we breathe we assume that it is to regulate the body heat to draw in cool air and thus moderate the blood again is that true although the tendency to breathe more often when we exercise indicates this the converse is not true for i placed a rat in a bucket of ice and stopped its nose but it died nonetheless boyle nodded and lower looked as though he wanted to put some questions but as he could see i was concentrating and trying to present my case well he obligingly refrained from interrupting the other thing that has struck me is the way in which the blood changes consistency have you noticed for example that it alters color after passing through the lungs i confess i have not lower replied thoughtfully although of course i am aware that it changes color in a jar but we know why surely the heavier melancholic elements in the blood sink making the top lighter and the bottom darker not so i said firmly cover the jar and the color does not change and i can find no explanation of how such a separation could occur in the lungs but when it emerges from the lungsat least this is the case in catsit is very much lighter in color than when it goes in indicating that some darkness is withdrawn from it i must cut up a cat and see for myself a live cat was it it was for a while it may well be that some other noxious elements leave the blood in the lungs are sucked out by passage through the tissue as through a sieve and are then exhaled the lighter blood is purified substance we know after all that the breath often smells and did you weigh the two cups of blood to see if they had changed weight boyle asked i flushed slightly as the thought had never even occurred to me clearly this would be a next step boyle said it may be of course a waste of time but it might be an avenue to explore a minor detail though please continue having made such an elementary omission i felt unwilling to continue and lay out my more extreme flights of fancy if one concentrates on the two hypotheses i said there is the problem of testing to see which is correctdoes the blood shed something in the lungs or gain something or both lower added or both i agreed i was thinking of an experiment but had neither the time nor the equipment in leiden to pursue my ideas and that was well i began a little nervously if the purpose of breathing is to expel heat and the noxious byproducts of fermentation then the air itself is unimportant so if we placed an animal in a vacuum oh i see boyle said with a glance at lower you would like to use my vacuum pump in fact the idea had not occurred to me before i spoke curiously boyles pump was of such fame i had scarcely given it a thought since id arrived in oxford as i had never dreamt of the possibility of using it myself the machine was of such sophistication grandeur and expense that it was known to people of curiosity throughout europe now of course such devices are well enough known then there were perhaps only two in the whole of christendom and boyles was the better so ingenious in design that no one had managed to reproduce itor the results he attained naturally its use was rationed very carefully few were even allowed to see it in operation let alone employ it and it was forward of me even to bring the subject up the last thing i wanted was a refusal i had set myself the task of ingratiating myself into his confidence and a rebuff now would have been hurtful but all was well boyle thought the matter over a while and then nodded and how might you proceed a mouse or a rat would do i said even a bird put it in the bell and extract the air if the purpose of respiration is to vent fumes then a vacuum will provide more space for the exhalations and the animal will live more easily if respiration requires air to be sucked into the blood then the vacuum might make the animal ill boyle thought it over and nodded yes he said eventually a good idea we can do it now if you like why not indeed come along the machine is prepared so we can start immediately he led the way into the next room in which many of his finest experiments had taken place the pump one of the most artistic devices i had seen stood on the table for those who do not know it then i suggest they consult the fine engravings in his opera completa here i will merely say that it was an elaborate device of brass and leather with a handle connected to a large glass bell and a set of valves through which propelled by a pair of bellows the air could be made to pass in one direction but not the other by the use of this boyle had already demonstrated some marvels including the disproval of aristotles dictum that nature abhors a vacuum as he said in a rare moment of jest nature may not like it but if pushed will be made to put up with it a vacuuman area of space voided entirely of contentcan indeed be created and possesses many strange qualities as i examined the machine carefully he told me how a ringing bell placed in a glass chamber will stop making sound as the vacuum is created around it the more perfect the vacuum the less the sound he said he had even constructed an explanation for the occurrence but declined to inform me of it i would see for myself with the animal even if the rest of the experiment did not work the bird was a dove a handsome bird which cooed gently as boyle took it from its cage and placed it underneath the glass dome when all was ready he gave a signal and the assistant began working the bellows with much grunting and a whooshing sound as air was propelled through the mechanism how long does this take i enquired eagerly a few minutes lower replied i do believe its song is getting fainter do you hear i regarded the beast with interest as it was showing signs of distress you are right but surely it is because the bird itself seems unconcerned with making a noise hardly had i spoken when the dove which a few moments ago had been hopping around the dome with curiosity fluttering against the invisible glass walls which it could feel but was incapable of understanding fell over its beak gaping open its beady eyes popping and its legs flailing around pathetically good heavens i said lower ignored me why dont we let the air back in and see what happens then the valves were turned and with an audible hiss the vacuum was filled the bird still lay there twitching away although it was clear that it was very much relieved within a few moments it picked itself up ruffled its feathers and resumed its attempts to fly away to freedom well i said so much for one hypothesis boyle nodded and gave the assistant a nod to try it again here i must note the extraordinary goodness of this fine man who refused to use the same animal in more than one series of experiments because of the torture to the creature once it had served its turn and given itself to the pursuit of humane knowledge he either let it go or if necessary killed it until then i had never thought such an attitude attachable to any experimentalist other than myself and i rejoiced to find at last someone whose sentiments were similar to my own experimentation must take place this is certain but sometimes when i behold the faces of my colleagues as they cut i think i see too much pleasure on their countenances and suspect that the agony is prolonged longer than is necessary for mere knowledge once in padua a vivisection of a dog was interrupted when a female servant grieved to hear the beasts piteous cries as it was cut open strangled it in front of a full audience of students causing much dismay and protest at the ruining of the spectacle of the assembled multitude i believe that only myself had sympathy for the woman and was grateful to her but then i was ashamed of the effeminacy of my concerns which i think came from my delight as a child in being read from the life of st francis who loved and reverenced all things in gods creation but boyle came to the same conclusions although typically of the man did so in a far more rigorous fashion than myself and was of course uninfluenced by memories of the assisi countryside for just as he believed that a gentleman should show christian condescension to the lower orders according to their merits so men the gentlemen of gods creation owed similar courtesy to the animals over whom they had dominion while not scrupling to use men or animals as was his right he believed firmly that they should not be abused either in that good catholic and fervent protestant were in accord for once and i liked boyle the more for his care that afternoon we used only a single bird by means of careful study we ascertained that it was scarcely affected when only half of the air was removed that it began to show signs of distress when two thirds had gone and was rendered insensible when three quarters had vanished conclusionthe presence of air is necessary for life to continue although as lower said that did not explain what it did personally i believe that as fire needs air to burn so life which can be likened to fire needs it also although i admit that argument by analogy is of limited use it was an appealing little animal the dove we used to prise these secrets from natures grip and i had my habitual pang of sorrow when we reached the final necessary round of the experiment although we knew what the result would be the demands of philosophy are implacable and all must be demonstrated beyond contradiction so it was my voice which reassured the creature for the last time and my hand which placed it back in the bell then gave the signal for the assistant to begin pumping once more i offered a small prayer to gentle st francis when it finally collapsed and died its song finally extinguished it is gods will that sometimes the innocent must suffer and die for a greater purpose this business concluded lower suggested i might like to dine with some friends whom he felt i might profit from meeting it was kind of him and it seemed that the closeness to boyle that an afternoons experiment entailed had placed him in a good humor i suspected however that there was another side of his character a darkness which warred with his natural good nature for a flickering of a moment while i laid out my thoughts to boyle i had felt a slight unease in lowers demeanor although this had never come to the surface i had also noticed that he had never given his own theories or elaborated his own thoughts these he kept close to himself i did not mind boyle was lowers most important connection among the few gentlemen of standing who could help establish himself in his career and he was naturally concerned lest that patronage be diverted but i contented myself with the assurance that i presented him with no challenge and concluded that i could hardly attract his enmity perhaps i should have been more sensitive to his concerns for it was a matter of character not of circumstance which made him uncomfortable my position had made me easy with all ranks of life i admired and was beholden to mr boyle but in all other respects i considered him my equal lower was unable to feel the same although all are citizens of the republic of learning he was often uneasy in such company for he believed himself at a disadvantage due to a birth which although respectable gave him neither fortune nor people moreover he lacked the talents of the courtier and in later years he never rose to any position of distinction in the royal society while men of lesser accomplishment took on its great offices this was galling for a man of his ambition and pride but for the most part this inner conflict was hidden and i am aware that he did as much as his nature allowed to assist me while i was in oxford he was a man who liked easily but then was seized by fear lest his affections be abused and exploited by others of a less trusting disposition than himself the fact that earning position in england is so formidably hard merely heightened this aspect of his nature i can say this now as the passage of years has lessened my hurt and increased my understanding at that time my comprehension was smaller it was as a result of his friendliness and enthusiasm however that i was led down the high street that afternoon in the direction of the castle i didnt want to mention it in boyles presence he said confidingly as we marched briskly along in the cold afternoon air but i have high hopes of getting hold of a corpse soon boyle disapproves i was surprised by this remark even though some of the older physicians didnt hold with the business at all and it still caused considerable trouble among churchmen it was accepted as an essential part of medical studies in italy was it possible that a man like boyle could disagree oh no he has nothing against anatomizing but he feels i tend to become undignified about the matter which may be true but there is no other way of getting hold of them without getting permission first what do you mean getting permission where does this man find the body in the first place he is the body how can you ask permission of a corpse oh hes not dead lower said airily not yet anyway is he ill heavens no prime of life but theyre to hang him soon after hes found guilty he attacked a gentleman and injured him badly a simple case it is too he was found with the knife in his hand will you come to see the hanging i must confess i shall its not often a student is hanged alas most of them join the church and get livings im sure theres a witticism in there somewhere if i phrased it rightly i was beginning to see boyles point of view but lower quite impervious to disapproval when fixed on his work explained how very difficult it was to get hold of a fresh corpse these days that had been the one good effect he said nostalgically of the civil war especially when the kings army had been quartered in oxford there were corpses two a penny never had anatomists had such a plentiful supply i forbore to point out that he was much too young to know the trouble is you see that most people who die are sick in some way not if they have the right doctor i said desiring to show myself as witty as he quite but its very inconvenient the only time we can see what a properly healthy person looks like is if they are killed in some relatively clean fashion and the best supply of those comes from the gallows but that is another one of the universitys monopolies pardon i said in some surprise law of the land he went on the university has a right to the bodies of everyone hanged within twenty miles the courts are so very lax on crime these days as well many an interesting specimen gets off with a flogging and theres only about half a dozen hangings a year and im afraid they dont always make the best use of the corpses they do have our regius professor is scarcely qualified to be a carpenter last time well lets not go into that he said with a shudder we had arrived at the castle a great gloomy edifice which scarcely seemed capable of defending the town from assault or of providing a refuge for the townspeople in fact it had not been used for such a purpose for as long as anyone could remember and was now the county prison in which those due to appear at the assizes were held pending their trialand pending their punishment afterward it was a dirty shabby place and i looked around with distaste as lower knocked on the door of a little cottage down by the stream in the shadow of the tower getting in to see his body was surprisingly easy all he had to do was tip the guardian a penny and this old hobbling mana royalist soldier who had been given the position for his servicesled the way his keys jangling by his side if it was gloomy outside it was even darker inside although far from grim for the more fortunate of the inmates the poorer ones naturally had the worst of the cells and were forced to eat food which was barely adequate for keeping body and soul together but lower pointed out as several were to have body and soul forcibly separated in due course anyway there was little point in spoiling them however the better sort of prisoner could rent a more salubrious cell send out to a tavern for food and in addition have laundry done when required he could also receive visitors if as was the case with lower they were prepared to tip heavily for the privilege there you are then sirs said the warder as he swung open a heavy door leading into what i gathered was a cell for a middleranking sort of prisoner the man whom lower hoped to cut into small bits was sitting on a little bed he looked up in a rather sulky fashion as we entered then peered curiously a glimmer of half recognition passing across his face as my friend passed into the thin stream of light that came through the open barred window dr lower isnt it he said in a melodious voice lower told me later that he was a lad from a good but impoverished family his fall from grace had been something of a shock and his position was not sufficiently elevated to spare him from the gallows and now the time appointed was drawing near the english rush from trial to sentence with considerable speed so that a man condemned on monday can often be hanged the following morning unless he is lucky jack prestcott could count himself fortunate that he had been arrested a few weeks before the assizes arrived to hear his case it gave him time to prepare his soul for lower told me there was not the slightest chance of an acquittal or a pardon mr prestcott lower said cheerfully i hope i find you well prestcott nodded and said he was as well as could be expected i wont beat about the bush lower said ive come to ask something of you prestcott looked surprised that he should be asked a service in his current condition but nodded to indicate that lower should ask away he put down his book and paid attention you are a young man of considerable learning and im told your tutor spoke very highly of you lower continued and you have committed a most heinous crime if you have found a way of saving me from the noose then i agree with you prestcott said calmly but i fear you have something else in mind but please continue doctor i am interrupting your speech i trust you have meditated on your sinful conduct and have seen the justice of the fate which awaits you in due course lower continued in what struck me as being a remarkably pompous fashion i suppose the effort to hit the right tone made him sound a little discordant indeed i have the youth replied with gravity every day i pray to the almighty for forgiveness mindful that i scarcely deserve such a boon splendid continued lower so if i were to tell you of a way in which you could contribute inestimably to the betterment of all mankind and do something to cancel out the horrible acts with which your name will be forever associated you might be interested hmm the young man nodded cautiously and asked what this contribution might be lower explained about the law on the corpses of criminals now you see he went on scarcely noticing that prestcott had turned a little pale the regius professor and his assistant are the most appalling butchers they will hack and saw and chop and reduce you to a mangled ruin and no one will be any the wiser all that will happen is that you will furnish a rarity show for any spotty undergraduate who cares to come along and watch not that many do now iand my friend here signor da cola of veniceare dedicated to research of the most delicate kind by the time we are finished we will know immeasurably more about the functions of the human body and there will be no waste i promise you he went on waving his finger in the air as he got into his stride you see the trouble with the professor is that once he stops for lunch he tends to lose interest he drinks a good deal you know he confided whats left over gets thrown away or gnawed by rats in the basement whereas i will pickle you i beg your pardon prestcott said weakly pickle you lower replied enthusiastically it is the very latest technique if we joint you and pop you into a vat of spirits you will keep for very much longer so much better than brandy then when we have the leisure to dissect a bit we just fish you out and get to work splendid eh nothing will be wasted i assure you all that is required is that you give me a letter specifying as your last request that i be allowed to dissect you once you have met your punishment convinced that this was a request no reasonable man might refuse lower leaned back against the wall and beamed with anticipation no prestcott said i beg your pardon i said no certainly not but i told you youll be dissected anyway wouldnt you at least want it to be done properly i dont want it done at all thank you whats more im convinced it will not be a pardon you think lower said with interest oh i think not no i fear you will swing sir after all you nearly killed a man of some importance tell me why did you attack him i must hasten to remind you i have not yet been found guilty of any crime let alone condemned and i am convinced i will shortly regain my freedom should i be wrong then i might entertain your proposal but even then i doubt whether i will be able to oblige you my mother would have the gravest objections this i suppose was the time for lower to return to his theme but his enthusiasm seemed to have waned perhaps he thought the young mans mother would regard being jointed and pickled as bringing still further shame on his name he nodded regretfully and stood up thanking the youth for having listened to his request prestcott told him to think nothing of it and when asked if he needed anything to improve his condition asked if he could deliver a message to a dr grove one of his former tutors asking for the goodness of a visit he had need of spiritual comfort he said another gallon of wine would be well received also lower promised and i offered to deliver the wine as i felt sorry for the fellow and i did so as my friend went off to an appointment with a new patient well it was worth trying he said in a disappointed tone when we met later on and the conversation returned to the topic of reluctant corpses i noticed that the rebuff had quite dissolved his cheerful mood of earlier in the day what did he mean about his family having shame enough lower was lost in contemplation however and ignored my remark while he dwelt on his failure what was that he said abruptly when his attention returned i repeated myself oh no more than the truth his father was a traitor who fled abroad before he could be held he would have been executed as well given the chance quite a family indeed it seems that the son takes after the father in more than looks alas it is a damnable shame cola i need a brain several brains and i am hindered and obstructed at every turn then after a long silence he asked what i thought the chances were of sarah blundys mother pulling through rather foolishly i imagined that he wanted a detailed account of the case and the treatment i had provided so i told him about the nature of the wound the way i had set the bone and cleaned the flesh and of the salve i had used waste of time he said loftily tincture of mercury is what you need you think perhaps but i decided that in this case considering the aspect of venus she stood a much better chance with a more orthodox remedy and then came the first serious indication of the darkness in my friend i have mentioned for i could not even finish my reply before he exploded with rage in full public swinging round to face me his face darkening oh dont be so stupid he shouted the aspect of venus what magical nonsense is that dear god are we still egyptians that we should pay attention to such rubbish but galen i dont give a hoot for galen or paracelsus or any foreign magus with his slobberings and mumblings these people are the merest frauds as are you sir if you drivel on in such a way you should not be let loose among the sick but lower more orthodox remedy he said mimicking my accent cruelly i suppose some gibbering priest told you that and you do as youre told eh physick is too important to be left to the dabblings of a rich mans son like you who could no more cure a cold than you could a broken leg stick to counting your money and your acres and leave serious matters to people who care for them i was so shocked by this outburst so unforeseen and so very violent that i said nothing at all in reply except that i was doing my best and that no one better qualified had offered their services oh get out of my sight he said with the most terrible contempt i will have none of you i have no time for quacks and charlatans and he abruptly turned on his heel and marched away leaving me standing in the street in shock my face burning red with anger and embarrassment conscious above all that i had provided cheap entertainment for the mob of shopkeepers all around me i returned to my room in deep distress to consider what i should do next and try to understand how i had caused such offence for i am one of those who naturally assumes the fault lies in himself first of all and my lack of understanding of english ways had greatly heightened my uncertainty even so i was convinced that lowers shocking outburst was excessive but the temper of the country then cast all opinions in extremes so i sat by the little fireplace in my cold room with the feelings of desperation and loneliness so recently banished coming back to plague me once again was my acquaintanceship at an end so soon certainly in italy no relation could survive such behavior and under ordinary circumstances we would now be preparing to duel i intended to do no such thing of course but did briefly consider whether it would be better to leave oxford for my association with boyle might well become intolerable and then i would be friendless once again but where could i go there seemed little point in returning to london and less in staying where i was i was fixed in my irresolution when feet on the stairs and a heavy pounding on the door roused me from my dreary thoughts it was lower with a grave look on his face he marched determinedly in and placed two bottles on the table i regarded him coldly and cautiously expecting another round of abuse and determined that he should speak first instead he ostentatiously sank to his knees and clasped his hands together sir he said with a gravity which had more than a touch of the theatrical in it how can i ask you to forgive me i have behaved with the manners of a tradesman or worse i have been inhospitable unkind unjust and grossly illmannered i offer you my humblest apologies on my knees as you see and beg for a forgiveness which i do not deserve i was as astonished by his behavior now as i was before and could find no suitable reply for this contrition which was every bit as excessive as his violence an hour or so previously you cannot forgive he continued with an ostentatious sigh as i remained silent i cannot blame you then there is no choice i must kill myself please tell my family that my gravestone should read richard lower physician and wretch here i burst out laughing so absurd was his behavior and seeing that he had cracked my resolve he grinned back truly i am most gigantically sorry he said in a more moderate tone i dont know why but sometimes i become so angry that i cannot stop myself and my frustrations over these corpses is so very great if you knew the torments i go throughdo you accept my apology will you drink from the same bottle as me i will not sleep or shave until you accept and you dont want to be responsible for me having a beard down to my ankles do you i shook my head lower i do not understand you i said frankly or any of your countrymen so i will assume this is part of your nations manner and that it is my fault for having so little understanding i will drink with you thank heavens for that he said i thought i had foolishly thrown away a valued friend through my own stupidity you are goodness indeed to give me a second chance but please explain why did i make you so angry he waved his hand you didnt it was my misunderstanding and i was upset over losing prestcott not long ago i had a violent row with someone over astrological prediction the college of physicians is wedded to it and this man threatened to keep me out of practice in london because i disdain it in public and advocate the new mineral physick it is a battle between new knowledge and the dead hand of old i know you did not mean it like that but im afraid the fight i had is too fresh in my mind the sound of you of all people taking their part was too much to bear so highly do i value you unforgivable as i say he had a way of turning insult into compliment which i was illequipped to handle we venetians have a reputation for the elaborate nature of both our courtesies and our insults but they are so formal there is no chance of misunderstanding even the most opaque remark lower and the english in general had the unpredictability of the uncivilized their genius is as uncontrolled as their manners and can make them great or mad i doubt that foreigners will ever know them or truly trust them but an apology was an apology and i had rarely received such a handsome one i shook his hand we bowed solemnly and toasted each other to bring the argument to a formal conclusion why do you want prestcott so much and so urgently my brains cola my brains he said with a loud groan i have anatomized and drawn as many as i can lay my hands on and i will soon be finished i have devoted years to the task and it will make my name when it is done the spinal cord in particular fascinating but i cannot finish without some more and unless i can finish i cannot publish my work and there is a frenchman who i know is doing much the same work i will not be beaten by some sniveling papist he paused and realized he had misspoken again apologies sir but so much depends on this and it is heartbreaking to be denied by such stupidities he opened the second bottle took a long draft from the open neck and handed it to me so there you are the reasons for my incivility they combine i must admit with an overly wayward temperament i am choleric by nature so much for the man who rejects traditional medicine he grinned true enough i speak metaphorically did you mean it about the stars you think it is nonsense he shrugged his shoulders oh i dont know i really dont are our bodies a microcosm of all creation can we discern movements of the one from studying the other probably it makes perfect sense i suppose but no one has ever given me a good and unassailable method for how to do it all this stargazing the astronomers do seems very thoughtless stuff and they will wrap it up so in nostrums and gabblings and they will keep on finding more of them with these telescopes of theirs all very interesting but they become so enthusiastic theyve all but forgotten the reason why theyre looking but do not start me on that i will lose my temper for the second time in the day so can we start again in what way tell me about your patient that most strange widow anne blundy i will give the matter my full attention and any suggestions i make will be without the slightest taint of criticism i was still chary of taking such a risk and so hesitated until lower sighed and made an elaborate preparation to go back down on his knees all right i said holding up my hands and trying to stop myself laughing once more i surrender thank heavens he said for im sure i will be rheumatic when im old now if im right i believe you said the wound was not knitting no and it will turn putrid very rapidly youve tried exposing it to the air rather than keeping it bandaged yes it is making no difference fever surprisingly not but it must come eating nothing unless her daughter has managed to feed her some gruel piss thin with a lemony aroma and astringent taste hmm not good youre quite right not good she will die i want to save her or at least i did i find the daughter intolerable lower ignored the last remark any sign of gangrene i told him no but that there was again every likelihood it might appear dye think she would be interested in advancing no i said firmly what about the daughter if i offered her a pound for the remains you have met the girl i believe lower nodded and sighed heavily i tell you cola if i should die tomorrow you have my full permission to anatomize me why it causes such upset i do not know after all theyre buried eventually arent they what does it matter how many pieces theyre in as long as they die with the blessings of religion do they think the good lord is incapable of reassembling them in time for the second coming i replied that it was the same in venice for whatever reason people did not like the idea of being cut up whether they were dead or alive what do you intend to do with the woman he asked wait till she dies it was then that i had an idea and instantly decided to share it such was my trusting nature that it never occurred to me not to do so hand me that bottle again i said and ill tell you what id like to do if i were only able he did so at once and i briefly considered the momentous step i was about to take i was hardly in an equable frame of mind my distress at the bruising i had received and the relief at his apology were so great that my judgment was unbalanced i do believe i would never have drawn him into my confidence had his loyalty and friendship been unquestioned now it had been placed in doubt the wish to please him and demonstrate my seriousness swept all before it please forgive the clumsy way i express this i said when he was leaning back on my truckle bed as comfortably as was possible the idea came to me only when we were watching that dove in the vacuum pump it is about the blood you see what if by accident there is not enough blood to carry the nutrient could a loss of blood mean that there is insufficient to vent the excess heat from the heart might that not be a cause of fever also i have wondered for some years whether the blood gets old with the rest of the body like a canal with stagnant water in it where everything starts to die because the passageway becomes clogged certainly if you lose blood you die but why not from starvation nor from excess heat either no sir it is the draining or occlusion of the life spirit present in the blood that causes death the blood itself i am convinced is merely the carrier for this spirit and it is the decay of that spirit which causes old age that at least is my theory and it is one where the traditional knowledge you disdain and the experimental knowledge you applaud are in perfect agreement at which point we connect your theoretical preliminary with the practicalities of your case is that not so tell me how you would proceed if you think about it simply it is very straightforward if we are hungry we eat if we are cold we approach heat if our humors are unbalanced we add or create some more to recreate equilibrium if you believe that nonsense if you do i said if you do not and you believe in the elemental theories then you rebalance the body by strengthening the weaker of the three elements that is the essence of all medicine old and newto restore equilibrium now in this case taking away more blood by leeching or scarifying the patient would only make matters worse if her life spirit is diminished reducing it still further cannot help her this is sylviuss theory and i believe he is correct logically instead of taking blood away the only answer should be to add some more lower said quickly leaning forward in his seat with sudden eagerness as he finally grasped what i was talking about i nodded enthusiastically thats it i said thats it exactly and not just more but young blood fresh new and unclogged with the vitality of youth in its essence maybe that would allow an old person to repair a wound who knows lower i said excitedly it might be the elixir of life itself it is thought after all that merely getting a child to share a bed can benefit the health of an elderly person just think what their blood might do lower leaned back in his chair and took a deep draft of ale as he thought about what i had said his lips moved as he held a silent conversation with himself going over in his mind all the possibilities you have fallen under the influence of monsieur descartes have you not he asked eventually why do you say that you have constructed a theory and that leads you to recommend a practice you have no evidence that it would work and if i may say so your theory is confused you argue by analogyusing a humoral metaphor you do not actually believe into conclude that supplying an absence is a solution that is adding vital spirit the existence of which is conjectural though not disputed even by yourself no that is true do you dispute my theory though no and is there any way of finding out whether i am correct except by testing it against result that is surely the basis of experimental philosophy that is monsieur descartess basis he said if i understand him correctly to frame a hypothesis then amass evidence to see if it is correct the alternative proposed by my lord bacon is to amass evidence and then to frame an explanation which takes into account all that is known in retrospect looking back over the conversation which i noted diligently in the book which was with me on my travels and which i now reread for the first time in many years i see many things which were obscured from my understanding then the english detestation of foreigners leads very swiftly to a wish to ignore any advance which stems from what they consider faulty methods and allows this proudest of people to claim all discoveries as their own a discovery based on faulty premises is no discoveryall foreigners influenced by descartes employ faulty premises and therefore hypotheses non fingo no hypotheses hereis that not the trumpet blast of mr newton as he assails leibniz as a thief for having the same ideas as himself but at that time i merely thought my friend was using argument as a means of furthering our knowledge i believe your summary of monsieur descartes does him scant justice i said but no matter tell me how you would you proceed i would begin by transfusing blood between animalsyoung and old of the same type then between different types i would transfuse water into an animals veins to see whether the same response was elicited then i would compare all the results to see what exactly the effects of transfusing blood are finally when i could proceed with certainty i would make the attempt on mrs blundy who by then would have been dead for a year or more lower grinned your unerring eye has spotted the weakness of the method are you suggesting i should not do this no it would be fascinating i merely doubt whether it is well founded and i am certain that it would cause scandal which makes it a dangerous business to discuss publicly let me put it another way will you help me naturally i should be delighted i was merely discussing the issues that are raised how would you proceed i dont know i said i thought that maybe a bull might serve as strong as an ox you know but good reasons rule that out the blood has a tendency to congeal so it would be imperative to transport it immediately from one creature into the other without delay and we could hardly bring an ox in besides the blood transports the animal spirit and i would be loath to infuse the bestiality of an ox into a person that would be an offense against god who has set us higher than the animals your own then no because i would need to attend to the experiment there is no problem we can easily find someone the best person he continued would be the daughter she would be willing for her mothers sake and im sure we could impress on her the need for silence i had forgotten about the daughter lower saw my face fall and asked me what was the matter she was so insufferably offensive last time i visited the house i vowed never to set foot there again pride sir pride perhaps but you must understand that i cannot give way she would have to come to me on her knees before i would reconsider leave that for a moment assuming you could do this experimentjust assuminghow much blood would you need i shook my head fifteen ounces maybe perhaps twenty a person can lose that much without too many ill effects maybe more at a later stage what i dont know is how to effect the transportation it struck me that the blood would have to leave the one body and enter the other in the same placevein to vein artery to artery i would recommend slitting the jugular except that its fearfully difficult to stop it up again i dont want to save the mother and have the daughter bleed to death so maybe one of the major vessels in the arm a band to make it swell up thats the easy part it is the transference which concerns me lower got up and wandered around the room rummaging around in his pockets have you heard of injections he asked eventually i shook my head ah he said a splendid idea which we have been working on we myself dr willis and my friend wren similar in some ways to your idea what we do you see is take a sharp instrument and push it into a vein then squeeze liquids straight into the blood avoiding the stomach entirely i frowned extraordinary what happens he paused we have had mixed results he confessed the first time it worked marvelously we injected an eighthcup of red wine straight into a dog not enough to make it even tipsy usually but by this method it turned rolling drunk he grinned at the thought we had a terrible time controlling it it jumped off the table and ran around then fell over after bumping into a cupboard of plates we could barely control ourselves even boyle cracked a smile the important thing is that it seems a little liquor injected has much more of an effect than when taken through the stomach so we took a mangy old beast next time and injected sal ammoniack and it died and in some considerable pain when we opened it up the corrosion to its heart was considerable we tried injecting milk the next time to see if we could bypass the need to eat but it curdled in the veins unfortunately died again he nodded we must have overdone the amount well cut it back next time i would be fascinated if you would allow me to attend a pleasure my point is that we could use the same idea for transferring your blood you dont want the blood exposed to the air because it might congeal so you take a pigeon quill which can be made very thin and sharp put a hole in the end and insert it into sarahs vein join it to a long silver tube which has a narrow diameter with another quill in the mothers vein wait for the blood to flow then stop the flow in the mothers vein above the slit join the two together and count im afraid wed have to guess about how much comes out if we let the blood flow into a bowl for a few seconds well have some idea of how fast it is going i nodded enthusiastically wonderful i said id been thinking about cupping this is much neater he grinned and held out his hand by god mr cola im glad youre here youre a man after my own heart truly you are in the meantime which of us is going to see grove for poor prestcott i have always acknowledged my debt to lower on the mechanics of transfusion without his ingenuity i doubt that the operation could have been made to work the fact remains however that the first suggestion of the idea and the reasoning for it came from myself and i later carried out the experiment until then lowers thoughts had revolved solely around the problem of injecting physick into the blood and he had never for a moment considered the possibility or potential of transferring blood itself this is a matter for a later part of my narrative however and i must stick to my story as it happened at that moment my main concern was to offer my services to visit dr grove on behalf of prestcott because i still believed that the more members of that society i knew the better it would be for me dr grove certainly was unlikely to be of much use and lower told me he was heartily glad of my offer to go as it spared him a meeting with a man he considered very tiresome he was an avowed and vociferous opponent of the new learning and only a fortnight before had delivered a stinging sermon in st marys attacking experimental knowledge as contradictory to gods word undermining of authority and flawed in both intention and execution are there many of his opinion in the town i asked dear heavens yes there are physicians who fear for their prerogatives priests frightened of being usurped and whole hordes of the ignorant who simply dislike anything new we are on dangerous ground this is why we must tread carefully with widow blundy i nodded it was the same in italy i told him in that case you will be prepared for grove he replied with a grin talk to him he will keep you on your toes he is no fooleven though he is wrong and frankly somewhat tedious st mary college of winchester in oxford vulgarly called new college is a large shabby building that stands in the east of the town hard up against the walls and the tennis courts it is very wealthy but has a reputation for being one of the most backward of places when i arrived it seemed almost deserted and there was no indication of where the object of my journey might be so i asked the one person i saw and he informed me that dr grove had been ill for some days and was not encouraging visitors i explained that while i would normally be willing to leave him in peace i could not in all conscience do so accordingly this man a short dark little fellow who introduced himself with a stiff little bow as one thomas ken showed me to the staircase the thick oak door of dr groves roomthe english are prodigal with fine wood in this waywas firmly closed and i knocked expecting no reply i did however hear a slight scuffling and so knocked again i thought that i heard a voice i could not make out what it was saying but it seemed reasonable to assume that it was inviting me in go away the voice said with irritation as i entered the room are you deaf i do beg your pardon sir i replied then paused in surprise the man i had come to visit was the same person i had seen a few days previously rejecting sarah blundys request for help i stared uncertainly at him and he looked back at me clearly also remembering that he had seen me before as i say i continued when i recovered my poise i apologize but i couldnt hear very well let me repeat myself then for the third time i was telling you to go away i am feeling much too poorly he was an oldish man in his early fifties and possibly more broadshouldered he nonetheless had that air of decline that sooner or later is sent by the almighty to touch the shoulder of even the most robust of his creatures reminding them of their subjection to his laws but a re decedo i am very sorry to hear you are ill i said standing my ground in the doorway would i be right in thinking your eye is causing you distress anyone could have made this statement for the doctors left eye was red and rheumy inflamed by much irritated rubbing quite apart from my reason for being there the sight aroused my interest of course it is my eye he replied curtly i am suffering the torments of hell from it i advanced a step or two into the room so that i could see more clearly and establish myself more firmly in his presence a severe irritation sir producing gumminess and inflammation i hope you are receiving proper attention although i dont think it looks so serious serious he cried incredulously not serious im in agony and i have a great deal of work to do are you a doctor i dont need one i have the very best treatment available i introduced myself naturally i hesitate to contradict a physician sir but it doesnt look that way to me i can see from here that there is a coalescence of a brown putridity around the eyelid which requires medicine that is the medicine idiot he said i mixed the ingredients myself what ingredients were they dried dog excrement he said what i had it from my doctor bate the kings physician you know and a man of good family it is an infallible cure tested through the ages a pedigree dog as well it belongs to the warden dog excrement yes you dry it in the sun then powder it and blow it into the eyes it is a sure remedy for all forms of eye complaint to my mind this explained why his eyes were giving him so much trouble there are of course innumerable old remedies in use and some are no doubt as efficacious as anything a physician could prescribenot that this is necessarily saying much i have no doubt that the mineral physick that so enthused lower will eventually supplant them all i had some idea of the sort of prattle that accompanied the recommendation the natural attraction of like and like the powdered excrement setting up an affinity with the noxiousness and sucking it out or not as the case may be far be it from me to question sir but are you quite sure it is working i asked surely that means you are questioning it no i said cautiously in certain cases it may be effectivei do not know how long has your eye been troubling you about ten days and how long have you been treating it in this way about a week and in that time has your eye become better or worse it has not improved he conceded but it may be that without the treatment it would have got worse and it may also be that with another treatment it would have become better i said now if i gave you another treatment and your eye improved that would demonstrate that would demonstrate that my original treatment has at last begun to be effective and that your treatment was of no significance you want your eye to recover as fast as possible if you apply a treatment and within a reasonable time there has been no improvement then one may conclude that within that time the treatment does not work whether it works next week the week after or in three years time does not matter dr grove opened his mouth to dispute this line of argument then suffered another twinge of pain in his eye which he began once more to rub furiously i saw an opportunity both of ingratiating myself and perhaps even of gaining a fee to bolster my resources so i asked for some water and straightaway began to bathe the foul mess out of the eye entirely thinking that this alone would probably effect an almost miraculous cure by the time i had finished his tortured eye was open once more and although he was still in some discomfort he expressed his joy at how much better he felt already even more satisfyingly he attributed it solely to the potion i had applied now for the next stage grove said stoutly as he rolled up his sleeve i think five ounces would do dont you think i disagreed although i refrained from telling him that i was far from convinced that bleeding ever did anyone much good as i was afraid of losing his confidence so instead i suggested the harmony of his body would be better restored by a light vomit after eatingespecially as he looked like a man who could easily miss a meal or two with no ill effects the treatment concluded he asked me to share a glass of wine with him which invitation i declined having already drunk far too much recently instead i explained my visit to him thinking that if he did not bring up the incident in the coffee house i would not do so either initially i had been critical of his behavior now i knew the girl better i was more understanding it is about a young man whom i encountered yesterday i said a mr prestcott dr grove frowned at the very mention of mr prestcott and asked how i had met him considering that he was locked in the castle it was through my dear friend dr lower i said who had a message to deliver to him wants his corpse does he grove asked i swear when i become sick i feel inclined to go back to my family in northampton in case lower turns up at my bedside with an acquisitive glint in his eye what did prestcott say i told him that prestcott had refused outright to countenance the idea and grove nodded good for him sound boy although it was easy to see that hed come to a bad end very wayward at the moment i replied gravely he seems very contrite and in need of spiritual comfort he wants you to visit him to offer him the solace of religion grove looked as pleased as he was surprised the ability of the noose to make even the worst of sinners embrace gods mercy should never be underestimated he said with satisfaction i will go this evening i liked him for that he was brusque and certainly of very definite opinions yet he was also kindly i sensed and loved nothing better than for people to disagree with him lower told me later that whatever his failings grove never took offense at opinions honestly held even though he was determined to combat them as much as possible it meant that while he was difficult to like some came to love him he was most anxious to speak to you as soon as possible i said but i would recommend you wait for a day or so the wind is from the north and it is known that is bad for an ailment of the eyes we shall see he said but i must go soon i was loath to do so unless he called for me himself and i am gratified he now has my thanks sir do you know i asked as i peered into his eye once more what the story of his crime was from the few details i have heard it seems quite peculiar grove nodded very peculiar he agreed but i am afraid he was fated to act thus because of his family his father was wayward as well made an unfortunate match he disliked his wife i asked grove frowned worse than that he married for love a charming woman so i am told but against the wishes of both families who never forgave him it was typical of the man im afraid i shook my head here coming from a merchant family myself i was well aware of the importance of not allowing sentiment to cloud ones judgment in marital affairs as my father had once remarked if god had meant us to marry for love why had he created mistresses not that he indulged overmuch in this direction himself for he and my mother were devoted to each other he enlisted on the side of the king when the war broke out fought with valor and lost everything but he still continued faithful and plotted against the commonwealth alas he loved plotting more than he loved his monarch for he betrayed his king to cromwell and almost with disastrous effects a more evil deed has not been seen since judas iscariot sold our lord he nodded sagely at his tale for my part i found it all very interesting but still did not understand how prestcott came to be in prison that is very simple grove said he is of a violent and unstable disposition perhaps it is a case of the sins of the fathers being handed down he became an unruly ungovernable child and took to bad ways with a vengeance once he was free of family control he assaulted and nearly murdered the guardian who has looked after him with kindness since his fathers disgrace and there is also a complaint from an uncle that he ransacked that mans money chest on a recent visit it happenswe hanged an undergraduate for highway robbery last year prestcott this year and im afraid these will not be the last the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence he paused for me to recognize the quotation but i shrugged helplessly ezekiel he said reprovingly it is a consequence of the turmoil we have been through now sir i feel unable to insult you by offering you money for your kindness but perhaps a meal in college would be an adequate recompense we do fine food better wine and i can promise excellent company i smiled wanly and said i would be delighted splendid he said i am so glad five oclock this was agreed and i made my farewells to him with as many thanks as i could muster the way he waved it aside suggested that he believed i was singularly honored by the invitation tell me before you leave he said as i opened the door how is the girls mother i stopped in surprise at the way he brought the matter up she is not well i replied in fact i believe she will die he nodded grimly in a fashion i could not decipher i see he said gods will be done and then i was dismissed i went back to inform mrs bulstrode i would not be dining then fulfilled my last obligation and took the gallon of wine to prestcott in his jail cell dinner at new college came as something of a shock as my hosts were all gentlemen of education and many of them in holy orders i imagined that i would be passing a pleasant time in agreeable surroundings instead the meal was served in a vast and drafty hall through which the wind swept as though we were at sea in midgale grove was well wrapped up for the occasion and went into considerable detail to inform me of the layers of undergarments he was wont to don before venturing forth had he forewarned me i would have done likewise even so i would have been cold while the english are used to icy conditions i am used to the soft air and balmy weather of the mediterranean nonetheless even the lowliest tavern did not possess a bitterness like that hall which ate through your clothes and flesh and made your very bones ache with the pain of it even that would have been endurable had food wine or company been a compensation these colleges have the monastic custom of eating in common with the exception of the wealthier members who pay to have food sent up to their chambers on a raised platform sit the senior fellows and in the rest of the hall are the others as the food is scarcely fit for animals i suppose it is not surprising that they behave like beasts they eat off wooden platters and in the middle of the tables are vast wooden bowls into which they toss the bones when they do not throw them at one another i ended up with food splattered over me from fellows talking with their mouths full spraying each other with bits of gristle and halfmasticated bread the wine was scarcely palatable so i could not even drink myself into oblivion instead i had to listen to the conversation which was not at all about matters of scholarly interest i began to realize that having initially fallen in with mr boyle and dr lower i had gained an unduly favorable impression both of oxford and the english far from being concerned about the latest advances of knowledge the assembly was instead entirely taken up with who was going to gain which preferment and what the dean of this had said to the rector of that there was one other guest apart from myself evidently a gentleman of some standing and the obsequiousness of their behavior to him was such that i assumed he was a patron of the college in some form he however said little and i was placed too far away to draw him into conversation for my part i excited little interest and i confess my pride was wounded by it i had anticipated that someone like myself fresh from leiden and padua would have rapidly become the center of attention far from it saying that i did not live in the town and had no position in the church was like confessing to the pox when it became clear i was a catholic two members left the hall and at least one other declined to sit near me i hated to admit it since i had become partial to the english by then but in nearly all respects they were no better than their fellows in padua or venice and apart from the differences in religion and language could have been exchanged for any group of gossiping italian priests without anyone really noticing but if few paid me much attention only one was offensive and my reception was neglectful more than hurtful it was a great shame however that the frostiness came from a gentleman whom i was ready to admire without reservation for dr john wallîs was someone i would dearly have liked to count in my society i knew of him and admired him for his skill in mathematics which placed him amongst the first rank in europe and i had imagined that a man who was the correspondent of mersenne who had crossed mathematical swords with fermat and pascal would have been a man of the broadest civilization alas this was not the case dr grove introduced us and was shamed by the way that wallis refused even normal civility to me rather he stared at me with pale cold eyes that reminded me of a reptile declined to respond to my bow then turned his back on me this was as we were sitting down to eat and grove became excessively cheerful and pugnacious in his conversation to cover up the embarrassment his colleague had caused now sir he said you must defend yourself it is not often that we have an advocate of the new learning amongst us if you are intimate with lower i suppose you must be so i replied that i hardly saw myself as an advocate and certainly not a worthy one it is true though that you seek to cast off the knowledge of the ancients and replace it with your own i said i respected all opinions of worth aristotle he said in a challenging way hippocrates galen i said that these were all great men but could be proven to have been wrong in many particulars he snorted at my reply what advances all that you novelists have done is to find out new reasons for ancient practice and show how a few trifles work in ways other than was supposed not so sir not so i said think of the barometer the telescope he waved his hand in scorn and the people who use them all come to entirely different conclusions what discoveries has the telescope made such toys will never be a substitute for reason the play of the mind upon imponderables but the advances of philosophy i am convinced will achieve wonders i have yet to see a sign of it you will i replied warmly i doubt not that posterity will verify many things that are now only rumors in some age it may be that a voyage to the moon will not be more strange than one to the americas for us to speak with someone in the indies may be as usual as a literary correspondence is now after all to talk after death could only have been thought a fiction before the invention of letters and to sail true by the guide of a mineral would have seemed absurd to the ancients who knew nothing of the magnet that is a most extraordinary flourish grove replied tartly yet i find the rhetoric defective in the suiting of the antitheses and the antipodes for you are wrong sir the ancients did know of the magnet diodorus siculus knew it plainly as any gentleman should be aware all we have discovered is a new use for the stone this is what i mean all knowledge is to be found in ancient texts if you know how to read them aright and that is true in alchemy as in physick i disagree i said thinking i was holding my own quite well for example take cramps of the stomach what is the usual remedy for those arsenic said another further up the table who was listening a few grains in water as a vomit i took it myself last september did it work i know the pains grew worse first i must say i am inclined to believe that letting a little blood was more effective but its qualities as a purgative are undoubted i have never passed so many stools so quickly my master in padua did some experiments and concluded that the belief in arsenic was a foolish error the idea came from a book of remedies translated from arabic and then into latin by deusingius however the translator made a mistake the book recommended what it called darsini for the pains and this was translated as arsenic but arsenic in arabic is zarnich so what should we be taking cinnamon apparently now sir do you defend a long tradition when it can be shown to rest merely on a translators error here this other threw his head back and laughed sending a shower of halfchewed food in an elegant parabola across the table you have justified only the existence of a sound knowledge of classical languages sir he said no more and use this as an excuse to cast away thousands of years of learning so you may replace them with your own feeble scrabblings i am all too well aware of the feebleness of my scrabblings i replied still the most civil person there but i do not substitute merely examine before i accept an hypothesis did not aristotle himself say that our ideas must conform to our experience of things as they are i fear i was becoming reddened with anger by this stage as i was conscious that he was little interested in a discussion in which reason played a part while grove was amiable in his argument this one was unpleasant in tone and in manner and then what do you mean and after you have put aristotle to your proof and no doubt found him wanting then what will you submit the monarchy to your investigations the church perhaps will you presume to put our savior himself to your proofs there lies the danger sir your quest leads to atheism as it must unless science is held firmly in the hands of those who wish to strengthen the word of god rather than challenge it he stopped here and looked around to gather support from his colleagues i was pleased to see that they did not look on with complete enthusiasm although many were nodding with agreement shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it what makest thou grove murmured mildly half to himself but his halfspoken quotation roused the young man who had shown me the way to groves room that morning isaiah he said the price of wisdom is above rubies he added quietly being obviously too young and junior to enter into the contest but reluctant to let the older man speak unchecked i had noticed that he had tried to take part in the conversation on several occasions but each time he opened his mouth grove had interrupted and carried on as if he wasnt there job grove snapped back irritated by the presumption he that increased knowledge increaseth sorrow ecclesiastes thomas ken countered also showing signs of becoming heated i discerned that there was some private squabble here which had nothing to do with me or experiment scorners delight in their scorning and fools hate knowledge proverbs thy wisdom and thy knowledge it hath perverted thee the final sally defeated poor ken who knew that he could not remember the source of the quotation and his face grew red under the public humiliation as he desperately tried to think of a response isaiah grove said in triumph when kens failure was obvious to all ken threw down his knife with a clatter and hands shaking stood up to leave the table i feared that they might come to blows but in fact it was all theater romans he said with icy slowness he withdrew from the table and marched out of the hall his footsteps echoing as he went i believe i was the only person who heard this last comment and to me it meant nothing i always found the tendency of protestants to bandy quotations from the bible a trifle ridiculous even blasphemous anyway grove certainly did not hear but instead looked pleased with himself for having carried the field as nobody else wanted to break the silence i decided as a foreigner and knowing little of what was going on to try to cover over the affair i am not a theologian or a priest i said trying to return the argument to rational grounds but i have studied the medical arts in my way and i know that in many cases physick is as likely to kill as to cure i think it is my duty to find out as much as i can and help my patients the better it is not impious i hope so to do why would i take your word when it differs from the great masters of the past what is your authority compared to theirs small indeed and i reverence them as do you did not dante call aristotle il maestro di color qui sanno but that is not what i am asking i ask you to decide on the result of experiment ah experiment grove said with glee do you hold with the copernican notion that the earth goes round the sun i do of course and you have performed those experiments yourself you have made the observations repeated the calculations and established by your own labors that it is so no i know little of mathematics alas so you believe it is true but you do not know you take copernicuss word for it yes and that of those experts who accept his conclusions pardon me for saying so but it appears to me that you are just as bound to authority and tradition as a man who subscribes to aristotle or ptolemy after all your protestations your science is also a matter of faith not in any way distinguishable from the old learning you so despise i judge by results i said pleasantly for he was clearly enjoying himself and it seemed churlish to spoil his entertainment and by the fact that the experimental method has produced good results this experiment of yours it is the core of the new medicine for example i nodded but how do you reconcile it with the notions of hippocrates which you physicians seem to think are so important i do not need to i said i see no conflict surely you must grove said in surprise for you have to substitute proven treatments for others which might be better but might well be worse rather than trying first and foremost to cure your patients you experiment on them to see what result is obtained you use patients to gain your knowledge not to make them better and that is a sin bartolomeus de chaimis says so in his interrogatorium sive confessionale and he has been seconded by the best authorities ever since clever argument but untrue i said experiment is there to improve treatment for all patients but if i come to you with an illness i do not care for all patients it matters not to me if others are cured when i die proving a treatment does not work i want to be healthy yet you say your wish for knowledge is greater than my need for health i say nothing of the sort there are many experiments which can be carried out without endangering the patient but you are still setting aside hippocrates you are deciding to use treatments not knowing whether they will work or not and that breaks your word think sir of a patient for whom there is no remedy that person will die in that case an experiment which gives the chance of health is better than none at all not so because you might well be hastening death that is not only against the oath it is against gods law and the law of men if it be murder you are saying that no improvement in medicine is permissible we have what we have been given by our forebears and can hope for nothing more i am saying that by your own admission the experimental method is corrupt it was hard but still i remembered my manners perhaps but i treated you today and you show much improvement you may dispute the source but not in this case the result grove laughed and clapped his hands together with pleasure and i saw that he was really only amusing himself seeing how far i could be provoked that is true sir very true my eye is much better and i am grateful to the new philosophy for that and i will trust you on the dangers of any substance you dislike and avoid them entirely but he said with a sigh as he confirmed that his wine glass was empty our meal is over and with it our discussion a pity we must talk more on this during your stay in our university who knows i might even persuade you of the error of your ways or i you i doubt it no one has ever succeeded before but i would be happy to hear you try then everybody stood while a young scholar read out thanks to the lord for the food or maybe it was for having survived it and we all shuffled out grove accompanied me across the courtyard to see me out pausing briefly at the entrance to his stair to pick up a bottle which had been left there splendid he said as he clutched it to his breast warmth on a cold night i thanked him for his hospitality i am sorry if i annoyed either you or your colleague dr wallis i did not intend it grove waved his hand you certainly did not annoy me and i wouldnt worry about wallis he is an irascible fellow i dont think he liked you very much but do not concern yourselfhe doesnt like anyone however he is not a bad man he has offered to visit prestcott for me as you say i should spare my eyes which is kind of him now here we are mr cola he said goodnight to you he bowed then turned rapidly round and marched off to his room and his bottle i stood watching him for a moment surprised by the sudden dismissal so unlike the lengthy formalities of venice but then there is nothing like a north wind in march for curtailing civilities it was not until the next morning that i realized a catastrophe was in the making the earlier part of the day was spent commiserating with lower on the loss of his corpse he took it in good part as he said his chances of getting his hands on prestcotts body had been small so it gave him a little satisfaction to know that the university wouldnt be getting it either besides hed quite liked the lad although he and most of the members of the town did think that the way he had maltreated dr wallis was quite unseemly to explain brieflyand this succinct account was the result of piecing together innumerable accounts until i understood what had happenedthe escape of jack prestcott from the kings justice was partly my doing i had delivered the message about the lad wanting a visitor and dr wallis the very man who had been so rude to me at dinner had gone in groves place because of my medical advice it was a kind act both to grove and to prestcott and i felt ashamed for deriving some small amusement from the result wallis had asked that the prisoner be unshackled so that he might have more ease in prayer and was left alone with him about an hour later still swaddled in his thick black gown and heavy winter hat he had emerged so distressed at the imminent loss of a fine young life that he had scarcely been able to speak merely tipping the jailer two pence and asking that prestcott be allowed an undisturbed nights sleep reshackling could wait until the morning the jailer who would undoubtedly lose his place as a result had obeyed and it was not until after five the next morning that the cell was opened whereupon it was discovered that the person on the little cot was not prestcott but a bound and gagged dr wallis who had so he related been overpowered by the young criminal tied up and stripped of his cloak and hat it had been prestcott who had left the previous evening and who had won as a result nearly ten hours start on any pursuers this intelligence caused a wonderful sensation the population at large of course enjoyed the majesty of the law to be made ridiculous but was aggrieved at the loss of a hanging on balance admiration for the audacity outweighed the disappointment the hue and cry set off to find him but i suspect that most were not wholly displeased when they came back emptyhanded having appointed myself groves physician i was naturally dispatched by lower to examine his eye once more so that i could pick up gossip on the matter however the thick oak door leading to his room was firmly shut and locked and this time there was no reply when i beat on it with my stick do you know where dr grove is i asked of a serving woman in his room there is no answer he must be still asleep i pointed out that it was nearly ten oclock did not fellows have to rise in order to attend chapel was it not unusual for him to be still asleep she was a surly and unhelpful woman so i appealed to mr ken whom i saw walking around the other side of the quadrangle he looked concerned because he said it was groves particular pleasure to take the roll at chapel and persecute latecomers perhaps his illness it was only an inflamed eye i said he was well enough to dine last night what medicine did you give him perhaps that accounts for it i did not like the suggestion that i might be responsible for making him ill if he was so but i hardly felt like admitting that my curewhich i had used as an example of the superiority of experimental medicine the previous eveningwas merely water and eau de cologne i hardly think so but it concerns me is there any way in which we can open this door mr ken talked to the servant and while they went in search of another key i stood outside the door and pounded again to see whether grove could be roused i was still pounding when ken reappeared with a key of course it will be of no use if his own is in the lock you know he said as he knelt down and peered through the keyhole and he will be very angry indeed if he returns to find us here ken i noted looked alarmed at this prospect perhaps you want to retire i suggested no no he said uncertainly we have no love for each other as you may have noticed but in all christian charity i could not abandon him if he were ill you have heard about professor wallis mr ken suppressed a twitch of very unzealous merriment just in time to maintain his somber countenance i have indeed and it shocks me that a man of the church should be treated in such a shameful fashion then the door was open and all thought of dr wallis was banished from our thoughts that dr grove was corpus sine pectore was indisputable and it was apparent that he had died in considerable pain he was lying on his back in the middle of the floor face creased up mouth open with dried saliva dribbling out of one side he had vomited and emptied his guts in his last moments so there was an insufferable stink in the room his hands were clenched so they more resembled claws than human hands with one arm outstretched along the floor and the other at his neck almost as though he had tried to extinguish himself the chamber itself was in total disarray books lying on the floor papers scattered about so that it looked as if he had flailed around violently in his last moments or as lower later pointed out maybe he was just untidy fortunately dead bodies do not trouble me greatly although the shock of seeing this one and the horrible circumstances of its arrangement distressed me but the sight terrified mr ken i halfthought he almost made the sign of the cross and only stopped himself in time to preserve propriety dear lord protect us in our time of sorrows he said with a shaking voice as he saw the outstretched body you he said to the servant run and fetch the warden quickly mr cola what has happened here i am at a loss to say i replied the obvious explanation would be a seizure but the clenched hands and expression of the face would not indicate that it looks as though he was in some great pain perhaps the state of the room is a result of that we looked quietly at the poor mans corpse until the sound of steps on the wooden stairs roused us warden woodward was a small alertlooking man who maintained a great degree of selfpossession when he saw what was within the room he had a small mustache and beard in the old royalist manner but i was told was in fact a parliament man who had hung onto his position not because he was a great scholarthe college paid little attention to thatbut because he was a marvelous man with the money as one fellow remarked he could make a dead pig yield up a perpetual profit and for that the college respected him maybe we should have a more definite opinion before we proceed he said after he heard ken and myself explain what we had found mary he went on addressing the servant who was still standing in the background ears flapping go and find dr bate in the high street if you please tell him it is urgent and that i would be grateful for his immediate attendance i almost opened my mouth to speak here but again said nothing to be passed over so rapidly did not please me but there was little i could do about it my only hope was that my services not required and this a college matter i would not be expelled from a most interesting situation lower for one would find it hard to forgive me if i returned without the story complete in all particulars it seems clear to me the warden said in a definite tone of voice that brooked no contradiction as we waited that the unfortunate man had a seizure i can think of little else to be said we must of course wait for confirmation but i have no doubt it will be forthcoming mr ken one of those obsequious prelates who made a point of agreeing with anyone more powerful than he nodded fervently both of them in fact seemed excessively eager to reach this conclusion but it was mainly because of my sense of pique i think that i ventured my own opinion might i suggest i said tentatively that the particulars of this business be examined more thoroughly before such a conclusion is adopted both looked at me with reluctance as i spoke for example what ailments had the man complained of in the past did he perhaps drink too much the previous evening had he taken some physical exertion which strained his heart what are you suggesting woodward said turning round stonyfaced to confront me i noticed that ken turned pale at my words as well nothing at all you are a malicious man he replied taking me entirely by surprise such an allegation is entirely without foundation for you to bring it up at a time like this is monstrous i know of no allegations nor am i bringing them up i said completely astonished yet again by the unpredictability of the english please assure yourself of my entire innocence on that i simply wondered it is obvious even to me woodward continued vehemently that this was merely a seizure and what is more it is a college matter sir we thank you for raising the alarm but do not wish to trespass further on your time which statement was obviously a dismissal and a somewhat offensive one i took my leave with more politeness than they i had almost finished my tale my fellows in the coffee house enthralled by the account it was after all about the most exciting occurrence to have happened in the town since the siege and as everybody involved was known to my audience doubly interesting for that lower immediately started wondering whether he might offer to examine the body himself we were trying to persuade him that the chances of being allowed to anatomize dr grove were slight and he was protesting that such an idea had never crossed his mind when he looked up behind me and a faint smile flickered across his face well well he said what can we do for you child i looked around and saw sarah blundy standing behind me pale and tired behind her the woman tillyard was coming into the room scolding her for her impertinence she took hold of her arm but sarah threw it off angrily it was clear she had come to see me and so i looked at her coldly as she deserved and waited to hear what it was i knew alreadylower i was sure had talked to her and stated the price of her mothers life either she made amends for her behavior or her mother died it was i think a small fee she dipped her eyes in an attempt to be modestsuch eyes she had i thought very much against my willand said in a low quiet voicemr cola i would like to offer you my apologies still i said nothing but continued to look frostily at her my mother is dying i think please it was dr grove who saved the old womans life then if it hadnt been for the memory of his behavior in exactly the same setting a few days back i would have turned away and made tillyard throw her out as she deserved but i wasnt going to give way so easily this time do you think for a moment i should lift a finger to help her after the impudence you have showered on me she shook her head humbly her long dark hair cascading around her shoulders no she said almost inaudibly so why come i said doggedly because she needs you and i know you are too good a man to abandon her because of my fault praise indeed i thought sarcastically as i made her wait in anguish and suffering a few more moments then as i saw boyle coolly appraising me i sighed heavily and stood up very well then i said she is a good woman and i will come for her sake having a daughter like you must be suffering enough for her i left the table scowled at lowers look of smug selfsatisfaction we walked across the town barely exchanging a word try as i might i could not but feel pleased and not because of having won a cheap victory no my pleasure was due solely to the fact that i could now conduct my experiment and perhaps even save a life i had not been in the cottage more than a few moments before any further thoughts about the daughter dissipated entirely the old woman was pale and restless tossing and turning in her bed in delirium she was also fearfully weak and had a fever at least the wound had not turned gangrenous which had been my worst fear but it was not mending eitherskin flesh and bone were not knitting even though by this time there should have been very distinct signs that natural healing was taking effect the splints still held the bone in place but this was useless if her frail and weakened body would not look after itself i could not make it do so if it refused to act in its own interest i sat back and stroked my chin my brow furrowed as i tried to come up with some other more conventional treatment some drug or some salve which might help the old woman but my mind was a blank i want it understood that i tried to think of all possibilities which would obviate the need for my experimenti did not rush into the attempt recklessly lower was right in saying the project should first be essayed on an animal but there was no time and no alternative that either i or lower when i asked could suggest and the girl knew as well as i did myself how limited were my resources she squatted down on her haunches in front of the fire cupped her chin in her hands and gazed calmly and intently at me for the first time a look of grave sympathy on her at my evident dismay her chances of recovery were not good even before you came she said softly because of your kindness and skill she has lasted longer than i thought possible i am grateful to you for that and my mother has long been prepared for her death do not reproach yourself sir you cannot defeat gods will i looked at her carefully as she spoke wondering whether there was some sarcasm or condescension in her voice so used was i to rudeness from her but there was noneshe was speaking only with gentleness strange i thought her mother is dying and she is comforting the physician but how do we know what gods will is you may be sure of it but i was not brought up so maybe i am supposed to think of something that will aid her if so then you will do so she answered simply i agonized with myself hardly daring to say even to a girl like this who could not possibly even begin to understand what i was proposing tell me she said almost as though she could see my indecision and hesitation for a long time i have been pondering a form of treatment i began i do not know if it would work it might very well kill her more quickly than an executioners blade if i tried it i could be your mothers savior or her killer not her savior the girl said seriously she has no need of another but you could not be her killer either no one who tries to help could be anything but her benefactor whatever the outcome it is the wish to help which is important surely the older you become the more difficult it is to heal a wound i said wishing i had made this point to grove the previous evening and surprised at the wisdom of her remark something a child would shrug off in a matter of days may be enough to kill an old person the flesh becomes tired it loses its resilience and it eventually dies freeing the spirit which abides within the girl still squatting looked impassively at me as i spoke neither shifting restlessly nor showing signs of incomprehension so i continued or it may be that the blood grows old by constantly coursing through the veins until it loses its natural strength and becomes less effective in conveying the nutrients for the heart to ferment the vital spirits the child nodded at this as though i had said nothing that surprised her whereas in fact i had advanced some of the latest discoveries and for good measure added an outlandish interpretation that would already have had my elders shaking their heads in dismay do you understand me child of course she said why shouldnt i it surprises you that i say the blood circulates through the body no doubt that could only surprise a physician she said any farmer knows it how do you mean if you bleed a pig you cut the main vein in its neck the pig bleeds to death and produces soft white meat how else could all the blood come out of one slit unless it was all connected and it moves of its own accord almost as though it is being pumped so must go round and round that is all obvious isnt it i blinked and stared at her it had taken practitioners of the medical art the better part of two thousand years to make this astounding discovery and there was this girl saying she knew it all along a few days ago i would have been furious at her impudence now i merely wondered what else sheand the country folk she mentionedmight know if only people troubled to ask them ah yes very well observed i said thrown off my path as i struggled to remember what id been talking about i looked at her seriously and took a deep breath anyway what i propose is to give your mother fresh new blood to give her the restorative power of a woman very much younger than she it has never been done before never even thought of as far as i know it is dangerous and would be scandalous if it were publicly known and i do strongly consider that it is the only chance your mother has of continuing in this life the poor girl looked stunned at what i had said and i could see a look of strained apprehension on her face well you are the physician sir it is in your hands i took a deep breath realizing that i had halfhoped the girl would start to abuse me again accusing me of flouting the law of god or some such and thus relieve me of the burden i had so cavalierly taken on but i was not to escape my fate so simply i had staked my good character my expertise on what i had said and there was no going back i will have to leave you and your mother alone for a while and go and consult lower whose assistance i will require i will be back as soon as possible i quit the hovel and left sarah blundy kneeling by her mothers bed stroking the old ladys hair and singing a song in a low soft voice a comforting and gentle sound i thought as i left my own mother had sung to me thus when i was ill and stroked my hair in the same way it had reassured me in my illness and i offered up a prayer that it did the same for the old woman i found lower hard at work dissecting a brain such worklater given to the world as his tractatus de cordeoccupied him greatly during his days and he had prepared many fine sketches of its anatomy he was not pleased when i burst in to demand his assistance and again i saw him in bad humor cant it wait cola he asked i dont think it can not for long at least and in return i can offer you one of the most enjoyable of experiments i do not experiment for enjoyment he said curtly i studied his face bent over the table as it was with one of his dark locks of hair hanging over his eye there was a set about the mouth and cheeks that made me concerned that one of the moods of passing blackness was upon him it is also a charity and i beg you not to turn me away for i need help and you are the only person steady and wise enough to give it do not be angry for i promise to repay your kindness tenfold later i have examined widow blundy and there is little time the obsequiousness of my manner disarmed him for he grimaced and with a show of reluctance put down his knife and turned toward me she is as bad as the girls face indicated she is she will die very soon unless something is done we must try the experiment she must be given blood i have examined the almanac the sun is in capricorn which is good for matters of the blood tomorrow will be too late i know you are doubtful of such details but i am disinclined to take risks he growled at me angrily as my manner made it clear that i would brook no refusal and not leave him in peace i am not convinced this is a sound idea but she will die otherwise it is probable she will die in any case so what is there to lose in your case nothing in my case the risk is more substantial my career and my family depend on my making my way in london i dont see the problem he wiped his thin knife on his apron and washed his hands listen cola he said turning to face me when he had finished you have been here long enough to know of the opposition we face think of the way that idiot grove assailed you at new college last night on exactly this question of experimental treatment he has a point you know loath as i am to admit it and there are many worse in a position to do me harm if i give them the slightest chance if i take part in this operation the patient dies and it becomes known then my reputation as a physician will be damaged before my career has even begun you have doubts about the experiment i am proposing i asked trying another approach i have the very gravest doubts about it and you should have as well it is a pretty theory but the chances of the patient surviving the application of it seem small indeed i must admit he said reluctantly making me sure i would win it would be fascinating to try so if there was no fear of it becoming generally known then i would be delighted to assist we can swear the daughter to silence true but you must also swear that you too will say nothing even when you are back in venice if you published a letter saying what had taken place you would land me in the most serious difficulty unless it was all done properly i clapped him on the back have no concerns i said for i am not a publishing man i give my word that i will not say anything unless you give me express permission lower scratched his nose as he thought this over then grimfaced at the risk he was taking he nodded his agreement well then he said let us be about it that is how it happened even now i like to think that he had no occult motive in insisting on this arrangement he was prompted by the simplest selfinterest and i think it was only later that swayed by the siren words of his friends in the royal society he came to prefer fame to honor and advancement to friendship then he exploited my honesty and trust most basely using my silence for his own ends at the time however i was overjoyed and grateful to him for taking such a risk on my behalf to be frank i would have preferred to have conducted my experiment in better surroundings and with more witnesses present to note what we were doing but such an option did not existmrs blundy could not be moved and quite apart from lowers fears finding other qualified persons to participate would have taken too much time so lower and i alone walked seriously and silently back to the little hovel where we once more found the sick woman and her daughter my dear child said lower in his most friendly and reassuring fashion do you understand fully what my colleague has proposed you understand the dangers both to yourself and to your mother we may be linking your souls and your lives together and if it fails for one it may be catastrophic for the other she nodded we are already linked as closely as mother and daughter can be i told her but dont know how much she understood im sure she would refuse because she has always accounted her own life of little value but you must ignore that lower grunted and you cola you wish to proceed no i said doubtful now the moment had arrived but i think we must lower then examined the patient and looked grave i certainly cannot fault your diagnosis she is very ill indeed very well then let us begin sarah roll up your sleeve and come and sit here he gestured to the little stool beside the bed and when she was sat i began wrapping a ribbon round her arm lower got to work uncovering the thin scrawny arm of the mother and wrapped another ribbona red one this time it has stuck in my mindaround her upper arm then he took out his silver tube and two quills and blew through them to make sure there were no blockages ready he asked we both nodded grimly with a neat and experienced movement he slipped a sharp knife into the girls vein and inserted one quill into it with the end pointing against the flow so that the natural movement diverted the blood out into the air then he slipped a cup under it and began to collect the liquid it poured in a ruby red rush into the bowl faster than either of us had anticipated he counted slowly this can hold half a gill he said i will just see how long it takes to fill and then we can guess more or less how much we are taking it filled swiftly so much so that it overflowed and the blood began to splash on the floor one and an eighth minutes lower called loudly quickly cola the tube i handed it to him as sarahs lifeblood began splashing on the floor and i inserted the other quill into the mothers vein the other way around this time so that the new blood would flow in the same direction as her own and not set up turbulence then and with surprising gentleness as the girls blood began to flow copiously out of the silver tube lower moved her over and connected the tube to the quill protruding out of the mothers arm he peered intently at the join it seems to be working he said barely managing to keep the surprise out of his voice and i can see no sign of coagulation how long do you calculate we should wait for eighteen ounces i did the calculations as swiftly as i could while lower counted ah about ten minutes i said make it twelve to be sure then silence fell as lower counted intently to himself and the girl bit her lip and looked worried she was very brave i will say thatnot a sound of complaint or worry came from her throughout the entire proceeding for my part i was in a state of anxiety wondering what the result would be there were no effects either way to start off with fiftynine sixty lower said eventually thatll do out we come and he pulled the tube out and put it on the floor expertly putting his finger over the mothers vein and pulling out the quill i did the same for the girl and then we both busied ourselves in bandaging their arms to stop the bleeding finished he said with satisfaction how do you feel my girl she shook her head and breathed deeply once or twice a bit dizzy i think she said faintly but all right good now you sit down quietly then he turned his attention to the mother no change there he said what do you think i shook my head not better not worse but of course it may take time for the youthful blood to have its effect whatever that effect might be lower murmured normally in a case like this one would recommend a strong emetic but i hardly think that would be wise at the moment i think the only thing to do my dear sir is to sit and wait and hope and pray your treatment will either work or it will not and thats an end of it its too late to change our minds now look at the girl i said pointing out how she had begun yawning mightily she was also pale about the face and complained of feeling lightheaded thats just the blood loss we have tapped her spirit and so she is obviously reduced lie down my girl beside your mother and sleep awhile i must not i have to look after her dont you worry about that cola here will want to watch her progress and i will send someone i know after so we can be informed of any developments so get yourself into bed with her and dont worry what a day cola what a day first dr grove then this i am quite fatigued by the excitement of it all what sarah said what about dr grove hmm oh you know him dont you id forgotten hes dead you know cola here found him in his room this morning the girls composure apparently untouched by the blood loss and even by the thought of her mother dying was affected for the first time by this news she turned even paler than she already was and we noticed to our great astonishment that she shook her head sadly then curled up on the bed and buried her face in her hands very affecting and surprising but i noticed that for all her distress she did not ask what had happened lower and i exchanged glances and quietly decided that there was nothing we could dothe tapping of her blood had weakened her and the starvation of her womb had let slip the humors held in it causing the body to react with all the symptoms of hysteria my friend was splendid revealing a kindness and skill which his flippant exterior did not suggest and which made the darkness of his occasional rage all the more perplexing to me having assured ourselves that there was enough food and heating and acquired warm bed clothing for our patient there was little else to do we wished her well and left i came back a few hours later to see what progress had been made both mother and daughter were asleep and i must say that the mother looked the more at peace by the time i joined lower that evening at mother jeansa woman who ran a cookhouse not far from the high street and offered edible food for only a small amount of moneyhe seemed in a far better mood than he had been earlier and how is your patient he cried from his table as i walked into the small crowded room full of students and the more impecunious of fellows largely unchanged i said as he pushed an undergraduate aside to make room for me she is still asleep but her breathing is easier and her complexion more sanguine so it should be considering he replied but we must talk of this later may i introduce you to a good friend of mine a fellow physician and experimentalist mr da cola i present you to mr john locke a man of about my age with a thin face supercilious expression and long nose raised his head from his platter for a second muttered something and then descended back into the food a brilliant conversationalist as you see lower continued how he can eat so much and remain so thin is one of the great mysteries of creation when he dies he has promised me his body so i can find out now then food i hope you like pigs head tuppence with as much cabbage as you can eat beer a hapenny there is not much left so youd better shout the good mother over how is it prepared i asked eagerly for i was starving i had quite forgotten to eat in the excitement of the day and the prospect of a nice head roasted with apples and liqueur and perhaps with a few shrimp as well made me salivate with anticipation boiled he said in vinegar how else i sighed how else indeed very well lower called the woman over ordered on my behalf and presented me with a tankard of beer from his jug come lower tell me what is the matter you have a look of great amusement on your face he raised his finger to his lips hush he said it is a great secret i hope you are not doing anything tonight what would i be doing excellent i wish to repay you for your consideration in allowing me to assist you this afternoon we have work to do i have received a commission what sort of commission look in my bag i did as i was told a bottle of brandy i said good it is my favorite drink after wine of course you would like some most decidedly it will wash the taste of boiled pigs brains out of my mouth that it would look at it carefully it is half empty very observant now look at the bottom i did as i was told sediment i said yes but there is sediment in wine not in brandy and this has a granular appearance what is it ive no idea what does it matter it came from dr groves room i frowned what were you doing there i was asked to attend mr woodward who is a distant relation of boyleeveryone is a distant relation of boyle as you will discoverasked his advice and he declined to assist on the grounds that this was not an area in which he could claim competence so he asked me to go in his stead naturally i was delighted woodward is an important man i shook my head it was already clear what was going to happen poor grove i thought he never had time to escape to northampton i thought hed called in someone else bate wasnt it lower flipped his fingers contemptuously old grandfather bate he wont even leave his bed if he thinks mars is in the ascendant and his only treatment is leeching and burning herbs it would take his entire training even to see poor old grove was dead no woodward is no fool he wants the opinion of someone who knows what hes talking about and your opinion is thats the clever bit he said craftily i examined the body briefly and decided further investigation was required which i will do this evening in the wardens kitchen i thought you would like to be there locke wants to come as well and if woodward provides some wine we should have a most instructive time it would be a great pleasure i said although are you sure i would be allowed warden woodward did not seem a very welcoming man when we met lower waved his hand dismissively dont worry about that he said you did meet him in distressing circumstances he was offensive i said in accusing me of giving countenance to slanderous tales really which ones i dont know all i did was ask whether the poor man might have undertaken some physical activity woodward turned dark with anger and accused me of malice lower rubbed his chin a faint smile of understanding on his face well well he said maybe it was true then what there was a little scandal this man locke said for he had finished his food now and was prepared to give his attention to other things nothing too serious but someone put it around that grove was fornicating with his servant personally i thought it unlikely given the source of the story was wood what do you mean i asked locke shrugged as though unwilling to continue lower however would have none of this decorum the servant in question was sarah blundy i must say that grove always struck me as an upright man well able to resist the wiles of someone like her locke said and as i say the tale originated with that ridiculous man wood so naturally i discounted it who is wood anthony wood or anthony à wood as he likes to style himself as he has delusions of quality have you not met him dont worry you will he will seek you out and suck you dry an antiquary of the most burrowing sort not so said lower i insist on justice in that field he is a man of excellent abilities maybe so but he is a pernicious gossip and a melancholic little bundle of envy everybody is less deserving and succeeds only through connection im sure he believes jesus only got his job through family influence lower cackled at the blasphemy and i surreptitiously crossed myself now locke you are upsetting our papist friend lower said with a grin the point is that wood lives a monastic life with his books and manuscripts and rather took up with the girl in some way she worked for his mother as a servant and poor wood felt greatly deceived by her locke smiled only wood you see would have been at all surprised by such things he said but he did find the girl a position with grove and then constructed these notions about them as he is malicious he started spreading this around the town with the result that grove was forced to dismiss the girl to guard his good name lower poked him in the arm hush my friend he said for here is the man himself you know how sensitive he is to being talked about oh lord said locke i cant take it not with food i must apologize mr cole cola mr cola i hope to see you later perhaps good evening gentlemen he rose bowed swiftly and headed for the door at an uncivil speed bowing to an absurdly scruffy man shambling toward us mr wood sir cried lower civilly do sit down with us and meet my friend mr cola of venice wood was already about to do so in any case without being asked and squeezed in alongside me so that the smell of his unwashed clothes became quite impossible to ignore good evening sir good evening lower i could see why locke had been in such a hurry not only did the man smell not only was he bereft of any elegance even wearing his spectacles in public as though he had forgotten he was no longer in a library but his presence instantly cast a pall of gloom over what had previously been a jolly table i understand you are an historian sir i said trying to make polite conversation once more yes that must be very interesting are you of the university no another long silence broken eventually by lower pushing back his chair and standing up i have to prepare he said quite ignoring my panicked looks of entreaty that i should not be left alone with mr wood if you would join me at mr stahls in turl street in half an hour or so and with a quiet twitch of amusement which indicated he knew full well the trick he was playing on me lower walked off leaving me with only mr wood for company he i noticed did not order any food rather he collected the plates of the others and scoured them for bits of fat and gristle sucking the bones with a horrible noise he must i thought be very poor indeed i suppose they have told you snide stories about me he said then waved his hand as i rushed to deny it you neednt bother he went on i know what they say it doesnt seem to concern you much i said cautiously of course it does does not every man wish to be held in high regard by his fellows i have heard many worse things said of others wood grunted and attended to lowers plate as the method of cooking had completely killed my appetite i passed him my own which was still laden with food kind of you he said very kind you may consider lower a false friend i said but i may say that he spoke very highly of your skills in the historical way which tempts me to ask what it is that you do he grunted once more and i was afraid that the nourishment might render him too talkative you are the venetian physician i have heard of he said by way of reply venetian but not a real physician i said papist yes i said cautiously but he did not appear about to launch into offensive denunciations you think heretics should burn then pardon i said in some surprise at the gaucheness of his conversation if someone is tempted out of the fold of the true churchyour own or any otherdo you think he should burn not necessarily i said trying to marshal an argument at short notice it seemed best to try to keep him on generalities rather than prying into my private affairs i detest gossip of all sorts he may deserve to lose his life if you follow the argument of aquinas who asked why the counterfeiters of coin should be killed but not counterfeiters of faith but that is rare now i think whatever you protestants may hear i meant burn in hell oh if i am baptized by a heretic priest are the sins of adam remitted he said thoughtfully if i am married by one are my children bastards cyprian said the quality of the sacrament existed ex opere operantis i think so that a heretic baptism would be no baptism at all but pope stephen countered that and said it existed ex opere operato through the merit of the action not the standing of the actor i said so you would be in no great danger if it was done on both sides by men of good intent he sniffed and wiped his mouth why do you ask you believe in mortal sin you papists he continued absently a gloomy doctrine i think less so than your predestination i believe god can forgive anything even mortal sin if he chooses you say men gain or lose their immortal souls before they are even born and god cannot change it what sort of poor thing is that for a god he grunted yet again at this and seem disinclined to engage any further which struck me as odd considering that he had begun the dispute in the first place do you have a desire to become a catholic perhaps i asked wondering if his sally had been prompted by something other than awkwardness and unfamiliarity with decent conversation is this why you ask i think you will have to find someone more learned than myself for that i am a poor churchman wood laughed and i sensed that i had finally chiseled him out of his morbid introspectiona fine triumph i think for there is nothing more persistent than a protestant in a state of melancholy you are indeed sir did i not see you going into a heretic church with mr lower only last sunday i went to a service with him at st marys that is true but i did not take communion although i must say i would have had no trouble doing so you astonish me how can that be the corinthians saw no harm in eating meat offered in sacrifice to pagan idols as they knew the gods not to exist i said and however mistaken they were on other questions i am in agreement with them on that the act is harmless it is willful false belief which is heresy if we are presented with the truth and refuse to accept the evidence of our eyes and ears obviously a sin surely even if it goes against all accepted opinion believing in christ went against all accepted opinion once discerning the truth however is not so easy which is why we must not be too hasty to reject beliefs hallowed by tradition even though we may criticize in private wood grunted that sounds jesuitical to me you would have no objection to my attending a service in one of your churches i would welcome you not that i have any right either to welcome or exclude you are very easygoing i must say but how do you know that the anglican church is heretical for the reasons i give and because it has been condemned as such by the pope oh i see so if a proposition was plainly heretical but had not been condemned would ior youhave liberty to countenance it i suppose it would depend on the proposition i said desperately seeking some way out of the conversation which had suddenly swung back to despondency again but he was a tenacious man and did so obviously want company poor soul that i could not be cruel if you like i will give you an example several years ago i came across a history of heretical movements in the early church you know of course of the phrygian montanus and his assertion that new prophets in every generation would add to the words of our lord condemned by hippolytus but supported by tertullian and commented on favorably by epiphanius and not my point for this history i mentioned talked of a woman follower of montanus called prisca and her sayings have never been condemned as far as i am aware as almost no one knows of them and what did she say that redemption is a perpetual process and in each generation the messiah would be reborn would be betrayed would die and be resurrected until mankind turns away from evil and sins no more and i may say very much more of the same sort of thing a doctrine which has passed from the sight of man you say wood replied strangely more interested in my example than in anything else i had said since i handed him my food not surprisingly it is surely just an unsubtle version of origen who held that christ is crucified again each time we sin it is a metaphor taken literally my point is that despite the fact that no formal condemnation has ever been made there can be no doubt that catholics are obliged to reject it as they are obliged to reject any heathen religion doctrine and liturgy are laid down quite clearly and we must assume that what is not permitted is by definition excluded wood grunted you never rebel against what you are told to believe frequently i said cheerfully but not on doctrine there is no need to do so since it is plainly correct in all particulars your mr boyle believes that when science and religion are in conflict then there is a mistake in the science that is little different from saying that when the individual mind and the church are at odds it is the duty of the individual to learn wherein lies his error i could see that wood was getting far more interested in this conversation than i was and that he was on the brink of suggesting that we go somewhere to drink and continue our most fascinating discourse i could think of nothing i wanted less and so before i was put in the position of having to rebuff him i stood up hastily you must forgive me mr wood but i have a appointment with lower i am late already his face fell with disappointment and i felt sorry for the fellow it is hard to mean so well and try so hard and be kept at arms length nonetheless i would have been more congenial had i the time despite my distaste for his scholarly earnestness and blockish discourse but fortunately i did not have to lie to avoid himmore important matters really did await i left him sitting there finishing my dinner all alone and the only silent person in a room full of merriment and good company this man peter stahl whom lower wished to consult was a german and known to be something of a magician having a fine knowledge of alchemy when in drink he could talk fascinatingly about the philosophers stone eternal life and how to turn base elements into gold for myself i always think that talk is very fine but not as good as demonstration and stahl for all his claims and obscure phrases never conferred eternal life on even a spider as he was not noticeably rich i assume that he never succeeded in turning anything into gold either however as he once said the simple fact that something has not been done is no proof that it cannot be he would accept that such things were impossible only when convinced that matter was immutably imprinted with unique form all the evidence so far he said suggested that it was possible to change base materials into primary elements if you could change acqua fortis into salta simple enough propositionby what reason did someone like myself scoff at the proposition that given the right method it was possible to turn stone into gold similarly all medicine aimed at fending off illness and age and decay some medicines even worked could i then swearand give reasons for my beliefthat there was no ultimate potion which might fend off illness forever after all the best minds of antiquity believed it and there was even biblical testimony did not adam live for years and seth years and methuselah years as genesis said lower had warned me that he was a difficult character and that only boyle could keep him under control his abilities were matched by equal vices as he was a sodomite of the most flagrant variety who delighted in disgusting those who conversed with him he was in his forties at this period and showed the signs of decrepitude that vice brings in its train with heavy lines around a tight mouth full of foully decayed teeth and a hunchedover deportment indicating the suspicion and distaste in which he held all the world he was one of those who considered everybody to be his inferior no matter what their station attainments or quality no monarch was as adept as he at ruling kingdoms no bishop as well versed in theology no lawyer as subtle at preparing a case oddly the one area where his arrogance did not rule was the one where it might have been justifiable which was in his skill at chemical experimentation the other curiosity about him was that although he treated everybody with scorn he gave tirelessly of his time and effort once his curiosity was engaged human beings he could not deal with but set him a problem and he would work to exhaustion although he should have aroused little but disgust i nonetheless developed a cautious regard for the man it was hard to persuade him to assist even though he knew that lower was an intimate of boyle who was at that time paying his wages as we explained the situation he sprawled in a chair and looked contemptuously at us so he is dead he said in his thick accented latin which he pronounced with the oldfashioned weighting and value quite discredited amongst the cognoscenti of italy although the english and others i understand still become passionately heated on the subject does it matter what happened precisely of course lower replied why because it is always important to establish the truth and you think that can be done do you yes stahl snorted then you are more optimistic than i am what do you spend your time doing then i asked i amuse my masters he replied in a disagreeable tone they want to find out what happens if you mix verdigris with oil of niter so i mix it for them what happens if you heat it so i heat it and then try to work out why it happens he waved his hand airily pfaf no we try to work out how it happens not why there is a difference of course a dangerous difference the gap between how and why troubles me greatly as it should you it is a difference that will bring the world down on our heads he blew his nose and looked at me with distaste look he continued i am a busy man you have come here with a problem it must be a problem of chemistry otherwise you wouldnt have demeaned yourself by asking me a favor correct i have a very high opinion of your abilities lower protested ive given you evidence enough of that surely i have been paying you for lessons for long enough yes yes but i havent been overburdened by social calls not that i mind as i have better things to do than talk so if you want a favor of me tell me what it is then go away lower seemed quite used to this performance i probably would have walked out by this stage but he very placidly took the brandy bottle out of his satchel and put it on the table stahl peered at it closelyi could see that he was shortsighted and probably could have done with a pair of spectacles so whats this its a bottle of brandy with a strange slurry at the bottom which you can see as well as i can despite your pretense of being blind we want to know what it is aha was dr grove killed by spirits or by spirits thats the problem is it is their wine the poison of dragons and the cruel venom of asps lower sighed deuteronomy he responded just so and then stood patiently as stahl went through an elaborate display of apparent thought so how do we test this substance even though it is corrupted by the liquid the german thought some more why dont you offer that tease of a servant of yours a glass of this brandy one evening eh solve two problems in one go lower said he didnt think this was a very good idea it would after all be hard to repeat the experiment even if it were successful now will you help us or not stahl grinned showing a range of blackened yellowing stumps that passed for teeth and which might well have accounted for his ugly temper of course he said this is a fascinating problem we need a series of tests that can be repeated and be sufficiently numerous so that it will identify this sediment but first i have to extract this sediment in a usable form he pointed at the bottle i suggest you go away and come back in a few days i will not be rushed perhaps we might start though stahl sighed then shrugged and stood up oh very well if it will rid me of your company he went over to a shelf and selected a flexible tube with a piece of thin glass on the end and inserted this into the open end of the bottle which he placed on the table then crouching down he sucked on the other end of the tubing and stood back as the liquid ran swiftly into a receptacle which he had placed underneath an interesting and useful exercise he observed common enough of course but fascinating nonetheless as long as the second part of the tube is longer than the first the liquid will continue to flow out because the liquid falling downward weighs more than the liquid being required to flow upward if it didnt a vacuum would form in the tube which is impossible to sustain now the really interesting question is what happens if you dont want to suck all the sediment out as well do you lower interrupted anxiously as the level of brandy fell toward the bottom of the bottle i saw it i saw it and stahl quickly whipped the glass tube out and now and now i remove the sediment which must be washed and dried this will take time and there is no reason at all for you to be here just tell us what you plan simple enough this is a mixture of brandy and sediment i shall heat it gently to evaporate the liquid then wash it in fresh rainwater allow it to settle once more again decant the liquid off and wash and dry it a second time it should be fairly pure by then three days if you please not a moment earlier and if you do turn up before then i wont talk to you and so i followed lower back to new college and the wardens lodgings a large pile which occupied much of the western wall of the quadrangle we were taken by the servant into the room in which warden woodward received guests and found locke already there stretched out in conversation by the fire as easy as if he owned the place there was i thought something about the man which could always inveigle his way into the good graces of the powerful how it was i do not know he was neither easy of manner nor particularly good company and yet the assiduity of his attention to those he considered worthy of him was so great that it was irresistible and of course he carefully crafted his reputation for being a man of the utmost brilliance so that these people ended up patronizing him and feeling grateful for it in later years he went on to write books which pass for philosophy although a cursory reading suggests that they do little but carry his bent for flattery onto the metaphysical plane justifying why those who patronize him should have all power in their hands i did not like mr locke his ease and selfassurance in the presence of warden woodward contrasted with the manner of my friend lower who fell into despondency when required to produce the mixture of deference and politeness required for dealing with those greater than he poor man he desperately wanted favor but had not the ability to pretend and his awkwardness was all too frequently viewed as rudeness within five minutes the fact that lower had been asked to examine groves body with locke there merely to observe had been all but forgotten all the conversation passed between the lengthy philosopher and the warden while lower sat uncomfortably by the side his humor sinking as he listened in awkward silence for myself i was gladly quiet as i did not wish to incur woodwards displeasure again and it was locketo give him creditwho rescued me mr cola here was dismayed at your censure of him earlier in the day warden he said you must remember he is a stranger in our society and knows nothing of our affairs whatever he said was perfectly innocent you know woodward nodded and looked at me please accept my apologies sir he said but i was distraught and did not mind my words as i should have done but i had received a complaint the previous evening and misconstrued your meaning what sort of complaint dr grove was being considered for a living and was likely to be given the place but a complaint was lodged only yesterday evening which alleged he was of a lewd way of life and should not be appointed this was the blundy girl was it not locke asked in a wordly disinterested fashion how do you know that locke shrugged common knowledge in the taverns sir not that that fact makes it true of course might i ask where this complaint came from it came from within the fellowship woodward said and more particularly more particularly it is a college matter alone did your complainant give any evidence for the accusation he said that the girl in question was in dr groves room yesterday evening and he had seen her go in he complained lest others see her and bring its reputation into question and was that true i had planned to ask dr grove this morning so she was there last night and grove was dead this morning locke said well well are you suggesting she extinguished his life heavens no locke replied but extreme physical exertion you know may in certain circumstances bring on a seizure as mr cola here so innocently pointed out this morning that is by far the most likely explanation if so then a careful examination will certainly help us and anything more sinister seems unlikely as mr lower says the girl seemed genuinely upset when she was informed of groves death the warden grunted thank you for the information perhaps we had better proceed i have had his body placed in the library where do you want to examine it we need a large table lower said gruffly the kitchen would be best if there are no servants around woodward went off to dismiss the kitchen staff and we went into the next room to examine the body when the house was deserted we carried him across the hallway and into the domestic offices fortunately grove had already been laid out and washed so we were not delayed by that less than agreeable business i suppose wed better begin dont you think lower asked clearing the dinner plates off the kitchen table we took off groves clothes and in the state in which god had created him lifted him up then lower got his saws sharpened his knife and rolled up his sleeves woodward decided that he did not want to observe and so left us to it ill get my pen if you would be so good as to shave his head lower said which i willingly did paying a visit to the closet where one of the servants kept his toiletries and fetching a razor a barber as well as a surgeon lower said as he drew the headfor his own interest only i suspected then he put down the paper stood back and thought for a moment when fully prepared he picked up knife hammer and saw and we all paused a moment in the prayers appropriate for those about to violate and enter gods finest work skin isnt blackened i note locke said conversationally when the moment of piety was over and lower began carving his way through the layers of yellow fat to the rib cage are you going to try the heart test lower nodded it will be a useful experiment im not convinced by the argument that the heart of a poisoning victim cannot be consumed by fire but we should see a slight ripping sound as the layers were finally severed i do hate cutting up fat people he paused awhile as he opened up the midriff and held open the thick heavy flaps of fat by nailing each corner to the kitchen table the trouble is he continued once this was done and he had a clear view inside the book i consulted did not specify whether you were meant to dry the heart out first but you see lockes point about the lack of blackening on the skin do you cola a sign against poisoning on the other hand it is livid in patches you see on the back and thighs maybe that counts i think we must call it inconclusive did he throw up before he died very much so why a pity but ill have his stomach just in case pass that bottle will you and he decanted in a very expert fashion a slimy bloody stinking froth from the stomach into a bottle open the window will you cola he said we dont want to make the wardens lodging uninhabitable people poisoned commonly do vomit i said recalling a case in which my teacher in padua had been allowed to poison a criminal to see the effect the poor unfortunate had died rather unhappily but as he had been due to have his limbs cut off and his entrails burned before him while he was still alive he remained until the end pathetically grateful to my master for his consideration but i believe they rarely manage to expel all of the stomachs contents conversation ceased at this point as lower busied himself transferring stomach spleen kidney and liver to his glass bottles passing comment on all of them as he held each individual organ up for me to see before popping it into its bottle the cawl is yellower than usual he said brightly as the work slowly restored him to good humor stomach and intestines are an odd brownish color on the exterior the lungs have black spots on them liver and spleen much discolored and the liver lookswhat would you say i peered inside at the oddshaped organ i dont know it rather looks as though it had been boiled to me lower chuckled so it does so it does now the bile very fluid runs all over the place and a sort of dirty yellow color most abnormal duodenum inflamed and excoriated but with no traces of natural decay same applies to stomach then i saw him eyeing the corpse reflectively as he wiped his bloody hands on his apron no more i said firmly i beg your pardon i do not know you well sir but already i recognize that look if you are thinking of opening his skull and removing his brain then i must beg you to desist we are after all trying to establish the cause of his death it would be quite illegitimate to go chopping bits off to perform dissections on them and he will be on public view before the funeral remember locke added it would be hard to disguise the fact that you had cut his skull in two it will be bad enough making sure no one sees that his head has been shaved lower clearly considered disputing this but eventually shrugged keepers of my conscience he said very well although medical knowledge may well suffer for your moral stand not permanently i feel sure besides we should be putting him back together again and so we set to work stuffing his cavities with strips of linen to present a good appearance sewing him up then bandaging the wounds in case any fluids should emerge to stain his funeral garb never looked better in my opinion lower said when grove was finally dressed in his best and placed comfortably on a chair in the corner with the bottles containing his organs lined up on the floor lower i saw was determined to have those at least now the final test he took the mans heart put it in a small earthenware dish on top of the stove and poured a quarter pint of brandy over it then he took a splinter of wood and lit it at the stove and thrust it into the bowl a bit like plum pudding really he said tastelessly as the brandy exploded into flames we stood around and watched as the liquid burned and then eventually spluttered out leaving an exceptionally unpleasant odor in the air what do you think i examined dr groves heart with care then shrugged a bit charred over the surface membrane i said but no one could say that it had been consumed even partly my conclusions as well lower said with satisfaction the first real evidence in favor of poisoning thats interesting has anybody ever tried this test on someone who has indubitably not died of poisoning i asked lower shook his head not that i know of next time i have a corpse ill give it a try now you see had young prestcott not been so selfish we could have had a comparison he glanced around the kitchen i suppose we had better clear up a bit otherwise the servants will bolt when they come in tomorrow morning he set to work himself with a cloth and water locke i noted did not assist there he said after many minutes silence in which i had tidied he had washed and locke had puffed on his pipe if you would call the warden we can put grove back but before we do what is our opinion the man is dead locke said dryly how i do not think there is enough evidence to say sticking your neck out as usual cola i am disinclined on the evidence so far to think his death anything but natural and you lower locke asked i would suggest that we reserve judgment until such time as further evidence is forthcoming with a careful warning that we were not to inform anyone of the evenings activity lest too much scandal be excited warden woodward thanked us for our help after we had presented our puny conclusions the relief on his facefor lower had not told him about stahl and he clearly thought the matter was now closedwas selfevident it is the custom of the english to bury their dead with as much speed as they hang them under normal circumstances dr grove would have been interred in the cloister of new college already but the warden had used some pretext to delay the ceremony for a full two days lower used the time granted him to urge stahl to speed while i was left at liberty due to mr boyles absence in london which town had a greater attraction for him since his beloved sister moved there most of the day i used up in attending to my patient and my experiment and the moment i arrived i saw with joy that both were progressing well mrs blundy was not only awake and alert she had even eaten a little thin soup her fever was gone her piss had a healthy bitterness and even more extraordinarily there were the first signs of improvement in her wound little enough to be sure but for the first time i saw that her condition had not deteriorated i was delighted and beamed at her with all the triumphant affection a physician can have for an obedient patient my dear woman i said when i had finished my examination applied some more salve and sat down on the rickety stool i do believe we may yet snatch you from the jaws of death how do you feel a little better thank you praise be to god she said not ready to go back to work yet i fear it is a great concern to me dr lower and yourself have been more than generous but we cannot survive without my earning money your daughter does not earn enough not to keep us out of debt no she has trouble with her work for she has a reputation for being fiery and disobedient it is so unfair a better girl no mother ever had she is sometimes more outspoken than a girl in her position has a right to be no sir she is more outspoken than a girl in her position is allowed to be there was a sudden defiance in her weak voice as she said this although what exactly she meant was not immediately clear to me is there a difference i asked sarah was brought up in a society of the most perfect equality between men and women she finds it hard to accept that there are things forbidden her it was difficult to resist a smirk but i remembered she was my patient and so humored her besides i had undertaken my travels to learn and even though this was far from being useful experience i was broadminded enough then to tolerate it i am sure a good husband would teach her all she needs to know on that subject i said if one can be found for her it will be difficult to find anyone she would accept this time i did laugh out loud i think she should take anyone willing to have her should she not she has little enough to offer in return only herself but that is much i think sometimes we did not do right by her she replied it has not ended as we expected now she is all on her own and her parents are a burden rather than a support your husband is alive then no sir but the calumnies that were heaped on him bear down on her as well i see from your face that you have heard of him very little and i have learned never to believe what i hear when it is bad in that case you are a rare man she said gravely ned was the most loving of husbands and the best of fathers who devoted his life to winning justice in a cruel world but he is dead and i will soon be so as well she has no resources whatsoever no people apart from yourself none neds family was from lincolnshire mine from kent all my people are dead and his were dispersed when the fens were drained and they were thrown off their lands without a penny so sarah is quite without connections what prospects she had were taken by slander and she has spent the small sums she saved for her dowry on me in my illnesses the only thing she will have from me when i die is her freedom shell manage i said cheerfully she is young and healthy and in any case you do me a great disservice i am after all doing my very best to keep you alive with some success i must say you must be very pleased that your treatment worked it is strange how much i wish to live i am pleased to gratify you i think that we may have stumbled on a remedy of unparalleled importance it was a shame that sarah was all that we had available if wed had a bit more time we might have been able to recruit a blacksmith just think if we had given you the blood of a really strong man you might be up and about by now but im afraid the spirit contained in a womans blood will not allow your leg to mend as rapidly perhaps in a week or so we could repeat the treatment she smiled and said that she would submit to whatever i thought necessary and so i left in a high state of good humor and selfregard i met sarah herself trudging through the muddy slush of the lane outside carrying more sticks and logs for the fire even she i greeted with good cheer and to my surprise she responded warmly your mother is doing well i told her i am delighted with her she smiled easily the first time i had seen such an expression on her face god has smiled on us through you doctor she replied i am very grateful think nothing of it i replied warmed by the response it was fascinating besides she is not fully cured yet you know she is still weak weaker than she herself knows and i think further treatment might be useful you must make sure she does nothing that might endanger that i suspect you will find it difficult i will indeed she is much used to activity although the thaw was beginning and the country was slowly emerging from the long dark of winter it was still ferociously cold when the wind got up and i shivered in the gusts of bitter air i must talk to you about these matters i said is there anywhere we could go she told me there was a drinking house around the corner which had a fire and i should go there for herself she would build up the fire and ensure her mother was comfortable then join me the place she indicated was not at all like the spacious elegant coffee house kept by the tillyards nor even like the grand inns that had grown up to service the coaches rather it was a place for the mob and had only the fire to commend it it was owned by an old woman who sold the ale she brewed to local customers who would come in to warm themselves there was no one there but myself and it was obvious it was not a room ever graced by the presence of gentlemen i was regarded with a curiosity which was not friendly when i opened the door and walked in nonetheless i sat myself by the fire and waited sarah arrived a few minutes later and greeted the crone with familiarityshe was welcomed while i was not she was an army woman she said this apparently was meant to be explanation enough and i asked no more how are you i enquired as i was anxious to note the effect of the procedure on the donor of the blood as well as the recipient i am tired she said but that is more than made up for by seeing my mother improve she is also concerned about you i replied that is not good for her you must present a cheerful countenance i do as i can she said although sometimes that is not easy your generosity and dr lowers have been a great boon in recent days do you have employment some i am working again for the wood family most days and in the evenings there is occasionally some work at a glove makers i stitch well although it is hard sewing leather why were you so upset about dr grove instantly i could see the caution come over her face and i feared was about to be subjected to another one of her outbursts so i held up my hand to prevent it please do not think me malicious i ask for a good reason i must tell you that there is some cause for concern about his death and it has been said that you were seen in the college that same evening she still looked stonily at me so i continued half wondering why i was taking such trouble it may well be that someone else will ask you the same questions what do you mean about concern i mean that there is a small possibility that he died of poison her faced turned pale as i spoke and she looked down in thought for a few seconds before staring blankly into my eyes is that so as i understand it he had discharged you from his employ recently true and for no good reason and you resented it very much of course who would not i had worked hard and well for him and never for a moment deserved any reproach and you approached him in the coffee house why i thought he would have had a good enough heart to help my mother i wanted to borrow money from him she looked at me angrily daring me either to pity or criticize and he turned you away you saw that for yourself did you go to his room the night he died does someone say i did yes who says this i dont know answer the question please it is important where were you that is none of your concern we had reached an impasse i could see if i kept on pressing she would walk out and yet she was very far from satisfying my curiosity and what possible reason could she have for not being frank nothing was so important that it was worth encouraging suspicion in any form and she must have known by now that i meant her well i tried one last time but again she blocked my enquiry was there any truth in these stories i know of no stories tell me doctor is someone saying dr grove was murdered i shook my head i dont think so there is no reason to think so at the moment and he is to be buried this evening once that has taken place the matter will be closed certainly the warden genuinely believes i think that there is nothing suspicious about the occurrence at all and you what do you believe i shrugged again i have heard of many men of groves age and appetites dying suddenly of a fit and apart from that it is of little concern to me my main concern is your mother and the treatment i have given her has she passed any stools she shook her head make sure you collect them if she does i continued they will be of great importance to me do not let her up and make sure she does not wash above all keep her warm and if her condition changes at all let me know instantly the funeral service for grove was a solemn and dignified affair which began shortly after darkness had fallen all through the day i imagined the preparations were madethe college gardener excavated a space in the cloister next to the chapel the choir of boys practiced and woodward prepared the eulogy i decided to attend once lower told me he thought there would be no objection grove was after all one of the few people i had known in the town but i insisted on his coming as well there are few things more distressing than being in a religious ceremony and not knowing what to do next he grumbled about it but eventually agreed the regime in new college i gathered was not greatly to his liking when it beganthe chapel full the attendant priests in vestmentsi could see why from his point of view you will have to explain i said in a whisper during a lull in the proceedings what the difference between your church and mine is i must say i can discern very little lower scowled there is none here why they are not open and pronounce their obedience to the whore of babylonapologies colai do not know they all want to the scoundrels there were i guessed about half a dozen or more of lowers persuasion and not all were as well behaved as he thomas ken the man who had disputed with grove over dinner sat ostentatiously through the whole service and talked loudly during the requiem dr wallis who had been so rude to me sat crossarmed and with the disapproving quietude of the professional cleric a few more even laughed at the most solemn moments earning them illtempered looks from others if the ceremony concluded without degenerating into an open fight i thought at one stage then we would be fortunate somehow though it came to an end without scandal and i thought that i could almost feel the relief in the air as woodward pronounced the final blessing and led the way white stick in hand out of the chapel and around the cloister to the open grave the body was moved over the gaping hole and held up by four of the fellows woodward was preparing the final prayer when there was a scuffling from the back i looked at lowerboth of us were sure that tempers had finally boiled over and groves last moments above the earth were to be tarnished by doctrinal dispute a few of the fellows were scandalized and turned round with angry looks a murmur ran through the congregation as their numbers were forced aside to let through a portly man with gray whiskers a thick cloak and a look of acute embarrassment what is this about woodward said turning away from the grave to face the interloper this burial must stop the man said i nudged lower and whispered in his ear whos that whats going on lower dragged his attention away and whispered sir john fulgrove magistrate then bade me keep silent you have no authority in this place woodward continued in matters of violence i do there has been no violence perhaps not but i am obligated by my position to satisfy myself i have received an official notice that murder may have been done and i am bound to investigate you know that as well as i do warden a loud murmur went up once the word murder was mentioned woodward stood stock still in front of the grave as though protecting the body from the magistrate in fact he was protecting his college there is no question of murder i am quite satisfied the magistrate was uncomfortable but determined to stand his ground you know that once a complaint is received then it must be properly investigated the fact that this death occurred inside the college is of no importance your privileges do not extend that far you cannot exclude me on such a matter nor can you dispute my writ i order that this funeral cease until i am satisfied with the eyes of the college and a good part of the university upon him woodward swayed to and fro as he considered how best to respond to this open challenge he was not ordinarily a man to hesitate for a moment but on this occasion he took his time i will not cede to your authority sir he said eventually i do not accept you have any right to enter this place without my consent nor to interfere with college business i am satisfied there is no cause for your presence and that i could in law order you out the audience looked pleased at this statement and sir john bridled with indignation having thus satisfied the proprieties and made sure he conceded no ground on matters of principle woodward submitted after a fashion yet perhaps you have testimony of which i do not know if violence has been done it is the duty of the college to know the truth i will hear what you have to say and postpone the interment until i have done so if i find your complaint to be without justification it will continue whether you agree or not there was a murmur of appreciation at what lower later told me was a masterly defensive retreat from an untenable position and while it continued woodward ordered the body to be taken back to the chapel then he escorted the magistrate out of the cloisters and to his lodgings well well lower said softly as the two men vanished through the narrow archway which led to the main quadrangle beyond i wonder who is behind this what do you mean a magistrate can only act if someone complains to him that a crime has been committed then he must investigate to see whether the complaint is justified so who went to see him it cannot have been woodward and who else had an interest as far as i know the man had no family i shivered we are not going to find out standing here i pointed out you are right how about a bottle in my rooms at christ church then we can see if we can figure it out we made little progress despite much talk and more wine the question of who went to see the magistrate was as unresolved when we awoke the next morning as it was when we left new college the only thing i learned was that the canary wine the english prefer leaves a wicked remembrance the next morning i slept with lower being too shaky to return to my own bed by the end of the conversationwhich soon left the topic of grove and ranged widely over the whole field of curiosity in particular he returned again to the idea of spirit and whether it was susceptible to investigationa notion which was of importance for the theory underlying my blood transfusion i suppose he said reflectively we may posit the existence of your life spirit in the blood from the existence of ghosts for what are they but the spirit released from the body and i cannot bring myself to doubt these manifestations for i have myself seen one really when i replied only a few months ago he said i was in this very room and heard a noise outside the door i opened it up as i was expecting a visitor and there was this young man very curiously dressed in velvet with long fair hair and carrying a silken rope i said hello and he turned and looked at me he didnt reply but smiled sadly then walked down the stairs i didnt think much of it but went back inside my guest arrived a minute or so later i asked him whether he had seen the strange youthhe could hardly have failed to do sobut he said no there had been no one on the stairs at all later the dean told me that a young man had killed himself in hed left his room on my staircase walked to a cellar on the other side of the college and hanged himself with a silken rope hmm hmm indeed i merely point out that this is one of the rare occasions when the best theories of science and practical observation coincide very well it is why i do not dismiss your a priori notions out of hand although i do not rule out the possibility that another explanation might account for widow blundys improvement to dismiss an explanation you have in favor of one you do not have seems foolish i said but i must point out that you are assuming that the spirit which maintains life is the same as that which survives it he sighed i suppose i am although even boyle has not yet thought up an experiment to discover what that spirit is assuming it has some physical existence it would get him into a great deal of trouble with the theologians i said and he seems concerned to maintain the best relations with them sooner or later that will come my friend replied unless we scientists are to confine ourselves solely to material things and what would be the point of that but you are right boyle is unlikely to take such a risk i cannot but think it a fault in him but then your mr galileo has shown the risks of annoying men of the church what do you think of him of course lower had heard of this celebrated case and it was much discussed at padua when i was there for galileo had been in the pay of venice until tempted away to the court of florence by medici pomp he made many enemies thereby which stood him in no good stead when he came into trouble for saying the earth went round the sun even though his fall had occurred almost before i was born it had frightened many of the curious and made them think carefully before they spoke but it annoyed me that lower should refer to it for i knew what his opinion would be and that he would twist the facts to attack my church i have the highest respect for him of course i said and the episode grieves me i am a man of science and count myself a true son of the church i believe firmly with mr boyle that science can never contradict true religion and that if they seem at variance then that is due to our faulty understanding of one or the other god gave us the bible and he gave us nature to show his creation it is absurd to think he might contradict himself it is man who fails someone is wrong in this case then lower said clearly i replied and no one seriously believes the popes advisors were anything but misguided but signor galileo was at fault as well possibly more than they he was a difficult and arrogant man and erred greatly in neglecting to show how his ideas were in conformity with doctrine in truth i do not believe there was any contradiction there was a failure to understand and that had the direst consequences not the intolerance of your church then i think not and would say it is proved that the catholic church is more open to science than the protestant every significant man of science yet has been raised in the catholic church think of copernicus vesalius torricelli pascal descartes our mr harvey was a good anglican lower objected a little stiffly i thought he was but he had to come to padua for his training and there formulated his ideas lower grunted and raised his glass in salute at my reply youll make cardinal yet he said a judicious and political response you believe science is obliged to prove itself i do otherwise it sets itself up as an equal to religion not its servant and the consequences of that are too awful to contemplate you are beginning to sound like dr grove no i replied after a moments thought he thought us frauds and doubted the usefulness of experiment i fear its power and ambition and concern myself lest its power should make men arrogant i could have grown angry at his remarks but i felt disinclined to argue and lower himself was not really trying to provoke anyway he continued with men like grove in our church who are we to condemn they have less power to cause trouble than your cardinals but they would do so if they could he waved his hand to dismiss a topic he had tired of tell me how is your patient is she truly living up to the theories you have heaped upon her shoulders i smiled contentedly she is bearing them marvelously well i said there are very distinct signs of improvement in her and she tells me she feels better than she has since she fell in that case i drink to monsieur descartes lower said raising his glass and to his disciple the eminent dr da cola thank you i said and i must say that i suspect you of having more regard for his notions than you say lower raised his finger to his lips shh he said i have read him with interest and profit but i would as soon own to being a papist as a cartesian an odd way of finishing a conversation but that was how it ended without even a yawn lower rolled overtaking the one thin blanket with him and leaving me shiveringand fell fast asleep i thought aimlessly for some time and did not even notice when i similarly succumbed to the embrace of lethe neither of us had woken when the messenger came from stahl to say that his preparations were complete and if we wished to attend on him at our earliest convenience we could witness his experiment i cannot say that i felt up to a meeting with the irascible german in my drugged and shaky state but lower reluctantly concluded that it was our duty to do our best god knows i dont feel like it he said as he washed his mouth out and straightened his clothes before attacking a piece of bread and a glass of wine for his breakfast but if this has become a magistrates matter then we will need to present our findings properly not that he is likely to pay us much attention why not i asked with some curiosity in venice physicians are regularly called to give their opinion in england as well your honor in my opinion this man is dead the presence of a knife in his back indicates an unnatural death as long as it is kept simple there is no problem shall we go he stuffed more bread in his coat pocket and held open the door im sure you do not really want to miss it much to my surprise stahl seemed almost happy to see us when we dragged ourselves up his stairs and walked into his cramped and smelly lodging off turl street a quarter of an hour later the prospect of demonstrating his ingenuity and skill to an appreciative audience was too much to resist although he did his best to be churlish everything was readycandles bowls bottles of various liquids six little piles of powderthe stuff which he had extracted from the bottleand chemicals lower had purchased and sent round to him now i hope youre going to behave yourself and not waste my time prattling he glared at us while lower assured him that we would observe as quietly as possiblea statement which neither he nor stahl believed for a moment the preliminaries done stahl settled down to work as an example of chemical technique it was fascinating to watch and while he talked i found my distaste slipping away in admiration at his ingenuity and methodical approach the problem he said waving at the piles of powder was perfectly simple how do we determine what this sediment drawn from the brandy bottle is we can look at it but that demonstrates nothing as many substances are white and can be reduced to powder we can weigh it but considering the amount of impurities present that would prove little we can taste it and compare the taste to other things but that operationquite apart from the fact that it might be dangerouswould help little unless it had a unique and recognizable taste from mere visual evidence we cannot say more than that the sediment is a whitish powder so he said warming to his theme we must test it a little furtherif for example we dissolved it in a little sal ammoniack the mixture might respond in several waysit might change color or it might give off heat or it might effervesce the powder might dissolve or float or sink still solid to the bottom of the liquid if we repeated the experiment with another substance and it reacted in a similar fashion could we then say that the two were the same i was about to reply in the affirmative when he waved his finger at us no he said of course not if they reacted differently then indeed we might conclude that the two substances were not identical but if they reacted in the same fashion all we could say was that they were two substances which when mixed with sal ammoniack responded in the same way he paused while we digested this then resumed once more now you are thinking he said how can we possibly ascertain what this material is and the answer is simplewe cannot i told you this last week whatever you may think there can be no certainty we can only say that accumulated evidence indicates the strong likelihood that it is such and such a substance i had not yet had much experience of law courts in england but i knew that if someone like stahl went into a venetian trial and spoke like that the side he was supporting might as well abandon all hope so how do we do this he was asking rhetorically waving his finger in the air we repeat the experimentation again and again and if after every repeated experiment the two substances match in their reaction then we can conclude that the chances of their not being the same shrink to the point where to maintain they are different is unreasonable are you with me i nodded lower didnt bother good he said now i have in the last few days performed my experiments on a dozen or more substances and have reached my conclusions i am prepared here only to demonstrate them have not the time to go through the whole process with you i have here glasses containing five different substances and we will add our powder one by one to all five then begin the process of comparison now the first is a little spirit of sal ammoniackhe poured a small amount of powder in as he spokethe second contains lixivium of tartar then spirit of vitriol spirit of salt and lastly syrup of violets i also have here a piece of hot iron i hope you see the logic of this dr lower lower nodded perhaps then you would explain to our friend here lower sighed this isnt a lesson you know i like people to understand the experimental method too many doctors do not they merely prescribe potions without the slightest reason to think they might work lower groaned then gave way what he is doing he said is subjecting the powders to all variants of matter as you know the essential principles of natural things are salt and earth which are passive and water spirit and oil which are active the combination of ingredients he has chosen consequently covers all of these and should provide an overall picture of every variety of matter he is also testing heat which is quite illogical of him as he does not believe that fire is a natural element stahl grinned no i do not the idea that all matter contains a quantity of fire which can be released on heating i find unlikely however this is quite enough chatter if your friend has got that into his pretty little head we might begin he peered at us closely to see he had our attention then rubbed his hands together and picked up the first bowl holding it to the light so we could see clearly the sal ammoniack first of all you see it has produced particles of a pale sediment with no other apparent movement hmm he handed it over for our inspection and we agreed that the other substance he was showing us produced the same result now lixivium of tartar a white cloud in the middle of the liquid suspended equidistantly between the surface and the bottom again the other substance behaved in the same fashion vitriol a precipitation producing hard crystals forming on the side of the glass a matching result again salt he paused and examined the bowl carefully a slight creamy precipitation but so slight you might miss it entirely violets how pretty a tincture of pale green most attractive two of them in fact as my chosen substance has produced the same result i hope you are beginning to be convinced he grunted at us in a satisfied fashion then picked up a pinch of each powder and threw them separately onto the redhot iron we watched as they hissed and gave off thick white fumes stahl sniffed at them then grunted again no flame in either case slight smell ofwhat would you saygarlic he poured some water on the iron to cool it down then casually tossed it out of the window so it could lie on the ground and not poison us and there we are we neednt waste any more time we have now run a total of six separate tests and in each case the material you brought me in the brandy bottle reacts in the same way as this substance here as an experimentalist of chemistry gentlemen i offer you my opinion that the material in the bottle is indeed unlikely not to be the same yes yes said lower finally losing patience but what is this other substance of yours ah said stahl the crucial point my apologies for my little piece of drama it is called white arsenic formerly used as a face powder by the more foolish and vanitous of women and quite deadly in large quantities i can prove that as well for i did one other test i have notes on all this by the way he said as he opened up two paper packages two cats he said picking the creatures up by the tails one white one black both perfectly healthy last night when i caught them i fed one two grains of the powder from the bottle and the other the same amount of arsenic both dissolved in a little milk both beasts are as you see quite dead youd better take both of them stahl continued as you appear to have been delving into dr groves intestines you may want to have a look at theirs as well you never know we thanked him profusely for his kindness and lower gripping a tail in each hand wandered off to the laboratory to anatomize the beasts and what is your opinion of that he asked as we strolled along the high street in the direction of christ church once more having established that the substance in the bottle was indeed arsenicor to be correct that it consistently behaved like arsenic and never behaved unlike arsenic so that it could reasonably be said to be arseniclikeand moreover that a cat when fed the substance died in a manner very similar to the way that a cat fed with arsenic died we were but one step away from an alarming conclusion fascinating i said ingenious and thoroughly satisfying in both method and execution but i must reserve my final opinion until we have seen inside those cats the syllogism you obviously have in mind is as yet incomplete arsenic in the bottle and grove dead but did arsenic kill grove you are quite right but you suspect as well as i what conclusions the cats intestines will indicate i nodded we have everything to suggest grove was murdered except for the one necessary factor which is i asked as we trailed through the unfinished and unworthy entrance to the college and walked through the vast but equally unfinished quadrangle we dont have a reason and that is the most important thing it is stahls problem with the why and the how if you like there is no point working out how it was done if we cannot say why fact of crime and motive for committing it are all that is neededthe rest is unimportant detail cui prodest scelus is fecit he who profits by villainy has perpetrated it ovid seneca i believe i said a little impatiently that you are trying to say something i am just as stahl can work out how chemicals mix with each other but has no idea why so it is with us we now know how grove died but we do not know why who might possibly have wanted to take so much trouble to kill him causa latet vis est notissima i quoted back and was pleased for once to have foxed him the cause is hidden suetonius but the effect is clear ovid again you should know that one we have at least established factif the cats are as we suspect the rest is not in our field he nodded considering your method of reasoning about your blood i find that strange you have completely reversed yourself in one case you had a hypothesis and saw no need for prior evidence in this case you have the evidence and see no need for a hypothesis i could just as easily say that you have done the same besides i do not dismiss the need for explanation i merely say that it is not our job to formulate it that is true he conceded and maybe my discontent is vanity but i feel that unless our philosophy can also answer the important questions as well it is unlikely to change much both why and how if science confines itself to how then i doubt it will ever be taken seriously do you wish to attend the cats i shook my head i would love to but i should go and see my patient very well perhaps you will join me at boyles when you have finished and this evening i have a great treat we must not allow ourselves to become overburdened by experiment diversion is also necessary i think by the way i wish to ask you something and that is periodically i make a circuit of the countryside boyle mentioned it when you arrived if you remember as i cant practice in the town i have to go outside to earn a little money and i am very short at the moment it is a christian charity and quite profitable which is a fine combination i set up a room on market days hang out a sign and wait for the pennies to roll in i was going to leave tomorrow there is to be a hanging out aylesbury way and i want to bid for the corpse would you like to come there will be more than enough work for both of us you can rent a horse for a week see the country can you pull teeth i bridled at the idea certainly not i said no its easy ill be taking some pliers and you can practice if you wish thats not what i meant i mean that i am not a barber forgive me for saying so but i risk my fathers wrath in acting the doctor and there are depths to which i will not sink for once lower was not offended youre not going to be much use then he said cheerfully listen i am going to towns of a few hundred souls at most villagers come from miles around and they want full treatment they want to be bled purged lanced have their piles rubbed and their teeth out this isnt venice where you can send them to the barbershop next door youll be the only properly trained person they will see for another year unless some wandering charlatan passes through so if you come with me you leave your dignity behind as i will no one will see and i promise not to tell your father they want a tooth out you reach for the pliers youll enjoy it youll never have such appreciative patients again what about my patient i really dont want to come back to find her dead lower frowned i hadnt thought of that but she doesnt need any attention does she i mean you cant do much except wait and see whether she lives and if you gave her more treatment that would spoil the experiment thats true i could ask locke to look in on her i noticed you didnt take to him much but hes a fine fellow really and a good physician well only be away five or six days i was doubtful and did not want someone like locke informed of my work although as i knew lower had a high regard for the man i refrained from saying so let me think about it i said and ill tell you this evening fine now these cats await me and then i suppose we ought to see the magistrate to tell him what we have discovered not i suspect that he will be very interested thus three hours later we knocked on the door of the magistrates house in holywell to inform him that as far as the opinion of two doctors was concerned dr robert grove had died of arsenic poisoning the stomachs and entrails of the cats were quite definite on this point there was absolutely no difference between them and in addition the excoriation closely matched that which we had noted in groves own the conclusion was inescapable by any theoretical approach whether it be that of monsieur descartes or lord bacon sir john fulgrove saw us after only a very short delay we were ushered into the room he used as his study and as an impromptu courtroom for deciding minor matters he seemed a worried man which was no great surprise someone like woodward could make life very unpleasant for any lay official even a magistrate who incurred his wrath investigating a death was tantamount to alleging murder sir john now had to come up with a convincing case to lay before the coroners court and for that he needed someone to accuse when we told him of our investigations and conclusions he leaned forward in his chair straining to understand what we were saying i felt quite sorry for him the matter was after all exceptionally delicate to his credit he questioned us closely both as to our methods and the logic of our conclusions and made us explain several times the more complicated procedures until he understood them properly it is your belief then that dr grove died as a result of drinking arsenic dissolved in the bottle of brandy is that the case lowerwho did all of the talkingnodded it is yet you will not speculate as to how the arsenic came to be in the bottle could he have put it there himself doubtful he had been warned only that evening of its dangers and said he would never use it again as for the bottle mr cola here might be able to assist on that point so i explained how i had seen grove pick up the bottle at the foot of the stairs as he escorted me to the gate i added however that i was not certain it was the same bottle and naturally i did not know whether the poison was already in it yet is this poison used medicinally you were treating him mr cole cola lower explained how it was sometimes used but never in such quantities and i said how i had done little more than wash away the medicine he was using so that the eye might heal itself you were treating him you dined with him that evening and you were probably the last person to see him before he died i agreed evenly that this might well be the case the magistrate grunted this arsenic he continued what is it exactly it is a powder lower said derived from a mineral composed of sulphur and caustic salts it is both expensive and often quite difficult to find it comes from silver mines in germany or it can be made by subliming orpiment with salts in other words thank you the magistrate said holding up his hands to fend off one of lowers lectures thank you what i mean is where is it obtained do apothecaries sell it for example is it part of the materia medica of physicians oh i see on the whole i think physicians do not keep it about them it is used only rarely and as i say it is expensive ordinarily they would apply to an apothecary when it was needed thank you indeed the magistrates brow furrowed in thought as he considered what we had just told him i do not see how your information valuable though it might be could possibly be of use should this ever come to a trial i understand its value of course but i doubt that a jury would you know lower what these men are like often enough if a case depended on such flimsy stuff they would be certain to acquit whomever we charged lower looked displeased but admitted that sir john was correct tell me mister cole cola cola you are italian i believe i said i was a doctor yourself i replied that i had studied physic but was not qualified and had no intention of practicing for a living my father i continued did not want you are familiar with arsenic then i did not for one moment suspect where this line of questioning was leading and i answered cheerfully enough that i was indeed and you admit you were possibly the last person to see dr grove alive possibly soplease forgive me for speculatingso if for example you put the poison in yourself and gave it to him when you arrived for dinner there would be no one to query your account sir john surely you are forgetting something lower said mildly which is unless you can advance a reason for a deed you cannot attribute it and logic rules out the existence of that reason mr cola has only been in oxford only in this country in fact for a few weeks he had only met grove once before that night and i must say i am willing to vouch absolutely for his good character as i am sure would the honorable robert boyle were he here this reminded the man of the absurdity of his line of questioning i am glad to say although it did not restore him to my esteem my apologies sir i did not mean to cause offense but it is my duty to investigate and naturally i must ask questions of those near the events that is quite understandable no apologies are needed i assure you i replied with little sincerity of spirit his remarks had alarmed me considerably so much so that i came close to pointing out the fault in his logicwhich was that i was not necessarily the last person to have seen grove alive for someone had seen sarah blundy it appeared going into his room after i had left him at the gate i was aware however that if an italian and a papist would have been the ideal candidate for a murderer then the daughter of a sectary of loose morals and a fiery temper would have been an adequate replacement i had no desire to extricate myself from suspicion by pointing an accusing finger at her she was i thought capable of such a thing but apart from gossip there was little to suggest any involvement i felt quite justified in remaining silent until that situation changed eventually the magistrate gave up trying to say more and levered himself out of his chair you must excuse me i have to see the coroner and alert him then interview some other people as well as placating warden woodward perhaps dr lower you would be kind enough to tell him what you told me i would be happier were he convinced i was not acting out of malice toward the university lower nodded reluctantly and went off to discharge his obligation leaving me free to do as i pleased for the rest of the day i was mindful that despite such excitements as the death of dr grove it was merely a distraction from my proper business which was above all to see to my family affairs although i have dwelt little on it in this narrative i had been hard at work and mr boyle had kindly done even more for me the news however was dispiriting and i had little or nothing to show for my labors boyle had as he promised consulted a lawyer friend of his in london and he had advised that i would be wasting my time in pursuing the matter without concrete proof of my fathers ownership of half the business there was no chance of persuading a court to grant title to half the property i was best advised to write off whatever assets had been lost rather than using up more capital in a hopeless quest so i immediately wrote to my father and told him that unless he had some relevant documents in venice it seemed the money was lost forever and that i might as well return home the letters written sealed and dispatched in the kings post i did not care if they were read by the government so decided against the extra expense of sending them privately i returned to mr crosses shop to pass the time in conversation and prepare a bag of medicines in case i should decide to accompany lower although i was already minded not to do so i dont want to go but if you could have them ready for tomorrow morning just in case crosse took my list and opened his ledger at the page listing my previous purchases i will look them out for you he said there is nothing particularly rare or valuable so it is no great labor for me he looked up at me curiously for an instant as though he was about to say something then thought better of it and consulted the ledger once again do not concern yourself about payment i said im sure lower or even mr boyle will vouch for my credit of course of course there is no question of that something else concerns you pray tell me he thought some more and busied himself arranging vials of liquid on the counter for a few seconds before making up his mind i was talking to lower earlier he began about his experiments over dr groves death ah yes i said thinking that he wanted more gossip from those in a position to offer interesting tittletattle a fascinating man that mr stahl if a little difficult are his conclusions sound do you think i can see no fault in his method i replied and his reputation speaks for itself why do you ask arsenic then that is what caused his death i can see no reason to doubt it at all do you disagree no not at all but i was wondering mr cola here he hesitated once more come on man out with it i cried cheerfully something is clouding your spirit tell me what it is he was about to speak then changed his mind and shook his head oh its nothing he replied nothing of any consequence i was simply wondering where the arsenic might have come from i would hate to think it came from my shop i doubt we will ever know i replied besides it is the job of the magistrate to find out what he can so i am told and no one would blame you in any case i would not worry yourself about it he nodded you are right quite right then the door swung open and lower accompanied i was sad to see by locke swept into the shop both were dressed up in their finest coats and lower was again daring to wear his wig i bowed to both of them i have not seen two finer gentlemen since i left paris i said lower grinned and bowed back an awkward movement as he was still unsure enough to hold his wig in place with his hand as he did so the play mr cola the play what play the one i told you about or did i forget the entertainment i promised are you ready are you not excited the whole town will be there come along it starts in an hour and unless we hurry we wont get the best seats his good humor and air of urgency swept all other matters from my mind instantly and without so much as a further thought about mr crosse and his air of vague concern i bade him good afternoon and accompanied my friend out into the street going to a play in england for any person of sensibility who has been exposed to the refinements of italian and french theater is something of a shock and more than anything else reminds one how very recently this race of islanders has emerged from barbarism it is not so much their behavior although the vulgar in the audience were perpetually noisy and it must be said some of the betterborn were far from quiet this was due to the wild enthusiasm that the troupe of players generated it was only a few years since such events had been allowed once more and the joy of having some novelty to witness had sent the entire town into a frenzy the very students it seemed had been selling their books and blankets to buy tickets which were outrageously expensive nor was the production so dreadful although it was fearfully rustic reminiscent more of carnival burlesque than the theater proper rather it is the type of play which the english admire that reveals what a crude and violent people they really are it was written by a man who had lived not far from oxford who alas had clearly neither traveled nor studied the best authors for he had no technique no sense of plot and certainly no decorum thus the unities which aristotle rightly taught us ensure that a play remains coherent were jettisoned almost from the first scene far from taking place in one location it began in a castle i think then moved to some moor then to a battlefield or two and ended up with the author seeing if he could place a scene in every town in the country he compounded his error by jettisoning the unity of timebetween one scene and another a minute an hour a month or as far as i could see fifteen years could pass without the audience being informed also missing was the unity of subject as the main plot was forgotten for long periods and subsidiary tales taken up rather as though the author had taken pages from half a dozen plays tossed them into the air then stitched them together in whatever order they fell to earth the language was worse some i missed as the actors had no sense of declamation but instead talked as though they were in a room of friends or in a tavern of course the true actors way standing still facing the audience and seducing them with the power of beautiful rhetoric was scarcely appropriate as there was little beauty to deliver instead what they had on offer was language of breathtaking foulness at one scene in particular where the son of some nobleman pretends to be mad and frolics on an open heath in the rain then meets the king who has also gone mad and has put flowers in his hair believe me i am not joking i quite expected the ladies to be hustled out by protective husbands instead they sat there with all signs of enjoyment and the only thing which caused a frisson of shock was the presence of actresses on stage which no one had seen before finally there was the violence god only knows how many were killed in my opinion it quite explains why the english are notoriously so violent for how could they be otherwise when such disgusting events are presented as entertainment for example a nobleman has his eyes put out on the stage in full view of the audience and in a fashion which leaves nothing to the imagination what possible purpose could be served by this gross and unnecessary coarseness except to insult and shock in fact the only real interest in the proceedingswhich dragged on so long that the final scenes were played out in blessed darknesswas that it presented me with a panoramic view of local society as virtually no one was able to resist the temptation to dabble their fingers in the muck that was on offer mr wood the gossip was there as were warden woodward and the severe cold dr wallis thomas ken was there as were crosse locke stahl and many others i had seen in mother jeans and there were many more not even mentioning the students whom i had never seen but who were well known to my friend during one of the frequent interruptions in the proceedings for example i saw a thin haggard man try to talk to dr wallis that gentleman looked angry and embarrassed then turned abruptly away oho said lower watching with interest how times do change i begged an explanation hmm oh i suppose you dont know he said his eyes still riveted on the scene being played out before him how could you tell me what do you think of that little man do you think it is possible to read character from physiognomy i believe so i said if it is not then a large number of face painters are wasting their time and telling us lies interpret away then we can experiment to see the usefulness of the doctrine or the level of your skill well i said carefully studying the man once more as he walked humbly back to his place and without complaint took his seat i am no artist and am not trained in the matter but he is a man in his late forties with the air of one born to serve and obey not a man who has ever held authority or power not favored by fortune although not poor a gentleman but of a lowly sort a good start lower commented continue not a man used to imposing himself with none of the manner or standing of one who might cut a dash in the world rather the oppositehis demeanor suggests someone who will always be overlooked and ignored aha any more one of natures supplicants i said warming to my theme now you can see from the way he approached and the way he suffered his rebuff clearly he is accustomed to such treatment lower nodded excellent he said a truly useful experiment was i correct let us say it was an interesting set of observations ah the play is beginning again splendid i groaned inwardlyhe was right and the players were coming on once more fortunately for the denouement i could have done better myselfrather than a morally pleasing resolution the king and his daughter die just at the moment that any reasonable playwright would see that they must live for there to be any moral instruction in the play at all but of course by then everyone else is dead as well and the stage a virtual charnel house so i suppose they just decided to follow suit for want of anyone to talk to i emerged rather dazed not having seen so much blood since we anatomized dr grove fortunately lower suggested an inn immediately afterward as i needed a stiff drink to recover i did not even demur when locke and wood decided to join usnot my idea of ideal company but after such a performance i would have taken a drink with calvin himself had it been necessary by the time wed walked across town and settled down in the fleurdelys lower had told locke of my comments about the mans demeanor which produced nothing more than a sneering smile if im wrong you should tell me how i said a little heatedly not liking at all to be used for sport in this fashion who was this man go on wood you are the repository of all human gossip you tell him clearly pleased to be included in our company and relishing his moment of attention wood took a sip of his drink and called over to the serving hatch for a pipe to be brought lower added his call for one as well but i declined not that i object to a little tobacco in the evening especially when my bowels are tight but sometimes pipes which have been overused by the general clientele of taverns do have a taste of sour spittle most do not mind i know but i find it unpleasant and only smoke from my own well wood began in his pedantic fashion when he was refilled with ale and safely alight this little man who is so much one of lifes failures so much a natural servant so much a supplicant is in fact john thurloe he stopped here for dramatic effect rather as though i should be impressed i asked him a bit more sharply than was strictly necessary who exactly was john thurloe never heard of him he said with an air of amazement many in venice have and almost everywhere else in europe for near ten years that man murdered stole bribed and tortured his way across this land and others he onceand not so very long agoheld the fate of kingdoms in his hand and played with monarchs and statesmen as though they were mere puppets he paused again and finally realized that he wasnt being clear he was cromwells secretary of state he explained as though talking to a child truly the man irritated me his spy master responsible for keeping the commonwealth secure and cromwell alive a task he accomplished with great success for cromwell died in his bed while john thurloe was there no assassin ever got close he had spies everywhereif ever there was a conspiracy by the kings men john thurloe knew about it before they did themselves he even planned some of their plots himself i am told just for the pleasure of destroying them as long as he had cromwells confidence there were no controls on what he could do at all none at all it was thurloe they say who lured jack prestcotts father into betraying the king that little man i said in astonishment but if thats true what is he doing walking around and going to plays surely any sensible government would have hanged him as quickly as possible wood shrugged unwilling to admit to not knowing something a mystery of state but he lives quietly a few miles from here by all accounts he sees no one and has made his peace with the government naturally all those who swarmed around him when he had power no longer even remember his name including john wallis evidently ah yes wood said his eyes twinkling including him dr wallis is a man with an instinct for power he can smell it i am sure the first inkling a man of state has of his downfall is when john wallis stops paying court everybody likes tales of dark and obscure happenings and i was no different woods tale of thurloe gave an insight into the kingdom either the returned king was so secure that he could allow such people their freedom without fear or he was so weak he could not bring them to justice it would have been different in venicethurloe would long ago have been devoured by the adriatic fishes and this man wallis he intrigues me but i found out no more as a young man i recognized as the magistrates servant came to our table and stood there stiffly until lower put him out of his misery by asking him his business i am looking for mr cola and dr lower sir we acknowledged ourselves and what do you want sir john requires your immediate presence at his house in holy well now asked lower both of us it is past nine and we have not even eaten i believe it cannot wait it is a matter of the utmost urgency the lad replied never keep a man waiting if he has the power to hang you locke said encouragingly youd better go the house on holywell seemed warm and inviting as we arrived and waited in the hallway before being ushered in to the interview room once more the fire blazed in the open hearth and i warmed myself before it conscious again of how cold the country was in winter and how underheated were my own lodgings i was also i realized formidably hungry the magistrate was decidedly stiffer than he had been only that morning once the formalities were over he led us into the little room and sat us both down you work very late sir john lower said amiably not through choice doctor he replied but this is a matter which cannot wait it must be serious then it is indeed it concerns mr crosse he came to see me this afternoon and i wish to check his credentials as he is not a gentleman although no doubt eminently trustworthy in all respects examine away then what about old crosse he is as good a man as i know and gives false weight only rarely and then only to customers he does not know he brought his ledger of sales from his shop the magistrate said which shows quite clearly that a substantial quantity of arsenic was bought four months ago by sarah blundy a serving girl of this town i see blundy was discharged by grove for illbehavior on that same day the magistrate continued she comes from a violent family forgive me for interrupting lower said but have you asked the girl perhaps she has a perfectly straightforward explanation i have after i talked to mr crosse i went straight there she said she bought the powder on dr groves instructions which may be true it would be difficult to contradict it may be so i intend to see if dr grove kept a ledger the cost of the powder was near a shilling and an item that expensive might well have been noted you can vouch for crosse he is of good character and unlikely to bear false witness out of malice oh no in that respect he is utterly trustworthy if he says the girl bought arsenic then the girl bought arsenic lower said did you accuse the girl directly no sir john replied it is too early for that you think it a possibility maybe so might i ask why neither of you mentioned to me the report that she had been seen entering dr groves room that night it is not my job to report tittletattle lower said sternly nor yours to repeat it sir it is not that sir john replied warden woodward told me and brought mr ken to repeat his accusation ken i asked are you sure he was telling the truth i have no reason to doubt him i am aware he and dr grove were at odds but i cannot believe he would lie on such an important matter and what did the girl say she denied it of course but she also would not say where she was i remembered that she would not tell me either and my heart filled with foreboding for the first time even the most terrible immorality after all would be worthwhile owning if it diverted suspicions such as these so what could the girl have been doing assuming that is she was not lying to cover her guilt in which case it will be her word against kens lower said his word will naturally carry the more weight the magistrate pointed out and from the gossip i have heard it seems the girl had a reason however perverted for such a deed do i understand that you are treating the mother mr cole i nodded i recommend that this cease instantly you should have as little contact with her as possible you are making an assumption about her culpability i said alarmed at the turn the conversation was talcing i believe i can see the beginnings of a case but culpability is not my task i am glad to say the mother still needs a doctor i said i did not add that my experiment required constant attention as well im sure some other physician will do i cannot prohibit you but i beg you to think of the awkwardness the subject of dr grove will undoubtedly be raised should you encounter the girlif she is responsible she is bound to want to know how the investigation is progressing and whether you suspect what was done you would then be placed in the position either of dissimulating which is undignified or giving away information which might cause her to flee i could see the sense of that at least but if i suddenly stop attending that might arouse her suspicions also in that case lower said cheerfully you will have to come with me on my tour it will get you out of the way and the girl will not suspect your absence as long as you come back mr lower will you stand surety for your friend ensure his return to oxford lower agreed readily and by the time we left the house the matter had been settled between them without my being consulted in any way the next day it seemed i would leave on tour and lower would persuade locke to attend to my patient and take whatever notes were required on her condition this inevitably meant telling him what we had done which made me uneasy but there was no alternative he went off to find his friend and i returned heavy at heart and alarmed by the turn of events to my lodgings despite its inauspicious beginnings the medical journey of the next week initially proved to be of great value to my troubled state of mind i discovered that in only a brief space of time the atmosphere of oxford had settled on me rendering me as melancholic as most of its inhabitants there is something about the place a dampness which is oppressive to the spirits which bears down most powerfully on the soul i have for long had a theory about the weather which if god spares me i would like to develop one day i do believe that the wetness and grayness of the climate will forever preclude the english from making much of a stir in the world unless they abandon their island for more sunny climes transport them to the americas or the indies and their character is such that they could rule the world leave them where they are and they are doomed to sink in lassitude i have personal experience of this in the way in which my normally cheerful temperament became dampened by the experience of residing there nonetheless finding myself astride a horse on what seemed like the first day of spring after a long hard winter in the open countryside that begins the moment you cross the old dangerouslooking bridge after the college of st mary magdalen was a wonderful tonic moreover the wind had finally shifted from the north to the west removing the ill effects of this most deadening of airs i must add that the prospect of having nothing to do with sarah blundy or the corpse of robert grove for a few days also helped lower had organized the expedition well in advance and rushed me off that first morning pushing the horses hard until we arrived in late afternoon at aylesbury in the next county we put up in an inn where we rested ourselves until the execution the next morning i did not attend taking little pleasure in such spectacles but lower didthe girl he said made a wretched speech and quite lost the sympathy of the crowd it had been a complicated case and the town was by no means convinced of her guilt she had killed a man whom she said had raped her but the jury judged this a lie because she had fallen pregnant which cannot occur without the woman taking pleasure in the act normally her condition would have spared her the gallows but she had lost the child and also any defense against the hangman an unfortunate outcome which those who believed in her guilt considered divine providence lower assured me his attendance was necessary a hanging is a detestable sight but one of his many fascinations was when exactly the moment of death occurs this related directly to our experiments with the dove in the air pump most of those hanged asphyxiate slowly at the end of the rope and it was a matter of some considerable interest to himand to physick in generalhow long it takes for the soul to depart he was he assured me a considerable expert in the matter for this reason he positioned himself next to the tree to take notes he also got his corpse once he had tipped the officials and paid a pound to the family he had it carried to an apothecary of his acquaintance and after he prayed in his fashion and i in mine we began work some anatomization we performed therei took the heart while he cracked open the skull and drew some delightful sketches of the brainthen we jointed the rest and placed the portions in several large vats of spirit which the apothecary undertook to deliver to crosses shop he also wrote a letter to boyle telling them the vats were on their way and should on no account be opened i dont know that he will be so very pleased he said once he had washed his hands and we had retired to the inn for food and drink but where else could i send them my college refuses to have corpses on the premises for any length of time and if i sent it to anyone else they might well practice on it before i returned some people have no shame in these matters as for the rest of our trip there is little point in going into details the patients came in thick and fast once we had established ourselves in the various inns on our route and i returned ten days later sixtyfive shillings the richer the average fee was four pence nobody ever paid more than one and sixpence and when i was paid in kind i had to sell the various geese and ducks and hens at a discount to local traders we ate one goose but i could hardly return to oxford with a farmyard menagerie trailing behind me all this should give an idea of how many patients i treated i will retell the events of one day because they were of significance this was in great milton a small settlement to the east of oxford to which we had repaired because a distant branch of boyles family owned a property there assuring us a comfortable bed for the night and a chance of ridding ourselves of the lice which we had acquired over the previous days we arrived about seven in the morning and went straight to our separate rooms at the nearby inn while the innkeeper sent a messenger around the village announcing our presence we had barely prepared ourselves when the first patient arrived and by the time he had been dealt with lower lanced a boil in his fundament to which treatment he responded with rare good humor there was a queue forming at the door that morning i extracted four teeth drained several gallons of blood fancy notions about therapeutic efficacy get you nowhere in the country they wanted their blood let and that was what they were determined to have bound wounds tasted piss applied salves and took in seven shillings a brief pause for lunch and then we were off again lancing sores wiping pus setting joints and taking in eleven shillings and eight pence throughout all of lowers grand theories about the new medicine were abandoned the patients were not interested in the benefits of iatrochemical potions and were disdainful of innovation so instead of prescribing careful concoctions of mercury and antimony we rebalanced humors like the most hidebound of galenists and consulted the stars with a fervor worthy of paracelsus himself anything which might work for we had not the leisure to consider novel approaches nor the reputation to apply them both of us were exhausted by the end and even so we had to skulk out the back of the inn to avoid still more patients waiting their turn the old couple in charge of the house had promised us a hot bath when we introduced ourselves at midday and i was eager to take up the offeri had not immersed since the previous autumn and felt that not only could my constitution stand it my morale would be immeasurably lifted i went first taking the brandy bottle with me so as to save time and felt very much better when i emerged lower was less carefree about bathing but the itching in his skin from the lice was such that even he decided to take the risk i stretched out in a chair while lower took his turn in the tub and was almost asleep when mrs fenton the servant told me that there was a message for me brought by a servant from the nearby priory i groaned this sort of thing happened all the time the gentry and families of higher quality would want to avail themselves of the services of a passing physician but naturally found it beneath them to wait with the rabble so they would send a message desiring our presence we attended on them rather than the other way around and charged heftily for the privilege lower invariably took most of this trade he being english and wanting to make connections for the future and i was happy to allow him that task this time however he was in the bath and in any case the servant said quite pointedly that my services in particular were desired i was flattered yet again amazed at the speed with which news travels in the countryside and quickly fetched my bag i left a message for lower that i would return in due course who is your master i asked wanting to make polite conversation as we walked back up to the main street of the village then down a smaller road to the left my teachers had often recommended this courseby careful questioning of servants it is often possible to reach a full diagnosis even before you see the patient thus earning a wondrous reputation this time the technique was of little use as the servant an old but powerfully built man did not reply at all indeed he said not a single word until we had walked all the way up to a mediumsized house on the outskirts of the village gone through the large door and i had been shown into what the english call a parlor a public room for the reception of guests here he broke silence asked me to sit and disappeared and so i did waiting patiently until the door opened and i found myself in the presence of europes foremost murderer if mr woods tales were to be believed good evening doctor john thurloe said to me in a quiet melodious voice as he came into the room it was kind of you to come although i could study him properly for the first time nonetheless i stood by my original assessment even knowing his reputation he still did not at all look like any sort of evil tyrant he had watery eyes that blinked as if unused to the light and the meek expression of one who wished desperately to be treated with kindness if pushed i would have placed him as a gentle prelate eking out a quiet but worthy existence in a poor parish forgotten by his betters but woods description had penetrated my mind and i found myself gaping almost awestruck you are dr cola are you not he went on as i said nothing i eventually managed to reply that i was and ask him what was his trouble ah not a problem of the body thurloe said with a faint smile more a problem of the soul you might say i ventured that this was hardly my area of expertise indeed not but you may be able to render some assistance may i be frank with you doctor i spread my hands as if to say well why not good you see i have a guest who is sorely troubled i cannot say that he is welcome but you know how it is with hospitality he is cut off from the society of his fellow men and finds my company insufficient i cannot blame him for this as i am not an interesting conversationalist do you know who i am by the way i am told you are mr thurloe lord cromwells secretary of state that is correct anyway this guest of mine needs information which i cannot provide and he tells me that you might be able to help he had completely lost me of course so i said i would willingly oblige but surely i continued great milton was not so very cut off from civilization thurloe did not reply directly i understand you knew a gentleman by the name of robert grove a fellow of new college recently deceased is that correct that thurloe should have heard of this amazed me but i said that yes i did i hear there is a question mark over the matter of his death would you care to tell me the circumstances i could see no reason why i should not so i summarized everything that had taken place from lowers investigations to sarah blundys conversation with me and the magistrate thurloe sat impassively in the chair as i talked hardly moving at all an air of the most complete tranquillity upon him i could barely tell whether he was listening or was even still awake i see he said when i had concluded so if i understand you correctly when you left oxford the magistrate had questioned this blundy girl but no more i nodded does it come as a surprise to learn that she was charged with the willful murder of dr grove two days ago and is now in prison awaiting the assizes it would astonish me i replied i did not know the english law worked so swiftly do you believe the girl is guilty what a question one which i had asked myself on many occasions during my journey i do not know that is a matter for law not reason he smiled at this as though i had made some cutting remark lower told me later that he had been for many years a lawyer before the rebellion had swept him into office in reason then tell me what you think the hypothesis is that sarah blundy killed dr grove what evidence is there there is a motive in that he discharged her from his employ although many servants are discharged and fortunately few take such revenge she acquired arsenic on the day she was discharged she was in new college on the evening of dr groves death and was reluctant to own it certainly the evidence supports the hypothesis proposed your method has a weakness though you do not mention all the evidence only that which supports the hypothesis as i understand it other facts support an alternative which is that you could have killed him as you were the last person to see him alive and also had access to the poison had you wanted to kill him i could have but i know i did not and i had no reason to do so any more than dr wallis had or lower or boyle he accepted this pointalthough why i was telling him i did not knowand nodded so it is the combination of different qualities of facts which you believe important and you conclude that she is indeed guilty no i replied i am very reluctant to do so thurloe affected to look surprised but surely that goes against the scientific method you must accept it until you have an alternative hypothesis i accept it as a possibility but would be reluctant to act on it unless it was more secure he stood up slowly in the way the old are forced to do by the stiffness of their joints please help yourself to a glass of wine doctor i will return to discuss this matter further in a short while i revised my estimate of him as i poured myself a glass an order is an order however mildly it is giventhurloe i decided was gentle because he had never needed to be other it never occurred to me to say that lower was expecting me that i was hungry or that i saw no reason to kick my heels waiting on his pleasure i stayed where i was for half an hour or more until he returned with him when he finally came back was jack prestcott his jail cell and shackles now a mere memory grinning with embarrassment as he followed thurloe into the room ah he said brightly as i stared at him in outright astonishment for he was the very last person i ever expected to see again let alone in such circumstances the italian anatomist how do good doctor thurloe smiled sadly at both of us then bowed i will leave you both to a discussion he said please do not hesitate to call me if required and he left the room leaving me to gape idiotically prestcott a burlier man than i remembered and certainly more cheerful than he had been on our last meeting rubbed his hands poured himself a glass of ale from a jug on the sideboard and sat down in front of me scrutinizing my face to see if there were any danger signals you are surprised to see me good im glad to hear it you must admit this is a pretty good hiding place dont you think whod think of looking for me here eh he certainly seemed to be in good spirits very much like someone who had not a care in the world rather than a man faced with the prospect of imminent hanging and what i wondered was he doing in the house of a man like thurloe simple enough he said my father and he were acquainted after a fashion i threw myself on his mercy we outcasts must stick together you know so what do you want you are taking a risk announcing your presence to me are you not we shall see thurloe told me what you said but would you mind going through the matter again which matter about dr grove he was good to me and the only person in oxford i had an affection for i was sorely grieved when i heard what had happened considering how ill you would have used him had he visited you the evening of your escape i find that difficult to credit oh that he said contemptuously i didnt hurt wallis by tying him up and i wouldnt have hurt old grove but what is a man to do die on the scaffold to avoid being uncivil i had to escape and this was my only opportunity what would you have done i would not have attacked someone to start with i replied he brushed the point aside now think a minute thurloe tells me that the magistrate hovered ominously around you for a moment what if he had clapped you in ironsas he might have done you know for a papist would be a popular choice what would you do sit tight and hope the jury was sensible or decide they are likely to be a bunch of drunken goodfornothings who would hang you for the pleasure of it i may be a fugitive but at least i am alive except that groves death concerns me and i would help if it were possible for he was kind to me once and i revere his memory so tell me what has been going on again i went through the story prestcott proved a more appreciative audience twisting about in his chair getting up to refill his glass punctuating my remarks with loud exclamations of approval or dissent eventually i concluded my tale for the second time and now mr prestcott i said sternly you must tell me what this is about what it is about he said is that i now understand a good deal more than i did a few moments ago the question is what am i to do about it i cannot advise you until i know what you mean prestcott took a deep sigh then looked me straight in the eye you know the blundy girl was his strumpet i said i had heard the story but added that the girl did not admit it of course not but its true i know because we went together briefly last year before i knew what she was then she moved onto grove and seduced him poor old man into her clutches it was simply done he had an eye for prettiness and she can be very compliant when she puts her mind to it she was furious when he dismissed her i came across her just afterward and believe me i have never seen such a terrifying countenance in my life she looked like a devil and was snarling and spitting like an animal he would pay for it she said and pay dearly meaning he shrugged i thought it just womanly excess at the time anyway shortly after i had my regrettable experience and ended up in jail so i lost contact with the outside world until i escaped when i walked out of the castle i had not a clue what to do next i had no money no proper clothes nothing and i thought id better hide lest the alarm was raised so i went to the blundys cottage i had been there before and knew it he had slipped quietly up the muddy alleyway to sarahs door and peered through the window it was quite dark inside and he assumed that no one was there he rummaged around to see if there was any food he could take and was eating a crust of bread when sarah returned she had an exhilaration which frightened me he confessed she was surprised to see me of course but when i told her i wouldnt hurt her and didnt intend to stay long she relaxed she had a small bag with her and as i thought it might have some more food in it i took it from her she let you have it not exactly i had to force it from her and i take it there was no food there no there was money and a ring groves signet ring he said then paused to rummage in his pocket he took out a small packet of crumpled paper which he unwrapped carefully inside was a ring with a carved blue stone in the center i remember it well he continued once i had taken it to examine ive seen it on his finger on innumerable occasions as he never took it off i was curious how sarah blundy came by it she refused to answer so i beat her until she snarled that it was none of my business and in any case grove wouldnt need it any more she said that grove wouldnt need it any more yes prestcott said i had other things on my mind so didnt pay that much attention at the time now of course it all seems quite important the question is what to do i can hardly offer my testimony as the magistrate will thank me kindly then hang me as well so i was wondering if you would take this ring and my story once you have gone back and spoken to sir john fulgrove i will be long gone with luck i thought hard clutching the ring in my hand and astonished by how much i did not want to believe what i was hearing you give me your word that what you are telling me is true absolutely he replied promptly and frankly i would have more sympathy if you were not also of a violent disposition yourself i am not he said coloring slightly and raising his voice and i resent the remark everything i have done was to protect my own and my familys name there is no similarity between my case which is an affair of honor and hers which is lust and theft sarah blundy will do this again believe me doctor she acknowledges no laws and no restraints you do not know her or her sort as i do she is wild i admitted but i have also seen her polite and dutiful when she wishes he said dismissively but she is entirely without a sense of duty to her betters that you must have discovered for yourself i nodded it was certainly true and i thought once more of my hypothesis i wanted further evidence of unimpeachable veracity and now i believed i had it prestcott had little to gain in coming forward indeed he potentially had much to lose it was difficult not to believe him and he spoke with such an intensity that it was hard to imagine he was not telling me the truth i will talk to the magistrate i suggested i would not say where you are but merely recount the story he is a trustworthy man i think and keen to conclude this matter swiftly many in the university resent his interference and your witness would be of great use to him it may be that he will look kindly on you you must take mr thurloes advice on this of course but i would advise against precipitate flight prestcott considered this maybe but you must promise me that you will be careful i am terribly afraid if someone like lower knows where i am he will give me up he is obliged to do so i promised him this with great reluctance and if i did not keep my word for reasons i will explain at least i can say that it did prestcott no harm myattempt to keep quiet however led to a sad deterioration in my relations with lower as my absence with what he assumed was a valuable and lucrative client led him once more into jealous despondency i have met people who would turn so to some degree but i have never met anyone like lower whose humor would change on the instant without warning or good reason twice now he had lashed out and vented his temper on me and i had endured it out of friendship the third time was worst and the last like all the english he drank prodigious amounts and had thus occupied himself in my absence so was violent in mood when i returned when i entered the house he was sitting by the fire clutching himself as though to keep warm and staring blackly at me when he spoke he spat his words as though i was his worst enemy where in gods name have you been tempted though i was to recount everything i replied that i had been to see a patient who had summoned me you have reneged on our agreement that i was to have such patients we had no agreement i said astounded although i am happy for you to have them but you were bathing i would have dried myself and the patient would have been no use to you that is for me to decide then decide now it was john thurloe and as far as i could see he is in perfect health lower snorted derisively you dont even lie well dear god how i am sick of your company with your foreign ways and mincing speech when do you go back home i shall be glad to see the back of you lower what is the matter dont pretend you are concerned about me the only thing you are interested in is yourself i have shown you real friendship took you in when you arrived introduced you to the best people shared my ideas with you and see how you repay me and i am grateful i said beginning to grow angry now truly grateful and have done my best to earn what i have been given have i not also shared my ideas with you your ideas he said with total contempt those arent ideas those are fancies idle nonsense with no foundations dreamed up merely to amuse yourself that is completely unfair you know it i have done nothing at all to earn your anger but my protests were of no use at all as with the last time what i said was of no importance when the storm burst it had to blow itself out and i could do no more to calm it than a tree caught in a tempest this time however i grew angry and resentful and rather than seeking to mollify him i felt more keenly his unfairness and fought against his rage i will not repeat what was said except to say that it was too much lower grew angrier and i still unable to fathom the cause became equally heated all i know is that this time i was set on resisting him and this determination drove him to more extravagant fits of fury i was he said a thief a charlatan a fop a papist a liar untrustworthy and deceitful like all foreigners i preferred the knife in the back to the way of honesty i was planning to set up in london as a physician he said and my strenuous insistence that i fully intended to leave england as swiftly as possible only made him more furious under any other circumstances honor would have demanded that i call him out and i suggested this earning myself more sneers eventually i withdrew exhausted and hungry for we did not stop to eat while we battled i went to bed deeply saddened for i had liked him and realized now that friendship was forever impossible his society had brought me advantage that is certainly true but the cost i was forced to pay was too great i was certain that my father when he received my letters would give me permission to leave and i decided that perhaps it would be best to anticipate that grant i was however determined to complete the experiment i had undertaken with mrs blundy if the woman survived and i could demonstrate its efficacy then at least i would reap something more than bitterness from the sojourn the following morning lower was of course all contrition and apology but this time it was of no use our friendship was breached beyond repairfides unde abut eo nunquam redit as publius syrus put it now that i had determined to leave i was less inclined to make the accommodations that such a reconciliation required and though i accepted his apologies in form i could not do so in my heart i believe he realized this and our journey back to oxford was full of silence and uncomfortable conversation i missed our ease greatly but could do nothing to retrieve our comradeship lower i think felt ashamed of himself for he knew that he had acted unpardonably as a result he showed me constant little kindnesses to win his way back into my favor and fell into melancholy when his efforts went unrewarded one thing though i was obliged in honor to do for even though i had given my word to prestcott i considered my obligation to lower the greater i knew little of the law but i knew that i had to inform him of what had transpired at mr thurloes house as it would have been improper for him to hear it from the magistrate or tavern gossip he listened gravely as i recounted the tale and you didnt tell me do you realize what youve done what you have made yourself as guilty as them you may hang now if prestcott is ever caught did that never occur to you no but what was i to do he thought i dont know but if the magistrate decides he wants prestcott and he has fled then you will be in trouble do you believe him i cant imagine why not he had nothing to gain it is not as if i would have discovered him had he not summoned me besides there is dr groves ring sarah blundy will have to explain how she came by that you are sure it is his no but if it is someone will be able to identify it what do you think lower considered i think he said after a while that if the ring is his and if some way can be found for prestcott to say his testimony then it will hang the girl do you believe she is guilty i would be happier to have seen her in his room pouring arsenic into the bottle or to hear it from her own lips as mr stahl tells us there is no such thing as certainty but i am coining to think it probable she was responsible both of us hesitated then as we realized at the same moment that we were slipping back into intimacy and instantly an awkwardness intervened at that moment my mind was made up for i realized i could never talk to him with ease lest he explode once more lower knew well what was going through my mind and fell glumly silent as the horse clopped along the muddy road i am sure he felt he could do no morehe had apologized for his past words and could see no need to excuse those he had not yet spoken i have already mentioned that my opinion of the theater in england was not high the tale tedious the acting dreadful the declamation poor not so with the courts which supplied all the pomp and drama that the theater lacked being also better produced and more convincingly expressed the spectacle of an assize is not to be matched anywhere on the continent not even the french who love the grandiose have such an awful display in their justice the essence of the grandeur lies in the fact that justice is mobile while small crimes are dealt with by magistrates more important cases are dealt with by the kings representatives sent out from london at regular intervals these patrol the country in circuit and their arrival is attended by much circumstance the mayor awaits the procession at the borders of the town the local landowners send carriages to drive behind and the people line the streets as the carriages wend their way to the courthouse where convoluted proclamations are read out which give the judges authority to hang as many lawbreakers as they please perhaps i ought to explain here the way the english deal with such matters their method being as singular as many other proceedings in that country one would have thought that a learned judge would have been sufficient as it is everywhere else but this is not the case for having appointed such a person they give all his power to a group of twelve men chosen at random and utterly ignorant of all law what is more they are inordinately proud of this most bizarre system and hold this jury in awe as the bedrock of their liberties these men listen to the arguments in court and vote about the verdict the case is normally presented by the person who brings the prosecution or in the case of murder by family or by a magistrate who acts on behalf of the king in this case grove having no family the magistrate was bound to prepare the suit at the public expense the preparations for the assizes are many and the cost considerable which is why the high street was all but clogged with people when we returned i was fascinated by the spectacle but it merely put lower into an ill humor it was late in the day neither of us had eaten and we were in two minds whether to stop for nourishment or to proceed straight to sir john fulgroves house in holywell we decided on the latter not least because i was also anxious about mrs blundywhatever her daughter had done she was still my patient and my hope of fame and i was anxious to be free of lowers company sir john saw me promptlyan aspect of the english law i greatly admire i have had little to do with our venetian magistrates but i know that they believe the grandeur of the law is served by making everything as inconvenient as possible he also listened to my story with interest though little gratitude his demeanor indeed had changed greatly in the period i had been away and he demonstrated none of that agreeable condescension which i had received before it was your duty to report this matter immediately to those in authority he said thurloe is a traitor and should have been hanged years ago and you now tell me he is harboring fugitives why the man thinks he is above the law entirely from what i hear i said quietly he is sir john scowled it is intolerable that this should continue he is in open rebellion against the kings government and yet it does nothing i do not wish to defend him i said as if half of what i have heard is true then he should be hanged forthwith but in this case i do not think he believes mr prestcott truly guilty of the crimes of which he is accused and by keeping him close by he has surely done a service if the man has important testimony about dr grove the magistrate grunted do you think this tale unimportant i asked no of course not the girl is going to stand trial she is she will answer the case on the last day of the assizes on what charge petty treason what is that grove was her master it matters not that she was discharged because it was as her master that he was killed that is treason because a master is as a father to his children or the king to his people it is the worst of all crimes far more serious than murder and carries a far harsher punishment when she is found guilty she will burn you are in no doubt about her guilt none my investigations have uncovered a character so foul so sordid that it is a wonder she was not unmasked before has she confessed not she she denies it all and what will you do with my information i intend he said to take some soldiers and ride straight out to milton where i will clap both mr prestcott and his protector in irons and drag them both back to jail we will see if mr thurloe can evade the law this time you must excuse me i am in a hurry that alarming duty done i returned to the high street to be told that mr boyle had fallen ill at his sisters house in london and intended to stay there for a few days yet then i went to tillyards to fill my stomach and catch up on the news locke was there and seemed mightily glad to see me i was not so content to see him next time you have a patient mr cola he said once i was settled pray keep her to yourself i have had the devil of a run with her she has deteriorated since you left im sorry to hear it why exactly he shrugged i have no idea at all but she is weakened a little it began the day that daughter of hers was arrested he willingly told me all the details as he had been attending the woman when it occurred it appeared that the bailiff had come for sarah at her house and had shackled her and dragged her away in full view of the mother sarah had not gone quietly she had screamed and scratched and bitten until she was forced to the floor and bound even then she continued screaming and had to be gagged as well the mother had attempted to rise from her bed and it had required lockes full strength to force her back all the time the poor woman screamed that her daughter had not done anything and they should leave her alone i must say when i saw the girls performance i could quite believe that she had killed someone ive never seen such a transformation in a human being before all quiet and gentle one moment the next a screaming raging monster quite a horrible performance and the strength she had do you know it took three fullgrown men to pin her down while the chains were put on i grunted her mother she curled up on the bed and began to cry of course and afterward became weak and fretful he paused and looked at me frankly i did what i could but it had no effect please accept my assurances on that i will have to go and see her i said this is something which has concerned me ever since i heard of the arrest i greatly fear the mothers condition is bound to get worse unless we do something drastic why is that the transfusion mr locke the transfusion think of it i didnt know for sure but i wondered whether the state of the girl might affect that of the mother now their spirits are so intermingled in her body sarah no doubt can withstand the effects her mother is so much older and weaker i have no doubt this is what has caused her decline locke leaned back in his chair his eyebrows raised in what seemed like supercilious disdain but which i now believed was his habitual appearance when deep in thought fascinating he said eventually this experiment of yours has all sorts of consequences so what do you intend i shook my head sorrowfully i do not know i have no ideas at all you must excuse me i should go and see her immediately and so i did the visit confirming the very worst of my fears the woman was indeed weaker whatever progress her wound had made had stopped and the stench of sickness hung in the dank little room i could have wept to see the sight but she was conscious and had not yet deteriorated too far close questioning discovered that she had not eaten now in near two days the girl lower had hired to watch over her had abandoned her post when sarah was taken refusing to stay in the house of a murderess naturally she did not refund the money it seemed to me that part of the trouble was that the woman was hungry she needed to eat well and regularly to have any chance at all so the first thing i did was march straight to a cook house and demand some bread and broth for her this i fed to her myself spoonful by spoonful before i examined and redressed the wound it was not as bad as i feared locke had done a decent job in that respect at least but she still should not have been that ill hunger and the dismay of seeing her daughter taken no doubt made her despondent but i was sureindeed my entire theory depended on itof a communication between her and the daughterly blood now commingled in her veins and if being cast into a ratinfested prison could have this effect then clearly worse was to come i beg you kind doctor she said when i had finished how is my sarah do you know i shook my head i have only just returned from the country and know less than you do all i have heard is that she is to go on trial have you not had any messages no i cannot go there and she cannot come here and there is no one who will take a message for me i hesitate to impose on your goodness my heart sank i knew what she was going to say and i dreaded the request but you know her a little you know she could not do anything like this she has never harmed anyone in her entire life quite the opposite in fact she is knowneven mr boyle knows herfor her willingness and ability to heal i know you cannot do anything for her but would you go and see her tell her that i am well and she is not to worry on my behalf i desperately wanted to refuse to say that i wished to have nothing further to do with the girl but i could not bring myself to say the harsh words it would have weakened the poor woman still further and if my theory was correct then the more content the girl the greater the mothers chances as well so i agreed to the request i would visit the jail assuming i was allowed in and would convey the message i hope i have led a good life and that the lord recognizes my efforts to conform to his laws so that i am spared the miseries of eternal torment for if hell is half as diabolical as the cells of an english jail on the day before an assize it is a terrible place indeed the small forecourt in front of the castle was far more crowded than on the previous occasion i visited it alive with the bustle of men and women come to succor prisoners or drawn merely by the possibility of watching new ones arrive the unfortunate wretches are brought in from far and wide when the judges come to town that they may stand their turn and hear their fate the jail virtually empty last time i was there was now bursting the stench of human bodies overwhelming and the noise of the sick the cold and the desperate deeply affecting however much many of the creatures deserved to be so lodged i could not but feel sorry for them and even had a momentary burst of panic that i might be confused for a prisoner and refused permission to leave again once my task was done men and women are separated of course and the poorer sort make do in two large rooms there is no furniture of any type except straw pallets for them to lie on and the sounds of the heavy iron chains clanking as the prisoners tossed and turned in a futile attempt to find comfort sang loudly in the background as i picked my way through the mass of bodies it was bitterly cold as the room was near the waterline of the old moat and centuries of damp clung to the walls the only light came from a few windows so high up that only a bird could have reached them it occurred to me that it was just as well the assizes met soon otherwise an underfed underclothed girl like sarah blundy would die of jail fever long before the hangman had his turn it took some time to find her for she was leaning against the clammy wall arms around her legs and her head bowed down so that only her long brown hair could be seen she was singing softly to herself a mournful sound in that dreadful place the plaintive lament of a caged bird singing in memory of its freedom when i greeted her it was some moments before she lifted her head up oddly i was most saddened and alarmed to see how her normal demeanor had vanished instead of the insolent haughtiness she was quiet and passive as though as deprived of the air she needed as the dove in boyles pump she didnt even reply when i asked her how she didmerely shrugged her shoulders and hugged herself as if to try and keep warm im sorry i have brought you nothing i said had i known i would have got some blankets and food that is kind she replied as to the food you need not botherthe university has a charitable fund and mrs wood my employer has kindly offered to bring me meals every day but i would welcome some warm clothes how is my mother i scratched my head that is the main reason why i have come she asked me to tell you must not worry about her to which i can only add my own exhortations your concern does her no good and may do her harm she looked at me steadily seeing straight through my words to the concern on my face she is not well is she she said flatly tell me the truth doctor no i replied frankly she is not as good as i had hoped i am concerned for her to my horror she buried her head in her hands once more and i saw her body shaking and heard her sobbing in sheer misery come now i said it is not as bad as that she has had a setback that is all she is still alive she still has myself and lower and now mr locke as well all desperate to make her better you must not concern yourself it is not at all kind to those who are trying so hard for her eventually after more such encouragement i talked her round and she lifted up her head eyes red with crying and wiped her nose on her bare arm i came to reassure you i said not to make you fret the more you look to yourself and your trial that is quite enough to keep you busy leave your mother to us in your current circumstances there is nothing you can do anyway and afterward after what after i am hanged there now that is jumping ahead a little i cried with very much more cheer than i felt you do not have the noose around your neck yet i did not tell her that her fate might well be much worse than a mere hanging everyone has already decided she said quietly the magistrate told me when he asked me to confess the jurors are bound to find me guilty and the judge is bound to hang me who would believe someone like me when i cannot prove my innocence and what will become of my mother then how will she live who will look after her we have no family no means of support at all when she recovers i said heavily she will undoubtedly find some suitable employment the wife of a fanatic and the mother of a murderer who would give her work and you know as well as i do that she will be unable to work for many weeks i could not say that this was a false problem as the chances were high that she would be dead within a week and god forgive me i could think of no other comfort to give mr cola sir i must ask you a question how much does dr lower pay i took a moment before i understood what she was talking about you mean i understand he buys bodies she said frighteningly calm now how much does he pay because i am willing for him to have mine if he will undertake to look after my mother please do not look so uncomfortable it is the only thing i have left to sell and i will not be needing it she concluded simply iii do not know it depends on the condition ofah will you ask him for me i am thought to have sold my body while alive so it will hardly be a scandal if i sell it again when i am dead even lower i think would have had trouble with such a conversation i found it quite beyond my powers could i say that after the pyre even lower would not want what remained i stammered that i would mention it to him but was desperately keen to change the subject you must not abandon hope i said are you planning what you will say how can i she asked i barely know what i am charged with i cannot know who is to give evidence against me i have no one on my side unless someone like yourself doctor will attest to my good character a fraction of a seconds hesitation was enough for her there you are she said softly you see who is to help me she looked intently at me as she waited my reply i did not want to respond it had not been my intention of coming but somehow i could not resist her i do not know i said eventually i would have liked to but i cannot explain dr groves ring what ring the one stolen from his body and discovered by jack prestcott he told me all about it the moment my answer registered i knew beyond any shadow of a doubt that my suspicions were true and that the magistrate had done his job well she had murdered grove she turned pale when the import of my words hit home she could have explained almost everything else in one way or another but she could find no answer to this charge well sarah i said when she kept silent it seems there is no escape for me then i think it time you went away it was a resigned pathetic statement very much the words of one who realized her deeds were finally proved beyond doubt are you not going to answer you will have to answer the court if you do not answer me so how do you defend yourself against the charge that you killed grove for revenge and stole from his body as it lay on the floor the whirlwind which hit me then was one of the greatest shocks in my life suddenly transformed from submission the true features of the girl were suddenly revealed as snarling with hatred and frustration she lunged at me tearing at my face with her nails eyes wild with madness fortunately the chains around her wrist and ankle restrained her or i swear she would have had my eyes out as it was i fell backward onto a foulsmelling old woman who instantly reached inside my coat for my purse i cried out in alarm and within a few seconds a jailer came in to rescue me kicking the prisoners and clubbing sarah to calm her down she fell back onto the pallet screaming and crying harder than i have ever heard any person cry before i stared appalled at the monster before me then collected myself enough to assure the anxious jailer that i was unhurt apart from a scratch down my cheek and stood at a safe distance gulping the foul air to get my breath back if i ever had any doubts about you i said they are gone now for your mothers sake i will speak to lower but do not expect anything further from me and i left so glad to escape the hellish place and the demons within it that i went straight to the nearest tavern to recover myself my hands were still shaking half an hour later although my mind was now at rest about the girls guilt i cannot say that i was contented in any other way on the contrary to be in the presence of such evil is profoundly disturbing and the manifestation i had witnessed was not forgotten so easily when i left the tavern i was much in need of company to have my mind taken off the sights and the sounds i had encountered had my relations with lower been easier his natural manner would have restored me but i had no desire to see him and did not do so until i remembered the girls request for my patients sake and because i had given her my word i felt obliged to deliver the message however futile it might be lower however was not to be found in any of his usual haunts nor was he in his rooms at christ church i asked and eventually someone told me that he had seen him with locke and the mathematician christopher wren an hour or so previously as wren still maintained rooms at wadham i should perhaps try there i was keen to meet this young man in any case as i had heard much about him during my stay and so i went there asking at the gate where he was and whether he had company he was with friends i was told and had asked not to be disturbed porters always say this of course so i ignored the advice and walked swiftly up the stairs to the gatehouse room where wren lived knocked and went in the shock upon entering was considerable wren a short neat man with flowing locks and a not unpleasing countenance looked annoyed as i walked into the room and stopped staring at the sight which i beheld locke had a kind of smirk on his face like a child caught in some prank glad to have his naughtiness known to the world my friend my very good friend richard lower at least had the goodness to be discountenanced and embarrassed to have his deceit so exposed that there was no possibility of any doubt about what was taking place for on a wide deal table in the middle of the room a dog was strapped whining piteously and rolling its eyes in distress as it struggled to free itself next to it was another more resigned to the torture it was being forced to endure a long thin tube ran from the neck of one to that of the other and blood from the incisions made in the necks of each had splattered onto lockes apron and onto the floor they were transfusing blood repeating my experiment in secret concealing their deeds from me the person who had best right to be informed of what they were doing i could not believe i had been so betrayed lower recovered first excuse me gentlemen he said without even having the courtesy to present me to wren i must absent myself for a while he took off his apron and threw it onto the floor then asked me to accompany him into the garden i dragged my eyes from the scene that so assaulted my spirits and followed angrily down the stairs we walked around the gardens crisscrossing the box hedges and patches of grass at random for several moments while i kept silent waiting for him to explain himself not my fault cola he said after a very long while had passed please accept my apologies it was unforgivable of me to behave in such a way the shock had still not passed and i could find no words locke you see told wren of the experiment weyouhad devised for mrs blundy and he was so excited that he insisted on repeating it it detracts not a whit from your own achievement you know we merely plod along in your footsteps emulating the master he grinned sheepishly and turned to see how his apology was being received i was resolved to remain cold the barest courtesy demanded that you inform me even if you could not bring yourself to invite my attendance a grimace replaced the smile true he said and i am properly sorry for it i did look for you but didnt know where you were and wren wants to go back to london this afternoon you see so you betray one friend to accommodate another i interrupted coldly this justified comment disconcerted him considerably and he pretended to become angry what betrayal once an idea is conceived it does not remain the property of the person who imagined it first we do not deny your achievement nor did we plan to keep it a secret from you you were not there that is all there is to the matter i did not know that wren was so keen to try it out until i encountered him this morning his tone was so insistent that i felt my doubts ebbing away i so very much wanted to believe him and to think of him as my friend still that i could not hold on to my conviction that i was betrayed but then i remembered the look of shocked exposure on his face as i walked into that room a more sure confession of guilt than anything i had seen on the face of sarah blundy we do not intend to publish this to the world without your knowledge and permission he continued when he saw he had still not breached my defenses and you must admit it is a better way of doing it if weyoumake an account of your discovery in a fashion which admits the transfusion was first attempted on a woman you will be dismissed as reckless and dangerous if however you preface it with accounts of transfusion between dogs then the disapprobation will be greatly lessened and that is what you were doing of course it was he said encouraged by the soothing of my anger i have told you of my fears if this becomes generally known too quickly it has to be done in this fashion and the sooner the better i am sorrytruly sorrythat you were not there please accept my most humble apologies and on their behalf i offer those of locke and wren as well as they never intended any discourtesy he bowed low and as he had no hat on swept off his wig as he did so my face cracked with a faint smile at the absurdity but i was determined this time not to give way because of such a device come now he said discouraged by my reaction do you forgive me i nodded very well i said flatly although it was one of the biggest lies i have ever told but i still needed his good offices and had no alternative beggar in friendship as i now was to maintaining at least the appearance of cordiality let us talk no more on this matter otherwise we will quarrel once again where were you anyway he asked we really did look with mrs blundy who is sick and getting sicker and with her daughter in the castle i nodded i did not wish to go but the mother begged me and it reassured me greatly if ever a soul was capable of murder it is that girl i have no doubts even though i suspect she will deny the deed and i would be easier still if she confessed to it freely but it seems clear to me now that she asked grove for money to aid her mother that morning in tillyards and was rejected so she took it anyway murdering him and stealing from his room it is dreadful that duty to a parent can be so corrupted and twisted lower nodded she told you this not she i said she will not admit anything but she does want to do one good deed still perhaps out of remorse because i can think of no other reason for it quickly i told lower of the offer of her corpse in return for his agreeing to treat and care for the mother lower looked surprised andi hate to say itpositively eager that he should benefit in this fashion how does the mother i doubt you will find her a lengthy burden on your pocket i said that is something else i need to talk to you about she is failing and if the girl dies i believe that the extinction of the spirit in one will have fatal results on the other he looked thoughtful as i told him of my fears and of the only remedy i believed might salvage the situation she must have more blood lower i said and from a different person one strong enough and healthy enough to counteract the girls spirit quickly as well if sarah is tried tomorrow she will die the day after there is little time you are convinced of this totally she has already declined along with the girls spirits the signs are obvious to see there can be no other cause that i can imagine he grunted you mean you want to do it today yes for her sake and for that of our friendship i would beg a final assistance from you we walked around the garden again in a similitude of friendship as he pondered my reasoning you might be right he said at last unless there is something we do not know if we do not know it we cannot take account of it i pointed out another grunt then he took one of those deep breaths which indicated he had taken a decision very well he said this evening i will bring one of the gardeners from the college who can be relied on to keep quiet why not this afternoon because i want to see the girl if i am to have her i will need a properly signed and witnessed letter to that effect it will take time and must be done before the trial begins you know she will burn the magistrate told me the chances of her being much use are small unless i can persuade sir john to intervene with the judge he bowed but dont worry well get it done in time meet me at the angel after dinner then well take care of the mother i passed the rest of the day in correspondence and melancholy now i had decided to leave as soon as my obligations permitted i was anxious to depart as swiftly as possible only widow blundy kept me there as i had already seen what happened when i did not attend her myself i took no joy in sarah blundys fate had little optimism about her mother and my confidence in my friend was at an end i wanted to accept his assurances about his fidelity and indeed i had done so but the seeds of doubt were sown and had disturbed my soul i am not prideful but i am jealous of my honor and fidelity and lower had placed both of those in jeopardy by acceding to wrens request above my right even though he owned to the fault it did not erase the hurt he had caused me and completed the distrust which his violent temper had already generated i was in other words in a gray humor by the time lower marched into the angel trailing behind him a cadaverous and sickly looking wretch whom he introduced as one of the undergardeners at his college for a shilling he would give his blood to mrs blundy but hes no good i cried look at him i wouldnt be surprised if he was in worse health than mrs blundy it would be better to transfer her blood into him i wanted someone strong and full of vitality hes enormously strong arent you he said addressing the man for the first time this latter noticing lower had turned in his direction gave a gaptoothed smile and whinnied like a horse his great virtue lower said as the man drank a quart pot of ale eagerly is that he is deaf and dumb dr wallis tried to teach him to speak but to no avail he cant write either it means you see that his discretion is assured which you must admit is important that family is held in enough disapprobation already and if it became commonly known that the mother was being kept alive by such means i wouldnt be surprised if she was burned along with the daughter here fellow have another he signaled for another quart which was soon set in front of the poor wretch best if he has a little he said i dont want him running away when he sees what we intend i was not happy although i saw the justice of the point but it says something about how my attitude had changed that i distrusted the motive behind the use of someone who could not testify to what had occurred did you visit the jail he rolled his eyes lord yes he said and what a day i have had had she changed her mind not at all we wrote out a suitable letterdid you know she could read and write as well as you and i i was astonishedand had it witnessed that was no trouble it was the magistrate he opposed the idea why because i could not persuade him that he was under any obligation to the girl a damnable nuisance if i may say so so thats it no body he looked despairingly at me even if i got her id have to give her over to the pyre when i was finished the magistrate would only allow me temporary possession but even that would have been better than nothing im going back to him later to see if there is some way of persuading him he glanced at the gardener who was now well into the third quart of ale oh come on lets get on with it before hes insensible do you know he said as we pulled the wretch up i am getting heartily sick of this family the sooner they are both dead the better oh damnation oh cola i am sorry both his explanation and his apology were justified for the halfwit must have been drinking even before lower brought him in and the three quarts he drank while we talked were too much with a foolish smile on his face turning to a look of alarm he slid to the floor then vomited on lowers shoes lower jumped out of the way and looked at the sight with distaste then kicked the wretch to confirm his insensibility what do we do now im not going to use him i said wed have to carry him there ourselves its difficult enough with someone who is cooperative he seemed sober enough when we left the college i shook my head sadly this is your fault lower you knew how important this was and you have failed me i have apologized that serves me nothing well have to postpone the treatment until tomorrow and hope she survives that long the delay may kill her i think your treatment will accomplish that in any case he said coldly i did not hear you saying that before you never asked i opened my mouth to reply but gave up what was the point for reasons i could not fathom almost everything we said to each other was taken as a slight or an insult as he would not explain his behavior and i could truly find no fault in my own there was nothing i could do i will not argue with you i said you have undertaken to supply me with some blood and i hold you to that promise then our association can end as you clearly wish will you bring him tomorrow after the trial he bowed stiffly and he promised he would not fail me again once the trial was over i should go to mrs blundys cottage and await him he would come with the gardener and we would perform the treatment there was enough time at one oclock the following afternoon the trial of sarah blundy for the murder of dr robert grove began in the assize court of oxford the crowd was eager not only did the trial promise much scandalous entertainment the previous day had seen not a single hanging verdict and ended not with the judge wearing a black cap but being presented with the traditional pair of white gloves to show that his hands were clean of blood but such mercy was considered dangerous for the awful majesty of the law needs sacrifice one maiden session as they are called was merciful two in a row would seem weak what was more wood an assiduous attender of trials who spoke to me briefly before the pushing of the crowd separated us told me that the judge realized thissomeone that day would hang we both knew i think who it would be there was a murmur of anticipation as sarah terribly pale was led before the court to stand facing the crowd and listen to the sonorous charges against her that she sarah blundy not having the fear of god before her eyes but being moved and seduced by the instigation of the devil in the fifteenth year of our sovereign lord the king at new college in the city of oxford did make an assault upon the reverend robert grove fellow of that place and formerly her master feloniously willfully and traitorously and the said sarah blundy did feloniously willfully traitorously and out of malice did place arsenic in a bottle and cause the said robert grove to drink it of which poisoning the said robert grove died so that the said sarah blundy in manner and form aforesaid feloniously willfully traitorously and of malice aforethought didst kill and murder against the peace of our sovereign lord his crown and dignity mutterings of approval which caused the judge to look up with warning in his eye erupted from the mob as they heard this accusation read it took some time for order to be restorednot that there is ever very much in an english court then the judge who did not strike me as very fearsome in aspect turned to sarah and asked her to plead she did not reply but stood with head bowed come girl the judge said you must plead you know guilty or not guilty it is all the same to me but you must say something or it will go ill with you still she said nothing and an expectant hush fell on the audience as they looked at her standing there head bowed to hide her terror and shame i felt a wave of sympathy for her for who would not be silenced by facing all alone the formidable power of justice ill tell you what the judge said a look of concern on his face that the proceedings were about to be disrupted well run through the charges and the evidence against you see if thatll make up your mind about your chances of escaping justice how about that sir are you ready the prosecutor a cheerful soul retained by the magistrate to do such business bounded to his feet and bowed obsequiously your lordships reputation for kindness is well deserved he said and the mob burst into applause to echo the sentiment the man next to me squeezed against me so tightly i could feel every breath he took turned to me and whispered in my ear that this was no more than the truth by rights the law is most harsh on those who flout its authority by refusing to plead shackling them with weights until either they give in or die from the pressure upon their chests nobody liked this proceeding but it is the only solution for recalcitrance by giving the girl a second chance so to speak the judge was indeed exceptionally merciful my neighborevidently a regular at trialssaid he had never heard of such kindness before the prosecutor then began to explain his casehe said that although he was not the victim of the crime in matters of murder the victim could obviously not appear for himself hence his presence it was not an onerous task for it was simple enough to see who had committed this foul deed in his opinion he said the jury would have no trouble at all in bringing in the right verdict for it was obvious to alland the town knew well enough already without having to remind them of itthat sarah blundy was a whore of intemperate and violent parentage so far was she from knowing her correct place so badly trained and so unknowing of all morality and decency that the idea of murder did not shock her in the slightest such are the monsters produced when parents turn their face from god and the country from its rightful king the judgeclearly not a cruel man and scrupulously fairinterrupted to thank the prosecutor and wondered if he might proceed fine speechifying could take place at the end if they got that far certainly certainly now as to her being a whore it is well attested that she had seduced poor dr grove and lured him into her power we have a witness to this one mary fullerton here a young girl in the audience smiled broadly and preened herself who will swear that one day she delivered some food to dr groves room and he mistaking her for blundy grabbed her and started fondling her in a lascivious fashion as though she was well used to it sarah looked up at this point and stared sullenly at mary fullerton whose smile disappeared when she felt the gaze upon her secondly we have testimony that dr grove when these accusations were made known discharged the girl from her employ so that he might take himself away from temptation and return to a virtuous life and that she most bitterly resented this thirdly we have the testimony of mr crosse an apothecary that on the same day as she was discharged sarah blundy bought arsenic from his shop she has said dr grove asked her to do so but no one has found any record of such an expenditure in dr groves papers fourthly we have the testimony of signor marco da cola an italian gentleman of impeccable integrity who will tell you that he warned of the dangers of this powder and heard dr grove say that he would never use it againa few hours before he died of it all eyes including sarahs were on me at this point and i looked down to avoid the sadness in her eyes it was true every word of it but i wished fervently at that moment that it was not next we have the testimony of mr thomas ken a divine that the girl was seen in new college that very evening and it will be shown that although she denies this she refuses absolutely to say where she was nor has anyone else come forward to say where she was finally we have proof of an unimpeachable nature for we have a witness mr john prestcott a young gentleman at the university who will testify that she confessed to him that very evening of her deed and showed him a ring which she had ripped from the corpse a ring which has been identified as dr groves own signet ring the whole room it seemed sucked in its breath at this point as all knew that the testimony of a gentleman on such a matter was unlikely to be gainsaid sarah knew it too for her head sank lower on her chest at the words and her shoulders slumped in what seemed like the abandonment of all hope sir the lawyer resumed the considerations against the accused of motive character and station are as strong as the particular evidence this is why i have no doubt that whatever the girl pleadsindeed whether she pleads or notthe outcome will be the same the prosecutor beamed around him to acknowledge the applause from the room waved his hand in a stately fashion then sat down the judge waited until some silence had returned and then turned his attention to sarah well child what have you to say you know i believe the consequences of what you may utter sarah looked very much as though she might collapse and though i had little sympathy for her any more i did feel that it would have been a kindness to have given her a seat come on girl someone cried from the audience speak up struck dumb are you silence thundered the judge well sarah lifted her head and i could see properly for the first time what a sad state she was in her eyes were red from crying her face pale her hair lank and dirty from the jail a large bruise on her cheek had turned blue from the beating the jailer had given her when she assaulted me her mouth trembled as she tried to speak what what the judge said leaning forward and cupping his hand to his ear youll have to speak louder than that you know guilty she whispered then slid to the floor in a faint as the audience erupted into catcalls and whistles of disappointment at being denied their fun i tried to walk over to her but was prevented from moving by the press of bodies silence the judge shouted out all of you be quiet eventually they once more calmed down and the judge looked around him the girl has pleaded guilty he announced which is a great blessing as we can now proceed quickly members of the jury any disagreement from you the jury members all shook their heads somberly does anyone else have anything to say here there was a rustle from the crowd as all turned to see if anyone would speak then i saw that wood had stood up redfaced with embarrassment at his temerity and at the catcalls which greeted him quiet now said the judge let us not rush please sir say your piece poor wood he was no advocate and had none of the assurance of even a man like lower let alone someone like locke and yet he was the only person who stood up for the girl and tried to say something in her favor it was doomed to fail even demosthenes himself could scarcely have succeeded in the task and i am sure wood proceeded from generosity of spirit rather than true faith in his cause and he did the girl no good at all for he was so overcome by the sudden light of public attention that he froze into incoherence and did little more than stand there babbling in a halfvoice that hardly anyone could hear the crowd put a stop to it the booing began at the back then whistling until even the greatest orator could not have been heard it was locke i think who ended the misery and with surprising gentleness pulled him down i could see the look of abject failure and dejection on the poor mans face and grieved for his shame as much as i rejoiced that the moment was over thank you for your eloquence said the judge playing shamelessly to the crowd and unable to resist piling on further humiliation and i will take your words into account then he pulled out the black felt cap and put it on his head as he did so there was an expectant rustling from the crowd whose mood had changed from sympathy to the greatest malice hang her cried one voice from the back quiet said the judge but it was too late thus encouraged more of the crowd joined in then more and within seconds the whole room was full of the sound of that lust for blood which comes over soldiers in battle or huntsmen as they near their quarry hang her kill her again and again in a rhythmic chanting with much stamping of feet and whistling it took the judge several minutes before he successfully restored order i will have no more of this he said sternly now is she recovered can she hear me he asked the court clerk who had given up his seat that she might be placed on it i believe so my lord the clerk said even though he was bodily holding her upright and had slapped her several times to bring her round good sarah blundy listen to me carefully now you have committed a most horrendous crime and the sentence the law insists upon for a woman who murders so treasonably is unavoidable you will be taken to a pyre and burned he paused to look around at the courtroom to see how this went down it was not well received necessary though it seemed to be the english did not derive much satisfaction from the pyre and a subdued mood settled over the room however the judge continued as you have pleaded guilty and spared the court a great deal of trouble we intend to be merciful you will be given the grace of being hanged before your body is consumed to lessen the suffering you will have to endure that is your sentence and may god have mercy on your soul he stood up and dismissed the court grateful for having had such a short and satisfactory afternoon the audience sighed as though it was waking from an exciting dream shook itself and began to leave while two bailiffs carried the now insensible sarah out of the room and back to the castle the whole trial had lasted less than an hour my mood of despondency increased markedly when i saw mrs blundy a few hours later for the battle was being waged and lost as i watched im so sorry doctor her voice was fainter even than before almost a whimper so sharply did the pain cut into her but she was brave and did her best not to let it show lest it be taken as a criticism of my efforts it is i who should apologize i said once i had examined her and realized how bad it all was you should never have been left alone for so long how is sarah she asked and it was the question i was dreading i had decided in advance to avoid telling her the truth that not only had she been found guilty but that she had admitted the deed as well she is well i said as well as can be expected and when is the trial i breathed a sigh of relief at that she had lost her sense of time and had forgotten what day it was it made my task a good deal easier soon i said i am sure that it will go well concentrate on your own troubles that is the best help you can give her because she must be free of distractions if she is to keep her wits about her she was content with that at least and i felt for the first time in my life that sometimes it is better to lie than to tell the truth like all people i suppose i had had it beaten into me from an early age that respect for the truth was the most basic attribute of the gentleman but it is not correct sometimes it is our duty to lie whatever the consequences for ourselves my falsehood contented her truth would have made her last hours the purest anguish i am proud that i spared her as no one else was around i had to do everything myself i simply hoped as i worked that lower would come soon so we could perform the task ahead of us he was already late and i was concerned grim and miserable work it is cleaning and wiping and feeding knowing that it is all for show to give comfort while the inevitable beckons the daughters spirit a stronger force in all ways was dragging the mother down with her her face was livid she had pains in her joints as well as acute gripes in the guts she trembled and flushed hot and cold rapidly when i had finished a shivering fit came over her and she curled up in the bed her teeth chattering even though i had built a fire and it was for the first time almost warm in the room what was i to do i tried to leave to search for lower and remind him of his obligations but this produced the first real movement in her since i had arrived she grabbed my wrist in a surprisingly strong grip and refused to let go please dont go she whispered through the shivers im frightened i dont want to die alone i didnt have the heart to leave although i had no enthusiasm for staying and my presence would make not one jot of difference without lower there however good my experiment whatever hope it held for the future he and the daughter had ruined it and she was now going to bear the responsibility for one more life and so i stayed fighting back the thought growing now into certainty that lower was going to fail me when his aid was most needed i built up the fire once more burning more wood in a night than the blundys had used in the previous six months and sat wrapped in my cloak on the floor as she slowly drifted in and out of a delirium and what madness she talked when she was sensible about her husband and her daughter reminiscence blasphemy piety and lies were all mixed together so i could scarcely tell one from the other i tried not to listen and did my best to avoid condemning her words for i knew that at times like these the devils which attend all of us in our lives see their chance and speak with our mouths uttering words we would never own to were we in full control of ourselves this is why we give the last rites to cleanse the soul of those demons so that it leaves the body pure and this is why the protestant religion is so cruel that it denies man that final kindness and i still could not understand mother or daughter as such sweetness and perversity i had never met in combination before or since nor could i understand it still when exhausted by her ravings first the old woman and then myself fell asleep in the hot airless room i dreamed of my friend and occasionally in the night a sound or noise disturbed me and i awoke thinking that he had come but each time i realized it was only an owl or some animal or the cracking of a log as it burst in the fire itwas still dark when i awoke i guessed about six certainly not later the fire had all but gone out and the room was chilly once more i rekindled it as best i could and the exercise helped loosen my joints which were stiff from sleep only then did i examine my patient she seemed little changed perhaps even slightly better but i knew she was in no state to withstand any new strain even though my trust for him had diminished i wished lower was there to help and advise but even i could no longer disguise the fact that he had failed mei was on my own and had little time to act i dont know how long i stood there in indecision hoping that my one alternative would not prove necessary i hesitated too long my mind cannot have been working properly because i stared blankly at my patient until i was brought back by a distant murmur of sound coming from the outside i shook myself into action when i realized what it was the sound of voices massed voices growing in volume even before i flung open the door to make certain i knew the sound came from the castle the crowd was assembling and i saw the first thin fingers of dawn in the sky there was not long and i had no choices left nor could i delay a second longer i prepared my instruments before i woke mrs blundy up laying out the quills and the ribbons and the long silver tube so that i could manipulate them with one hand i stripped off my coat and rolled up my sleeve and positioned the stool in the best position then i woke her now madam i said we must proceed can you hear me she stared at the ceiling then nodded i hear you doctor and i am in your hands is your friend come i cannot see him we must proceed without him it will make no difference you must have blood and soon it matters not where it comes from now give me your arm it was very much more difficult than the first time her emaciated state made it fiendishly hard to find a suitable vessel and i wasted time probing then withdrawing the quill some half dozen times before i was satisfied she bore it patiently as though hardly aware of what was going on and impervious to the sharp pain i inflicted on her in my haste then i prepared myself cutting into my flesh and jabbing the quill in as quickly as possible while her blood dribbled down her arm when the flow of blood from my arm was free and easy i moved into a better position then picked up the silver tube and inserted it into the end the blood swiftly ran through and spurted out in a hot red jet splashing over the bedclothes as i maneuvered the tube to bring it into line with the quill in her arm then it was done the conjunction was made and when i saw there were no obstructions i started counting ten minutes i thought as i managed a smile at the old woman nearly done i said youll be fine now she did not smile back so i counted feeling the blood pulsing out of me and myself growing dizzy as i struggled to keep still in the background the noise from the castle was slowly growing in intensity as the seconds passed after i had counted near ten minutes an enormous roar erupted then died away to complete silence as i pulled the quills out of our arms and bound up the wounds to staunch the flow of blood it was difficult in my case i had incised into a large vessel and i lost more blood before i could close the wound with a bandage still the blood soaked through and created a wide stain before i was sure i succeeded then i was finished and all i could do was over i took a deep breath to steady my spinning head while i packed the instruments away in the bag hoping only that i was in time then the noise from the castle began again and i turned round to look at my patient there was a bluish tinge on her lips i saw and as the drums rolled in the distance i picked up her hand and saw that the fingers had discolored as well the drums picked up in intensity as she began to shake and cry out in the most excruciating pain and gulp desperately for breath then as the roar of the crowd mounted and became almost deafening she arched her back and cried out in a strong clear voice clear of all sound of agonysarah my god have mercy upon me then silence the noise from the castle stopped the rattling choking sound from the womans thin throat ceased and i knew i was holding the hand of a corpse only a sudden monstrous clap of thunder outside and the noise of heavy rain suddenly beginning to pound on the roof now kept me company i was too late the ripping of the daughters spirit from her body had been too powerful and violent for such a weakened body to resist it had torn the life out of the mother through its departure there was not enough time for my blood to give her the strength she needed my indecision and lowers failure had made all my efforts worthless i do not know how long i sat there holding her hand hoping that i had made a mistake and that she had simply fallen into a fit i was vaguely aware of more tumult from the castle but paid it little attention then i closed her eyes and combed her hair and arranged the mean bedclothes as best i could finally though she was not of my religion and might well have scorned me for my efforts i knelt by the bed to pray for the souls of them both i believe i was praying for myself as well i suppose i left that miserable place for the last time about an hour later i was in no mood to reprimand lower instead i felt a ferocious and overwhelming hunger mingling with my despair so i went to a tavern to eat for the first time in more than a day dimly as i sat there lost in my misery and thoughts i listened to the conversation going on all around me festive and cheerful and so completely at odds with my spirits that i felt more a stranger than ever before at that moment i hated the english for their heresy the way they turned a hanging into a festival timed for market day to profit the traders i loathed their bigotry and certainty of their own correctness i hated lower for his temper and the way he had scorned and betrayed and abandoned me and i decided then and there that i would leave forthwith this terrible little town and this grim cruel country there was nothing more for me to do i had my patient and she was dead i had my task from my father but that was futile i had my friends but they it was now clear were hardly friends of mine so it was time to be gone the resolution made me feel better i could pack and leave within the day if need be but first i realized i would have to inform someone of mrs blundys death i did not know what exactly was to be done with her body but i was resolved she would not be buried as a pauper i would ask lower to perform me this one last service to take some of my money and see that she was interred with proper solemnity the decision brought me back to myself or maybe it was the food and drink that did it i picked up my head and noticed for the first time all that was going on around me and realized they were talking of the hanging i could not make out exactly what had happened but it was clear some scandal had attended the event so when i saw mr wood in a far corner i asked him how he was and whether he knew what had happened we had met only a few times in the past and it was no doubt impolite of me to approach him but i was desperate to know and wood was more than keen to tell me the story his eyes bright with the pleasure of scandal and with a most inappropriate air of suppressed excitement he asked me to sit by him so that he might tell me in full it is done i asked i thought maybe he had been drinking early though it was for he laughed immoderately at my question oh yes he said done it is she has died i am sorry for you i said did she not work for your family it must have been distressing he nodded it was especially for my poor mother but justice must be served and it has been he laughed again and i felt like striking him for his heartlessness did she die well please tell me i asked i am upset because the girls mother has just died as well and i attended her in her last moments oddly this upset him a great deal far more than the hanging of his own servant that is very sad indeed he said quietly sober all of a sudden i knew her and found her both interesting and gentle please i repeated tell me what happened so wood began however much embroidered already it was a dreadful tale which reflected badly on all concerned except for sarah blundy herself who alone had behaved with dignity and correctness everyone else in woods account disgraced themselves he said he had assembled at the castle forecourt just after four to be sure of a good vantage point he was not the first by any means and had he delayed even another half hour he would have missed most of what occurred long before the ceremony began the courtyard was crowded with a sober somber crowd all facing the tree which already had the rope dangling from a strong branch and a ladder propped up against it a few dozen yards away the jail officials kept watchers away from the pyre which was to consume the girls body after she was dead some people took logs for mementoes others to warm themselves at home and on several occasions in the past a punishment had been postponed because too much wood had been taken to permit the bodys consumption then exactly as the first light dawned a little door opened and sarah blundy heavily chained and shivering in a thin cotton shift her hair pulled back was brought out the crowd he said grew very quiet at the sight for she was a pretty girl and it was hard to believe anyone of her delicate appearance could possibly deserve such a punishment then lower pushed himself forward and muttered a few words to the hangman and bowed ceremoniously to the girl as she was led forward did she say anything i asked did she admit her guilt once more strangely it was important to me at that moment to hear that she was truly guilty her admission in the courtroom had reassured me greatly for it was the final information i requiredno one confesses to a crime of that magnitude unless they are certainly guilty for to do so is to abandon hope of life it is no less than suicide the greatest of sins i do not think so he said but i couldnt hear it all she spoke very softly and even though i was close by i missed much of it but she owned herself one of the worst sinners in the world and said that she prayed for forgiveness even though she knew she did not deserve it it was a short speech and was very well received then a minister offered to pray with her and she turned him down saying she needed no prayers from him he is one of the new men put in by the king and very far from the views of sarah and her sort that of course caused more of a stir some of the crowd looked displeased but a fair numbermainly the rougher folkapproved of her courage this he told me was nothing too much out of the ordinary it was the task of the church to impose itself at such moments and it was naturally open to the condemnedwho had little to lose after allto make a last gesture of defiance if they felt so inclined sarah prayed alone on her knees in the mud and with a quietness and decorum that elicited a sympathetic murmur from the crowd then she stood up and nodded to the hangman her hands were bound and she was helped up the ladder until her neck was level with the rope there the hangman stopped her and began tying the noose she moved her head to make herself as comfortable as possible and then all was ready she had refused to have her head bound or covered in any way and the crowd fell silent as they saw her eyes close and her lips move so the name of god would be the last sound to pass her lips the drummers began their roll and at the end the hangman leaned forward and simply pushed her off the ladder then the thunderstorm started and within minutes all was awash with muddy water the torrents so heavy it was hard even to see what was going on wood paused here to take another drink i hate hangings he said wiping his mouth on his sleeve i go and see them of course but i do hate them i dont know anybody who thinks otherwise or could do once they have seen one the way the face contorts and the tongue protrudes is so hideous that you understand why normally they insist on the head being covered and the smell as well and the way the arms and legs twist and jerk he shuddered let me talk of that no more for it didnt last long and when it was done lower staked his claim did you know hed bought the body and come to some sort of arrangement with the judge so that he might have it and not the professor i nodded i thought he must have done so it was done in the worst possible way because the university had heard and the regius professor thought his prerogatives were being infringed so he came along as well to claim his right there was a brawl in the mud can you believe it two proctors fighting for the body held off by half a dozen friends of lower who got locke to help him pick it up and carry it out of the yard i dont think many knew exactly what was going on but those who realized were furious and began throwing stones there was very nearly a riot and would have been had not the rain persuaded many to leave i think this was the last straw for my friendship with lower i know what he would say that a body is a body but there was a callousness about his action which distressed me greatly i believe it was because he had abandoned me in order to advance his own career that given a choice between assisting me in treating the mother and gaining the daughter for dissection he had chosen the latter he would now have his book on the brain i thought grimly much may it profit him so lower has his way not exactly he took the body to boyles and is virtually under siege there the proctors complained to the magistrate and said that if they cant have the corpse no one should have it so the magistrate has now changed his mind and is demanding it back lower so far has refused to give it up why i suppose because he is doing as much work on the corpse as he can in the time allowed and what about mr boyle fortunately he is in london he would be appalled to be involuntarily dragged into such an affair he stood up i am going home if you will excuse me i wrapped myself up as well as i could and braved the rainfall to walk along the high street to the apothecarys i found mr crosse along with the boy he employed to mix ingredients guarding the door firmly making sure that no one entered unless lower gave permission including myself i could not believe it when he held his hand against my chest and shook his head im truly sorry mr cola he said but lower is adamant neither you nor any of these other gentlemen here are to be allowed to interrupt him while he is working that is absurd i cried what is going on crosse shrugged i believe that mr lower has agreed to hand the body back to the hangman so that it can be burned as ordered until that gentleman comes he sees no reason why he should not conduct such investigations as he sees fit he has little enough time hence his insistence on not being disturbed im sure he would be glad of your participation under ordinary circumstances he added that he was saddened by what he had heard of our argument and counted himself still my friend it was kindly done and so like any common citizen i had to stand and wait for lowers pleasure although crosse at least did me the favor of allowing me to wait indoors rather than having to stamp my feet outside until the hangman arrived to claim his booty then lower came down looking tired and worn his hands and apron still bloody from his labors the sight of him inside the building caused a small tremor to run through the crowd are you prepared to submit to the magistrates orders the hangman asked lower nodded then caught the hangman by the sleeve as he was preparing to take his assistants upstairs i have taken the liberty of ordering a box for the body he said it would not do for her to be carried out as she now is it will be here shortly and it would be best to wait the hangman assured him that he had seen many gruesome sights in his time and this would not bother him i was thinking of the crowd lower said as he disappeared up the stairs he followed and as there was no one to stop me i followed lower one glance and the hangman changed his mind indeed he turned ashen white at the sight for lower had abandoned the delicate workmanship which normally characterized his dissections in his haste to take the organs he wanted for his work he had quartered the body and ripped it open with savagery removed the head and sawn it open to take the brain tearing off the face in his haste and then tossed the pieces on an oilcloth on the floor those fine beautiful eyes which had so captivated me the first time i saw her had been torn from their sockets tendons and muscles hung from the arms as though savaged by a wild beast bloody knives and saws lay all around along with the piles of the long dark lustrous hair which he had hacked off to attack the skull there was blood everywhere and the stink of blood filled the room a large bucketful which he had drained from her stood in another corner next to glass jars full of his trophies and the smell was indescribable in a corner in a small pile was the cotton shift she had worn stained and soiled from her last ordeal dear god the hangman exclaimed looking at lower with horror i should take this out and show it to the crowd then you would join her on the pyre which is no more than you deserve lower shrugged with exhaustion and unconcern it is for the common good he said i feel no need to apologize to you or anyone else it is you and that ignorant magistrate who should apologize not me if i had had more time i stood in the corner and felt the tears welling up in me so tired and sad to see all my hopes and faith shattered i could not believe that this man whom i had called my friend could act in such a callous way to me show such a side of himself that previously had been so well hidden i have no sentimental notions about the body once the soul has departed i believe it is fitting and honorable to use them for the purposes of science but it must be done with humility in honor of something which was made in gods image to advance himself lower had descended to the level of a butcher well he said looking at me for the first time what are you doing here the mother is dead i said i am grieved to hear it so you should be as it was your doing where were you last night why did you not come it would not have done any good it would have i said if shed enough spirit to dilute the daughters she died the moment her child was hanged nonsense pure unscientific superstitious nonsense he said rattled by my willingness to confront him with what he had done i know it is you do not it is the only explanation you are responsible for her death and i cannot forgive you then do not he said brusquely hold to your explanation and to my responsibility if you wish but do not trouble me at the moment i demand to know your reasons go away he said i will give you no reasons and no explanations you are no longer welcome here sir go away i say mr crosse will you escort this foreign gentleman out the exchange went on a little longer than this but in essence those were the last words he ever spoke to me since then i have heard nothing from him at all and so i still am unable to explain why his friendliness turned to malice and his generosity to the most extreme cruelty was the prize so great was his feeling of disgust with his deeds turned on me so that he could avoid owning his own fault but one thing i soon became certain of his failure to help me with mrs blundy was deliberate he wanted my experiment to fail because i could not then claim success i am fairly certain now that he already knew what he was going to do perhaps he had already started writing that communication which a year later appeared in the transactions of the royal society an account of the transfusion of the blood by richard lower detailing his experiments on dogs conducted with wren and followed up with another which described transfusion between two individuals so generous he was in acknowledging wrens help so open in admitting his debt to locke such a gentleman but not a word about myself and i am sure now that lower had already determined that i would have no acknowledgment all he had said in the past about others beating him to recognition about foreigners and his distaste for all of them came back to me and i realized that anyone less naïve than myself would have been on his guard long before but i am still shocked by how far he was prepared to go to steal my fame for in order to make sure my claims were not entertained he spread wicked stories about me among his friends saying i was a charlatan a thief and worse he had narrowly it was believed stopped me from stealing his idea rather than the other way around and only good fortune exposed my duplicity at the last moment i left oxford that same day traveled to london and after a week took ship on an english merchantman headed for antwerp then found another to take me to livorno i was back in my home by june i have never left my country again and have long since abandoned philosophy for the more respectable activities of the gentleman it pains me to return even in memory to those dark sad days one last thing i did before i left however i could not ask lower so i went to see wood who was still willing to receive me he told me that sarahs remains had burned that same afternoon as i was packing my bags and that all was finally over there was no one but himself and the hangman at the pyre and it had burned ferociously it grieved him to attend but he felt he had owed her that last attendance i gave him a pound and asked him to see to mrs blundys funeral so that she might avoid a paupers grave he agreed to take care of it for me i do not know whether he kept his word the great trust ideas of the cavern are the ideas of every man in particular we every one of us have our peculiar den which refracts and corrupts the light of nature because of the differences of impressions as they happen in a mind prejudiced or prepossessed francis bacon novum organum scientarum section ii aphorism v it is something of a surprise and even an embarrassment to have scarce remembered faces and facts summoned from the gloom of antiquity like so many ghosts this has been my experience while perusing the manuscript written by that strange little venetian marco da cola lately sent to me by richard lower i never imagined he had such a formidable if selective memory perhaps he took notes as he went along expecting to entertain his countrymen on his return such travelers memoirs are popular enough here it is possible the same is true in venice although i am told the inhabitants are a narrowminded people convinced nothing is worthwhile if it lies more than ten leagues from their city as i say the manuscript was a surprise its arrival as much as its contents for i had not heard from lower for some time we were somewhat in company he and i when we were both making our way in london but then our paths diverged i married well to a woman who brought me a good addition to my estate and began to associate with men of the very highest rank whereas lower somehow missed failing to endear himself to those most able to do him good i do not know why this was he did certainly have an irritability about him which never sits well in a doctor and was perhaps too mindful of his philosophy and not enough of his pocket to make a mark in the world but my loyalty and forbearance mean that at least he still numbers the prestcott family among his few patients i gather that he has already sent colas words to wallis old and blind though he now is and daily expects to hear his opinion i can imagine what that will bewallis triumphans or a variation thereof it is only to set the matter aright that i bother to put down a true version of events it will be a disjointed account as i am often interrupted by business but i will do my best i should start by saying that i quite liked cola he cut an ungainly figure but pictured himself a gallant and made something of an entertainment during his brief stay in oxford by the gaudiness of his clothes and the air of perfume that he left behind him he was constantly pirouetting and bowing and paying bizarre compliments quite unlike the majority of venetians who i understand normally pride themselves on their gravity and look askance at english exuberance his dispute with lower i do not pretend to understand how men could come to blows over such trivialities escapes me there is surely something undignified in two gentlemen fighting over the right to be seen the more artisanallower has never mentioned anything of the matter to me and i cannot judge whether or no he has anything to be ashamed of that acrimonious and foolish business aside however the venetian had much to commend him and it was unfortunate i did not encounter him in easier circumstances i wish i could talk to him now for there is much to ask above all i do not understand whyit is the most glaring of his omissionshe never mentions in his memoir that he had known my father it is strange for we talked much of him on the occasions we met and cola spoke of him warmly thus my opinion of the venetian from what i knew of him i suspect that dr wallis will paint a different portrait i never quite understood why that worthy divine so took against the man but i am fairly certain that he had no real reason to do so wallis had some strange obsessions and of course a profound dislike of all papists but often would be just plain wrongthis was one of those occasions it is generally known that until mr newton eclipsed him dr wallis was considered the finest mathematician this country has ever produced and this reputation has obscured his occult activities for the government and the malice of his character frankly i have never been entirely certain what either of them do that is so wonderfuli can add up and subtract to get the estate accounts in order and i can place a bet on a horse and calculate my winnings and i cannot see why anybody should need to know more someone once tried to explain mr newtons notions but they made little sense something about proving that things fall as i had taken a bad drop from my horse only the previous day i replied that i had all the proof i needed on my backside as for why it was obvious that things fall because god has made them heavy however clever he was in matters such as these though wallis was no judge of character and made fearful mistakes cola i think was one of them because the poor man was a papist and desperately trying to ingratiate himself wallis assumed there was some sinister motive behind it all personally i take people as i find them and cola never did me any harm and as for being a papist that is not my concern if he chooses to burn in hell there is nothing i can do to save him despite his amiability though it was clear to me at least that cola was a fool in many respects an example of the difference between learning and wisdom i have a theory that too much learning unbalances the mind so much effort goes into squeezing in knowledge that there isnt enough room left over for common sense lower for example was a desperately clever man but got nowhere whereas i with no education to speak of have great position am a justice of the peace and also a member of parliament i live in this vast house built especially for me and am surrounded by servants some of whom even do my bidding a fine achievement i submit for someone who was born through no personal fault with less than nothing and who once narrowly escaped sarah blundys fate that young woman you see was a harlot and witch despite the prettiness and the strangeness of manner which so captivated cola now in my mature years and having come closer to god i am astonished at my carelessness in placing my soul in peril by consorting with her however as i am a just man i must state the absolute truthwhatever her other crimes and however much she had to die sarah blundy did not kill dr robert grove i know this for a fact for i also know who did kill him had cola been more mindful of the bible he would have realized that the proof lay in those notebooks he carried to jot down the words of others he reports that at the dinner in new college grove had a dispute with thomas ken who stormed out muttering the words romans cola remembered the reference wrote it down and entirely missed its significance indeed he missed the significance of the whole occasion failing even to understand why he was invited in the first place for what is this passage unlike him i took the trouble to find out and it confirmed the belief i have held all these yearsfor if ye live after the flesh ye shall die my friend thomas was convinced grove did indeed live for fleshly pleasure and a few hours later he died had i not known better i would have called that a remarkable prophecy i accept readily that thomas was tormented beyond endurance before he acted for i knew well groves qualities and defects i had suffered much from his barbs as a child myself when he had taught me as part of his duties in sir william comptons household and although i knew him well enough to see the good that lay therein once i was large enough not to be beaten by him for he was formidably strong in his arms i knew how hurtful his wit could be thomaspoor slow honest thomaswas too easy a target for his sallies so much and so mercilessly did he taunt my friend i might even claim that grove brought his fate upon himself and myself i have to relate my journeys not one but several all undertaken at the same time in my quest for prosperity and dare i say it salvation some of what i will say is public knowledge already some is known only to myself and will cause great consternation amongst the atheists and the scoffers i doubt not that what i say will be scorned by the erudite who will laugh at my presentation and ignore the truth that lies within that is their concern for the truth i will tell whether they like it or not it is my desire to set out clearly my account of events and not bother with the sillinesses indulged in by socalled authors trying to earn spurious fame god forbid that i should ever suffer the shame of publishing a book for money or of having one of my family so demean themselves how can one tell who might read it no worthy book has ever been written for gain i think occasionally i am forced to listen to someone reading to while away time in the evening and on the whole i find it all quite absurd all those elaborate conceits and hidden meanings say what you mean to say then be silent is my motto and books would be betterand a lot shorterif more people listened to my advice there is more wisdom in a decent volume on husbandry or fishing than in the most cunning of these philosophers if i had my way id mount them all on a horse at dawn and make them gallop through the countryside for an hour that might blow some of the nonsense out of their fuddled minds so i will explain myself simply and directly and i have no shame in saying that my narrative will reflect my character i was at oxford intended for the law and i was intended for the law because though the eldest and only son of my family i was going to have to earn my living so low had we sunk in misfortune the prestcotts were a very old family but had suffered considerably during the wars my father sir james prestcott had joined the king when that noble gentleman raised his standard at nottingham in and he fought courageously throughout the civil war the expense was enormous as he maintained a whole troop of horse at his own charge and he was shortly reduced to mortgaging his land to raise money confident that this was a wise investment for the future no one in those early days seriously considered that the fighting would end in anything other than triumph but my father and many others reckoned without the kings rigidity and the growing influence of the fanatics in parliament the war went on the country suffered and my father got poorer disaster occurred when lincolnshirewhere much of the family property wasfell wholly into the hands of the roundheads my mother was briefly imprisoned and much of our revenue confiscated even this did not shake my fathers resolution but when the king was captured in he realized that the cause was lost and so made such peace as he could with the new rulers of the land in his opinion charles i had thrown away his kingdom through his folly and mistakes and no more could be done father was reduced to virtual poverty but at least retired from the fray rich in honor content to resume his life until the execution i was only seven on that terrible winters day in and yet i recall the news of it still i think every man alive then can remember exactly what they were doing when they heard that the king had been beheaded in front of a cheering mob there is now nothing which more brings home to me the passage of the years than to meet a grown man who does not recall as his strongest memory the horror that the news produced never in the history of the universe had such a crime been committed and i remember vividly how the sky turned dark and the earth rocked as the anger of heaven was loosed on the land it rained for days afterward the sky itself weeping for the sinfulness of mankind like everyone else my father had not believed it would happen he was wrong he always had too good an opinion of his fellowsperhaps that was his downfall murder perhapssuch things happen but a trial to execute in the name of justice the man who was its very fount to lead gods anointed onto a scaffold like a criminal such blasphemous sacrilegious mockery had not been seen since christ himself suffered on the cross england had sunk lownever in their worst nightmares did anyone suspect it could sink so very far down into the sulphur my father gave his loyalty entire to the young charles ii at that very moment and vowed to dedicate his life to achieving his restoration this was shortly before my fathers first exile and before i was sent away from my family for instruction i was called formally to his room and went with some trepidation as i assumed that i must have misbehaved since he was not a man who gave himself much to his children being too occupied with more important matters but he greeted me kindly and even permitted me to sit then told me of what had happened in the world i will have to leave the country for a while to mend our fortunes he said and your mother has decided that you will go to my friend sir william compton and receive instruction from tutors while she returns to her own people you must remember one thing jack god made this country a monarchy and if we stray from that we stray from his will to serve the king the new king is to serve your country and god in equal part to give your life for that is nothing to give your fortune less still but never give your honor for that is not yours to give it is like your place in the world a gift from the lord which i hold in trust for you and which you must guard for your children though i was seven at the time he had never talked to me with such seriousness before and i adopted such gravity as a childish face can manage and swore that he would have cause to be proud of me i managed not to cry as well although i remember the effort most strongly that was strange i had seen little of him or of my mother in my life and yet i thought of his imminent departure with great despondency three days later both he and i left our house never to return as its owners perhaps those guardian angels we are told watch over us knew this and played melancholy music and saddened my listening soul for the next eight years there was little for my father to do the great cause was lost and he was in any case too poor to participate such was his distress that he was forced to leave the country and seek his living fighting as a soldier as did so many other royalist gentlemen he went first to the netherlands then served venice fighting on crete against the turks in the long miserable siege of candia but when he came back to england in he immediately became a central member of that group of patriots later known as the sealed knot which worked incessantly to bring charles back from exile he endangered his life but did so joyfully they might take his life he said but even his worst enemy would acknowledge him to be an upright honest man alas my good father was wrong for he was later accused of the most base treachery which malevolent lie he never shook off he never knew who accused him or even what the charges were so could not defend himself and refute the allegations eventually he left england once more forced out of his own country by the malicious hiss of the gossip mongers and died of grief before his name was cleared i once saw a horse on my estate a handsome grand beast driven to distraction by the incessant viciousness of flies which buzzed all around it it ran to escape its tormentors not knowing where they were when it flicked its tail to drive one off ten more came to replace it it ran across an open meadow fell and broke its leg and i watched the saddened stablehand dispatch it for its own good so are the great and noble destroyed by the petty and mean i was just eighteen when my father died in his lonely exile and it marked me for life the day i received the letter that told me he had been buried in a paupers grave i broke down in sorrow before a violent anger gripped my soul a paupers grave dear heaven even now the very words make a coldness seep through my body that this courageous soldier this best of englishmen should end in such a way shunned by his friends abandoned by a family which would not even pay for his funeral treated with contempt by those for whom he had sacrificed everything was more than i could bear i did what i could eventuallyi never found where he had been buried and could do nothing for his body but i built him the finest memorial in the whole county in my church and i take everyone who comes to see it and meditate on his fate it cost me a considerable fortune but i do not begrudge one penny of the expense while i knew my family had been greatly reduced i was not yet aware of how much we had suffered for i understood that on my twentyfirst birthday i would obtain full title to the estates which had been supposedly protected from the government by an assortment of legal devices i knew of course that these lands would come burdened with so much debt that it would take me years to reestablish myself as a person of moment in the county but this was a task i relished i was even prepared to endure several years at the bar if necessary to accumulate those riches which lawyers find so easy to come by at least my fathers name would be perpetuated the ending of a mans life is but death and that comes to us all in the fullness of time and we know we have the blessing that our name and honor continue but the demise of an estate is true extinction for a family without land is nothing youth is simple and assumes that all will be well part of the estate of manhood consists in learning that gods providence is not so easily understood the consequences of my fathers fall did not appear to me until i left the seclusion of a home where although i was not happy i was at least protected from the buffeting of the outside world then i was sent to trinity college oxford for although my father had been a man of cambridge my uncle who had charge of me when i left sir williams house decided i would not be welcome there the decision spared me no grief as i was as rejected and despised for my parentage in the one university as i would have been in the other i had no friends as none could resist cruelty and i could not tolerate insult nor was i able to mix with my own for although enrolled as a gentlemancommoner my sniveling mean uncle allowed me scarce enough money to live as a servitor moreover he allowed me no freedom alone of my rank my small money was given over entire to my tutor and i had to beg even for that i was subjected to the discipline of a commoner and could not leave town without permission i was even forced to attend lessons although gentlemen are exempt from instruction i believe that many men see my manner now and consider me a rustic yet i am far from such those years taught me to hide my desires and my hatreds i learned swiftly that i would have to endure several years of humiliation and solitude and that there was little could do to alter that it is not my way to rage uselessly against a situation i cannot change but i noted those who were heartless and promised myself that in due course they would regret their coarseness many of them have done so i do not even know that i greatly missed the temptations of society in any case my attentions have always been focused on my own people and my childhood prepared me little for more promiscuous intercourse such reputation as i had was of a surly illtempered fellow and the more this grew the more i was left in a solitude which was broken only by my forays among the townsfolk i became an adept at disguise leaving my gown behind me and walking the streets like a citizen with such confidence that i was never once challenged by the proctors for improper dress but even these excursions were limited for once i shrugged off my gown i also shrugged off my credit and had to pay ready money for my pleasures fortunately the urge for diversion came on me only infrequently for the most part i engaged my mind with my studies and consoled myself by conducting such investigations as i could into greater matters i was gravely disappointed in my expectation that i would soon learn enough to proceed with the getting of money however for in all the time i was at the university learned nothing of the law whatsoever and was somewhat derided by my fellows for having any such expectation jurisprudence there was aplenty i was swamped in canon law and the principles of aquinas and aristotle came to have a nodding acquaintance with the justinianic code and acquired something of the art of disputation but looked in vain for instruction on how to launch a suit in chancery to contest a will or query the provisions of an executor and while my legal education proceeded i also decided that i would take the more direct revenge that my father had not been able to exact for not only did his soul demand it i considered it by far the quickest way of solving my familys material problemsonce persuaded of the innocence of the father i was certain his majesty would recompense the son initially i thought the task would be easybefore he fled my fathers judgment was that cromwells secretary of state john thurloe had seeded the calumnies against him to spread dissent in the royalist ranks and i never doubted that he was correct it had all the hallmarks of that dark and sinister man who ever preferred a knife in the back to an upright honorable combat but i was too young to do much and besides i assumed that sooner or later thurloe would be tried and the truth known again youth is naïve and faith is blind for thurloe was not brought to trial did not have to flee the country had not one penny of his illgotten gains taken from him the comparison between the fruits of treachery and the reward for loyalty was stark indeed on the day near the end of that i heard it confirmed there would be no trial i realized that any revenge would have to come from my own hands cromwells evil genius might escape the law i thought but he would not escape justice i would show all the world that some people in this debased and corrupted country still knew the meaning of honor with the purity of youth it is possible to think in such noble and simple terms it is a clarity that experience strips from us and we are all poorer for the loss from that day i date the beginnings of the campaign that totally occupied me for the next nine months and which ended in the most complete vindication i had virtually no assistance instead i crisscrossed the country seeking out the evidence i required until i finally understood what had happened and was in a position to act i was abused and humiliated by those who did not believe me or else had good reason to deflect me from my task and yet i continued buoyed by my duty and by the love of the best father a man could ever have i witnessed the depths of turpitude in those who seek power and understood that once the principle of birth is undermined the disinterest that alone can assure good government is fatally compromised if anyone can achieve power then all will try and government becomes a mere battle in which principle is sacrificed for interest the lowest will impose themselves for the best will shun the gutter all i managed was to achieve a small victory in a war which was already lost such thoughts were far beyond me in those days as i walked the streets sat in lesson and prayer and lay awake at night in bed listening to the snoring and snuffling of the other three students who shared the same room with my tutor one resolution alone stayed in my mind that i would in due course take john thurloe by the scruff of the neck and slit his throat but i felt strongly that more than mere vengeance was needed perhaps those lessons in the law had seeped into me or perhaps i had imbibed my fathers high sense of principle without realizing it what would he have done what would he have wanted this was my everpresent concern to strike without proof would be false revenge for i was sure he would not have wanted his only son to be hanged like a common criminal bringing further stain onto the family thurloe was too powerful still for a direct assault i would need to circle round him like a huntsman stalking a wily deer before i could inflict the fatal final blow to set my thoughts in order i regularly talked over my problems with thomas ken he was one of my few friendsperhaps even my only friendat the time and i trusted him absolutely he could be tedious company but each of us needed the other and supplied a lack we knew one another through a family connection before he was sent to winchester and thence to new college for a career in the church his father had been a lawyer consulted on many occasions by my own father when he set himself to oppose those rapacious interlopers who had swept down from london to drain the fens before the war my father wished both to protect his own interests and also the rights of those families who had grazed the land since time immemorial but it was hard work for the bloodsucking thieves who wished to steal other mens land acted under the umbrella of the law my father knew that the only thing that can oppose a lawyer was another lawyer and so this henry ken advised him on many occasions always honestly and effectively the diligence of one and the skill of the other combined with the unstinting resistance of the farmers and graziers whose livelihoods were threatened meant that progress in the draining was slow the expenses bigger and the profits much smaller than expected and so thomas and i had a natural amity for it is known that the loyalty and gratitude of lincolnshire men once forged can never be broken it must be said however that we made an odd pair he was of a severe and clerical disposition rarely drinking always praying and constantly looking out for souls to save he made a religion of forgiveness and though now a firm anglican who maintains he was ever so i know that in those days he inclined to dissent naturally that made him suspect then where hatred was mistaken for fortitude and smallness of mind was a sign of loyalty i confess with some shame now that i took great delight in causing him to become discountenanced since the more he prayed the more i laughed and the more he studied the more bottles i opened to make him blush in truth thomas would have loved to wine and wench just as i had to struggle hard to keep out feelings of pious dread which in the dead of night would creep upon me and occasionally in a sudden burst of anger or a flash of cruelty in his words the careful observer could see that his kindness and gentle nature were not natural gifts from god but were wrenched in a hardfought battle with a darkness deep in his soul as i say it was groves misfortune to torment him so much that one night the battle was temporarily lost for all that i always found thomas patient and understanding and we were useful to one another in the way that people of opposite character can sometimes be i would give advice about his theological ditheringssoundly i may say as he is now a bishop and he would listen with enormous patience when i would describe for the fiftieth time how i would take john thurloe and slit his throat i could hear him let out his breath as he prepared to argue with me again i must remind you that forgiveness is one of the gifts of god and that charity is strength not weakness he said piffle i said i do not intend to forgive anybody nor do i feel in the slightest bit charitable the only reason he is still alive is because i do not have the proof i need to avoid a charge of murder then i went on to tell him the entire story again the trouble is i concluded i dont know what to do what do you think you want my considered opinion of course accept the will of god get on with your studies and become a lawyer thats not what i meant i meant how do i find this proof if you are a friend please put aside your nitpicking theology for a while and help i know what you meant you want me to give you bad advice that can only imperil your soul exactly thats just what i want thomas sighed and supposing you find your evidence what then will you go ahead and commit murder that depends on the evidence but ideally yes i will kill thurloe as he killed my father no one killed your father you know what i mean you maintain that your father was betrayed and falsely disgraced justice was not done would it not be better to right that wrong by making sure it was this time you know as well as i do how much it costs to prosecute someone how am i meant to pay for it i merely mention it as a possibility will you give me your word that if it is possible then you will do it rather than taking matters into your own hands if it is possible which i doubt then i will good he said with relief in that case we can begin to plan your campaign unless of course you have one already tell me jack i have never asked since your countenance always discourages such questions but in what was your fathers treachery supposed to consist i dont know i said it sounds foolish but i have never been able to discover my guardian sir william compton has not spoken to me since my uncle refuses even to mention my fathers name my mother shakes her head in sorrow and will not answer even the most direct questions thomass eyes narrowed at my blunt statement you have your criminal but do not yet know with any precision what the crime was that is an unusual position for a man of law to find himself in is it not perhaps but these are unusual times i assume my father was innocent do you deny that i must do so and that in religion as in law i have no choice in this matter quite apart from the fact that i know my father was quite incapable of acting in so base a fashion i grant it is a necessary starting point and you grant also that john thurloe as secretary of state was responsible for all that pertained to the destruction of anyone who challenged cromwells position yes then thurloe must be guilty i concluded simply so why do you need proof if your legal logic is so fine because we live in distempered times when the law has become the cats paw of the powerful who tangle it in rules so that they may escape punishment that is why and because my fathers character has been so abused that it is impossible to make people see what is obvious thomas grunted at this for he knew nothing of the law and believed it to have something to do with justice as i had once done myself until i studied it if i am to triumph at law i continued i must establish that my fathers character was such that he could not have betrayed anyone at present he is cast as the betrayer i must discover who put this story about and for what purpose only then will a law court listen and how do you intend to do this who could tell you not many people and most of those will be found at court already a problem as i cannot possibly afford to go there thomas dear soul that he was nodded in sympathy it would be a pleasure if you would let me assist you dont be absurd i said why you are even poorer than i am god knows im grateful but im afraid my requirements far exceed your resources he shook his head and scratched his chin in the way he always did before launching into a confidence my dear friend please dont concern yourself my prospects are good and getting better the parish of easton parva is coming up in the gift of my lord maynard in nine months time he has asked the warden and thirteen senior fellows to recommend a candidate and the warden has already hinted that he thinks i would be more than suitable as long as i can make clear my full adherence to doctrine it will be a struggle but i will grit my teeth and then eighty pounds a year will be mine if that is i can fight off dr grove who i asked in astonishment dr robert grove do you know him very well and i still have some tender spots to prove it he was the curate at sir william comptons when i was sent to that family he acted as my tutor for many years such as i know he put there what has he got to do with this he is now back in his place as a fellow of new college and he wants my living thomas explained even though he has no claim to preferment except that he has not received any frankly i am very much better suited a parish needs a young and sound minister grove is an old fool who only gets excited when he thinks about the wrongs done to him in the past i laughed i would hate to be between dr grove and something he wants i have no great objection to him thomas said as though i needed to be reassured on this point i would be happy for him to be pastured out to a comfortable living if there were two of them but there is one only so what can i do i need that living more than he jack can i tell you a secret i will not stop you i wish to marry oh i said thats it is it and how much has the lady seventyfive a year and a manor in derbyshire very nice i said but you need a living to persuade the father i see the problem not only that he said in some obvious distress i am obviously not allowed to marry as long as am a fellow of the college and i cannot cease being a fellow until i have a living what is worse he concluded ruefully i like the girl how unfortunate who is she the daughter of my aunts cousin a woolen draper in bromwich a soundly based man in all respects and the girl is obedient meek hardworking and plump everything a wife should be with her teeth as well i hope most of them yes nor has she had smallpox we would do well i feel and her father has not dissuaded me but he has made it clear that he would not countenance the alliance if i cannot match her portion which means a living and as i have no other connections one that comes from new college or through its influence and easton parva is the only one likely to come vacant in the next three years i see i said these are serious times have you been on campaign as much as possible i have talked to all the fellows and find myself well received in fact many have given me to understand i have their support i am confident of the outcome and the fact that the gold men will advance me funds now indicates my confidence is not illplaced and the decision is taken when next march or april then i suggest you start living in the chapel just in case recite the thirtynine articles in your sleep praise the archbishop of canterbury and the king every time you take a drink of wine let not a breath of dissent escape your lips he sighed it will be hard my friend i can only do it for the good of the country and the church i applauded his sense of duty do not think me selfish but i was very keen for thomas to win his place or at least to be the favored candidate for as long as possible if it was noised that he would not get the living the moneylenders would shut their coffers with a snap and that would spell disaster for me as well as for him i wish you the very best of good luck then i said and i counsel you once more to be cautious you are prone to saying what you think and there can be no more dangerous habit in one wanting preferment in the church thomas nodded and reached inside his pocket here my good friend take this it was a purse containing three pounds how can i put this i was overcome as much with gratitude for his generosity as i was by disappointment over his limited means ten times that much would have been a start thirty times could have been spent with ease and yet sweet man that he was he gave me all he had and risked his own future in the gift you see how much i owed him remember this it is important i take my debts as seriously as my injuries i cannot thank you enough not only for the money but because you are the only person who believes in me thomas courteously shrugged it aside i wish i could do more let us turn to business now who might you approach to tell you about what happened to your father there is only a handful who might know something sir john russell was one edward villiers another and there was lord mordaunt who did so well from helping the king back onto his throne that he gained a barony and a lucrative sinecure at windsor as part of his reward then of course there is whatever i might one day persuade sir william compton to tell me windsor is not far from here thomas pointed out scarcely a days journey and only a couple if you walk if lord mordaunt is to be found there then it would be the most economical place to start what if he will not see me you can only ask i recommend that you do not write in advance it is discourteous but avoids the possibility that he might be forewarned of your arrival go and see him then we can decide what to do next we as i say underneath that clerical exterior there was a man yearning for the sort of excitement that a little bit of bread and wine could never provide well and good but before i went i made the acquaintanceship of the blundys mother and daughter who play such a large role in colas story in doing so i set in train events which gained me the most terrible enemy whom it demanded all my ingenuity and strength to defeat i do not know who will read this scribbling of mine possibly no one except lower but i realize that in these pages i will be recording some acts in which i can take little pride some i feel no need to apologize for some cannot be rectified now some can at least be explained my dealings with sarah blundy were due to my innocence and youthful trusting natureby no other means could she have entrapped me and come close to destroying me entirely for this i must blame my early upbringing before the age of six i was raised for a while by a greataunt on my mothers side a pleasant lady but very much the country woman forever brewing and planting and serving physick to the entire area she had a marvelous book vellumbound and gray with ages of fingering handed down from her own grandmother of herbal receipts which she would make herself and dispense to all and sundry highborn or low she was a powerful believer in magic and despised those modern preachers such she called them for she was born when the great elizabeth was still thought beautiful who scorned what she believed to be selfevident crumpled bits of paper and cloud reading and divination by key and bible were part of my upbringing despite the prelates i must say i have yet to find any man who really disbelieves in spirits or doubts that they have the most profound influence on our lives any man who has lain awake at night has heard the ghosts of the air as they pass by all men have been tempted by evil and many have been saved by good inhabitants of that ethereal space which surrounds this world and joins us to heaven even by their own standards the sourfaced prelates are wrong for they hold fast to scripture and that states clearly that such creatures exist does not st paul talk of a voluntary worshipping of angels colossians what do they think christ drove into the gadarene swine naturally it is hard to tell angels from evil spirits for the latter are adept at disguise and often beguile men and more frequently women into believing they are other than they truly are the greatest caution is required when making contact with such beings for we put ourselves in their hands by creating a debt of obligation to them and just as a lord or master remembers his debts so do these creatures good or evil by going to old blundy i took risks that in the maturity of ages wisdom i would now shun then i was too carefree and too impatient to be cautious old blundy was a washerwoman and by reputation a cunning woman some said even a witch this i doubt i smelled no whiff of sulphur in her presence i had once encountered what was supposed to be a real witch who was burned nearby in and a smelly old hag she was i now believe this poor woman was probably innocent of the charges which brought her to the stake the devil is too cunning to make his servants so easily identifiable he makes them young and beautiful and alluring so gracious they might never be detected by the eye of man like sarah blundy in fact nonetheless the mother was a strange old crone colas description of her is wildly off the mark of course she was not at her best when he encountered her but i never saw any sign of that sympathetic understanding of which he speaks nor of gentleness and kindness and constantly asking questions it was simple enough what i wanted i told her eventually who betrayed my father could she help or not it all depended she said did i have suspicions it made a difference to what she did and to what she would not do i asked her to explain she said that really difficult problems involved conjuring up particularly powerful spirits it could be done but it was dangerous although i said i would take the risk she said she did not mean spiritual dangers she was afraid of being arrested and charged with necromancy after all she did not know who i was how did she know whether i was sent by a magistrate to trap her i protested my innocence but she would not be moved and repeated instead her question did i or did i not know the identity of my target even vaguely i said i did not in that case we cannot roll names in water we will have to gaze instead a crystal ball i sneered for i had heard of such baubles and was on my guard to avoid being duped no she replied seriously that is just nonsense used by charlatans there is no virtue in balls of glass a bowl of water will suffice just as well do you want to go ahead i nodded tersely she shuffled off to get a saucer of water from the well outside and i put my money on the table feeling the skin of my palms beginning to prick with sweat she did not bother with any of the mummery that some practitioners adoptno darkened rooms no incantations or burning herbs just put the bowl on the table asked me to sit in front of it and close my eyes i heard her pour the water in and heard her pray to peter and paulpapist words which sounded strange from her lips now young man she hissed in my ear when she had finished open your eyes and gaze at the truth be forthright and be fearless as the chance may not come again look into the bowl and see sweating profusely i slowly opened my eyes and bent forward staring intently at the still and placid water on the tabletop it shimmered slightly as though some movement had disturbed it but there was none then i saw it grow darker and change in its texture rather as though it was a curtain or hanging of cloth and i began to see something emerging from behind this cloth it was a young man with fair hair whom i had never seen before in my life though he seemed familiar somehow he was there only for an instant and then passed from view but it was enough his features were embedded in my mind forever then the curtain shimmered again and another figure came into view an old man this time gray with age and worry bent over from the years and so sad it made your heart break to see it i couldnt see the face clearly there was a hand over it almost as though the apparition was rubbing its face in utter despair i held my breath desperate to see more and bit by bit i did the hand slowly came away and i saw that the despairing old man was my father i cried out in anguish at the sight then swept the bowl from the table in rage making it spin across the room and shatter against the damp wall then i jumped up spat an insult at the old woman and ran out of that disgusting hovel as fast as i could go it took another three days and the careful ministrations of thomas and the bottle before i was myself again i hope i will not be considered credulous if i say that this strange encounter was the last time i saw my father i am convinced that his soul was there and that the disturbance i caused played a great part in the events that came after i do not remember him well after the age of about six i met him only a few times as the war meant i was sent first to live with the greataunt i have mentioned then to the household of sir william compton in warwickshire where i spent those years under the tutelage of dr grove my father tried to come and assure himself of my progress although his duties ensured that this was rare on one occasion only did i spend more than a day in his company and that was shortly before he was forced into his second and last exile he was everything a child could hope for in a father stern disciplined and wholly conscious of the obligations which exist between a man and his heir he taught me little directly but i knew that if i could be half the subject he was then the king should he ever return would count me as one of his best and most faithful servants he was not one of these effeminate apologies for gentry whom we see strutting and mincing their way through the court these days he eschewed fine clothes although he was fine looking when he chose and was disdainful of books nor was he a great conversationalist idling away his hours in talk when practical things were to be done a soldier in short and no man was ever grander in leading a charge he was lost in the welter of backstabbing and conspiracy that the courtier must master too honest to dissimulate too frank ever to win favor it marked him out and if it was a fatal flaw i cannot consider he was diminished by it his fidelity to his wife was as pure as a poet could imagine and his courage a byword in the army he was at his happiest at harland house our main seat in lincolnshire and when he left it he was as grieved as if his wife had died and rightly so for the land at harland wyte had been in our family for generations it was our family you might say and he knew and loved every square inch of it the sight of his soul in such distress rekindled my enthusiasm for my task as it was clear it was tormented by the injustice he still suffered so when i had sufficiently recovered my strength i concocted a story about the illness of an aunt from whom i had expectations to gain my tutors permission to leave town and set off one bright morning for windsor i coached as far as reading as the university has no monopoly on the route and prices are affordable and then walked the remaining fifteen miles i slept in a field as it was still just warm enough and i did not wish to spend unnecessarily but breakfasted in a tavern in the town so i could brush myself down and wipe my face and present a reasonably proper appearance i also learned from the keeper that lord mordauntwhom i discovered was bitterly detested in the town for his lack of extravagancewas indeed in residence as warden of the castle having returned only three days before from tunbridge wells there was no point in dallying having come so far it would have been foolish indeed to hesitate as thomas had said a refusal was the worst i could suffer so i marched boldly to the castle then spent the next three hours sitting in an anteroom while my request for an audience was conveyed through an army of lackeys i was grateful for my breakfast as it was well past dinnertime before i received any response in the interval i marched up and down awaiting the condescension of the mighty vowing that i would never behave in such a way to those seeking my patronage when my fortune turned a promise i must say i broke the moment i had the opportunity to do so as by then i understood the purpose of all this attendingit establishes the proper boundaries creates a due deference amongst those seeking favors and most practically discourages all but the most serious and eventually my reward came when a servant more cordial now than before opened the door with ceremony bowed and said that lord mordaunt would grant me an interview if i would come this way i had hoped that simple curiosity at least would prompt just such a response and was glad that my guess had proven correct it was not often i imagine that anyone had the presumption to present himself on the noble gentlemans doorstep in such a fashion i knew little of the man whom i had traveled to see except that all expected him to become a figure of great consequence in the government a secretary of state at the very least and soon to improve his barony to a full earldom because of his favor with lord clarendon the lord chancellor and the most powerful man in the land he was a brave plotter on the kings behalf a man of great fortune from one of the highest families in the land with a notably virtuous wife and the sort of good looks that makes any man a place his devotion to the kings service was all the more remarkable since his family had kept out of the struggle as much as possible and were masters at not committing themselves and emerging with their fortunes intact mordaunt himself was said to be cautious in advice but bold when needful and disinclined to faction and petty squabbling this was the surface appearance of the man at least his only weakness was impatience and an abrupt way of dealing with those he considered incompetentbut that was a great flaw for there were many such at court and even more who wished ill on any friend of clarendon i approached through a series of rooms until eventually i was led into his presencea grand and in my mind unnecessarily pompous proceeding at least the final room was small and commodious enough a bureau stacked with piles of paper and shelves of books i made my bow and waited for him to address me first i gather you are the son of sir james prestcott is that correct i nodded lord mordaunt was a man of medium height with a wellformed face spoiled only by a nose disproportionately small his figure was fine especially in the legs his movements gracious and however grand the ceremony of introduction he cast that aside the moment that the interview began and engaged in the most amiable conversation which gave the lie to rumors of his pride and haughtiness i came away admiring the man for his sagacity he seemed a worthy comrade in arms for my father and i believed that each had been equally honored by the trust and love of the other the contrast with a man like thurloe could not be greater i thoughtthe one tall fair and open like a roman of old in bearing and manner the other certainly wizened and twisted operating in the dark never doing anything in the open always using the instruments of deceit an unusual approach verging on the discourteous he commented severely i imagine you must have a good reason the very best my lord i said i greatly regret troubling you but i have no one else to turn to you alone can help me if you will i can offer nothing in return but my needs are small i want a little of your time that is all you cannot be so foolish as to expect preferment i could not help you in that regard i came to talk to people who knew my father to clear his honor of stain he considered this remark fully digesting all the implications it contained before he replied gently but cautiously that is commendable in a son and understandable in a child whose fortune depends on it but i think you will have an uphill struggle in the past my tendency when faced with such remarks was to erupt into a burning rage during which i would voice all manner of angry ripostes as a youth i returned home with many a black eye and bloody nose but i knew such behavior would not help herei wanted help and that could only be obtained through politeness and deference so i choked back my anger and maintained a serene countenance it is a struggle i must undertake i believe my father was innocent of all wrong but i do not even know what he was accused of doing it is my right to know and my duty to repudiate the accusations your family surely they know little and tell less forgive me for interrupting sir but i need to know at first hand what transpired as you were one of the key figures in his majestys great trust and are reputed for your fairness i thought to approach you first of all a little delicate flattery often oils the wheels of converse i find even when it is recognized for what it is such comments show a recognition of indebtedness the only requirement is that the compliments be not too coarse and do not jar on the ear too loudly do you think my father was guilty mordaunt considered the question still with a faint air of surprise on his face that the discussion was taking place at all he made me wait a long time so that the kindness he did me was fully appreciated before he sat down then indicated he would permit me to sit also do i think your father was guilty he repeated thoughtfully im afraid i do young man i tried hard to believe in his innocence such belief was earned by a brave comrade even though we rarely saw eye to eye you see i never had any direct indication myself that he was a traitor do you understand how we operated then did he tell you i told him that i was working more or less in the dark i had rarely encountered my father once i had come to an age at which such matters were understandable to me and then he had been as discreet with his family as i am convinced he had been with everyone else there was always the possibility that the soldiers would come for us and he wanted us to know as little as possible for our sake and his own mordaunt nodded and thought awhile you must understand he said quietly that ivery reluctantlyconcluded that your father was indeed a traitor i moved to protest here but he held up his hand to quieten me please hear me out that does not mean that i would not be happy to be proven wrong he always struck me as a good man and it shocked me to think that was a sham it is said that the face mirrors a mans soul and that we can read there whatever is written on his heart not with him with your father i read wrongly so if you can prove this was not the case then i will be in your debt i thanked him for his opennessthe first time indeed i had come across such an even devotion to justice i thought to myself that if i could persuade this man then i would have a case he would not judge unfairly now he went on how exactly do you plan to proceed i do not remember exactly what i said but i fear that it was of a touching naïveté something about finding the true traitor and forcing him to confess i added that i was already certain john thurloe was the man behind it all and that i intended to kill him when i had the evidence however i phrased it my remarks brought a small sigh from mordaunt and how do you intend to avoid hanging yourself i suppose i must discredit the evidence against my father which evidence are you talking about i bowed my head as the depths of my ignorance forced my confession i do not know lord mordaunt looked at me carefully awhile although whether it was with pity or contempt i could not make out perhaps he said after a while it might help you if i told you something of those days and what i know of the events i do not speak because i believe you are correct but you do have a right to know what was said thank you sir i said simply and my gratitude to him then was whole and unfeigned you are too young to remember much and were certainly too young to understand he began but until the very last moment his majestys cause in this country seemed doomed to extinction a few people continued to fight against cromwells tyranny but only because they thought it right to do so not because there was any anticipation of success the number of people sick of despotism increased year by year but they were too cowed to act without a lead the task of giving that lead was taken on by a handful of loyal subjects of whom one was your father they were given the name of the sealed knot because they bound each to the other so tightly through their love of each other and their king they accomplished nothing except to keep hope alive in mens hearts certainly they were active scarcely a month went by without some scheme or anothera rising here an assassination there if these had come to fruition cromwell would have been dead a dozen times long before he died in his bed but nothing of substance took place and cromwells army was always there a vast block against anyone who wanted change unless that army could be defeated the road to the restoration would be forever closed and you do not defeat the most effective army in the world with hope and pinpricks i suppose i must have frowned at his criticism of these heroic lonely men and their struggle and he noticed it and smiled regretfully i do not disparage he said softly i state the truth if you are serious you need all the information good and bad i apologize you are right of course the sealed knot had no money because the king had no money gold can buy loyalty but loyalty on its own cannot buy weapons the french and the spanish kept his majesty on a shoestring allowing him enough to live in his exile but not giving enough to do anything but we were ever hopeful and i was entrusted with the task of organizing the kings men in england so they might act should our circumstances change i should have been unknown to thurloes office as id been too young to fight in the war and passed those years in savoy for my education instead nonetheless who i was became known very swiftlyi was betrayed and could only have been betrayed by a member of the knot who knew what i was doing thurloes men swept me up along with many of my associates at the very moment when they knew we had incriminating documents on us excuse me i said foolishly risking a second interruption even though i could see the first had displeased him but when was this in he said i will not bother you with the details but my friends and chiefly my beloved wife beggared themselves in bribes and so confused the panel of judges who examined me that i was released and escaped before they realized the size of their error no such good fortune was with the others they were tortured and hanged more importantly it meant all my efforts in the kings cause were in vainthe new organization i had labored to construct was destroyed before it even began its work he paused and courteously requested a servant to bring me some cakes and wine then asked me whether i had heard this story before i had not and told him so i felt like telling him also that i found it thrilling to hear such details of danger and bravado and that i wished i had been older that i could have met the dangers with him i am glad i did not he would have found the remarks childish as indeed they were instead i concentrated on the gravity of the events he was describing and asked a few questions about his suspicions i had none i thought merely i was cursed with the greatest ill fortune it never occurred to me then that my peril might have been deliberately caused in any case my meditations on the matter were swept away a few months later when we heard the glorious news that cromwell was dead you remember that im sure i smiled oh indeed who could not i think it was the happiest day of my life and i was full of hope for the country mordaunt nodded as were we all it was a gift from god and we felt at last that providence was with us our spirits rose immediately and all energies were rekindled even though his son richard was declared protector in cromwells stead and from that hope a new plan emerged without it even being commanded a way at least to rattle the regime there was to be a rising in several parts of the country at once by forces too big to be ignored the commonwealth army would have to split to deal with them and that it was hoped would open the way for a swift landing in kent by the kings forces and a rapid march on london would it have succeeded possibly not but i do know that every man involved did the best he could arms that had been stockpiled for years against such a day were brought out of hiding men of all sorts declared in secret their readiness to march great and small mortgaged their land and melted their plate to provide us with money the sense of excitement and anticipation was so great even the most dubious were swept up in the enthusiasm and thought that at last the hour of deliverance had come and again we were betrayed suddenly everywhere that men were to rise troops appeared they knew as if by magic where arms were stored and where money was hidden they knew who had been appointed officers and who had the plans and lists of the forces the entire venture which had taken the better part of a year to bring to fruition was dashed to the ground and trampled on in less than a week only one part of the country reacted swiftly enough sir george booth in cheshire brought out his troops and did his duty but he was all alone and had to face the onslaught of the entire army led by a general second only to cromwell himself it was a massacre as complete in its destruction as its ruthlessness there was a silence in the room as he finished speaking and i sat there transfixed by his tale truly i had not imagined anything so shocking the failure of sir georges rising i knew about of course but i never dreamed that his collapse had been caused by treachery nor did i suspect this was the crime of which my father was accused had he been responsible then i would have hanged him myself but i had not yet heard anything to suggest that he was guilty we did not rush to accuse anyone mordaunt continued when i put this to him and your father led the campaign to uncover the man responsible his indignation and outrage were terrifying to behold and yet it appeared this was duplicity eventually we received documents from within the government which indicated without a shadow of doubt that the traitor was your father when he was confronted with the evidence in early he fled abroad the matter was never resolved then i said he did not have the chance of rebutting the charges properly he would have had every chance had he stayed in england mordaunt replied frowning at the hint of skepticism in my voice but the documents i think were unanswerable there was letter after letter in a cipher only he used notes of meetings with high officials in the government in which conversations were recorded and containing information he alone could have possessed notes of payment no i all but shouted that i will not believe you tell me you dare to say that my father sold his friends for money i tell you what is there plain to see mordaunt said severely and i knew that i had overstepped the bounds of propriety his favor now hung on the thinnest of threads and i made haste to apologize for my incivility but the main accusation against him came from the government you believed that government papers but not from the government john thurloe was not the only person to have spies it never occurred to you the papers might have come to you deliberately to point the finger of accusation at the wrong person and sow dissent of course it did he said tartly and i could see that i was beginning to weary him we were extremely cautious and if you do not believe me you should also go and see other associates of his and they will tell you honestly what they know as well i will do so where would i find these people lord mordaunt looked at me disapprovingly you do need help london boy or rather considering the time of year tunbridge wells where they are jockeying for position like everyone else and can i come and see you again no what is more i do not want it known that you have been here i suggest that you conduct yourself with discretion and be careful with whom you talk this is still a delicate matter which men remember with bitterness i do not wish it known that i have helped you in picking at old wounds best forgotten it is only because of my memory of what i thought your father was that i have even talked to you today and i want something in return anything in my power i believe your father was guilty of a monstrous crime if you find any evidence suggesting i am wrong you will tell me of it instantly and i will do everything in my power to help i nodded and if you agree that my conclusions were correct you will tell me of that as well then i can rest peacefully i am haunted by the possibility that a good man may have been unjustly accused if you can be persuaded of his guilt then i will accept it if not what then a good man has suffered and a guilty one has gone free that is an evil which must be corrected the journey to tunbridge wells took me four days as i skirted round london rather than go through it and i did not begrudge a moment of the time even though i was keen to make swift progress the nights were still warm and the solitude filled my heart with a tranquillity that i had scarcely known before i thought a great deal of what mordaunt had said and realized that i had made progressi knew what my father was accused of doing and i knew how the accusations were put abroad forged papers coming from within thurloes office finding them would now be part of my quest more than this however i knew that a traitor wellplaced and wellinformed had indeed existed if it was not my father the number of people it might be was smallonly a handful of trusted men could have betrayed the rising of so very comprehensively i had seen his face in old blundys saucer of water now i had to discover his name i knew how it was done and why with good fortune i would also discover who i could have fallen into company as many people were on the move but i shunned all attempts to draw me into companionship sleeping alone in woods at night wrapped in my blanket and buying such food as i wanted in the villages and small towns i passed through that solitary mood passed only when i came to the outskirts of tunbridge wells itself and noted the bustle of coaches and carriages the neverending trails of wagons taking produce in to keep the courtiers supplied with their needs the growing numbers of itinerant peddlers musicians and servants heading there in the hope of squeezing some money for themselves by selling their wares in the last two days i did have a companion despite myself as a young whore called kitty attached herself to me offering her services in exchange for protection she was coming from london and had been attacked the day before and did not want the experience repeated she had been lucky that first time as no visible damage was done beyond some bruises but she was frightened had she lost her tooth or broken a nose her earnings would have suffered badly and she had no other trade to fall back on i agreed to protect her because the creature had a strange fascination for a country boy like myself such a phantasm of city corruption had never come into view before she was not what the lurid tales had led me to expect indeed she was very much more correct than many fine ladies i met in later life and i suspect no less virtuous she was about the same age as me a soldiers bastard abandoned by the mother for fear of chastisement how shed been brought up i do not know but she was wiser and more cunning for it she had no notion of honesty whatsoever and all her morality lay in her obligationshelp her and hers and she would owe hurt and she would hurt back that was her entire moral universe and what it lacked in christianity it more than made up in practicality it was at least a code she could keep to simple as it was i should say that i did not partake of what she had to offer the night before we arrived in tunbridge wells fear of the clap and a heaviness of mind about what i was to do the next day took away my appetites but we fed talked and later fell asleep under the same blanket and though she made fun of me i think she was quite happy that it was so we parted on good terms outside the town with me hanging back for fear of being seen in her company like my father i have never been a man for courts or courtly ways indeed i have always avoided the taint of corruption that goes along with such association although i am no puritan there is a level of decency which a gentleman should maintain and the court in those days had quickly abandoned any pretense at the sturdy values which make any country fit to live in tunbridge wells shocked me beyond measure i was quite prepared for rumors were spreading thick and fast by then to find the ladies of the court unmasked in public and even sporting wigs and perfume and makeup i was appalled to discover that the horseguards were wearing them as well but such things hardly concerned me i was not there to cut a dash to duel to lacerate with razorsharp wit or to worm my way into a position nor did i have the resources to do so to gain a post worth a year a friend of mine had to lay out near in bribes all borrowed at interest and consequently must defraud the government of more than per year to live decently and pay his debts i scarcely had enough to buy the post of his majestys ratcatcher let alone one worthy of my standing in society and given the fact that i was my fathers son all the money in the world would not have won me even that lowly post i could not stay in town when i arrived as it was too expensive the place knew its vogue would not last long and the court would soon turn its fickle attention elsewhere it was an ugly little settlement with no attractions but the waters which were a la mode that year all the fops and fools were there prattling on about how much better they felt for drinking the foultasting muck when all the time they jostled to be close to men of influence around them the tradesmen gathered like flies trying to suck what money they could from their purses i do not know which side was worseboth made me sick at the stomach prices were outrageous but even so all the rooms were let easily to courtiers willing to pay handsomely to be near his majesty many were even in tents on the common nearby in my brief time there i never even came within eyeshot of the king i was too ashamed of my dress to go to a levee and too concerned of an insult should my name become known i had a task to accomplish and did not want my life cut short by some fops sword if publicly insulted i would have to call and i was wise enough to know that i would almost certainly lose so avoiding all the fashionable resorts and those who populated them i confined myself to the lesser taverns on the outskirts of the town where the footmen and lackeys would come once their duties were done to gamble and drink and swap tales of the high and mighty i saw my traveling companion the once but she was too obliging to acknowledge me publicly although she did give me an insolent wink as she passed on the arm of a grand gentleman who was not ashamed to display his lechery in public from the servants i learned very quickly that i had wasted my trip as far as talking to my guardian sir william compton was concerned for he was not there his advancement had been utterly blasted by a dispute with lord chancellor clarendon over hunting rights in wychwood forest which they both claimed and as long as clarendon held the strings of government compton could whistle for preferment he knew this well it seemed so had decided to save his money and stay on his estate not even bothering to come to court two others of the magic circle were indeed present howeverbut i soon learned that although edward villiers and sir john russell had been staunch comrades in adversity the blessings of success had divided them more than thurloes schemes had ever managed villiers was in my lord clarendons party into which he was drawn by lord mordaunt while sir john a member of the duke of bedfords great family had attached himself to the opposition whose only unity came from a detestation of clarendon such is power that good men loyal generous and courageous in the field squabble like infants when they become courtiers nonetheless i had two people whom i could approach and i felt that the evening passed gathering gossip in the tavern had been well spent i was tempted to approach villiers as he most clearly had the ear of men in power but after some consideration i decided to start with easier meat and so set off the next morning to pay my respects to sir john russell i wish i had not done so i would prefer to pass over this incident in silence as it reflects badly on one born a gentleman but i am in the mood to tell everything warts and all as cromwell said sir john refused to talk to me would that this were all but he rebuffed me in a way calculated to humiliate even though i had never done him or his any wrong it was some months before i discovered why my name caused him to act in such a way what happened was thisi arrived at seven in the morning and entered the lower part of russells inn asking the landlord to send his manservant so that i might request an audience not correct form i know but anyone who has ever waited on a court on the move knows that formality is at a discount all around me were a few dozen or more people some waiting on favors some merely eating before going out to attend the audiences of others the room was abuzz with lesser courtiers trying to take their first step on the long and slippery ladder to preferment and office i was such a person myself in a way and so like them i sat patiently and waited in this lonely positionfor no one is more lonely than a supplicant in a roomful of supplicantsi sat for half an hour waiting a response then an hour then another half hour at past ten two men came down the stairs and advanced on me the chatter in the room stoppedeveryone assumed that i had successfully negotiated the first stage of my suit and wanted to watch the occasion from a mixture of curiosity and envy the room was perfectly quiet so everyone heard the message deliveredindeed the servant spoke in a sufficiently loud voice to make sure of this you are jack presteott i nodded and began to rise the son of james presteott the murderer and traitor i could feel my stomach contracting as i sat down again winded by the shock and knowing that there was more to come and nothing i could do to avoid the blow sir john russell presents his compliments and asks me to tell you that the son of a dog is a dog he has instructed me to ask you respectfully to take your traitorous presence away from this building and never have the insolence to approach him again if you do so he will have you thrashed leave this place or be thrown into the gutter as your foul father should have been there was total silence i could feel thirty pairs of eyes boring through me as i gripped my hat and stumbled for the door aware of nothing at all just some fleeting impressions a sorrowful almost sympathetic look on the face of the first servant and the hardness of the other who rejoiced in humbling me the look of malicious triumph in some supplicants the eager interest of others as they thought how they would tell and retell this tale over the next few weeks and the blood pounding in my head as the rage and hatred poured into my soul and feeling as though the force within my skull would split it open i was sensible of nothing else by the time i reached the door and do not even recall how i got back to the anonymous misery of my cot above the stables in the tavern how long i lay there i am not sure but it must have been some considerable timei assume i was sharing the place with half a dozen others that there must have been some coming and going to which i was entirely insensible all i know is that when i recovered my senses my beard had grown to a stubble my limbs were weak and i had to shave before i could show my face to the world once more the water from the well was freezing cold but i presented a reasonably civilized appearance when i went down to the inn across the courtyard i had half forgotten what had transpired but it came back to me in a flash when i walked through the door dead silence followed by a snicker i walked up to ask for some beer and the man beside me turned his back in the cruel way that comes so naturally to the coarsealthough considering the example they had been set by their betters perhaps it was not so surprising it is hard to relive such humiliations and even now i find my hand shakes as i dip my pen in the ink and write these words down so many years have passed with such grace and goodness in them yet that moment still cuts deep and the anger returns i have been told that the heart of a gentleman is the more open to such wounds than those of ordinary people because his honor is the greater and it may be so i would have continued had it been likely to serve any purpose but i knew that the incident had ruined my expedition there was no way now that i could approach edward villiers with any hope of a polite reception and i would not expose myself to another rebuff there was no alternative but to leave as swiftly as possible although i was determined that before i did so i would gaze on the face of sir john russell to see whether it matched the vision i had seen in mrs blundys saucer of water mordaunts visage had not of which i was heartily glad and i already knew that villiers was also different i confess i hoped that sir john who had already done enough to earn my lifelong enmity would compound his sin and make my quest more simple alas it was not to be i spent many hours lurking outside the inn and as quietly as possible so as not to be recognized outside the fashionable gatherings listening with gloom to the sounds of revelry within getting myself soaked to the skin by the first rains of autumn as i stood doggedly and patiently eventually i was rewarded after a fashion i had tipped a stallkeeper to point out sir john when he emerged and as i was almost giving up hope he nudged me in my ribs and hissed in my ear ere he is in all his finery i looked halfexpecting to see an almost familiar face coming down the steps where i said there thats him said the trader pointing out a rolypoly fat man with a pink face and a straggly oldfashioned mustache i watched with the greatest disappointment as this creature who looked neither deceitful nor familiar got into a waiting coach he was not the man that the blundy woman had shown me go on then said the man go and present your letter my what i said having forgotten entirely that this was my supposed reason for wanting to know who he was oh that later maybe nervous eh i know but let me tell you young sir youll not get anywhere with this bunch unless you go ahead with your plans i decided to take this unsought but probably good advice by packing my bags and leaving the town it did not contain what i was looking for it is midafternoon and i am told you note how it is these daysi am told that we are setting off for my country seat in the morning i have little time to continue my narrative i have already had my head shaved for that damn fool wig the tailor has been to see me all is busy with activity so many things there are to prepare and to get ready and i care nothing for any of them these tedious little details are hardly germane to my story but i notice this tendency in me it comes more frequently now my dotage i suppose it is i find that i can remember what happened all those years ago more easily than i recall what i was doing the day before yesterday to return to my story i arrived back in oxford with a deep resentment in my heart and an ever greater determination to defeat my hidden enemies i had been away more than two weeks and in that time the town had filled with students and was no longer the quiet rustic place it is much of the year fortunately this also meant that all those whose help i needed were now in residence one was thomas of course whose logicchopping skills honed in the theological and logical arts which he taught with surprising skill to students were vitalhe could whip through a pile and tease out a meaning faster than anyone i knew the other was an odd little fellow he brought to see me one day his name was anthony wood here thomas said presenting wood to me in his room is the answer to all of your problems mr wood is a great scholar and keen to help you in your search cola describes him briefly and it is one of the few occasions when i can find only small fault with his penmanship i have never met a more ridiculous creature than anthony wood he was a deal older than myself perhaps thirty or thereabouts and already had the bowed back and sunken cheeks of the bookworm his clothes were monstrousso old and patched it was hard to see how out of fashion they werehis stockings were darned and he had the habit of throwing his head back and whinnying like a horse when he was amused an unpleasant grating sound which made all in his company suddenly grave lest they say something witty and be rewarded with his laughter this combined with the general inelegance of his movementsall jerks and twitches so that he could barely sit still for more than a few secondsbegan to irritate me the moment i set eyes on him and it was hard indeed for me to keep my patience but thomas said he would be useful so i forbore to make fun of him unfortunately the connection once begun proved hard to break like all scholars wood is poor and constantly in search of patronagethey all seem to think that others should pay for their diversion he has never had any from me but has never despaired either he still comes to pay court in the hope that a coin might slip from my pocket into his inkstained hands and never ceases to remind me of the services he rendered all those years ago he was here a few days back in fact which is why he is so fresh in my memory but said nothing of consequence he is writing a book but what is there in that he has been writing the same one since ever i knew him and it seems no nearer its conclusion and he is one of those wiry little men who never seem to age at all beyond stooping a little more and acquiring a few more lines on his face when he comes into a room it is as though half my life has not happened and is only a dream it is only my own aches that remind me mr wood is a great friend of mine thomas explained when he saw the look of disgust on my face as i regarded the fellow we play music together every week he is a monstrous student of history and over the last few years has accumulated a great deal of information about the wars fascinating i said dryly but i fail to see how he can help wood now spoke in that highpitched fluting voice of hissuch precise mincing enunciation as neat as a notebook and scarcely more interesting i have had the honor of encountering many people he said distinguished in war and in public affairs i have a substantial knowledge of this countrys tragic course which i would be happy to place at your disposal to establish what became of your father i swear he talked like that all the while all his sentences as perfectly formed as he was grotesque himself i was not sure what to make of this offer but thomas told me i must certainly accept as mr wood was already known for the niceness of his judgment and the voluminous nature of his knowledge if i needed to know anything about any event or any personality then i must certainly ask wood first of allit would save me a great deal of time very well i said but i wish to make it clear that you will tell no one of my search there are many people who would be my enemies if they knew what i am doing i wish to take them by stealth wood agreed reluctantly and i told him that i would lay all the facts and information before him in due course so that he might supplement my findings with information of his own then thomas considerately bundled him out of the room and i gave my friend a wry and reproachful look thomas i know i am in need of all the help i can get you are wrong my friend mr woods knowledge may be crucial to you one day do not dismiss him because of his appearance i have also thought of another useful person for you i groaned who might this be then dr john wallis who he is the savilian professor of geometry and was deep in the confidence of the commonwealth by virtue of his skill with codes many a secret letter ot the kings did he reveal to thurloes office so they say should have been hanged then and now he performs the same service for his majestys government it is rumored lord mordaunt told you the documents incriminating your father used a cipherif so then dr wallis might know something of the matter if you can persuade him to help i nodded perhaps for once one of thomass ideas was going to be useful before either mr wood or dr wallis could do much to help me i had an opportunity to repay some of my debt to thomas by rescuing him from one of the most absurd pieces of illjudgment the circumstances were highly amusing if a little worrying everyone knew that old tidmarsh the quaker held some grotesque conventicle in his little house down by the river illegal of course and considering the trouble such lunatics had already caused they should have been crushed mercilessly but no every now and then a few were locked up then they were let out again free to resume their loathsome ways in fact they seemed to take pride in it and blasphemously likened their own sufferings to those of our lord himself some i heard even claimed to be the lord in their arrogance and ran around shaking their heads and pretending to cure people the world was full of such madmen in those days imprisonment is not the way to deal with such people half measures merely feed their pride leave em alone or hang em in my opinion or better still pack them off to the americas and let them starve anyway i was walking down by the castle a few evenings later when i heard a lot of noise and the sound of running feet for once it seemed the magistrate had decided to do something there were sectaries everywhere jumping out of windows running this way and that like ants bestirred in their nest never let these people tell you incidentally that they sit still and sing psalms when arrested they are as frightened as anyone i stood and watched the sport with merriment until i saw with great surprise my friend thomas all but falling out of the window of tidmarshs house and running up an alleyway instantly as any friend would i gave chase of all the stupid people i thought he was perhaps the stupidest here he was risking his future by indulging his ridiculous piety at the very moment when absolute and total conformity was required he was no sportsman and i caught up with him without any trouble he almost fainted poor soul when i grabbed him by the shoulder and brought him to a halt what in gods name do you think youre doing jack he said with the most profound relief thank god i thought it was the watch and so it should be you must be mad no i the explanation for his absurdity was cut short however for two men of the watch now hove into view we were in an alley and running would not get us out of trouble keep quiet lean on my shoulder and leave it to me i whispered as they approached good evening sirs i cried slurring my words like one very much drunker than i was and what are you two doing ah i said missed the curfew again have we students are you colleges please he peered at thomas whose impression of being drunk was sadly lacking had he just a little experience of inebriation he might have done better where have you been for the last two hours in the tavern with me i said i dont believe you how dare you doubt my word i replied stoutly where do you think we were attending an illegal assembly you must be joking i said with a fine demonstration of merriment at the absurdity of the idea do i look like a fanatic we may be drunk but it is not with the word of god im glad to say i meant him he pointed at an everpaler thomas him i cried oh dear me no ecstasy has been his tonight but very far from divine im sure the lady concerned would vouch for his devotion though dont let the clerical air fool you thomas blushed at my words and fortunately this was interpreted as shame i for my part have been playing cards with some considerable success really yes and i am in a splendid mood i wish to share my good fortune with all the world here sir have this shilling and drink my health he took the coin looked at it for a fraction of a second and then greed overcame duty and if you are chasing quakers i continued happily once it was tucked away in his pocket i saw two gloomy types running up the street over there not three minutes ago he looked at me and grinned showing his gaping gums thank you young sir but the curfew is on if youre still here when i get back have no fear now run quickly or you will miss them i breathed an enormous sigh of relief as they ran off then turned to thomas who showed distinct signs of being sick thats a shilling you owe me i said now lets get out of here we walked back in silence to new college i needed to talk to him but could not possibly do so in my own lodging crammed in as i was with my tutorwho i imagined was already in bed thomas however being now a senior member of a wealthy college had the freedom to come and go without bothering about the curfews which plagued my life small and poky though his room was he did not have to share it with his studentsa luxurious innovation which caused much comment when introduced you must be out of your mind my friend i said vehemently when the door was closed what on earth were you doing indulge your sentiments in private if you must but to advertise them and risk jail when you are trying to secure yourself a living and a wife is madness i was not no of course not you just happened to be amongst that band of quakers not knowing who they were and climbed out of the window and ran away for the exercise no he said i was there deliberately but for a good reason no reason is good enough for that i went to talk to someone win their confidence why because i fear i may not get my parish after all you certainly wont if you behave like this will you listen to me he pleaded grove is pressing his case and is winning over several members of the fellowship whom i assumed were on my side and now he is talking to the warden what can he say simple that he is old and a bachelor while i will undoubtedly marry and have a family his needs in contrast are simple and he will hand over a third of the annual revenue from the living to the college can he do that if he gets it he can do whatever he wants its his money he is calculating that it is better to have two thirds of eighty pounds a year than none of it and woodward is very mindful of college funds and you cant match the offer of course i cant he said with bitterness i wish to marry the girls father is only just willing to support the match if i have the full amount what would your reaction be if i went along and said id given a third away find another wife i suggested jack i like her she is a good match and that living is mine i see your problem but not what it has to do with climbing out of windows grove is unsuitable to be in charge of a flock he will bring scandal onto the church and drag its good name in the dirt i know this well but as long as he was kept away from a living it was not my affair im still not following you he is a lecher im sure of it he engages in illicit concourse with that servant of his to the shame of the college and the church it is a disgrace if his perfidy is proven then the college will not risk its reputation by giving him a parish i was trying to discover the truth at a meeting of quakers i said incredulously the story was getting worse and worse this servant attends sometimes and is said to be important to them in fact he said she has a great reputation amongst them for reasons i do not understand i thought if i attended i could win her confidence im afraid that here i burst out laughing oh thomas my dear friend only you could try and seduce a girl on your knees he blushed scarlet i was not trying to do anything of the sort no of course not who is this creature anyway a girl called blundy sarah blundy i know her i said i thought she was quite a good girl that merely demonstrates the limits of your observation the father was shot for mutiny or something the mother is a witch and the girl lived in a hellish society giving herself freely to anyone who wanted her from the age of ten ive heard of these people and the sort of things they got up to i tell you i shudder even at the thought of talking to her im sure having you chant psalms and pray for deliverance would do wonders in winning her over i said are you sure of this i have met the girl and the mother for a witchs daughter she is very pretty and for a devilish slut unusually civil i make no mistake did you talk to her i had no chance they are very peculiar these meetings we all sat around in a circle with this blundy girl in the center and and nothing it seemed as though all were waiting for her to say something but she just sat there this went on for about an hour then we heard shouting from outside and everyone ran in panic i see even if this belief of yours is true you are hardly going to get her to tell you i said why should she it obviously doesnt bother her and she must need the money why should she risk her position to do you a favor i believe she must secretly despise him i thought that if i gave her a promise that there would be no consequences she would see her duty i think a few coins might sway her better thomas are you sure this is not a mistake dr grove was my tutor you remember and i detected no sign of lustfulness about him in all of four years i am persuaded that thomas was convinced of the selflessness of his actions he genuinely wished the parishioners of easton parva to have the very best minister possible and was certain that he was that person naturally he wanted the stipend and the wife and dowry that went with it but that merely to make him a better servant of his flock he was motivated by righteousness not greed that was why matters fell out so badly in the end simple selfishness causes less harm than desperate virtue for my part i freely confess the selfishness of my own actions i needed a supply of money and for that i needed thomas to have some besides he was my only friend at the time and i felt beholden to him for my sake as much as his i decided that he needed the sort of assistance only i could provide listen my friend go back to your studies and abandon this meddling because you are not at all suited to it i will deal with the blundy girl for you and will soon have her singing like a canary and how will you do that i will not tell you but if you pray for the forgiveness of my sins then you will be working hard in the next few weeks as usual he looked shocked at my irreverence which was just as i hoped it was so easy to upset him in that way laughing happily i left him to sleep went back to my college climbed over the wall undetected and crept softly into the room of my snoring tutor i went to see john wallis mathematician and man of god as thomas had urged at this stage i knew little of that grand divine except that he was not well liked although this i put down to the fact that he had been foisted on oxford by cromwell much of his unpopularity was due to the fact that at the general purge of puritans when the king came back wallis had not only kept his position but had even received signs of official favor many of those who had suffered for the king and had not been so rewarded resented this bitterly rather presumptuously i visited him at his home for he was a rich man and kept rooms in his college a substantial house in merton street and also i gathered a place in london his manservant assumed i was a student wanting instruction and it was only with some difficulty that i gained an audience wallis saw me immediately for which favor i was impressed lesser lights in the university had in the past kept me waiting for hours for no reason consequently i went into his presence with some rising hope in my heart i suppose everybody has in their mind now an idea of what these people look like the cleric rosycheeked from too much high living the natural philosopher absentminded a little unkempt with the buttons of his tunic done up in the wrong order and his wig all askew if there are such people then the reverend dr john wallis was not one of them for he was a man who i believe never missed or forgot anything in his entire life he was one of the coldest most frightening people i ever encountered he sat perfectly still and watched me as i came in indicating only by a slight nod of the head that i should sit down now i think more about it there is something about quietude which is very eloquent thurloe for example sat very still as well but the contrast could not have been greater it may sound strange for me of all people to say it but thurloes stillness had a humility about it wallis had the immobility of a serpent as it eyes its prey well sir he said in an icily soft voice after a while i noticed that he had a slight lisp which made the impression of the serpent even stronger you want to see me not the other way around i have come to ask you a favor sir on a personal matter i hope you dont want instruction oh lord no do not blaspheme in my presence my apologies sir but im not certain how to start i was told you might be able to help by whom by mr ken an ma of this university and i am aware of mr ken wallis said a dissenting priest is he not he is trying desperately to be obedient i wish him well he no doubt realizes we cannot afford less than total compliance in these days yes sir i noticed that we it was only a short while after all since wallis had been a dissenting priest himself and done handsomely out of it wallis still sat impassively helping me not at all my father was sir james prestcott i have heard of him in which case you also know that he was accused of dreadful deeds which i know he did not commit i am convinced that his fall was a plot organized by john thurloe to hide the identity of a real traitor and i intend to prove it again wallis made no move either of encouragement or disapproval rather he sat there staring at me with his unblinking eyes until i felt a hot flush of foolishness come over me and i began to sweat and stammer in my embarrassment how do you intend to prove it he said after a while somebody must know the truth i said i had hoped that as you were connected with mr thurloes office here wallis held up his hand say no more sir you have an overblown notion of my importance i think i deciphered letters for the commonwealth when i could not avoid doing so and when i was sure my natural loyalty to his majestys cause would not in any way be compromised of course i muttered almost admiring the smooth way the blatant lie dripped from his thin lips so my information was wrong and you cannot help me i did not say that he continued i know little but perhaps can find out much if i wish what papers do you have of your fathers from that period none i said and i do not think my mother has any either why do you want them no box no books no letters you must find out where he was at all times for if it was said he was in london communicating with thurloe and in fact you can prove he was elsewhere then your cause is advanced greatly did you not think of such a thing i hung my head like a recalcitrant schoolboy and confessed i had not wallis continued to press me asking me the most absurd questions about particular books although i do not recall the details my way was the more direct one of confrontation not nitpicking through letters and documents perhaps i thought mr woods skills would turn out to be useful after all dr wallis nodded in satisfaction write to your people and find out what they have bring it all to me and i will examine it then perhaps i will be able to connect it with things i know that is kind of you he shook his head it is not if there is a traitor at court it is best to know of it but rest assured mr prestcott i will not help you unless you can provide proof that you are correct in my mind time was pressing and my task daily bore in on me the memory of my father urging me to action so i began to prepare my travels and from then on voyaged almost without a break for the next few months until all was resolved i was on the move through one of the worst winters i can recall and out again into spring driven by my duty and my desire for the truth i traveled on my own with little more than my cloak and a pack walking for the most part trudging up road and tracks skirting the huge puddles that swamp all byways at that time of year finding rest where i could in villages and towns or under trees and hedges when there was no alternative it was a time of the greatest anxiety and fear until the last i often doubted i could be successful and was concerned that my many enemies would prove impossible to defeat and yet i also remember that time fondly although that is perhaps merely the rosy glow that age always puts on the memory of youth before i set out i had to honor my promise to help thomas coming across sarah blundy was easy although engaging her in conversation was more difficult she would leave her lodging at six in the morning to go to the woods in merton street where she worked as a servant every day except monday which was devoted to dr grove here she stayed until seven in the evening she was given four hours off every sunday and one day every six weeks to herself most particularly on wednesdays she went to do the marketing for the family at gloucester green a wasteland on the outskirts of town where farmers were allowed to sell their produce she would buy whatever the family needed and as mrs wood was a notorious miser had to carry it back herself as she was not given the money for a hired hand this i decided would be my best opportunity i followed her at a discreet distance to the market waited while she made her purchases then made sure i encountered her at the very moment she was struggling past with two enormously heavy baskets of goods miss blundy is it not i said with a look of pleasure on my face you dont remember me no doubt i had the good fortune to consult your mother some months ago she tossed the hair out of her face and looked at me quizzically then nodded slowly thats right she said eventually you did i trust you found the money well spent it was very helpful thank you most helpful im afraid i did not behave as well as i should have done i was very concerned and upset at the time and this no doubt came through in my lapse of manners thats right she said it did please i said let me make some small amends allow me to carry your baskets they are far too heavy for you without any pretense of protest she instantly handed over both of them that is kind she said with a sigh of relief it is the part of the week i like the least as long as i am not taking you out of your way not at all how do you know where we are going it doesnt matter i said hastily to cover my mistake i have nothing at all to do and i would willingly carry these all the way up heddington hill for the pleasure of your company she tossed her head back and laughed then you certainly dont have much to do fortunately i will not impose on your good offices so much i am heading only for merton street they were formidably heavy and i halfresented the girl for being so willing to hand them both over one would have been more than sufficient what was worse she looked at me with scarcely concealed amusement as i struggled with what she carried as a matter of course are you treated well there i asked as we walkedi panting along and she walking with a light and easy step mrs wood is a good mistress she replied i have nothing to complain about why were you about to offer me a position oh no i cannot afford a servant you are a student is that right i nodded considering that my gown was flapping in the sharp wind and my cap in constant danger of being blown into the gutter it was not a greatly perceptive remark you aim at the church i laughed dear me no do you disapprove of the church am i talking to a secret catholic perhaps i flushed with anger at the remark but remembered in time that i was not passing the morning for my own amusement far from it i said sinner i may be but not to that extent my nonconformity comes from a different direction entirely although in action i am blameless i congratulate you i heaved a sigh i do not congratulate myself there is a group of godfearing people i would like to associate with but they wouldnt even consider accepting me and i cannot say that i blame them and who is that i had best not say i said at least you could risk telling me why you are so unwelcome someone like me i said who would have such a person so steeped in every monstrosity i know it i sincerely repent it but i cannot erase what i have been i always thought that many groups of people welcomed sinners there hardly seems much point in only welcoming the pure they are already saved thats the idea they put about of course i said with a great show of bitterness in truth they turn from the people who really need them they told you this they didnt need to i certainly would not accept someone like myself and if they did i have no doubt they would constantly fear i would disrupt them has your life been so wicked it is difficult to imagine as you can be little older than myself you were no doubt brought up in a righteous and pious family though i pointed out i unfortunately did not have such good fortune it is true i was blessed in my parents she said but you can be certain that any group which would turn you away would not be worth belonging to come sir tell me whom you have in mind i might be able to find out something for you ask whether you would be welcome if you are too timid to approach them yourself i looked at her with gratitude and delight would you i hardly dare ask it is a man called tidmarsh i have heard he is a saintly preacher and that he has gathered around him the few people left in oxford who are not corrupted she stopped and stared at me but he is a quaker she said quietly are you aware of what you are doing what do you mean gods people they may be but he is giving them sore trials if you become associated with them you will lose whatever protection your birth gives you you will be jailed and beaten and spat on in the street you may even have to give your life even if you are spared your friends and family will shun you and you will be held in contempt by the world you will not help me you must be certain you know what you are doing are you one a momentary suspicion passed across her face then she shook her head no she said i am not i was not brought up to invite troubles i think that as prideful as gaudy dress i shook my head at the remark i do not pretend to understand you but i am sorely in need of help find it elsewhere she said if god commands it you must obey but make sure you know what he wants first you are a young gentleman with all the advantages that brings dont throw them away on a whim think and pray hard first theirs is not the only route to salvation we had been walking awhile down st aldates then along merton street and had paused outside the door of her mistresss house while she delivered this last injunction i imagine she was merely trying to shield herself but even so her advice struck me as wise if i had been some impetuous youth on the brink of making a grave mistake she would have given me pause for thought i walked away slightly discomfited which now i understand i was deceiving her and she gave kindness in return it made me very confused until i later learned how much greater her trickery was than mine itwas not difficult to contrive several chance meetings with her in the few weeks that followed and i slowly won her friendship i told her that i had decided to take her advice but my soul was still tormented all the sermons in the world could not reconcile me to the established church i had learned that her father had been an extremist of the worst sort so busy advocating the murder of property owners and the establishment of a republic that he had no time for christ accordingly i had to modify my approach when i think of the hopes that existed in the world only a few years ago i said it makes me grieve what were common aspirations are now cast out and despised and the world is given over to greed and selfishness she stared at me solemnly as though i had uttered a profound truth and nodded we were walking down st giles i having managed to meet her as she was coming back from a cookshop with the woods dinner that evening it smelled delicious hot and tasty and the odors made the juices turn in my stomach i could see that she also was hungry what do you do after you have delivered this then i am finished for the day she said it was already dark and cold in the air come with me let us eat together i can see you are as hungry as i am and you would do me a favor to keep me company she shook her head that is kind jack but you should not be seen with me neither of our reputations will be improved by it what is your reputation i know nothing of it i see only a pretty woman with an empty stomach but if it concerns you we can go to a place i know where the clientele make both of us seem like saints and how do you know such places i told you i was a sinner she smiled i cannot afford it i waved my hand we can discuss that at a later stage once your stomach is filled still she hesitated i leaned over the bowl of food she was carrying and sniffed deeply ah the smell of that gravy running over the lumps of meat i said longingly cant you just imagine a plate of it before you with a fresh crusty loaf and a tankard a plate piled high the steam rising into the air the juices stop she cried laughing out loud all right ill come if only youll stop talking about food good i said so deliver your meal and come with me we went to a small place on the very outskirts of the town past magdalen college and over the river no one from the university not even students ever ate there it being too far away in distance and too low in reputation the food was execrable as well mother roberts was as bad a cook as she was disgusting a person and the food was like the womanlarded with fat and giving off a foul smell sarah looked uneasy in the little room where she served up the gruel but ate with the appetite of one who rarely gets enough the main virtue of mother roberts was that the ale she served was strong and cheap and i regret the passing of those days now that men of business make beer and are trying to stop women selling the ale they brew i believe the great days of this country are over the best quality of the brew was that by the time sarah had drunk a quart of it shed become talkative and susceptible to my questions as much as i remember it i set the conversation down here on my prompting she told me that she not only worked for the wood family but had also found work with dr grove she did little for him except clean his room prepare his fire and a bath once every quarterfor he was fastidiously clean about his personand he paid generously the only trouble she said was his desire to bring her within the established church i said that this grove must be something of a hypocrite to speak so as he had a reputation for being a hidden papist if i thought this would draw her out i was wrong for she frowned and shook her head fervently if he was such she said she had never seen the slightest sign of it neither in his room nor in his manner and he works you hard on the contrary she insisted he had treated her with the utmost kindness at all times even though she had seen him be extremely unpleasant with others her main concern was that he would get a living out in the country soon he had told her only a few days before it was a near certainty this upset me mightily i already knew grove to be blameless in his adherencein fact he was probably more in conformity with the church than thomas himselfand it seemed unlikely that my friends suspicions about his morals had any substance nor could the girl be persuaded to denounce him falsely for money she had an honest air to her he surely cant have much skill at running a parish i said no doubt because he has been in the university for so long otherwise he would be wary of having a pretty young woman to clean his rooms there is bound to be talk there is nothing to talk about so why should anyone trouble i do not know but lack of substance has never dissuaded a gossip yet i think tell me about this reputation of yours that i should be so wary of i said thinking that if i could prove grove was willingly taking a sectary to his bosom this might do just as well so she told me a little about her fathers career in the wars and described what to my ears seemed as black a monster as ever lived a mutineer atheist and rabblerouser even through her description i perceived that the only thing to be said in his favor was his evident courage she did not even know where he was buried as he was too foul even to be allowed a consecrated grave we shared that misfortune at least she was already casting her spell over me i think for i found myself strangely drawn to her despite a freedom about her talk which should have been a warning we had a strange amount in common she worked for grove i had been in his charge both of our fathers had evil reputations and although that of my own was unjustified i knew what it was to be cursed in this fashion and unlike many sectaries she did not have the burning eyes and humorless demeanor of the fanatic nor was she ugly like most of them their souls drawn to jesus because no mortal man wants their bodies she ate with surprising and natural delicacy and when in drink she behaved well i had talked little with women in my life as they were either too protected or too low for proper conversation and my experience with the whore outside tunbridge wells and the way she had laughed at me had begun to rankle i was beginning to want her as we left the table and naturally thought that her willingness to dine alone with me in such a place and her open conversation meant she was equally inclined to me i knew of people such as her in any case and had heard tales of their laxity i was all the more keen because she was of no usethere was no truth in thomass thoughts about grove and she would tell no tales fool that i was to think in such a fashion for her trap was about to shut its jaws as it had done no doubt many times before i thought i was being charming and seductive favoring her with my condescension instead she was exploiting my youth and trusting nature leading me into that sin she fully intended to use for her own devilish ends it was well past eight when we left and already dark so i told her we had best travel back across christ church meadow to avoid the patrols i was caught a few weeks back by the curfew i said i cannot afford to be caught again come with me you will be safer she accepted without demur and we cut past the botanical gardens and into the meadow at which point i slipped my arm around her waist she stiffened slightly but did not protest when we were in the middle of the field and i was certain there was no one close by i stopped took her in my arms and tried to kiss her instantly she began struggling so i squeezed her tightly to show that while some resistance was to be expected she should not overact her part but she kept on struggling and averting her face then started hitting me with the flat of her hands pulling at my hair and making me lose patience i tripped her up and pushed her to the ground still she struggled so perfectly furious at her behavior i was forced to slap her how dare you i exclaimed indignantly once the struggling had momentarily stopped a meal isnt a high enough price for you you expect something for nothing what do you think you are do you plan to pay me back some other way she started struggling again so i pinned her to the cold damp ground pulled up her thin skirt and prepared myself i was hot in blood by now as her refusal had both angered and excited me and i gave no quarter i may have hurt her i do not know but if i did it was her own fault when i had finished i was content and she was subdued she rolled away from me and made no more protest lying on the cold grass there i told her so what was that noise about it cannot have been a surprise to someone like you or did you think i wanted to feed you for your conversation come now if i had wanted talk i would have gone out with one of my fellows not a serving girl whose company has to be hidden i shook her playfully in good humor again dont make such a fuss heres an extra tuppence dont take it amiss youre not some virgin who has lost something of value then the harpy rolled over and slapped me full in the face then scrabbled at my face with her claws and pulled at my hair so hard some of it even came out in her hand i have never been treated in such a fashion in my life and the shock took my breath away she had to be taught a lesson of course and i did so although with little pleasure i have never liked beating people not even servants however deserving it is one of my greatest weaknesses and i fear it leads them to hold me in less respect than they ought there i said when she was crouching on the grass her head in her hands next time i wont want any of this nonsense i had to bend down and talk into her ear to make sure she would hear me i noticed she was not crying you will treat me with proper respect in future now to show there are no hard feelings take this money and lets forget all about it as she didnt want to get up i left her to show i wasnt susceptible to such wheedling behavior the evening had not been as useful as i had imagined in that the problem of dr grove was not yet solved but it had had an agreeable ending i even noticed out of the corner of my eye that she had a strange expression almost a smile i thought on her face as i turned to go that smile stuck in my mind for a long while afterward i would have left the matter there had not a dream that very same night disturbed me greatly i was climbing a staircase and there was a large oak door at the top which was firmly closed it frightened me but i summoned all my strength and pushed it open it should have been the bedroom but instead i found myself in a gloomy and humid cellar the sight inside was a fearful one my father was lying on a bed as naked as noah and covered in blood sarah blundy dressed all in white and wearing that same smile stood over him knife in hand as i entered she turned placidly toward me thus dies a man of honor she said in a whisper i shook my head and pointed accusingly at her you have murdered him i said oh no and she nodded at me i looked down and in my hand was the bloody dagger she had been holding herself only a moment before i tried to let it go but it would not leave my hand you see you are forever stained now she said that was the end of the dream or if there was more i cannot recall it i woke up frightened and it took some effort to rid my spirit of the pall that it cast over me which was strange considering that i had never before paid much attention to such phantasms and indeed had always laughed at those who placed such store by them i asked thomas what he thought when i encountered him and we went for a drink in a tavern and he of course treated the matter with gravity as he did everything their meaning he informed me depended on my constitution what was the dream exactly naturally i left out the background to it he was exceptionally condemnatory of fornication and i did not wish to dispute with him over trifles tell me do you tend to a dominance of the choleric humor he asked when i had done no i said melancholia rather i take it you dont know much about dreams i admitted the fact you should study them he said personally i find them superstitious nonsense but there is no doubt that the vulgar believe all sorts of stuff can be read from them one day such foolishness may be condemned certainly no reputable priest should pay any attention to such drivel however that age has not yet come so we must beware you see he said warming to his theme and shifting his thin backside in his seat in the way he did when he was settling down for a long discourse dreams come from various sources all acting in conjunction generally there is a dominant source and it is that which we must isolate to identify the true nature of the apparition one source is vapors rising from the stomach to the brain causing it to overheat such an occurrence happens when you have overindulged in food or drink did you do that before the dreams far from it i told him thinking back to my meal at mother robertss the next is an imbalance of your humoral constitution but as you tell me that melancholia is dominant in you we must rule that out as well this is obviously a dream in which the choleric exerts its influence the choler tending to produce black dreams because of its color so that leaves the spiritual influence a vision in other words either inspired by angels as a warning or by the devil as a torment and temptation either way the dream does not look well the girl is strongly associated with the death of a man a father a dream of murder is a terrible sign it foretells hardship and imprisonment tell me again what else was there the knife the girl the bed my father again the knife bodes ill was it bright and sharp must have been a knife indicates that many people of ill will are ranged against you i know that already it also foretells that if you have a lawsuit pending you are likely to lose it the bed i asked becoming more and more miserable at the prospect he was laying out before me beds of course are about your marriage prospects and for it to be occupied by the corpse of your father again does not signify well at all as long as he is there you will not marry his body prevents it which means that no woman of quality would touch the son of a traitor like myself i exclaimed again i hardly need a divine messenger to tell me that thomas looked forward into his tankard and then there is the girl he said whose presence puzzles me because the dream says plain that she is your misfortune and your judge and that cannot be why you scarcely know her and i can see no possibility that your current difficulties can be laid at her door can you explain this to me even though i knew more than i could comfortably tell thomas i could not explain it i can do so now for i have pondered long and hard on the matter it is clear to me that my initial visitation to widow blundy created an imbalance amongst the spirits a dependency in which i was embroiled and that by taking my pleasure with the daughter i allowed myself foolishly to fall into a trap that i was prompted by the urgings of a devil and was seduced into her power is now equally obvious the message of the dream was in fact simple had i only the wit to understand for it showed clearly that the girls entrapment was aimed at deflecting me from my quest with the result that failing to clear my fathers name would be a form of murder once i understood that i was fortified and encouraged in my resolve of course such insight did not come instantly for i have never claimed to be a cunning thinker in such matters i learned as all men must by experience and from the application of common sense so that ultimately only one explanation is left which answers all at that time my only thought was that the girl might lay some piddling complaint against me to the proctors of the university who took a poor view of students consorting with the towns whores and that the investigation might force me to remain in town a defense was needed and attack is the best form of it when i left thomas and walked up carfax i came on an exceedingly ingenious solution in brief i tipped mary fullerton a vegetable girl in the market and one of the most dishonest and scurrilous wretches i knew to confirm the story by telling how she had gone one day to deliver some fruit to dr grove and been mistaken for sarah the moment she got in the room i instructed her to say grove had come up behind her and started fondling her breasts when she protested here she claimed to be a virtuous girl which certainly was not the case grove said what girl you do not want what you were so eager to have yesterday better still i sought out wood and told him a story about dr grove and his rutting ways with his servant it was guaranteed that within a day or so the story would spread and soon get back to the fellows of new college such was woods ability as a gossip so let the slut complain if she will i thought no one will believe her and she will do nothing but bring scandal and shame on her own head looking back now i am less sanguine my cunning did not deliver the living into thomass hands and though it might have fended off sarah blundys worldly revenge it enraged her to ever greater heights of malice i knew nothing of that when i left oxford a few days latera blessed release for i always detested the town and have not revisited it for more than ten years nowand believed rather that i had enjoyed the girl protected myself and helped my friend at one and the same time such contentment did not last long after i crossed the border into warwickshire and made my way to my mother although again i ignored the first sign that anything was amiss i spent money on a carriage to warwick planned to walk the last fifteen miles to save money and set off in good heart pausing after an hour or so for some water and a bite of bread it was a lonely spot on the road and sat down on a grassy verge to rest after a while i heard a rustling in the bushes and got up to investigate i had scarcely walked four paces into the undergrowth than with a hellish squalling a polecat sprang up and scratched my hand causing a deep gash which bled profusely i started back in alarm and fright and tripped over a root but the animal did not press home its advantage it vanished immediately as though into thin air and had it not been for the blood dripping from my hand i would have sworn id imagined it i told myself of course that it was my own fault that i had probably got too near its brood and paid the price only later did it occur to me that in my many years acquaintance with that part of the world i had never heard anyone mention such creatures living there later of course i knew better the origins of the beast but then i merely blamed myself bound up my hand and got on with the journey arriving after three days travel at my mothers people our destitution had left her no choice but to throw herself on their charity and they had taken her back but not as family ought my mother had disobliged them mightily by marrying as she pleased and they did not let her forget for an instant that in their opinion her sorrow was punishment for her disobedience accordingly they made her live little better than a servant true she was allowed to eat at the main tablethey maintained the old custom now almost forgotten of eating with the entire householdbut they always made sure she sat at the end and subjected her to almost daily insult they were the very model of what have since come to be known as trimmersthey would have got on well with dr wallis had they ever met under cromwell the family sang their psalms and praised the lord under charles they bought the family curate his vestments and read the book of common prayer every evening the only thing beneath them i think was popery for they were the most fervent haters of rome and constantly on the lookout for the malign touch of priestcraft i always loved the house but i believe it has been remodeled now reconstructed along modern lines by one of sir christophers innumerable imitators now the rooms are regular and wellproportioned and the light no doubt floods in through the modern sashes the chimneys draw properly and the drafts are kept to a minimum for my part i regret this enthusiastic conformity to whatever men of fashion in europe tell us is elegant there is something false about all that symmetry it used to be that a gentlemans house was the history of his family and you could see in its lines when they had been in funds and expansive or when times were hard those curling chimney stacks and corridors and eaves stacked one next to the other provided the comfort of a sweet disorder one would have thought after cromwells attempts to impose uniformity on us all through his armies that no more was needed but i am out of harmony with the times as usual the old houses are being destroyed one by one and replaced by gimcrack structures which will probably last no longer than the grasping arrogant new families who construct them built so fast they can be swept away as quickly along with all the people they contain how do you stand for such humiliation madam i asked my mother when i visited her in her room one evening i had been there for some weeks and could stand the mean piety the arrogant selfimportance of these people no more to have to endure their superiority every day would try the patience of a saint not to mention their insufferable reproaches and pained kindnesses she shrugged as she looked up from her embroidery it was her habit to pass time in this way in the evening making cloths which she would tell me would be mine once i had found a wife and an income you should not be unfair to them she said they are more than generous to me they were under no obligation after all your own brother i cried of course he is under an obligation as your husband would have been had the positions been reversed she did not answer for a while and concentrated on her labor while i stared once more into the big log fire you are wrong jack she said eventually your father behaved very badly toward my brother i am sure it was all my uncles fault i said no you know how i revered your father but he could be hottempered and rash this was one of those occasions he was entirely at fault but refused either to admit it or make amends i cannot credit it i said you do not know what i am talking about she said still patient i will give you a small example during the war before your father left to fight abroad the king sent round collectors to levy an impost on all the great families the demands on my brother were harsh and unfair naturally he wrote to my husband asking him to intercede and get the amount reduced he wrote back a very offensive letter saying that with so many people giving their lives he did not intend to help my brother avoid giving his silver it would have been a small enough service to do for his family and when parliament in turn made its levy my brother had to sell a large parcel of land he was now so impoverished he never forgave your father i would have arrived with a troop of horse to take the money myself i said the needs of the kings cause outweighed all others had more people seen that parliament would have been defeated the king was fighting to preserve the law not merely to keep himself on the throne what point was there in success if everything he was battling for was destroyed thereby without the families of the realm the king was nothing preserving our fortune and our influence did as much for his cause as fighting for him how convenient i scoffed yes she said and when this king returned your uncle was there to take up his position as magistrate and reestablish order without my brother who would have controlled this part of the world made sure our people welcomed the king back your father was penniless and without influence i would rather have a penniless hero for a father than a rich coward i said unfortunately you now claim descent from a penniless traitor and live on the kindness of the rich coward he was no traitor you of all people cannot believe that all i know is that he brought ruin on his family and made his wife a beggar the king gave him life and honor what else could he do spare me your childishness she snapped war is not a tale of chivalry the king took more than he gave he was a fool and your father was a greater fool for sustaining him for years i had to juggle with creditors bribe soldiers and sell our lands just so he could be the man of honor i watched our funds dwindle to nothing so he could cut a figure as an equal with noblemen on ten times the income i watched him reject a settlement with parliament because the man sent to negotiate with him was not a gentleman that particular show of honor cost us dear believe me and when we were reduced to penury i had to come with nothing but the clothes on my back to throw myself on my brothers mercy he took me in fed me and housed me while your father dissipated what remained of our fortune he pays for your education so you can live and he has promised to set you up in london when you are ready in return he gets nothing from you but contempt and childish remarks you compare his honor with your fathers tell me jack where is the honor in a paupers grave i sat back stunned by her vehemence and grievously disappointed my poor father betrayed even by the one person who owed him all obedience my uncle had even managed to subvert her i did not blame her how could a woman resist such pressures when they were constantly applied it was my uncle i blamed using my fathers absence to blacken him to the person who should have defended his name to the last you talk as though you are going to say he was a traitor after all i said eventually when my head had stopped spinning i cannot believe that i do not know she said and so i try to believe the best in the year or so before he fled i hardly saw him i do not know what he was doing you do not care who betrayed him it does not disturb you that john thurloe is free though guilty while your own husband lies dead through betrayal you do not want revenge for this no i do not it is done and cannot be changed you must tell me what you know however little it is when did you last see him she stared long at the fire that was fading in the grate and letting the cold wrap itself around our bodies it was always an icy house and even in the summer you needed a heavy coat if you went out of the main rooms now winter was coming in the leaves falling and the winds beginning to blow the chill was taking over the house once more it took some urging before she answered my questions about papers and letters and documents which might show what took place for walliss request was still in my mind and i wished to oblige him if i could several times she refused changing the subject and trying to divert me into other matters but each time i insisted eventually she gave way realizing it would be easier than to resist but her unwillingness was obvious and i never entirely forgave her for it i told her that i had above all to know everything possible about what had happened around january of just before my father fled and when the plot against him was reaching its climax where was he what had he done or said had she even seen him in that period she said she had indeed it was the last time she had ever seen him i received a message through a trusted friend that your father needed me she began then he came here unannounced and at night he had no dealings with your uncle and spent only one night here then left again how was he very grave and preoccupied but in good spirits and he had a troop with him she shook her head just one man which man she waved my question aside he stayed the night as i say but didnt sleep just fed himself and his comrade then came to talk to me he was very secretive making sure that no one heard and making me promise not to reveal a word to my brother and before you ask i have not done so i knew at the bottom of my heart that i was on the verge of receiving a message of unparalleled importance that my father had meant me to hear this otherwise he would have sworn my mother to complete silence go on i said he talked to me very intently he said he had discovered the worst treason imaginable which had shocked him so greatly he had initially refused to believe the evidence of his own eyes but now he was convinced and he was going to act i all but cried out in frustration at this what treason what act what discoveries my mother shook her head he said it was too much to confide in a woman you must understand that he never told me any secrets or gave me any confidences at all you should be surprised he said so much not that he said so little and that was all he said he would uncover and destroy men of the greatest evil it was dangerous but he was confident of success then he pointed to the man who had been sitting in the corner all the while his name madam what was his name at least i thought i might have something but again she shook her head she did not know he may have been called ned i do not know i think i had met him before before the war your father told me that ultimately only your own people were to be trusted and that this man was such a person if anything should not take place as planned then this man would come and give me a packet which contained everything he knew i was to guard it well and use it only when i was sure it was safe to do so and what else nothing she said simply shortly after they left and i never saw him again i received a message from deal a few weeks later saying he was having to leave the country for a short while but would be back he never did come back as you know and this man this ned she shook her headhe never came and i never received any package however disappointing it was that my mother had nothing to help dr wallis the information she gave me was an unexpected bonus i had not expected her to have such knowledge and had applied to her only as an afterthought sad though it is for a son to acknowledge i found it increasingly hard to maintain my civility with her so much was she being drawn back to her own family which had only ever approved of my father while he possessed a good estate no my purpose in going into warwickshire was quite different for i wanted to consult the papers concerning my lincolnshire estate so that i might know when i could expect to take possession i knew that the matter had been complicated my father had told me so on many occasions by the time the fighting became serious and his confidence in the king began to slacken he was aware that far more than his own life was at risk and that the entire family might well be destroyed consequently he drew up a settlement designed to protect it in brief and following the latest practice in the country he devised the real estate on a trust for the use of himself and on his death of myself a will drawn up at the same time made my uncle his executor and sir william compton my guardian charged with the proper disposal of both the personal and real estate it sounds complicated but nowadays any man of property will understand it all perfectly well it has become such an ordinary means of protecting a family from danger back then however such complexities were all but unheard ofthere is nothing like civil strife to make men ingenious and lawyers rich i could not ask to see the papers as they were in the keeping of my uncle and it was scarcely likely he would agree to the demand nor did i want to warn him of my interest lest he take steps to destroy them or alter anything in his own favor i had no intention of allowing my uncle to cheat me an activity which came as second nature to him so that night when i was sure everyone was asleep i made my search my uncles study where he conducted the estate business and held meetings with his agents was unchanged from the days when he used to summon me to give me lectures about godfearing good conduct and i crept quietly in remembering without even thinking about it that the door had a squeak that could easily rouse the entire household holding up my candle i could make out the stout oak table where the accounts were laid every michaelmas and the ironbanded chests in which the vouchers and accounts were kept formidably difficult are they not do not worry when they are your responsibility you will understand them just remember the golden rules of propertynever trust your managers and never bear too hard on your tenants you will lose in the end thus i remember my father talking to me i suppose when i was five maybe less id come into his own office at harland house because the door was open even though i knew it was forbidden my father was alone with reams of paper all around the sand shaker by his elbow the wax heated for affixing the seals to the documents the candle smoking in the wind i half expected to be beaten but instead he looked up and smiled at me then gathered me onto his lap and showed me the papers when he had more time he would begin my education he said for a gentleman had much to learn if he was to prosper that day never came and the thought made my eyes smart with tears as i remembered that room at my own home the home i might have lost forever and which i had not even seen for more than a decade even so the smell of it came back to me strong and sure a mixture of leather and oil and i stood for some time in sadness before coming to and remembering my task and the urgency of getting on with it my uncle used to keep the keys to the strongbox in the sword cupboard and it was here that i immediately looked when i recovered myself fortunately his habits had not changed and the big iron key was in the usual place opening the box took no time at all and then i sat down at the big desk positioned the candle and began to go through the documents which i took out one by one was there for several hours before the candle failed it was tiresome work for most of the bundles were of no interest and were discarded the moment they were opened but eventually i found the details of the settlement i also found twenty pounds which after some hesitation i took not that wanted to rely on such tainted money but i reasoned that by rights it was mine in any case so i should have no qualms about using it words cannot express the full horror of what i discovered for the documents provided a complete and dispassionate outline of the most despicable and complete fraud i will put it simply for no amount of ornamentation will increase the effectmy entire estate was sold by sir william compton the man appointed to guard my interest to my uncle the man supposedly entrusted with maintaining the integrity of the land this foul piece of trickery had been accomplished the moment my poor father was laid into his paupers grave for the final deed of sale was signed and dated not two months after his death i had in short been utterly and entirely dispossessed i had never liked my uncle and had always detested his conceit and his arrogant ways but i had never suspected he might be capable of such a monstrous betrayal for him to take advantage of his familys disarray and turn it to his own profit to make use of my fathers death and my minority to pursue such a grubby scheme to coerce my own mother into connivance with the destruction of her sons interestall this was far worse than i could ever have imagined he assumed that my age and lack of funds would prevent me from fighting back i determined then and there that he would shortly learn how very wrong he was what i could not understand were the actions of sir william compton my guardian and a man who had always treated me with the greatest of kindness if he too had conspired against me then i was truly alone but despite the clear evidence i could not believe that a man of whom my father always spoke in the highest terms to whom indeed he was prepared to consign his heir could have acted with duplicity a bluff hearty man the very backbone of the nation in robust honesty described even by cromwell himself as that godly cavalier he must also have been duped to act in this fashion if i could find out how then again my cause would advance i knew i would soon have to question him as well but recoiled from the task until i could present him with more evidence for i had been dispatched from his house of compton wynyates the moment my father fledi did not know what reception i would receive and i admit was afraid of his scorn i knew as i closed the casket and locked it then slipped quietly back to my room that my task had grown enormously in complexity and that i was now more alone than i ever dreamed for i was betrayed in one way or another by everyone even those closest to me and had no resources but my own determination every step i took it seemed my labors grew greater and more difficult for now i not only had to find the man who betrayed my father i also had to confound those who so swiftly moved to profit from his disgrace it had not yet occurred to me that the two quests might be one and the same nor even that in comparison to the other struggle that was about to burst upon me in full flood these problems were almost trivial i soon received some indication of what lay ahead for about two hours before dawn i slept i wish i had not i should have left the house immediately and been on my way had i done so i would have avoided the most fearsome experience of a night that was already harrowing i do not know how long i was asleep but it was still dark when a voice awoke me i drew the bed curtain back and saw in the casement of the window the clear figure of a woman leaning in as though standing outside though it was on the second floor although i could not make out the face the flowing dark hair instantly confirmed my suspicions it was the blundy girl boy she hissed time and again you will fail i will ensure it then with a sigh more like wind than breath she vanished i sat shivering with cold for an hour or more until i had convinced myself that what had occurred was no more than the fever of a disordered and tired mind i told myself that the dream was nothing just as the earlier one had been nothing i reminded myself of all the worthy priests who had said that to pay credence to such imaginings was presumptuous but they were wrong while i have no doubt that many socalled prophets who interpret their dreams as divine messages are ignorant and harebrained mistaking vapors for angels and humors for the lord some dreams are indeed spirituous in origin and not all come from god as i tried to lie back in the bed and sleep once more the wind rattling against the window kept me awake and i remembered that i had not opened it before i went to bed yet there it was opened and fixed open although not by my hand i changed my plan when i went down the next morning and left as swiftly as was decent i said no farewells to my mother and certainly none to my uncle i could not bear the sight of them and was afraid i might let slip some remark and reveal that i had uncovered their plot i will not describe my turbulent emotions as i made my way to the border which divides the counties of warwickshire and oxfordshire that my soul burned with the desire for revenge must be obvious and i do not feel the need to put down on paper what any man in my position must have experienced it is my task to describe what i did not what i felt on the matterthe transience of emotions makes them a sorry waste of time in the history of man it is glorious action which provides all matter of significance and all lessons for posterity do we need to know how augustus felt when he heard the news that actium had extended his dominion over the entire globe would it magnify the glory of cato to have a record of his sentiments as the knife plunged into his breast emotions are but the tricks of the devil sent to tempt us into doubt and hesitation and obscure the deeds committed whether good or ill no man of sense i think will ever pay them much attention for they are a distraction a surrender to womanish sentiment that should be concealed from the world if they cannot be suppressed in the heart it is our task to overcome the passions not digress on their intensity so i will say merely i was troubled that as fast as i made progress in one sphere i was assaulted in the other the more i stalked john triurloe the more demons stalked me for i had not shaken off the concern generated by the succession of dreams and visitations and my brain was so befuddled that their obvious cause was hidden instead i fruitlessly pondered this disharmony as i trudged southward through the heartland of the wars taking in almost every mile the continued record of destruction that had been meted out to the land so many buildings so many fine dwellings were still in disarray their owners like my own father no longer having the money to rebuild manor houses burned out or dismantled for their stone fields still abandoned and overgrown with weeds for the tenants will not work without a firm hand to keep them in their place i stopped in southam in the midst of a fit of that melancholy which has always plagued me and spent some money on a bleed in the hope that i might be rebalanced and fortified then weakened by the experience i spent more money on a bed for the night it was providential that i did for i heard at the table that a great magus had passed through that same day wise in healing and all matters of the spirit the man who told mewho joked but was frightened withinsaid he was an irishman who had a guardian angel that extended protection over him that he might never come to harm he was one of the adepti who could cure merely by passing his hands over the afflicted spot and was in constant converse with spirits of all forms which he could see as ordinary men see each other i heard also that this man was heading south intending to make his way to london for he was intent on offering his services to the king himself this venture i understand came to nothing his ability to cure by touch and it was a real skill i saw it myself and many others attested to it was considered presumptuous for he said he could cure scrofula by this means knowing full well that this is the prerogative of kings and has been since time immemorial being irish as well he was naturally seen as subversive and was constrained to leave london after only a short stay so the next morning i set off confident that my youthful legs and early start would soon allow me to catch up with this valentine greatorex and consult him about my problems at least i knew i would not have to beg since the money from my uncles chest was still in my belt and i could afford for once whatever was asked of me i caught up with him within a few hours at a village just on the oxfordshire side of the border he was staying at an inn and once i learned this i hired a room myself then sent up word of my desire for an interview i was summoned immediately i went to the meeting with some trepidation for although i might have met a wizard before i had never encountered an irishman i knew of course that they were terrible people wild and disobedient with a monstrous cruelty the stories of the massacres they perpetrated on poor protestants in late years were still fresh in my mind and the way they continued to battle despite the chastisement meted out to them by cromwell at drogheda and other places proved that they were scarcely human in their bloody viciousness i do believe that the only time cromwell enjoyed the full and unrestrained support of the english was when he set out to subdue these murderous creatures mr greatorex however satisfied neither my notion of what a wizard nor of what an irishman should be like i imagined him old stooped flamehaired and with wild staring eyes he was in fact scarcely a dozen years senior to myself with a gentlemanly bearing neat and precise movements and a solemnity of expression that would have done credit to a bishop until he spoke he could have passed for a prosperous trader in any small town in the country his voice however was extraordinary and i had never heard the like before although i now know that the softness of expression and musicality of tone is characteristic of these people who use words of honey to disguise their natures as he plied me with questions his words swept gently over me and i relaxed until i was aware of nothing in the room at all except his voice and the gentleness of expression in his eyes i understood i think how a rabbit must feel when it is frozen by the look of the snake and how eve must have felt also willing to do anything at all to please the serpent and earn more words of comfort from it who was i where had i come from how had i heard of him about what did i wish to consult him all these were necessary questions and similar to the ones widow blundy had put to me to assure herself i was not sent to trap her i answered fully until we came to my encounter with sarah blundy then greatorex leaned forward in his chair let me tell you sir he said softly that it is a very great mistake to tell me lies i do not take kindly to being deceived i am not interested in how badly you behaved although i can see you abused this girl shamefully i did nothing of the sort i protested she was willing she must have been so and put on the pretense afterwards in order to extract more money from me which you did not give her i was generous enough and now you fear you are cursed tell me your dreams i told him and about the polecat he listened quietly as i recounted each piece of evidence it did not occur to you that the daughter of the cunning woman might be able to encompass such attacks i said it had not but the moment he suggested the idea that sarah blundy was responsible i realized that it was obvious and knew also that my inability to see was itself part of the enchantment she had laid on me and have you spoken to her since greatorex continued it may offend your dignity but often the surest way of dealing with such matters is to make amends if she accepts your apology she must then remove any curse she has placed on you and if she does not then other measures will be required but it is the best first step i believe you are frightened of her you do not think you can contend with her i know nothing of the matter if she truly has such power then it would indeed be difficult i see no shame in admitting it darkness is strong but i have contested such people before and i think have had as many victories as defeats now tell me what does she have of yours i told him i did not understand the question but when he explained i described the way she had scratched at my face with her nails and pulled some of my hair from my head i had hardly spoken before he walked across to me before i could react in any way he drew out a knife and grabbed me by the hair dragging the knife across the back of my hand in one swift movement then he simply tore a lock from my head i jumped up cursing him with all my strength and inventiveness the magic of his voice gone in an instant from my mind greatorex however merely resumed his seat as though nothing of importance had passed and sat waiting for me to control myself my apologies he said when i had calmed but i needed blood and hair in the same circumstances in which she took it the more painful the taking the more powerful the relic i believe that may be why such power is attributed to the relics of saints and why the remains of martyrs who died in great agony are considered the most potent i clutched my head with my bloody hand and glared at him papist nonsense i growled what now now now you go away for a few hours to be certain that you are indeed bewitched rather than merely believing so and to discover what are the forces ranged against you i need to cast your horoscope it is the surest indeed it is the only way of penetrating the darkness if only the courts would make more use of people like myself then the process of the law would be that much the surer but in this foolish age it is frowned on so much the worse for the age i was told no witch has ever been caught by the law do you believe that some have no doubt been punished by accident but can the law apprehend such people if they do not wish it no i cannot credit it so these women who have burned of late they were falsely accused for the most part not deliberately i am sure there is too much evidence of the devils presence among us for their existence to be gainsaid any sensible man must conclude that the powers of evil have been trying to seduce christian women taking advantage of the troubles that have so stirred the souls of men once authority is broken satan sees his chance besides the only sensible argument against witchcraft is that women do not have souls and therefore have nothing to trade with the devil but this is flatly contradicted by all authority nothing can be done you think such people cannot be stopped not by you lawyers how do you know i am a lawyer he smiled but ignored the question the whole of existence is a contest between light and dark all the battles that are important for mankind have been waged without most people even knowing they were taking place god has given special powers to his servants on earth the magi white witches adepti call them what you will they are men of secret knowledge charged with contending with satan from generation to generation you mean alchemists people like that he looked scornful once maybe i meant such people but their skill and power is waning they seek now to explain what is not to explore its power alchemy is now a mechanical trade full of brews and potions which will be able to explain how things are made but loses sight of the greater questions of what they are for you are an alchemist he shook his head no i am an astrologer and if you will a necromancer i have studied the enemy and i know his powers my skills are limited but i know what i can do if i can help you i will if not i will tell you so he stood up now you must give me the information i require then leave me in peace for a few hours i need the exact time of your birth and the place of it i need the time and place of your conjunction with this girl and the times of your dreams and encounters with the animals i gave him all that he required and he dismissed me to walk around the village which i was quite happy to do for i knew it had been the scene of one of the battles of the war in which my father had played a distinguished and noble role by advising the king so well that the day ended with the capture of all the enemys cannon and the death of much of his force had the king kept my father close to him rather than relying on the advice of betterborn but less experienced men the result might have been different but the king came increasingly to rely on cowardly penpushers like clarendon who wanted merely to surrender not to fight it is lowlying lush land around the northern part of oxfordshire fine countryside for crop and cavalry and its richness could be seen even when all was dead the fields brown and still and the trees stripped of their leaves for winter the hills give some concealment to troops but do not greatly impede their movement and the woods are small in scale and easily skirted i walked out of the village and up the river imagining in my mind how the two armies had slowly edged their way upstream the king on one side general waller and the rebels on the other watching each other like cocks in a ring for a slip which would give the slightest advantage it was my father who gave the advice which turned the day encouraging the king to move the van forward and advance the rear at a slower pace opening up a gap in the middle which he knew a man like waller would not be able to resist sure enough waller sent a good portion of his horse and all his cannon over the little bridge at cropredy and they were still in disarray from breaking ranks to cross when the good earl of cleveland warned of the tactic fell upon them and cut them to ribbons it must have been a wonderful sight to have beheld to have seen the cavalry so far from their current perfumed dissolution charging in perfect order their sabers glistening in the sun for i remember my father saying that it had been a warm cloudless day of midsummer tell me i asked of a laborer who passed me by giving me the downcast look of sullen suspicion which all villagers adopt with foreigners where is the tree the king dined under the day of the battle he scowled at me and made to sidle past me but i grabbed him by the arm and insisted he nodded in the direction of a small lane there is an oak tree in the field at the end of that track he said that is where the tyrant ate i struck him full in the face for his impudence mind your tongue i warned him you will not talk like that in my presence he shrugged as if my reproof was of no importance to him at all i speak the truth he said as is my duty and right you have no rights and your sole duty is to obey i replied incredulously the king was fighting to save us all and on that day all my crops were trampled my son killed and my house ransacked by his troops what cause do i have to love him i moved to hit him again but he guessed my intention and shrank back like a dog that has been beaten too often and so i waved the miserable creature to be out of my sight but he had spoiled my mood my plan of standing where the king had stood so i could breathe in the atmosphere of the time seemed less appealing now and after a moments hesitation i turned back to the inn in the hope that greatorex had finished his task he had not and he made me wait a good hour before he came down the stairs bearing the sheets of paper which supposedly bore all my past and future on them in his little squiggles his attitude and mood had changed no doubt to frighten me and thus put up his fee whereas before he had been relaxed and i think treated my tale with less than complete seriousness now he had a heavy frown and an air of the greatest concern i had never troubled before and have troubled little since with astrology i care not to know what the future brings for by and large i already know i have my place and in the fullness of time tomorrow or thirty years hence i shall die as god wills astrology is of use only to those who do not know their position or what it will be its popularity is a mark of a people in distress and a society in torment no doubt that is why such people as greatorex were so much in demand during the troubles for then a man could be a grandee one moment and less than nothing the next i have no doubt that if the leveling principle prevails amongst us and more men claim advancement merely for merit then the fortunetellers will profit the more certainly that was why i needed him then and why i dismissed such people when i needed them no longer no man who truly accepts the will of god can attend to astrology now think for whatever happens is the goodness of providence if we accept that we should not want to know more well i asked when he had composed his papers before me what is the answer it is disconcerting and worrying he said with a theatrical sigh and i hardly know what to make of it we live in the strangest of times and the heavens themselves bear witness to great prodigies i myself know this there is a great teacher far greater than i can ever be who might explain it to me if i can find him i have traveled from ireland for that express purpose but so far with little success times are hard indeed i said dryly but what about my chart it disturbs me greatly he said peering at me as though i was newly introduced to him and i scarcely know how to advise you it seems you were born for a great purpose perhaps this is the currency of all soothsayers i do not know but i felt that he was saying the truth and i felt that it was so what greater purpose was there after all than the one i had taken on myself greatorexs confirmation of it bolstered my strength greatly you were born on the day the battle of edgehill was fought he continued a strange and frightening day the skies were in disarray and portents abounded i did not point out that you hardly needed to be an adept to see that and you were born not greatly distant from the battle he continued which means your chart was affected by the events which went on around you you know of course that the chart of the querent intersects with that of the country in which he is born i nodded so you were born a scorpio with your ascendant in libra now as far as the question you pose is concerned you asked it at exactly two oclock and it was for that time that i prepared the horoscope the best sign of witchcraft is if the lord of the twelfth house be in the sixth or if one planet be lord of the ascendant and the twelfth which may happen when the proper ascendant may be intercepted then it may be witchcraft if the converse applies however and the lord of the ascendant be in the twelfth or sixth then it shows that the querent occasioned his problems by his own willfulness i sighed heavily beginning to regret having placed myself in the hands of a canting magician evidently greatorex perceived my disdain do not dismiss this sir he said you think this is magic yet it is not it is the purest of science the only way man has to penetrate the secrets of the soul and of time itself everything is performed through the finest of calculations and if it is the case that the lowest is joined to the highest as all christians must believe then it is obvious that the study of the one must reveal the truth of the other did not the lord say let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs genesis that is all astrology is reading the signs that god in his providence has given us to guide our way if we will only take notice of them simple in theory though hard in practice i do not for a moment doubt the truth of it i said but the details weary me it is the answers that give me greatest concern am i bewitched or not you must let me answer in full for a partial answer is no response at all it is the conjunction of your birth chart with the transitional chart which is of the greatest concern to me for they are strangely at odds indeed i have never seen the like before so the transitional chart indicates clearly that some form of enchantment is present for venus which rules your twelfth house is most firmly in the sixth so the answer is yes please be patient your birth chart also places the ascendant in the twelfth which indicates that you are inclined to be the author of your own misfortunes the opposition of jupiter and venus makes you prone to magnify your problems without justification and the conjunction of the moon in the ninth house and in pisces means you are liable to fantastical notions that lead you into rash acts which indicates the need for caution in this matter and the most cautious move you can make is to acknowledge your fault for you are at fault and her anger has the force of justice behind it whatever she might be the easiest solution is not to fight it but to ask forgiveness and if she refuses she will not if your contrition is genuine i will make it the more plain the indicator of the enchantment is in exact opposition to the conjunction of your troubles caused by mars in the second house and what does that mean that means the two aspects of your life are one and the same your fear of bewitchment and what you tell me of your other troubles are intimately connected so much so that the one is the other i stared at him in astonishment for he had said the same of my chart as thomas had said of my dream but how can that possibly be she never knew my father nor could she possibly have known him surely her power is not such that she can intervene in affairs of that importance he shook his head i state the situation i cannot offer an explanation but i do urge you to take my advice this girlthis witch as you call heris more powerful than any i have ever encountered more than you far more than me he said solemnly and i am not ashamed to admit it i would no more go against her than i would jump off the tallest cliff and nor should you for any victories will be illusory and defeat will be total any countermagic i can offer is unlikely to be of use even if it has a temporary effect give it to me anyway so i know what to do he thought for a moment as if doubting my sudden enthusiasm do you give me your solemn word that you will take my advice and approach the girl first of course whatever you say i said hastily what is the spell give it to me you have to do it yourself he handed me a phial containing the hair and the blood he had so violently taken from me this is silver which is the moons metal it contains a simulacrum of what she has of you you must either get your own back from her and destroy it to remove the object of her spells or failing that you must take this phial and fill it with her urine or her blood bury it when the moon is waning as long as it is undiscovered she will have no power over you i took the phial and put it carefully in my bag thank you sir i am grateful now what do i owe i am not finished there is a matter far more grave i think i have heard enough thank you i have my potion and want no more of you listen my friend you are rash and foolish and you do not listen well to those wiser than yourself please do so now as a great deal is at stake oh very well tell me i repeat again that the girl who is the focus of your attention is no ordinary witch if she is one at all you asked earlier whether i was afraid to contest witches and the answer is no generally speaking i am not but in this case i am indeed very frightened do not engage with this creature i beg you and there is one other thing as well and what is that others might take your fortune and livelihood even your life but your greatest enemy is yourself for only you have the power to destroy your own soul tread carefully some people are fated from the moment of their birth but i hold that nothing is absolutely preordained and we can choose a different path if we will i tell you what may be not what must be now you are talking nonsense to frighten me and get more money listen to me he said leaning forward and staring at me intently using all his powers to bend me to his will the conjunction of your birth is strange and frightening and you should beware i have seen it only once before i do not wish to see it again and that was in a book i was allowed to see only once it belonged to placidus de tito and he had it by descent from julius maternus himself the greatest magus of them all perhaps in it there were many horoscopes drawn from many periods it had the birth charts of augustus and constantine of augustine and many many popes there were soldiers and churchmen and politicians and doctors and saints but only one did i see which was like yours and you must take warning from it if you can and if you will i tell you again that if you do not heed my warnings then far more than your life is at risk and whose horoscope was it he looked at me gravely as though afraid to speak it belonged to iscariot he said softly i am quite prepared to admit that i left that man shaken to the depths of my soul terrified at what he told me and perfectly under his spell i will even say that it took some considerable time before i recovered my balance and was able to dismiss most of what he said as a tissue of nonsensical babblings i give him full credit for his skill for he had mixed a little knowledge with a great deal of impudence to forge a weapon of great power able to command him large sums of money from the credulous after a while i was even able to laugh at the way he had imposed himself upon me for i had quite believed him he had sensed my fear and concern and had exploited my worries to enrich himself how he did this how all these people act is clear after a little thought his questioning taught him all he needed to know and he then wrapped up in his magical words what i had already said mixing it in with the sort of common advice my mother might well have given me add all this to obscure references to occult texts and you have the perfect fraudit is easy to succumb and requires great effort of character to resist but resist i did although i considered that there were a few nuggets among the dross i had received to begin with the very idea of begging that girls pardon disgusted me but wiser counsels prevailed as i lurched my way back to oxford what was my purpose after all but to remove the stain on my family and recover what was mine if this girl was in some way bound up in that then the sooner her malign influence was removed the better i had in fact little faith in the mans magic he had told me little that was remarkable and much which was clearly wrong i might have to resort to his spells but i had little confidence in them and decided that painful though it might be an approach to the girl was the most likely and the most direct way of removing the problem nonetheless i decided first to discuss my investigations with thomas and went to see him immediately on my return to see how his campaign was faring i did not get around to my own problems for some time so deep was he in misery i learned then that my stratagem for helping him had not been as effective as i had desired for dr grove had dismissed sarah blundy when the rumors about his morals began to spread and his action was seen as a sign of resolute sacrifice rather than an admission of guilt already they are saying that he is likely to get the living thomas said gloomily of the thirteen senior fellows five have already offered their support to him and some of those counted on do not look me in the eye anymore jack how could this have happened you know what he is like more than most people i asked the warden for reassurance only this morning but he was stiff and unfriendly to me it is the changing times i said remember many of groves old friends are in positions of influence close to the government even warden woodward must beware of displeasing the powerful at such a time he was put in by parliament and must give regular signs of conformity himself lest he be put out again by the king but dont despair i said heartily for his long face and heavy sighs were beginning to grate upon me the battle is not yet lost you have a few weeks yet you must keep cheerful as there is nothing people like less than seeing reproach in a face at every meal it will harden their hearts against you even more another heavy sigh greeted these words of wisdom you are right of course he said i will do my best to look as though poverty was nothing to me and seeing the lesser man win gave me the greatest of pleasure exactly just what you must do so distract me he said tell me your progress i trust you paid my respects to your mother i did indeed i replied even though i had forgotten and although i was not best pleased to see her i learned much of interest from the trip i have discovered for example that my own guardian sir william compton was persuaded to connive with my uncle to defraud me i said it with as much levity as i could manage although bitterness gripped my heart as i explained the situation to him typically he chose to search for a kindly explanation perhaps he thought it for the best if as you say the estate was indebted there was a risk you would be thrown into a debtors prison the moment you reached your majority then it was surely a kindness on his part i shook my head vehemently there is more to it i know it i said why was he was so willing to believe that my father his best friend was guilty of such a crime what had he been told who had told him perhaps you should ask him i intend to do just that when i am ready but first i have some other matters to attend to i found sarah blundy late that evening after a long wait i had thought of going to her abode but decided that i could not face mother and daughter together and so stood at the end of the alley for upward of an hour before she emerged i do not mind admitting that my heart was beating fast as i approached and that the wait had put me in a foul temper miss blundy i said as i walked up behind her she spun round quickly and took a few steps backward her eyes instantly blazing with the most vicious hatred keep away from me she spat her mouth curled up in an ugly snarl i must talk with you i have nothing to say to you nor you to me now leave me in peace i cannot i must talk to you please i beg you hear me out she shook her head and made to turn away and continue her journey much as i hated to do so i ran round in front of her to block her path and assumed the most supplicatory of expressions miss blundy i beseech you listen to me perhaps my expression was more convincing than i thought for she stopped and assuming a look of defiancemingled i was glad to see with some fearwaited well i am listening speak then leave me in peace i took a deep breath before could bring myself to utter the words i have come to beg your pardon what i have come to beg your pardon i repeated i apologize still she said nothing do you accept my apology should i do so you must i insist upon it and if i refuse you will not refuse you cannot refuse i can easily do so why i cried how dare you talk to me in this way i have come here as a gentleman though i had no need to do so and abased myself to acknowledge my fault and yet you dare to refuse me you may have been born a gentleman that is your misfortune but your actions are those of one far lower than any man i have ever known you violated me although i gave you no cause to do so you then spread foul and malicious rumors about me so i am dismissed from my place and jeered at in the streets and called whore you have taken my good name and all you offer in return is your apology said with no meaning and less sincerity if you felt it in your soul i could accept easily but you do not how do you know i see your soul she said her voice suddenly dropping to a whisper which chilled my blood i know what it is and what is its shape can feel it hiss in the night and taste its coldness in the day i hear it burning and i touch its hate did i or anyone else need a franker confession the calm way she confessed to her power frightened me mightily and i did my best to summon the contrition she wanted but she was right on one scorei felt little her devils made her see true you are making me suffer i said in desperation it must stop whatever you suffer is less than you deserve until you have a change of heart she smiled and my breath caught in my throat as i saw the look on her face for it confirmed everything i had feared it was the clearest admission of guilt that any court of law ever heard and i was only sorry that there was no one else around to witness that moment the girl saw that i had understood for she pitched up her face and let out a peal of laughter leave me be jack prestcott lest worse befall you you cannot undo what has been done it is too late for that but the good lord punishes those who transgress and will not repent you dare speak of the lord how can you even utter his name i shouted in horror at the blasphemy what are you to do with him talk of your own master you fornicating witch straightaway her eyes flashed with the darkest anger and she stepped forward and struck me on the face grabbing my wrist and pulling my face to her own never she hissed in a dark voice which seemed more like that of a familiar than her own never talk to me like that again then she pushed me away her breast heaving with emotion while i too was winded by the shock of the assault then lifting her finger at me in a warning she walked off leaving me trembling in the middle of the empty street less than an hour later i was seized by a powerful griping of the guts which left me curled up on the floor vomiting out my stomach so violently i could not even cry out in pain she had renewed her attack i could not talk to thomas about this matter he could not give me any help at all i doubt that he even believed in spirits certainly he was of the opinion that the only proper response was prayer but i knew that this would be insufficient i needed a powerful countermagic fast and there was no means of getting it what was i to do run after blundy and ask her if she wouldnt mind pissing in the bottle greatorex had given me unlikely to be successful nor did i feel like breaking into her cottage and ransacking it for the charm the irishman said she must be using against me i must point out one thing here which is that my account of my talk with blundy is accurate in every single detail it could hardly be other for her words were engraved on my mind for years after i say this because it contained confirmation of everything i knew and justification of everything that occurred thereafter there is no room for doubt or misinterpretationshe threatened me with worse and she could hardly do me harm in any other way except through her magic i do not need to persuade or assert on this mattershe admitted it quite freely when she had no need to do so and it was only a matter of time before she made good on her promise from that moment i knew that i was engaged in a battle which would end in the destruction of one or the other i say this plainly for it must be understood that i had no choice in what i didi was desperate instead of thomas i went to see dr grove for i knew that he still believed in the power of exorcism he had once lectured us about this when he had heard of an affair of sorcery in nearby kineton when i was about fifteen he warned sternly about dabbling with the devil and that evening most strangely and generously led us in prayer for the souls of those suspected of compacting with darkness he told us that the invincibility of the lord can so easily turn back satans powers if it is genuinely desired by those who have delivered themselves into his arms and it was one of his major contentions with the puritans that by disparaging the rite of exorcism they not only lowered the priesthood in the eyes of the population who continued to believe in spirits whatever their ministers said but also removed a potent weapon in the neverending battle apart from catching a glimpse in the distance when once i was walking down the high street a few months earlier i hadnt cast eyes on him for nearly three years and i was surprised when i entered his presence once more fate had been kind to him whereas i remembered a man barely enough fed with threadbare clothes a size too big for him and a mournful expression on his face now here before me was a rolypoly character evidently too eager to make up for lost time in the matter of food and drink i liked thomas and wanted only the best for him but i felt then he was wrong in thinking grove unqualified for the parish of easton parva i could see him already rolling down to the church after a good dinner and bottle of wine to lecture his parishioners on the virtues of moderation how they would love him as well for everyone likes a character to fit the part life has allotted him the parish i felt would be a happier place with grove as its leader than with thomas even if it would be less mindful of the awesome fear of the lords chastisement i am glad i find you well doctor i said as he allowed me into his room as packed with books and as littered with paper as i recall the quarters allotted to him at compton wynyates you do indeed jack you do indeed he cried for i no longer have to teach snottynosed youths like yourself and if gods will be so will shortly no longer have to teach anyone at all i congratulate you on your escape from servitude i replied as he gestured me to move a pile of books and sit down you must relish your improved estate from being a family priest to being a fellow of new college is a grand recovery for you not that we were not all extremely grateful for your earlier misfortune for how else would we have had such a learned tutor grove grunted pleased at the compliment but half suspecting i was joking at his expense it is indeed a great improvement he said although i was grateful to sir william for his kindness for if he had not taken me into his household i would have starved it was not a happy time for me im sure you realize that but then it turned out to be an unhappy period for you as well i hope that life as an undergraduate is more to your taste well enough thank you or at least it was at present i am in grave trouble and i need to beg you for help grove seemed concerned at this bald statement and earnestly asked what was the matter so i told him everything and who is this witch a woman called sarah blundy i see you know the name grove looked dark and angry at the mere mention and i thought that perhaps it might have been better had i not said but in fact i did well she has caused me great grief recently very great grief ah yes i said vaguely i did hear some slanderous talk did you indeed might i ask from whom it was nothing merely tavern gossip i had it from a man called wood i straightaway told him his words were shameful i came close to boxing his ears i must say grove grunted once more then thanked me for my kindness not many people would have had such an honorable response he said curtly but you see i continued pressing my advantage she is a dangerous character in one way or another everything she does causes trouble the witchcraft is confirmed by astrology i nodded i do not trust this greatorex absolutely but he was adamant that i was bewitched and that she was formidably powerful and there can be no other source of it as far as i am aware no one else has cause to resent me in any way and you have been attacked in your head and your guts is that right by animals and visited in dreams on several occasions yes but if i remember you had such headaches when you were a child as well is that not the case or is my memory playing false all people have headaches i said i was not aware that mine were of any greater intensity grove nodded i feel you are a troubled soul jack he continued in a kindly fashion which distresses me for you were a happy child even though wild and untameable tell me what concerns you that your face is become set in such an angry expression i am under a curse apart from that you know there is more than this do i need to tell you surely you know the disasters that have afflicted my family you must you were in sir william comptons family long enough your father you mean of course what distresses me most is that my family my mother in particular wishes to forget the whole matter there is my father his memory weighed down by this accusation and no one except myself seems concerned to defend him i had misjudged grove i think for i had a childish apprehension of seeing him half expecting that the passing of years would be as nothing and he would again pull out his rod it was as well that he was more able to treat me as an adult than i was to think as one rather than telling me what to do or lecturing me or giving advice i did not wish to hear he instead said very little but listened to me as we sat there in his darkening room without even getting up to light a candle when the evening lengthened indeed until i spoke of my troubles that evening in new college i had not realized i had so very many of them perhaps it was groves way of religion that made him so quiet for although no papist yet he believed in the confessional and would give absolution in secret for those who truly desired it and whom he trusted to keep their mouths shut in fact it occurred to me that if i so wished i could at that very moment blight his chances forever and secure thomass place all i had to do was beg him to hear me and then report him to the authorities as a hidden catholic then he would be too dangerous for preferment i did not do so and perhaps it was a mistake i thought thomas was young and another parish would come along in due course it is natural so i now know for youth to be in a hurry but ambition must be tempered by resignation enthusiasm by deference i did not think so then of course but i like to believe there was more than simple selfinterest in my decision to spare grove from the disgrace i could have visited upon him so easily selfinterest there was as i shall reveal in fact i later wondered at the mystery of providence which led me to him for my distress led me to my salvation and turned the curse under which i labored into the agent of my success it is remarkable how the lord can take evil and turn it into good can use a creature like blundy to reveal a hidden purpose quite the opposite to the intended hurt in such things i believe are the true miracles of the world now that the age of prodigies is past for grove was teaching me again in the best disputational fashion and i never had a better lesson had my real tutors been so skilled i might even have taken to my legal studies with more of a will for in his hands i understood if only fleetingly the heady brew that argument can be in the past he had confined his instruction to fact and drilled us ceaselessly in the rules of grammar and suchlike now that i was a man and entered into that age when rational thought is possible a sublime state given to man alone and denied by gods will to children animals and women he treated me as such in matter of education wisely he used the dialectic of the rhetor to examine the argument he ignored the facts which were too tender in my mind and concentrated on my presentation to make me think anew he pointed out his arguments were too close for me to remember the precise stages of his reasoning so i present here only an outline of what he said that i had presented an argumentum in tres partes formally correct he said but lacking the necessary resolution and thus incomplete in evolution and hence in logic as i write this i realize i must have paid more attention to my lessons than i knew for the nomenclature of the scholar comes back to me surprisingly easily thus the primum partum was my fathers disgrace the secundum was my penury through being disinherited the tertium was the curse i had fallen under the task of the logician he pointed out was to resolve the problem and unify the parts into a single proposal which could then be advanced and subjected to examination so he said consider afresh take the first and the second parts of your argument what are the common threads which link them together there is my father i said who is accused and who lost his land grove nodded pleased that i could remember the basics of logic at least and was prepared to lay out the elements in the correct fashion there is myself who suffers as a son there is sir william compton who was executor of the estate and comrade of my father in the sealed knot that is all i can think of at present grove inclined his head good enough he said but you must take it further for you maintained that without the accusation the first part your land would not have been lost the second part is that not the case yes now was this an indirect or a direct causation i dont know that i understand you posit a minor accident that the second was an indirect consequence of the first without examining the possibility that perhaps the link was the inverse you cannot argue of course that the loss of your land caused your fathers disgrace for that would be temporally impossible and thus absurd but you might perhaps argue that the prospect of losing the land led to the accusation and that in turn led to the actual loss the idea of alienation generated the reality through the medium of accusation i stared at him in bewilderment as the words hit home for he had spoken the suspicion that had nagged at me ever since that night i spent in my uncles office could this possibly be the case could the accusation that destroyed my father have been prompted by nothing more than greed are you saying i am not saying anything at all dr grove said except to suggest that you think through your arguments with greater care you are deceiving me i said because you know something of this matter which i do not you would not direct me to think in this direction if you had not good reason to do so i know you well doctor and your way of argument would also suggest that i must consider the other obvious form of accident which is which is that the link connecting the two states of accusation and alienation is the fact that my father was indeed guilty grove beamed excellent young man i am pleased with you indeed you are thinking with the detachment of the true logician mow can you see any other we may i think leave out random misfortune which is the argument of the atheist i thought long and hard as i was pleased that i had pleased and wished to win more praise i had rarely done so in lessons and i found it a strange and warming experience no i said eventually those are the two main categories which must be considered everything else must be a subclass of the two alternative propositions i paused for a moment i do not wish to diminish this conversation but even the best of arguments requires some matter of fact to give it ballast and i have no doubt that at some stage you will indicate that in crucial areas this is lacking you are beginning to talk like a lawyer sir grove said not like a philosopher this is surely a question where law is applicable logic can only advance you so far there must be some way of distinguishing between the two propositions which are either that my father is guilty or that he is not and that cannot be accomplished by metaphysics alone so tell me you know something of the circumstances oh no he said there i must disabuse you entirely i only met your father the once and while i found him a handsome robust man i can hardly offer any judgment or even assessment of him and i heard of his disgrace only incidentally when i overheardquite by chancesir william telling his wife that he felt obliged to tell what he knew what i said lurching forward in my seat with such violence that i believe i frightened the man you heard what grove queried me with an air of genuine bafflement but you must know this surely he said that sir william was the person who made public the accusations you were in the house at the time surely you heard something of what was happening not a word when was this he shook his head early in i believe i cannot really remember with any exactness what happened i was in the library searching out a volume for sir william gave me free run of his books for as long as i was there it is not the best of libraries but it was a small oasis in the desert for me and i drank there frequently you remember the room no doubt it faces east for the most part but turns a corner toward the end and off there is the office in which sir william conducted all the domestic business of the estate i never disturbed him in it because he always got into a fearsome temper when he had anything to do with money it brought home his reduced state too painfully everyone knew to steer clear of him for many hours afterward on this occasion his wife did not and that is why i know to tell you this i saw little and did not hear all but through a crack in the door as it stood ajar i saw that good lady on her knees before her husband imploring him to think carefully about what he was to do my mind is decided he said not unkindly even though he was unused to having his actions queried my trust has been betrayed and my life sold that a man could act in such a way is difficult to imagine that a friend could do so intolerable it cannot go unpunished but are you sure my lady asked him to level such an accusation against a man like sir james who has been your friend twenty years and whose son you have brought up almost as your own cannot be done in error and you must bear in mind that he willhe mustchallenge you and such a contest you would lose i will not fight him sir william replied more kindly this time for he could see that his wife was concerned i acknowledge my inferiority in arms nor do i have the least doubt that my accusations are the absolute truth sir john russells warning leaves no doubt of that at all the letters the documents the notes of the meetings he had from morland i can confirm many of them from my own knowledge i know his handwriting and i know his cipher then the door shut and i heard no more but my lady spent the next few days in great distress and sir william was more than usually preoccupied he left for london at the end of the week in a most secret departure and i imagined there communicated his suspicions and evidence to others in the kings circle i almost laughed as i heard this tale for i remembered those times well sir william compton had indeed left the house and galloped away one morning the household had been somber indeed the previous few days as though the body was taking a sickness from the head which rules it and i remember again sir william talking to me before he left and telling me that i must soon leave it was time he said to return to my own people as i was old enough to attend to my duties my childhood was now over three days later the day after sir william rode away at dawn i was put on a cart with all my belongings and sent to my uncle i had not known anything of the storm that had been brewing under my very nose but the way i left compton wynyates is far from my story and i must tell more of my meeting with dr grove on the matter i had called on him for he refused to help he would not perform an exorcism for blundy had reached into his soul ahead of me and made his selfishness such that he was afraid to open himself to criticism at this most delicate moment of his career try as i might i could not persuade him all he would say was that if i could provide him with better demonstration of the enchantment then he would reconsider the matter until then he would only offer that we might pray together i did not wish to offend him but i demurred at the prospect of spending an evening on my knees besides the news he had given me had galvanized my senses and i was willing for a while to put all superlunary matters aside the important thing was that i now had a further connection in my chain of deceit and i questioned the doctor closely on the matter documents he had off morland via sir john russell which meant that sir john had merely forwarded these materials from someone else he was happy to spread the rumor it seemed but had not initiated it was that a fair inference dr grove said it sounded so although he was sure that russell had acted in good faith but he could not help me further about the source it was infuriating one word from russell would have saved me much trouble but i knew from the way he had behaved in tunbridge that i would never hear that word from his lips as i left groves room in new college i decided it was time to visit mr wood in my haste and excitement i had forgotten one important detail and as the heavy studded door of woods house in merton street was dragged open i remembered that sarah blundy was employed by the family to my great relief however it was not the girl who opened but woods mother who looked not at all pleased to see me even though it was not late jack prestcotts compliments to mr wood and he would beg the indulgence of an interview i said i could see she was halfminded to tell me to go away and return only when an appointment was made but she relented and instead gestured for me to enter wood came down to meet me a few moments later also looking not best pleased mr prestcott he said when all the bowing was done i am surprised to see you i wish i could have had more time to prepare for the honor i ignored the rebuke and told him that it was a matter of urgency i was in town only for a short while wood grumbled like the fusspot he was pretended that he had so many matters of import to deal with then gave way and led me to his room i am surprised not to see that blundy girl here i said as we climbed back up the stairs she does work as a maid for you does she not wood looked uncomfortable we discussed the matter he said and decided it would be best to dismiss her probably a sensible decision and certainly the best for my familys reputation but i am not content with it nonetheless my mother was very partial to her remarkably so in fact i could never account for it perhaps she was bewitched i said as lightly as possible wood gave me a look which indicated something of the same had passed through his mind perhaps he replied slowly strange how we all end in thrall to our servants some servants i said some masters a suspicious furtive look showed he had seen the criticism but wished to deflect it you are not here to talk about the difficulty of hiring reliable maids i think he said i told him of my problem and something of my interview with dr grove i know this evidence presumably the same material lord mordaunt told me about was made known to the world by sir william i now know he had them via sir john russell from someone called morland now who is morland that i think he said as he scurried around the room like a lost mole searching through one pile of papers after another until he came onto the pile he needed that i think is not a great mystery i think this must be samuel morland and he is he is now i understand sir samuel which is in itself quite remarkable and gives much food for thought he must have rendered a very signal service to be so favored considering his past unmasking a traitor in the kings ranks might well qualify or passing forged documents which purported to do so oh indeed wood said nodding his head and snuffling indeed for morland was noted for what you might call his pensmanship he worked in thurloes office for some time i believe and even tried to succeed him when thurloe was thrown out in the last days of the protectorate if i remember the story properly then i think he threw in his lot with the royalists his timing was impeccable so the idea of forged documents does not strike you as being absurd wood shook his head either your father was guilty or he was not if he was not then some device must have been employed to create the illusion of culpability but the only way you will find out i think is to tackle morland himself he lives somewhere in london i imagine i was told by mr boyle that he concerns himself with hydraulic engines for drainage schemes and suchlike they are said to be most ingenious i almost fell on my knees to thank the silly little man for the information and had the grace to admit that thomas had been correct in recommending him to me as quickly as was decent i left that house the next morning after a night made sleepless by my fevered excitement i coached to london i had never been in a large metropolis before oxford was by far the grandest town i had ever entered most of my life had been spent either on country estates where the largest habitation was a village of a few hundred souls or small market towns such as boston or warwick with populations of only a few thousand london so i am told although i do not believe anyone knows for certain contained then some half million people it sprawled over the landscape like a vast bleeding pustule on the face of the earth sickening the land and poisoning all who lived in it i was at first fascinated as i pulled up the leather to peer out of the coach window but this amazement turned to disgust as i perceived the shocking meanness of life in such a place i am not as must be clear by now much of a bookman but there is a line in a poem which i was forced to construe by dr grove in my youth which has stuck with me i do not recall the poet but he was obviously a wise and sober man for he said i cannot live in the city for i have not learned to lie so it always will be the honesty of the country man is at a disadvantage in the town where duplicity is prized and straightforwardness scorned where all men look after only themselves and generosity occasions only laughter before i made enquiries for sir samuel morland i decided i needed as much to collect myself and prepare myself for the interview which lay ahead so i took my pack and walked across the great thoroughfare which links london with westminster although there is so much construction it will soon be completely impossible to discern where one city ends and the other begins and took myself northward to find a place which sold something to eat and drink i soon came to a piazza as it is called though square should be good enough for any englishman which i am told can stand equal with any in europe it did not seem so grand to me the buildings were ruined by the squalor all around of women selling vegetables and dirt and waste trampled underfoot there were eating houses there but the prices were such that i removed myself in horror at the audacity of the owners round the corner was another street which seemed much calmer although again i was deceived for this drury lane was accounted one of the most vile and dangerous in the city full of bawds and cutthroats all i saw was the theater shortly to open and witnessed the actors in the uniforms which won them protection from the law and mighty ridiculous they looked from covent garden i walked to london diverting only up a squalid alley near st pauls cathedral to leave my possessions in a dingy little tavern i had been told was both cheap and honest it was so but unfortunately did not accompany these virtues by being quiet and clean as well the blankets were crawling with lice and such evidence as there was indicated that my future bedmates were less than genteel but i had lice in my hair anyway so decided there was little point in spending my money on better then i began to make enquiries about sir samuel morland it did not take long to find his address it was an old house in an ancient street near bow church and i dont doubt was one of those burned to the ground a few years later in the fire for it was an ancient construction of wood and thatch which would have been the more attractive had any care been taken on its upkeep that of course is another problem with city life as when owners are not the same as inhabitants then no care is taken of buildings and they molder and decay casting a distemper on the streets and becoming a breeding ground for vermin the lane itself was narrow and dark from the overhanging storys above and a riot of noise from the traders who plied their wares up and down its length i looked for the sign of an ox as instructed but it was so discolored that i walked up and down twice before i realized that the tattered and broken piece of wood above one door had once carried such an image on it when the door opened i was not even asked my business but was invited in with no ceremony at all is your master at home i asked the man at the door who was as disgraceful looking a servant as ever i had come across covered in dirt and dressed in the foulest of clothes i have no master said this creature in surprise forgive me i must be at the wrong house i am looking for sir samuel morland i am he he replied so that it was now my turn to look astonished who are you my name is ah grove i said i am delighted to make your acquaintance mr grove and i yours sir i am sent by my father we own some marshland in dorset and have heard reports of your ingenuity in drainage i could not even finish my lie for morland grabbed me by the hand and pumped it up and down excellent he said excellent indeed and you wish to see my engines do you not use them to drain your land well if they work eh i see your mind perfectly young man what if this inventor is a fraud best to spy out the land so to speak before committing funds you are tempted because you know of the ingenuity of the dutch and how they have increased the yield of their land an hundredfold and turned marsh into the richest pasture but you do not fully believe it you have heard of the fen drainage and the use of pumps there but do not know if they would be appropriate for you that is the case is it not do not bother to deny it it is well for you that i am not a suspicious man and freely show my designs to all who desire to see them come he said cheerfully grabbing my arm once more and pulling me to a door come this way in some bemusement at this behavior i was dragged from the small entrance hall into a large room beyond i guessed it had once been the house of a woolen merchant and had been used for storing bales certainly it was very much larger than the frontage of the house suggested these merchants always play poor and hide their wealth from public view and sweet and fresh from the wideopen doors at the end which gave in so much light despite the time of year that i was briefly dazzled what do you think impressive eh he said mistaking the hesitation this caused for astonishment when i could see clearly again though i was indeed astonished for i had never seen such a collection of bricabrac in my life a dozen desks and each one overflowing with strange instruments and bottles and casks and tools bits of wood and metal were stacked up against the walls and the floors were covered in shavings and pools of greasy liquid and cuttings of leather two or three servants probably those artisans able to make up engines to his designs were at work at benches filing metal and planing wood extraordinary i replied as he clearly wanted me to express some approbation look he said enthusiastically again removing the obligation to speak what do you think of this we were standing in front of a finely carved oak table which was empty save for an extraordinary little device scarcely bigger than a mans hand of beautifully wrought and engraved brass on top were eleven small wheels each one carved with numbers below in the body of the machine was a long plate which evidently concealed other dials for small holes cut in the surface revealed yet more numbers beautiful i said but what is it he laughed in delight at my ignorance it is a calculating machine he said proudly the finest in the world not alas unique as some little frenchman has one but he lowered his tone to a confidential whisper his doesnt work very well not like mine what do you do with it you calculate of course the principle is the same as napiers bones but far more ingenious the two sets of wheelwork registers numbers from one to ten thousands or from halfpennies up if you wish it for finance the handle engages this by a series of cogs so that they turn over in the correct proportion clockwise for addition anticlockwise for subtraction my next machine which is not yet perfected will be able to calculate square roots and cubes and even perform trigonometry very useful i said indeed every countinghouse in the world will shortly have one if i can find a way of telling them of it it will make me a rich man and experimental science will advance in leaps and bounds when it is no longer confined to adepts in mathematical calculation i sent one some time ago to dr wallis at oxford as he is the best man in that business this country has you know dr wallis i asked i am acquainted with him myself oh yes although i have not seen him of late he paused and smiled inwardly to himself you might say we were by way of being in business together once i will send your salutations if you so wish i do not know that he would greatly welcome them my thanks for the offer nonetheless but it is not what you are here for i know come into the garden so we left his arithmetical engines thank heavens and i followed him out into the open air where he paused in front of what seemed to be a large barrel with a tall tube coming out of the top this he regarded with a sad wistful look on his face then shook his head heavily and sighed is this what you wished to show me no he said regretfully this i have reluctantly abandoned why is that does it not work far from it it works too well it was an attempt to harness the power of gunpowder to the problem of pumping you see it is a great problem in mining the distance below the earth of mines these dayssometimes four hundred feet or moremeans that the effort required to extract water which means raising it by an equivalent distance is formidable do you know the weight of a tube of water four hundred feet high of course not if you did you would be astounded at the audacity of man in even thinking of the idea now you see my conception was to get a sealed container above earth filled with air which descended into the water below ground with another linked tube coming up into the open i nodded although he had largely lost me already in the container you explode a small measure of gunpowder which causes a great rise in tension within this rushes down the one tube and forces the water up the other repeated often enough you would get a constant flow of water upward sounds splendid it does unfortunately i have not yet thought of a way of ensuring explosions of the right quality and consistency either the tube bursts which is dangerous or you get a single plume of water fifty feet high which then stops i have a patent on the idea so i am in no danger of being overtaken by rivals but unless i figure out the solution a very good idea may well be wasted i have considered using heated water because water turned into vapors demands a much larger spacesome two thousand times did you realize thatand acquires irresistible strength in the process now if some way could be made to force the vapor down the tube or into some pumping mechanism then the strength required to lift the water would be there and the problem the problem is making the hot vapors go in the direction required rather than in any other i understood scarce a word but his animation and enthusiasm were such that i could imagine no way of shutting off the flow of words from his mouth besides my willingness to listen seemed to endear me to him and thus rendered him more likely to give me the information i required so i plied him with questions and affected the gravest of interest in all those matters which normally would have excited nothing hut my contempt so you do not have a pump which works is that what you are telling me i asked eventually pumps of course pumps aplenty all sorts of pumps chain pumps and suction pumps and cylinder pumps i do not yet have an efficient pump an elegant pump which will perform its allotted task with simplicity and grace so what about these fens what is used there oh that he said almost scornfully that is a different matter entirely of little interest at all in matter of technique he glanced at me and remembered again why i was there but of course all the better an investment for that as it requires no novelty the problem is a simple one you see and simple problems should best have simple solutions do you not agree i agreed many areas of fenland he said lie beneath the level of the sea and properly should actually be underneath the sea very much as the greater part of the low countries should be because if not they would have to change their name he chuckled at his little joke awhile and i joined in politely you know this of course now it is easy enough to prevent more water from entering by building dikes the hollanders have been doing this for centuries so it cannot be very difficult the problem is to evacuate the water that is already there how is this to be done i confessed my ignorance which pleased him rivers are the simplest you cut a new river and the water flows away pipes are another wooden pipes underground which collect the water and allow it to flow off the problem with that is that it is both expensive and slow what is more the land around you remember is higher as is the sea so where is this water to go i shook my head again nowhere he said with vehemence it cannot go anywhere for water will not flow uphill everyone knows that this is why much of the fenland has not been completely drained with my pumps you see the problem can be overcome and in the contest between mans wishes and natures desires nature can be made to yield a victory for water will indeed flow uphill and be carried off leaving the land useful excellent i said and very profitable oh indeed those gentlemen who have formed a company for the drainage of their lands will become prosperous indeed and i hope to turn a profit myself for i have some land there in harland wyte sir are you all right i felt almost as though i had been struck a heavy blow in my stomach for the mention of harland wyte my family land the heart of my fathers entire estate was so unexpected that it left me breathless and i fear must almost have given myself away by the way i turned pale and gulped for air forgive me sir samuel i said i am prone to this momentary lightheadedness it will pass i smiled reassuringly and pretended to be recovered harland wyte you say i do not know it have you owned it long he smirked cunningly only a few years it was a great bargain for it was going cheap and i saw its value better than those selling it im sure you did who was the seller but he brushed my question aside and would not be drawn preferring to expand on his cleverness than on his turpitude now i will complete the drainage then sell it on and pocket a handsome profit his grace the duke of bedford has already agreed to purchase it since he already owns most of the land all around i congratulate you on your good fortune i said giving up the line of enquiry and trying another approach tell me sir how you know dr wallis i ask as he has tutored me on occasion does he consult you on his experimentations and mathematics good heavens no morland replied with sudden modesty although i am a mathematician myself i freely admit that he is my superior in all respects our connection was very much more worldly for we both at one stage were employed by john thurloe of course i was a secret supporter of his majestys cause whereas dr wallis was a great man for cromwell in those days you surprise me i said he seems a loyal subject now besides what services could a priest and mathematician provide for someone like thurloe many and varied morland said with a smile at my innocence dr wallis was the finest maker and breaker of codes in the land he was never beaten i think never yielded to a stronger in cryptographical technique for years thurloe used his services bundles of letters in code would be sent to him in oxford and the translations would come back on the next coach remarkable we almost felt like telling the kings men that they really should not waste their time putting letters into code at all for if we captured them wallis could always read them if he is your tutor you should ask to see some im sure he has them still although he naturally does not advertise such records of his past activities and you knew thurloe as well that must have been extraordinary he was flattered by the compliment and this goaded him to try and impress me the more indeed i was almost his righthand man for three years you are a family connection of his oh dear me no i was sent as an envoy to savoy to plead on behalf of the persecuted protestants i was there for several years and kept my eye on exiles there as well so i was useful and became trusted and was offered the post when i returned which i kept until i fled when discovered passing intelligence to his majesty his majesty is lucky in his servants then i said despising the man suddenly for his selfsatisfaction not all of them by any means for every loyal man like myself there was another who would have sold him for a bag of sovereigns i unmasked the worst of them by making sure that some of the documents wallis produced were seen by the king i was so close i knew it if i could only keep calm so that his suspicions were not aroused i knew i could tease unheardof treasures from him you hint that dr wallis and yourself are no longer on good terms is it because of what happened in those days he shrugged it no longer matters it is all past now tell me i said insisting and i knew the moment the words were out of my mouth that i had pushed too far morlands eyes narrowed and the air of eccentric good humor drained out of him like sour wine from a bottle perhaps you have acquired more interests at oxford than in your studies young man he said quietly i would advise you to go back to your dorset estate and concern yourself with that if indeed any such estate exists it is a dangerous business for any man to occupy himself with matters that are none of his affair he took me by the elbow and tried to guide me to the front door i shook my arm free scornfully and turned to confront him no i said confident that he would be no match for me and that i could shake the information out of him if i so wished i wish to know the sentence went uncompleted morland clapped his hands and instantly a door opened and a roughlooking man came into the room a dagger thrust obtrusively in his belt he said nothing but stood awaiting orders i do not know whether i could have defeated such a man it is possible but it was just as possible that i would not he had the air of the old soldier about him and was certainly far more experienced in swordplay than i was myself you must excuse my conduct sir samuel i said controlling myself as best i could but your stories are fascinating it is true i have heard many tales at oxford and they interest me greatly as they must all young men you must forgive the enthusiasm and curiosity of youth my words did not conciliate him his suspicion once aroused could not be laid to rest in his years of deceit and duplicity he had no doubt learned the value of silence and he was not to be tempted into taking any risk show this gentleman out he said to the servant then he bowed to me politely and withdrew i was back on the noisy street outside a few moments later cursing myself for my stupidity it was obvious by this stage that i needed to get back to oxford my quest was nearing its end and the answer to my remaining questions lay in that county but it was too late to leave as the next coach did not go until the following day had i been less exhausted the constant scratching of the fleas in the straw pallet that was my communal bed would have irritated and the noise of my companions disgusted my senses as it was they occasioned no dismay at all once i had securely bound my money bag to my waist and ostentatiously placed my dagger under my pillow so that all could see that they were to beware of taking advantage of my sleep the following morning i dawdled like a true gentleman of leisure slowly drinking a pint of ale with my bread and only leaving the place when the sun was well up as i had nothing better to do i played the viewer of sights visiting st pauls cathedrala scandalously rundown pile of stone quite reduced from its former glory by the depredations of the puritans and yet more glorious in its decrepitude than the illformed conceit which is now being built to replace it i watched the booksellers and hawkers of pamphlets who congregated in st pauls yard and listened to the criers and constables reciting the list of crimes and deceits which had been the previous nights crop of malice so many thefts assaults riots it seemed the whole town must have been up all night to have committed them then i walked to westminster and saw the palace and gazed in awe at the very window from which king charles stepped to his bloody martyrdom covered now in black crepe to commemorate that evil deed and reflected awhile on the punishments the nation had endured because of that sinful act such entertainments tired me quickly though so i bought myself some more bread from a street seller and walked back through covent garden which was no more agreeable to my senses now than it had been the previous day i was hungry and trying to decide whether to spend the vast quantity of money needed for a pint of wine in that place when i felt a light touch on my arm i was not such a bumpkin that i did not realize what was probably about to take place and i spun round and reached for my knife then hesitated when i saw a finely dressed young woman standing beside me she had a good face but it was so covered in wig and beauty spots and rouge and whitening that gods gifts to her could scarcely be discerned most noticeable of all i remember was the stink of perfume which so covered her natural aromas that it was like being in a flowershop madam i said coldly as she raised an eyebrow and smiled at my alarm jack cried the creature do not say you have forgotten me you have the advantage well you may have forgotten me but i cannot forget the gallant way you protected me under the stars near tunbridge said she then i rememberedthe young whore but how changed she was and though her fortunes had obviously improved in my eyes she had not changed for the better kitty i said remembering her name at last what a fine lady you have become you must forgive me for not knowing you but the transformation is so great you cannot blame me too much no indeed she said waving a fan in front of her face in an affected manner although no one calls me lady who knows me truly whore i was and now i am raised a mistress my congratulations i said for evidently she thought this was in order thank you he is a fine man well connected and extremely generous nor is he too repulsive i am a lucky woman indeed with fortune he will give me enough to buy myself a husband before he tires of me but tell me what are you doing here gaping like a yokel in the middle of this street it is not the place for you i was looking for some food there is plenty here i cannotwill notafford that she laughed merrily but i can and will and with a brazenness which took my breath away she linked her arm in mine and led me back to the piazza and a coffee shop called wills where she demanded a room to herself and for food and drink to be brought far from being affronted at such a request the servant obliged with obsequiousness as though she was indeed a lady of consequence and a few minutes later we were in a commodious room on the second floor overlooking the bustle below no one will object i asked anxiously concerned that her lord might send some bravoes around in a fit of jealousy it took her some moments to work out what i meant by this but then she laughed again oh no she said he knows me too well to think me capable of ruining my prospects by such an indiscretion may i know the name of your benefactor of course everyone else does he is my lord of bristol an entertaining and wellplaced favorite of the kings if rather old i caught him at tunbridge so you see i have great reason to be grateful to you i was there scarcely a day before i received a message asking to meet me i pleased him as best i could and kept him entertained and thought that was that the next thing i know he wants my company back in london and offers a handsome incentive is he in love with you goodness no but he is hotblooded where his wife is an old prune and he is mortally afraid of disease it was all her idea she spotted me in the street first of all and drew his attention to me she wagged her finger at me you look about to launch into a sermon jack prestcott do desist i pray you or you will vex me you are too virtuous to do anything but disapprove strongly but what would you have me do i sell my body for my little bit of wealth and comfort all around there are priests and ministers who sell their souls for theirs i am in good company and one more sinner among such a throng will hardly be noticed i tell you jack virtue is a lonely state in this age i hardly knew what to say to this frank expression of depravity i could not approve of her but i was disinclined to condemn for that would have meant an end to our acquaintance and despite everything her company pleased me all the more so because to show off her good fortune she ordered the best food and wine and insisted i eat as much as my stomach could hold and my head endure all the while she talked to me of town gossip and of her lovers inexorable rise at court so that she said he was a serious rival to lord clarendon in the kings favor of course clarendon is powerful she said affecting to know all the secret dealings of the government but all the world knows that his ponderous gravity drives the king to distraction while the gayness of lord bristol keeps his majesty amused and this is a king who always sacrifices on the altar of amusement so lord clarendon is vulnerable it will not take much to eject him and then i will be the second whore in the kingdom after lady castlemaine its a pity my lord is a papist as that is a great hindrance to him but even that can be overcome perhaps you think any of this might happen i asked fascinated despite myself it is odd how gossip of the high and mighty exercises such interest oh yes i hope so for lord clarendons sake as much as anything i hardly think he will thank you for your solicitude he should she said seriously for a moment truly he should for i have heard worrying tales he has annoyed many powerful people and some are less peaceable and generous than my lord if he does not fall from power i fear worse may befall him one day nonsense i said fall he will but he is an old man and that is only natural but he will always be rich and mighty and favored such people as he who never raise a sword nor put their courage to the test always survive and prosper while better men fall by the wayside oho she said spoken from the heart i would say is this why you are in london i had forgotten i had told her of my quest and nodded i was here to enquire after a man called sir samuel morland have you ever heard of him i believe i have is he not a man who concerns himself with mechanical devices he often approaches people at court trying to beg influence for some scheme does he have any strong patrons i asked it is always well to know what you are dealing with it would be alarming to discover that the man you wish to attack is defended by someone far more powerful not that i know of i believe he is associated in some way with schemes for draining fenland so he may know the duke of bedford but more than that i could not say do you want me to find out it would be easy enough to do and a pleasure to oblige i would be deeply grateful then that is all the encouragement i need it shall be done would you care to come to my lodging this evening i attend my lady castlemaine in the morning and my lord in the afternoon but the evenings are my own and i am free to receive whomever i like that is our understanding and i must invite people if only to show that i am keeping him to our agreement it would be a pleasure and now i hope you are refreshed and prepared as i must leave you i stood up and bowed deeply to thank her for her kindness and was bold enough to kiss her hand she laughed with merriment stop sir she said you are being deceived by appearances not at all i said you are more a lady than many i have met she blushed and made fun of me to cover her pleasure at the compliment then she swept out of the room accompanied by the little black servant given to her as a present and who had been there throughout our interview her lord was easygoing and gracious she said but there was no need to risk his displeasure unnecessarily itwas already darkening and cold so i passed the hours in a coffee shop near st pauls reading the journals and listening to the conversation of others which filled me anew with disgust for the city and its inhabitants so much bravado so much bragging so much time wasted in idle foolish talk designed for nothing but to impress their fellows and impose on their betters by pretense gossip in the town is a commodity to be bought and sold if it is not possessed then it is fabricated like coiners make specie out of dross i was at least undisturbed for no man there sought my company and i was truly glad it was so while others now habitually frequent these shops and lower themselves in what they call good company i shun the vulgar and public places the time passed if only slowly and eventually the hour of my appointment came i was apprehensive of the meeting despite our differing stations in life which should have ensured my comfortable superiority but london is corrosive to deference who you are is less important than what you seem a fraudster of no family can impose himself on a gentleman from an ancient line simply by being better dressed and having a winning manner for my part i would reestablish the rules the great queen insisted upon no merchant should be allowed to dress as a gentleman and should pay the price for any impudent imitation for it is fraud and should be punished as such just as it is fraud for whores to disguise their nature vice had brought great rewards in kittys case and though i was loath to admit that good can come from bad she lived in a fashion which showed a great deal of what we are now taught to call gout i am glad i must say that we english are still robust enough to need to borrow words from the french for such nonsense while many of her fellow laborers for venus would have flaunted the spoils of conquest she lived simply with solid oak furniture rather than the gilded stuff of the foreigner simple arras on the walls to keep in the warmth not some gaudy tapestry the only piece of gross vanity was a portrait of herself on one wall impudently matched to one of her lord on the opposite as though they were husband and wife that i felt was insulting but she assured me when she saw my disapproval that it was a gift and she could do no other jack she said when we had greeted each other and sat down i must talk to you seriously for a moment by all means i must ask you for a great courtesy if you please in return for giving you the information you require a courtesy is yours for the asking i said slightly ruffled without the need to bargain for it thank you i wish you to promise never to reveal where we met of course i said it never happened you may have met a young whore on the road in kent but that was not me i now come from a good but poor family in herefordshire and was brought to london by my lord as a distant relative of his wifes family who i was and what i was is unknown and must remain so it does not seem to have done you a great deal of harm no but it would when his protection is withdrawn you think of him so of course he will not be cruel i think he will settle an annuity on me and already i have saved a good amount of money by the time i am too old i will have the means to support myself but what then i must marry i suppose but i will not get a good bargain if my past is known i frowned at this you propose to marry do you have a suitor oh plenty she said with a pretty laugh although none has dared to come forward that would be far too audacious but a woman of some property as i will be who can offer a connection to one of the most influential men in the kingdom i am a prize unless someone destroys my chances through careless talk i cannot say marriage appeals however for most women it is a dream to hand over my hardearned fortune to my husband be unable to do anything without his permission risk being disinherited of my own money when he dies oh yes a wonderful dream you are making fun of me i said gravely she laughed again i suppose but my position in my future husbands household will be stronger if i am katherine hannay daughter of john hannay esquire of hereford than formerly kitty the whore i must have looked despondent for it was not easy to comply suppose i heard that she was to marry a gentleman even if not of my acquaintance was it not my duty to warn him could i stand by as a man put his name at risk and lived forever under the threat of exposure i do not ask your approbation nor your patronage merely your silence she said softly well i said it seems we live in an age where whores become ladies and ladies play the whore family counts for nothing and appearance is all i cannot say you would not make as good a wife as many a real lady and so i give you my word miss hannay of hereford i gave her a lot with those words and she appreciated it and it was with a heavy heart indeed that i felt obliged to go back on them in later years when i heard that she was to marry sir john marshall a gentleman of some fortune in hampstead i anguished greatly over what to do and with the very greatest of reluctance concluded that my duty could not avoid the necessity of writing to the man and telling him what i knew of the woman who threatened to impose herself on his name that fortunately was all in the future for then she was deeply grateful to me and would not have assisted me otherwise i hope my little discoveries can repay this second kindness you have given me i doubt it very much but i will tell you what i have found out and later i will introduce you to mr george collop who has agreed to come and take some refreshment who is he he is the receivergeneral of the duke of bedford a powerful man as he has direction of one of the greatest fortunes in the land i hope he is honest then he is and loyal to a fault and able as well which is why he is paid near a hundred pounds a year in hand with all his costs and living on top of that i was impressed my father had always done his own administration and in any case could not have afforded to pay anything like that to a single servant for all that there are many people who would willingly pay him double for he has made the duke even richer than he once was it is said that his grace will scarcely buy a new pair of hose without asking mr collops opinion first what is his connection with sir samuel morland fens she said he is in charge of the dukes involvement in draining the fenland he knows more about it than anyone and so knows a great deal about sir samuel i see what else have you discovered for me not so very much this morland has acquired some pensions and sinecures since his majesty returned but boasted of many more which were not given him it seems he considered that he did such a service that no reward would be great enough however my lord does not think much of this assessment you must be clearer with me kitty i said this is or may be a legal matter i cannot leave anything bound up in the obscurity of dark words i had this from my lord this afternoon she said you know i am sure that he was one of the kings most loyal followers and endured years in penury and exile for his sake he does not look favorably on those who switched their allegiance at the last moment he says that he knows for sure that morland encountered lord mordaunt when both were in savoy he was involved in the arrest of mordaunt and other conspirators and took part in the trial at which mordaunt was acquitted my lord also mentioned to me that of morlands rewards and pensions nearly all have been won at the specific request of lord mordaunt a strange courtesy to extend to a man who supposedly tried to hang you more indeed something you would do for a man to whom you were connected by long friendship so my lord said i looked at her long and hard as she said this and she nodded seriously at me you must draw your own conclusions she said i questioned my lord but he would give no direct answer saying merely that what is obvious is usually also true what did he mean he said he could not help more plainly for it would be seen as an attack on clarendon if he leveled accusations against mordauntthe two are so closely attached criticism on one is an assault on the other but he wishes you well and begs you take his advice if you look hard enough you will find proof of what he says jack whatever is the matter the relief i felt at those words was so great that i had to lean forward in my chair and hug myself so near did i feel to exploding from sheerest joy at last i had someone who would credit what i always knew to be the truth and at last i had the pointer i needed odd it was indeed to have it from such a source that the solution or the near solution to my troubles should fall from the mouth of a harlot but thus it transpired for the angels of the lord can take as many strange forms as the servants of the devil i now knew who had trumped up accusations against my father i knew who the traitor really was and now i needed to discover why my father was chosen out of all the possible candidates for such treatment i was close to the point of being able to confront thurloe with his own turpitude and justify his death i fell to my knee and kissed her hand again and again and again until she burst out laughing and pulled it away come now she said merrily what have i said that produces such adulation you have ended years of anguish and restored the name of my family with luck you will also have restored my fortune and prospects as well i said if anything deserves adulation it is surely that thank you kind sir she said although i cannot consider i have done anything of such merit all i have done is repeat my lords words to you in which case i thank him through you he must be the kindest and best master a manor womancould have it may be impertinent on my part but if the opportunity arises when it can be done without embarrassment please convey my gratitude and make sure he is aware that should he require a service i will perform it willingly i will be sure to do so are you staying in london long i must leave tomorrow a pity i would like to present you to him next time write to me in advance and i will make certain you are publicly acknowledged by him as a friend a friend is too much i think i said but i would be grateful to be seen as in his interest it shall be done and here she said as she heard a heavy clumping of boots up the stairs is undoubtedly mr george collop he was a man of low extraction that was clear from the moment he walked through the door and bowed deeply to what he thought was the lady who greeted him his movements were awkward his speech coarse and with a heavy dorset accent it seemed he was the son of a tenant farmer and had forced his way into his graces attention by his skill all well and good but the price was heavy for having to listen to that rolling burr must have been tiresome indeed it said much for his qualities as a comptroller of finance for he had none other to recommend him many years in the intimate presence of gentility had done little to soften his manners or refine his talk he was one of the low who glory in their roughness it is one thing to despise the effeminacy of city and court quite another to set your face against the basic qualities of breeding in the way he collapsed in a chair with enough force to make the legs bend then pulled out a cloth to wipe his face from the walk up the stairsfor he was a heavy thickset man with a red face and mottled nosecollop made it clear he cared naught for politeness this gentleman mr ah grove kitty began with a smile toward me is fascinated by the fen project she said and so i asked you to meet him as there is no one who knows more of it than you as you oversee his graces works there thats right he said and said no more thinking it sufficient contribution his father has a very boggy piece of land and was considering whether the engines of sir samuel morland would be of use he has heard much of them but cannot tell bombast from true report well he said then stopped again lost in consideration of such a weighty matter my father i put in anxious to relieve kitty of some of the onerous conversational duty is concerned that the machines will involve great expense and might prove to be money put out to waste he is extremely keen to discover the truth of the matter but finds sir samuel himself less straightforward collop heaved with a brief private amusement for a moment that he is he said eventually and i cannot help you as we do not use his machines i rather gained the impression he was crucial to the project he is the sort of man to give himself airs of importance he does not deserve in fact he is an investor only sir samuel has some three hundred acres at harland wyte which will be worth ten times its purchase when the land is drained of course it is insignificant compared to his graces interest which is ninety thousand acres i gasped in astonishment which collop observed with satisfaction yes it is a mighty undertaking some three hundred and sixty thousand acres in all barren land which by the ingenuity of man and the grace of god will yield plenty already doing so in fact not so barren surely what about the inhabitants already there there are very many of those i think he shrugged some who scratch a living but they are removed when necessary it must be hugely expensive that it is and many men have put money into the venture although the reward is so certain it presents little risk except where villagers or landowners delay the work so it is not certain then all problems can be overcome if squatters object they are ejected if landowners refuse to cooperate then ways are found round their objections some straightforward othershere his eyes twinkled with amusementothers less straightforward but surely no landowner objects youd be surprised for all sorts of mean and ignorant reasons people have put obstacles in our way for upward of thirty years but most are seen to now the prestcott problem has been solved my heart quickened at the words and i was hard put not to let out some exclamation fortunately collop was not an observant man and kitty seeing my shock diverted him for full ten minutes with inconsequential court gossip but i interrupted you dear sir she said brightly after a while you were telling us about your battles who was the man you mentioned prestwick was that it prestcott collop corrected her sir james prestcott a thorn in our side for years he did not see the advantages of being rich did he strange how some people require some convincing collop chuckled oh no he knew the advantage of wealth it was his jealousy that was the problem kitty looked enquiringly and collop was more than happy to oblige little aware of how he was condemning himself and others with every filthy word he uttered he did not benefit as much from the division of land and feared the arrival of greater men than he in an area his family had dominated for generations so he incited the local inhabitants to damage our works we built dikes the rabble came out at night and drove holes in them flooding the land again we brought cases against them and he as a magistrate found them all not guilty it went on for years then came all the troubles and this sir james went into exile but the war also made the money dry up and in any case part of his land cut straight across the line of a river we needed to dig and he would not sell it to us without it an entire river would have to be diverted or some fifteen thousand acres abandoned surely then it would have been wise to offer more he would not take it collop wagged his finger with a smirk on his face but then the goodness of the lord shows itself he said for what do we eventually discover when we are on the point of despair that all the while good sir james is in fact a traitor my lords cousin sir john russell had it from sir samuel morland himself and he provided all the information we needed to make prestcott flee abroad once more the trustee of his property was forced to sell up to avoid bankruptcy and we had our river dug just where we wanted it i could not bear even to look at his gross smug face any longer and was seriously afraid that if i heard much more i would run him through on the spot a red haze spread over my eyes and my head spun with dizziness as i walked to the window i could barely think so powerful was the pain that gripped my head and i felt the beads of sweat running down my forehead and onto my clothes as i fought for breath to be forced to listen as this dirty man of no name encompassed the downfall of my father to gain a profit made my soul revolt i had no appetite to exult in the fact that i was so much closer to my goal for to find motives so mean and tawdry made me tremble with sorrow now at least i knew why sir john russell had refused even to cast eyes on me at tunbridge wells he could not have borne the shame and lived are you not well sir i distantly heard kitty anxiously enquiring as she must have seen my face pale as i stood by the window trying to control myself it was as if she spoke from a great distance she had to repeat the words several times before i could attend to them yes thank you it is a migraine to which i am prone i think it must be the city air and the heat in your apartment i am not used to it collop at least had the grace to offer instantly to withdraw i heard the ceremonious and courteous way in which she thanked him for calling and summoned the servant to show him out it was some considerable time i thinkit could have been minutes but just as easily hoursbefore i was able to leave that window she had by then produced a cold compress which she placed on my forehead and a glass of chilled wine to restore my senses she was in fact a naturally kind woman one of the kindest i have known i must offer you my apologies i said eventually i fear i must have caused you grave embarrassment not at all she replied you lie there until you feel able to move i did not understand the import of the words entirely but i could see they were a grave shock to you that they were i said worse than i imagined i should have known of course that something this mean was behind everything but i have looked so long that its discovery took me entirely by surprise i am not it seems a man for a real crisis would you like to tell me she said as she bathed my forehead once more she was close to me and her perfume no longer repelled me but had the precise opposite effect the warmth of her bosom against my arm similarly excited hidden feelings deep inside me i held her hand as it rested on my chest and drew it close but before i could make my desires known further she stood up and walked back to her seat giving me a sad and i think regretful smile you have had a shock she said it would be best not to follow it up with a mistake i think you have more than enough powerful enemies already without seeking to make new ones she was right of course although i could have answered that with so many one more would make little difference but she was not willing that would have made no difference with the kitty i originally knew but i was as under the spell of the times as much as anyone despite everything i could not but treat her as a woman of standing and so desisted even though to continue would have brought much needed release so are you going to explain why you turned so pale i hesitated then shook my head no i said this goes too deep it is not that i do not wish to confide in you but i am anxious lest anything be known of my progress i do not wish to forewarn anyone but please tell your lord of my gratitude and my intention to act on his words speedily she agreed to this and reined in her curiosity with dignity for my part my business was done and i prepared to leave again and again i thanked her for her kindness and her usefulness and wished her well in her fortune she kissed me lightly on the cheek on our parting the first time i believe a woman had ever done such a thing to me for my mother never touched me at all the journey back to oxford gave me time to consider everything i had heard and learned although the malevolence which had dogged me for so long continued to swirl all around the horses slipped their harness and had to be recovered by the coachman a sudden and unlikely storm suddenly blew up out of nowhere and turned the road into a sea of mud most frightening of all a huge crow flew into the carriage when one of the passengers lifted the blind and fluttered around in panic pecking and beating its wings against usmyself most of allbefore being strangled and its corpse hurled out again it was not only myself who saw these mishaps as more than mere accident a minister also traveling to oxford was similarly concerned and even remarked how the ancients viewed such birds as evil portents and the emissaries of malevolent spirits i did not tell him he was nearer the truth than he knew this reminder of the darkness to which i was returning weighed on my mind but i put it from me enough to turn over again and again the catalogue of misdeeds that my enquiries had brought to light by the time i arrived in oxford it was all laid out and the case was as clear and lucid as any presented in a court of law a fine speech it would have been although i never had cause to deliver it i fear that i caused some consternation in the coach as we lumbered toward oxford for i became so involved in my thoughts that i must have talked aloud on several occasions and made dramatic gestures with my arms to emphasize the points i was making to myself but for all the bravado of my mind i knew that i was not yet finished a perfect argument flawless in its conception and its development leading toward a conclusion that is unavoidable in its logical progression is all very well in disputation where power of structure will carry all before it it is of less use in the courtroom whatever the rhetoricians say of their art no i needed testimony as well and what was more i needed it from someone who would match the standing of those gentlemen i would be accusing i could hardly after all rely on morland or lord mordaunt to speak truth and sir john russell had made his partialities perfectly clear thurloe would not speak for me and dr grove could do me little good which meant i had to see sir william compton he i was still sure was as upright and honest a man as could be and the thought that my suspicions about him were certainly wrong came as the greatest relief it would have been impossible to persuade him to act dishonorably and i was certain he consented to the sale of my lands only when he was convinced my fathers sin was so great that no further consideration need be given my family to consider yourself betrayed by a man you called friend this would have been a bitter blow indeed and if he believed my father his closest comrade a traitor then others would as wellthat surely was why he was chosen to disseminate the information i could not go to see him directly as the weather was so bad the roads were all but impassable and in any case my obligations at the university were pressing i had missed much of the term and was forced to make amends like a sniveling schoolboy before i could go off once more not much was required other than my presence but there was little i could do about it and a week or two of quiet reflection was no bad thing i think even though at the time my fiery temperament naturally wanted to bring the matter to an end as soon as possible my few friends by this stage were abandoning me so preoccupied were they by their own petty affairs it grieved me greatly and saddest of all was the distraction of thomas who when i called on him neither asked me how i was nor how my quest was progressing i was barely in the room before he launched into bitter complaints revealing such a violence of soul that the ultimate outcome should not have surprised me as much as it did in short it was becoming clear to him that his claims on the living were to be shunted aside in favor of dr grove the times were changing faster than he had reckoned the new laws on conformity which the government had introduced made almost any deviation from the steady orthodoxy of the anglican church punishable independents presbyterians everyone but virtual catholics in my friends opinion were to be crushed and starved denied any possibility of preferment personally i welcomed such legislation as long overdue the sectaries had done well under cromwell and i could see no reason why they should be allowed to continue in prosperity now for twenty years or more we had endured these arrogant presumptives who had expelled and tormented those who disagreed with them while they had the power to do so why should they now complain when such power was turned with just vengeance on themselves thomas did not see the matter in such a way of course in his opinion the health of the land depended on his gaining eighty pounds a year and the state of marital bliss this would bring in its train he could not see the danger he posed and the more it seemed his ambition would be denied him the more it fed his antagonism for dr grove subtly metamorphosing it from disagreement to dislike and ultimately to a burning and violent hatred it is the college he said and in particular the warden they are so cautious so determined not to give offense or attract the least degree of criticism from anyone that they are prepared to subsume the interests of the parish and install a man such as grove are you sure of this i asked has the warden actually said so to you he does not need to thomas said in disgust indeed he is too crafty a man ever to say anything directly at all perhaps the matter is beyond his control i suggested the living is not in the wardens gift his influence will be decisive lord maynard has asked the colleges opinion before he bestows the parish on someone and that opinion will be communicated through the warden thomas said lord maynard is coming to the college soon and we must all dine together then the senior fellows will give their verdict jack he said desperately i do not know what to do i have no other possible patron i am not like grove who could count on the favor of many a great family if he would but ask now now i said cheerfully although i was becoming irritated with him for his selfishness it is not as bad as that you are still a fellow of this college and a man of learning and probity must always find a place for himself in the world you must cultivate the mighty with the same enthusiasm that you apply to your studies for the one is useless without the other you know as well as i that association with those who can advance you is the sole means that men of worth have of gaining a place in the world and you if i may say so have too much neglected this world in favor of the other i meant no criticism although perhaps it was there certainly thomas bridled at my words so delicate was his spirit and so tender to just reproach are you saying it is my own fault that i am to be defrauded in this manner it is my responsibility that my warden advances another at my expense no i replied not at all though more elegance of address might have persuaded more fellows to support your cause what i am saying is that you have made no effort whatever to cultivate others you must frequently hear of those with livings in their gift have you written to them taken up opportunities to give their sons tuition when they come to this town have you published any of your sermons and offered the dedication of them to any men of influence have you made the gifts and performed the attentions that create an obligation no you have not in your pride you have studied and thought that enough it should be i should not have to bow and scrape i am a minister of the lord not a courtier and that is your arrogance and conceit why should you be so different from everyone else do you think your qualities so great your virtue so large and your learning so extensive that you can scorn to beg like ordinary men and if your purity and loftiness do not come from unreasoning pride be assured that that is how they must appear to others it was a harsh reply but it was necessary and if i was aware of injuring him i did it with the best of intentions thomas was a good man but not a worldly one and therefore quite unsuited for the church of england i do not say this in jest for the church is the best reflection of gods intentions on earth and it was he who ordered man according to his will thomas was obliged to apply to others for support as those beneath him must apply to him in turn how else can any civil society continue to work without a constant flow of gratuity from one to the other high to low did he think that the mighty would apply for the honor of giving him patronage his refusal not only indicated his lack of humility it was at bottom godless perhaps i was in error in saying what i did certainly i was wrong to continue to drive the point home for i am sure that it helped thomas on to the catastrophe which played such a part in mr colas narrative but it is often the way with conversation that people having caused a hurt try to reassure themselves by making it worse thomas i said kindly because i thought that the sooner he was aware of the truth the better grove is older than you and has a superior claim the thirteen men who run this college have known him for years while you are a relative newcomer he has taken care to be pleasant to lord maynard while you have not and he has offered the college a proportion of the living which you cannot do i wish it were otherwise but you must face the factyou will not get this place as long as grove is alive and wants it for himself had i known the outcome of course i would not have spoken but his mildness of manner was such that i never for a moment considered that the realization might drive him into such evil action moreover had i remained in close association with him i do not believe dr grove would have died it is known that a resentment unexpressed grows in the soul i certainly had experienced such a malady myself with my counsel and restraint thomass breast would not have filled with so immoderate a hatred that he took the steps he did or at least i might have discerned his mind and stopped him but i was in prison at the time and could do nothing to stay his hand i see that i have scarcely mentioned dr wallis since i recounted my visit to his house in merton street and i must do so briefly now to indicate the mans bad faith for according to morland he had known at least something about the plot against my father and therefore he had lied outright to me on the subject he asked me to find him documents in my fathers possession when he had all he needed already in his desk i determined to confront him with this duplicity and so wrote him a polite letter presenting my compliments and enquiring delicately for an interview i received a dismissive reply so a few days later i decided to pay him a visit he was at that stage lodged in new college for building works had encumbered his house and his own college had no accommodation which would match his rank his wife had been dispatched to london to which city wallis intended to fly as soon as the end of term permitted i noted with some amusement that he was now a close neighbor of dr grove as i could not imagine two gentlemen less likely to be on civil terms wallis was in an ill humor as he was a man who clearly did not relish any form of inconvenience being turfed out of his own lodging virtually deprived of his servants and forced into unwanted society through having to eat in college when he could not prevail on the kitchen to send his meals up had no good effect on his mood this i could see the moment i entered the door and i was accordingly prepared to be maltreated at his hands he was brutally unkind offensive and threatening by turns so much so that i regretted approaching him in the first place in brief he upbraided me for writing to him and told me i had no claim on him at all that he had undertaken reluctantly to oblige if i would provide him with the necessary materials but resented mightily being harried in such a way i have already told you i have nothing i said whatever my father may have had was lost it seems in fact that you possess more papers than i do as i am told that you deciphered the documents which incriminated my father i he said in mock surprise what makes you think that sir samuel morland took some letters you worked on and passed them on to the king they supposedly demonstrated my father was a traitor i believe that those coded letters were forged on thurloes instructions i would like to see them so i can demonstrate this samuel told you all this he told me a pack of lies it is a truth i discovered on my own in that case i congratulate you he said suddenly friendly it seems you have been cleverer than myself for i never suspected that i was in any way duped by either thurloe or samuel will you give them to me alas i cannot young man i dont have them you must morland said samuel is a great romancer it is possible that what you say is true and that samuel imposed himself on me in this fashion but i have none of the originals so where would they be he shrugged and i knew from the way he moved and the way his eyes would not meet mine that he was lying if they still exist i imagine mr thurloe would have them if you can find sufficient patience i will make discreet enquiries for you with great expressions of thanks on my part and an equally hypocritical expression of admiration on his side i left his room soon after as convinced as i could be that dr wallis had those letters close by him somewhere i was laid low in my bed for several days after this meeting which distressed me however i knew the cause of the infirmity and also knew well that summoning a physician would be throwing good money after bad so i lay and suffered until the worst of the affliction was passed and my head had cleared enough for me to move much of the time i spent in prayer and i found that blessed exercise a great comfort to me calming my soul and filling me with a strange and powerful strength enough to complete the task my father had set me it was the second day of march before i set out for compton wynyates slipping from my tutors bed before dawn dressing on the landing so as not to disturb the other students slumbering within and wrapping myself up with the thickest and warmest clothes i had i took one of my fellow students pair of boots having tried them on in secret a few days before my need was very great the cold was dreadful worse than anything for many years and without stout high leather my suffering would have been intolerable then i prevailed on a tradesman heading north with a consignment of gloves and other goods for yorkshire to let me sit in the back of his wagon until banbury in exchange for which i pushed when the cart bogged down in the road and took a turn driving the horses when he wearied from banbury i walked and arrived at compton wynyates late in the evening well after darkness had fallen i clapped my hands as i walked through the great front door to summon the servant that my arrival could be announced i did so with bravado but i was highly nervous for i had no idea whether i would be well received in the back of my mind all the time was the reception i had received from sir john russell i could not bear to be so rejected by sir william also but i was swiftly reassured for he soon descended to greet me himself and made a great show of welcoming me to the house whatever resentment he may have harbored for my name did not rise to the surface i am astonished to see you jack he said cordially what brings you here surely term is on at the university and you are still a student i am surprised you were given permission to leave the town such laxity never existed in my day this was a special dispensation and i have an indulgent tutor i said well i am pleased you are here he said it has been too long we have a fine fire in the parlor so come and warm yourself immediately this hall is as cold as charity itself i was dumbfounded with relief by this reception and upbraided myself for doubting his kindness amiability was sir williams natural demeanor and he was very much the country gentleman in that regard thickset and with a florid complexion he had a simple directness that made him devotedly loyal to such causes and people as he clasped to his heart i was too cold and tired to pursue that question at that moment rather i allowed him to lead me through to the great fire and sit me down within the aura of its warmth which made such a delightful contrast with the chill of the room beyond the flames influence there i was served hot wine and food by a servant and left alone in peace until i had finished my meal sir william excused himself saying he had small business that would not wait but that he would be back in a half hour i was almost asleep when he returned not that he took such a long time but the heat and the drink drugged my mind and made me realize how dreadfully weary i was i was also saddened as i sat there so warm and comfortable not long ago this had been my home and i found that despite everything that had happened i still felt it to be such i had spent more time in the company of his family than i had in that of my own this house i knew better than that abode which was no longer mine even in name in a conflict of slumbering emotions i sat quietly by the fire drinking my wine pondering such strangeness until the return of sir william forced me back into some semblance of alertness it is at this point that i must return to one essential purpose of my narrative or at least to that matter which caused me to reach for pen and paper to start with i must discuss my dealings with signor marco da cola and the worth of his narrative as i said much earlier in this account i find his memory a strange one indeed for he discourses at length on the trivial and ignores studiously matters of much greater import i do not know and at this great distance i care less why this is my only concern here is to correct his account in those passages where i am directly concerned the first was that evening at sir williams house for by his side when he returned to the fire was marco da cola i must assume that he had some good reason for falsifying the story of his arrival in england for i can attest that it is erroneous he cannot have arrived as he said he did not come to london then proceed more or less directly to oxford he was in this country many days beforehand a strange little fellow i found him too his clothes all lavender and purple with the strangest of cuts were such as would draw attention in such a place and the aroma of perfume that entered the room long before he did was quite unforgettable later when he saw me in prison in the company of lower i could almost tell who my visitor was long before the jailer opened the cell door so strong was the smell he gave off but i took to him odd though he was and only later discerned that there was more to him than instant appraisal suggested to meet he was short and stout with merry eyes and an easy laugh everything amused him and everything attracted his interest he said little not being greatly proficient in english though much better than i at first imagined but sat quietly bobbing his head and chuckling with appreciation at our conversation as though he was hearing the best jokes in the world and the wittiest of conversations only once during that first encounter did i even have half a suspicion there might be more to him when sir william and i were talking i saw a flash in his eyes and the most fleeting glimpse of cunning passed across that chubby harmlesslooking face but who pays attention to such details when all else indicates the opposite it was a trick of the light only a reflection of the flames in the dimness of the room and nothing more as he was unwilling or unable to play any manful part in the conversation sir william and i talked instead and gradually almost forgot the presence of the foreigner in our midst sir william introduced him as a man with whom he had dealings in trade for as master of the ordnance his paltry reward for his labors on behalf of the king he was thrown in contact with many foreign traders and colas father was it seemed a man of great power in such matters moreover said sir william he and his family had been good friends to the great cause over the years and now naturally wanted to supply some of those goods his majesty needed i wished them well and hoped they would both profit from the association for if sir williams position gave him little standing it held out instead the probability of considerable wealth a dedicated master of the ordnance taking what bribes and profits came his way could amass a considerable fortune in a short time by controlling the armys supplies and sir william was not wholly discontented with his position he had it must be said greater need of money than honor at that time i suppose i can see why the presence of such a man would need to be kept discreetly quiet although colas delicacy in hiding such matters so long after the event strikes me as being excessively fine for sir william as i have mentioned was in dispute with my lord clarendon and any man who angered the lord chancellor had to tread very carefully in the execution of his office it mattered not that clarendon had so joyously looted the treasury himself since the moment the king returned his enemies had to beware for what was encouraged in clarendons friends was used to tear down his enemies the more isolated he became the more the attacks on those who wished to be rid of him grew in violence the most ordinary behavior could be turned into a weapon for clarendon was not a lawyer for nothing taking the fruits of office could in a twinkling of an eye become bribery and corruption and such matters have swept many an honest person from office and now jack said sir william after we had talked awhile you must allow me to say something in all seriousness and do please listen until i have finished i nodded you are no doubt all too aware of the great matter that passed between your father and myself i would like to make it as clear that i in no wise associate you with those events even though you are his son you will always be welcome in this house and my acquaintance partisan of my father though i was i was aware of the deep goodness of that statement if it came from true sincerity i was inclined to believe that it did for he had not the guile to dissimulate well nor the hardness of heart to toy so cruelly with another this made him a loyal friend and a bad conspirator the simplicity of his own soul made him unsuspecting of base motives in others and so made him the perfect instrument for those wishing to bend the truth to their own ends i thank you for those words i replied i did not expect such a welcome from you i was afraid that circumstances had engendered some bitterness between us so they had he replied seriously but that was an error on my part i wanted you out of my sight because i could not stand the reminder your presence brought me i now see this was cruel you have never done me harm and have suffered more than anyone his statement brought a tear of gratitude to my eyes as it had been a long time since anyone had talked to me with such kindness i knew the limits of his generosity for he believed absolutely in my fathers guilt and oddly found i honored him the more for it it is no easy business to embrace the child of a man who you think has done you such injury that is certainly true i replied and i think i have been imposed on far more than was just this is the cause of my visit you were the trustee of my inheritance and yet i have no inheritance my lands are now in other hands and my position is ruined you may have considered that all bonds of loyalty between you and my father were dissolved but your trust continued in that matter so how is it that i am penniless now i see from your face that this question disturbs you and i do not in any way wish to level an accusation but you must admit it is a fair question to ask he nodded soberly it is although my wonder is not that you ask but that you do not know the answer already it is my understanding that i have been left with nothing at all is that correct your fortune has been much diminished it is true but it has not been extinguished entirely there is enough for you to rebuild if you are industrious and there is no place better for making a name than the inns of court and no profession more suited for amassing wealth than the law my lord clarendon he said with a smile of contempt has demonstrated that beyond contention but the estate was sold even though entailed how could that be because your father insisted on assigning it as guarantee for his debts he could not do that no but i could i stared at him as he admitted this and he looked uncomfortable at feeling my gaze rest on him i had no choice your father came to me and begged he said it was my duty as a friend and a comrade to help him having tied up his lands so they could not be confiscated if he should come into misfortune he discovered that he could not use them to raise money either he absolutely insisted that i act on his behalf and authorize the loan all i was required to do was sign the papers and you did i did and later discovered he had not played absolutely fair with me or with his creditors for he had raised several loans at the same time pledging the estate many times over after the debacle i found myself liable for the debts as trustee had i been a rich man myself i perhaps could have assisted but you know i think something of my situation and i must be frank i was not in the humor to be generous at that time so the estate was dissolved no even so we did our best to keep it in your family your uncle bought it and i insisted on a clause that should you ever be in a position to pay cash down he would sell the land back to you we also reached a settlement with the creditors a generous settlement i must say for they accepted much less than they were owed only some land was sold out of the family entire including harland wyte which will be the most valuable of all the land when it is drained how come that was sold to the man who accused my father in the first place sir william looked surprised at the depth of my knowledge and paused before he spoke again no he said after a short while sir samuel did not act with great generosity of spirit i must say but we had little choice you must remember that the revelations about your father were initially known to only a very few people and it was imperative to keep it so the moment his creditors heard a whiff of the matter they would have swooped immediately we needed time and needed morland to keep quiet i regret to say that his consent was expensive the sale of harland wyte at an advantageous price to him bought us eight weeks in which to act i bowed my head in the greatest of sadness for i did not doubt that he was telling me the absolute truth as he saw it i was heartily glad of it i had encountered so much duplicity in the past few months that i no longer expected to meet an honest man and i fear was overinclined to harbor suspicions in his way sir william was betrayed every bit as much as my father had been for his goodness had been perverted to evil ends i knew that sooner or later i would have to tell him so lay bare the whole scandalous history and confront him with what he had done in all innocence and with the very best of intentions it concerned me for i was afraid it would break his heart and i also knew that i as much as those evil men would have to stoke up the fires of his wrath so that he would fight to correct the injustices in which he had participated it was not to my advantage to pursue the conversation much further that night i did not wish to seem overanxious and in any case i was desperately tired shortly after then i put on my cloak picked up a candle and made my way from the warmth of the fire to the chamber i had always used presumably sir william had roused out a servant when i arrived for the room was already prepared for me there was even a small fire burning in the grate although it gave out more consolation than warmth i shivered in that cramped little room but nonetheless gave thanks as i knelt down to pray that i was not in one of the great cavernous chambers more honored guests received the italian gentleman i thought would be suffering mightily that night my devotions finished and in that calm frame of mind which habitually comes over men of faith when they give thanks in true humility i was in half a mind to wrap myself up as much as i could and get straight into the bed but i was grimy from the journey and reluctantly decided to wipe my face first a bowl of water had been placed on the chest by the great window and after i had shuttered the casements tight i cracked the thin layer of ice then plunged my face into the bitterly cold water then i received a rude reminder of the hydraheaded nature of my woes even after so many years i cannot bring myself to write down the obscene images that were conjured up in that bowl of water illuminated solely by the flickering candle on the chest the lubricious and foul torments presented to me were such that only the most devoted slave of lucifer could have imagined them to send them forth to anguish the soul of a christian after prayer was an act of the most profound evil the noises that reverberated through my head as i found myself leaning heavily over that bowl desperate to tear away my eyes yet unable to move a single muscle made me cry out with horror and terror and yet i confess i was fascinated by the scenes i witnessed even the spirits of the pure and innocent were subjected to most violent depravity and made to enjoy the abuse i saw the image of my fathernot he indeed but a devil in his guisestretched out as sarah blundy pleasured him in the most disgusting fashion imaginable all sorts of demons cavorted lewdly in my sight sure i was watching and relishing the torture they imposed i could not speak and could not move to take myself away from the foulness because i was not prepared for it any more i had grown weak and believed that perhaps the assault was over that perhaps the blundy girl had relented or given up her revenge i now had all the evidence i needed that she had been merely preparing an ever more vicious attack nor it seemed did it involve only myself if her diabolical masters reach could torment those who should be beyond harm and impervious to pain it took the mightiest of efforts to tear myself away from that monstrous sight to cast the bowl onto the floor and fling myself into the corner of the room where i lay panting unable to believe that it was all over i lay there much of the night i think cowering in sheer terror lest it start again and remained motionless until my limbs were stiff and my body icy with the cold when i could stand it no more and the pain overwhelmed my fear i rose from my hiding place and spent some considerable time checking that the windows were firmly closed and pulling the chest across the room so that the door was barred so tightly even the devil himself would have trouble gaining entry then i tried to sleep afraid of the moment when the candle would finally gutter out i had never been afraid of the dark before then that night it terrified me i was still shaky from fear and lack of sleep when marco da cola engaged me in conversation the next morning i was not greatly responsive as i was very much preoccupied with the attack on me but his persistent efforts eventually forced me to be as civil as possible looking at me with his twinkling eyes and smiling quite vacuously he began by saying he understood that my father was sir james prestcott i fully expected that he was going to examine me on my fathers fall so answered in the coldest manner i could but rather than adopting a grave and distressed face typical of those who intend to patronize with their commiseration he brightened considerably at my response that is excellent indeed he said in an accent so thick he was barely comprehensible truly excellent he beamed with pleasure at me might i enquire why you say so it is not a response i have been used to of late because i knew your most admirable father well a few years ago i was greatly saddened to hear of his misfortunes you must allow me to offer you my most sincere condolences on the loss of a man who must have been a perfect father that he was and i thank you i said i had taken a dislike to the foppish little foreigner for such people are highly distasteful to me in ordinary circumstances in this case i was aware that my opinion needed revision there were few people kind enough even to acknowledge an acquaintance with my father let alone to praise him you must tell me how you met him i said i know nothing of that time when he was out of the country except that he was forced to sell his services as a soldier he sold them to venice cola replied which was grateful for them for he was a brave man if more people were like him then the ottoman would not be threatening the very heart of europe so he was valued by your state i am glad of it highly and he was as popular with the officers as he was with the men he was gallant but never foolhardy when he decided to return to his home those of us who wished your king well consoled ourselves that our loss would be your sovereigns gain i find it difficult to believe that the man i knew could act meanly in any way you must not believe all the information you hear i assured him i am persuaded that my father was the victim of an abominable crime with luck i will soon have the proof of it i am glad cola said truly glad nothing would give me greater pleasure you were a soldier yourself he hesitated a moment before replying to my question i have trained in medicine in recent years among other things he said a most unmilitary occupation and i occupy myself mainly with questions of curiosity i admired your father greatly but have never had much affection for his profession and the little man walked off leaving me to give thanks that my fathers character was such that it invariably left a favorable impression on those who encountered him when they were unaffected by the poison of rumor sir william had already left the house he was an assiduous governor of his estate believing firmly that it was his obligation to see to such matters himself besides he always enjoyed it and would have been the happier had he devoted himself entirely to country pursuits the profits of the court however could not be resisted and at least tour times a year he had to go to london to oversee his office but the rest of the time he was in warwickshire and nearly every day whatever the weather he would collect one or two of his favorite hounds and leave the house early in the morning to pay calls give advice and issue orders around noon he would return redfaced from the exercise radiating contentment and satisfaction before eating and taking a nap in the evening he would see to the paperwork which any estate of size generates and check his wifes governance of the household this routine he repeated without variation every day and i believe that every day he went to bed and slept soundly confident of having blamelessly fulfilled all his many obligations his life was in my opinion most completely admirable and content as long as no unwelcome intrusion disturbed its placid rhythm because of this i was unable to engage him in further conversation until that evening when his business done he became once more the genial host it was cola once lady compton had withdrawn who brought up the subject of my fathers innocence sir william instantly looked very distressed indeed at the remark i beg you jack he said sadly put this matter behind you you should know that it was i who received the evidence of your fathers guilt and i can assure you on my life that i would not have acted had i not been totally convinced it was the worst day of my life i would have been a happier man had i died before i discovered that secret again i felt no anger rising in my breast as i had on so many previous occasions i knew that this kind man spoke with the most complete sincerity i also knew that he had been an innocent dupe as betrayed as my father for he had been tricked into plunging the knife into his best comrade it was with the greatest regret therefore that i replied to his words i fear sir that i will shortly require you to bear yet more distress because i am within a whisker of proving what i say i am convinced that the evidence which convinced you was forged and had been concocted by samuel morland to protect the true traitor it was given to you because your honesty was so unquestioned that an accusation from your lips would be the more easily believed sir william turned deathly somber at these words and the silence in that room when i had finished was total you have proof he asked incredulously i cannot believe it to accept that a man could so coldly plot such a thing is incredible at the moment my proof is incomplete but i am certain that when it is presented properly i will induce john thurloe to confirm it and if that happens i do not doubt that morland will sell his partner in deceit to save his own neck but i will also need you to confirm some parts of the story i believe my father was chosen as the victim so the russell family could remove my fathers objection to their profiteering you are the only one who can say the information came from sir john russell to begin with and that he had it from morland will you say that with all my heart he said vehemently and more if what you say is true i will kill them both with my own hands but please do not think badly of sir john unless you must i saw his face when he told me of the news and the distress was obvious he is a good actor then and he also pledged himself through his family with your fathers creditors for a while so the estate could be sold at the best possible price had he not done so you would now be in very dire straits indeed that of all things made me angry the idea that i was meant to be grateful to such a man was infuriating and the cunning way he had hidden his depredations under the appearance of selfless virtue and kindness sickened me beyond belief it was desperately hard for me to resist jumping up there and then denouncing all the russell family and upbraiding sir william himself for his foolishly trusting blindness but i succeeded although i let cola converse with him for upward of half an hour before i was confident enough to speak again then i merely told him that i was sure absolutely sure that what i said was correct and that in due course i would prove it to him what evidence do you have so far he asked some i said unwilling to go into further details and dismay him by the fact that my case was not yet complete but not enough i do not have the forged letters when i have them i will be able to confront thurloe directly and where are they i shook my head you do not trust me i trust you completely you are the nearest thing i have on this earth to a father now that my own is no more i honor and reverence you for all you have done for me and i would not for the world burden you with the knowledge i possess i am proud to place myself in danger of assault from these men for they know that i am on their trail i will not place others in danger without good reason this pleased him and he told me that if my father was as guiltless as i believed then i was a worthy son to him then the conversation diverted onto other paths with the italian a man most eager to learn about foreign lands earnestly plying sir william and myself with questions about the country and the way it was governed sir william told him much and i learned a great deal also for although i knew that he did not like lord clarendon i had thought that their dislike was mainly personal instead i received my first great lesson in the politics of the land for he told me how clarendon a man of little background was so extending himself from his country estate nearby that he was pushing his interest deep into the land usually controlled by the compton family up through oxfordshire and across warwickshire he had the presumption to insist absolutely insist that one of the warwick county members of parliament at the last election be one of his men because he said it was vital there should be sympathetic men in the commons to do the kings business as if my family does not know has not always known where its duties lie he has reached an understanding with the lord lieutenant of oxfordshire and is now handing out bribes to the gentlemen of warwickshire i understand he is in ill health cola said if so he cannot remain in his position for long i can only hope not replied my guardian he is out to destroy my family that is not surprising i said sadly his friends have already destroyed mine we talked no more of this as sir william showed signs of distress at the thought and cola kindly began to ask about the late wars sir william reminisced about the battles and the heroic deeds he had seen marco da cola talked of his countrys war on crete and its brave resistance to the brutality of the turk i having no stories of daring to contribute listened to their tales basking in their acceptance of my presence and feeling myself a man among equals if only i thought it could always be like this then i would be happy and want for nothing a fire a glass and amiable companionship is all any man needs for true contentment i have them all now and the future i glimpsed that evening is every bit as good as i imagined i could have stayed in that house for a long time and i was most reluctant to tear myself away the tasks that lay before me were daunting and the prospect of renewing the struggle brought no pleasure but i resolved that the sooner i began the better so when cola had retired to his chamber and sir william went back to his office to attend to business i slipped softly down the stairs and out of the great door it was entirely dark with no moon and not even a star visible in the sky as i walked it was only because i knew the house so well that i managed to find the track which led to the road the small torch i had brought with me from the fire scarcely gave enough light to see more than a few yards ahead of me it was cold as well and my feet crunched on the frost that lay thick on the frozen ground all around the nightbirds fluttered and the animals patrolled their nocturnal domain searching for their prey or trying to escape their fate i was not frightened nor was i even apprehensive i am told that this is unusual for often we are given to know of impending danger and our necks prickle or our scalp itches as the peril approaches not so in my case i was concerned merely with finding the gate and the road to banbury and i had to concentrate so much to keep my feet on the path and avoid the ditches which i remembered on either side that i had no thought for anything else it was only the noise which broke that caution and even then i did not react immediately thinkingif i thought at allthat it was some fox or badger crossing in front of me just out of reach of my torchs light only at the very last moment did all my senses scream out that i was in mortal peril and force me to leap bodily out of the way of the hideous fiend which rose up out of the earth and blocked my path it had taken the form of a man but such apparitions are never perfect and the careful eye can always see where the imitation fails in this case it was the movement all jerky and irregular that betrayed the fact that here was a monster not a human being it had tried to take the form of an old gentleman but it was covered in rancid pustules and hideous deformities with bent back and irregular gait and its eyesstrange this and i never understood how it could bewere dark as pitch but burned brightly in the dark and i could see the flames of hell itself deep within the noise it made as it wheedled and cajoled and tried to fascinate me into its trust was the most revolting of all indeed i believe it did not speak rather i heard its entreaties like the hissing of a snake and the squeaking of a bat as they sounded in my head but not in my ears no jack it hissed you must not leave yet please stay with me come with me i remembered the visions i had seen the previous night and shuddered at the implication of the words and willed myself to ignore its importuning i tried crossing my fingers and holding them up to its face but this symbol of our lords suffering occasioned no more than a snigger of dismissal i began to recite the lords prayer but my dry mouth and parched lips allowed no sound to escape and so in blind terror i retreated back up the path keeping my eyes on the beast stalking me and fearing that it might at any moment grab hold of me and tear my soul out of my body i told it to leave me in peace but there was no response except a hideous laugh and a sucking sound like that of a bog pulling a sheep under the surface and i felt a cold clammy sensation on my arm as it reached out a skinny hand to grip me i leaped back and swung my dagger round more in the hope of indicating my intention of resisting than with any expectation of mounting an adequate defense but my stoutheartedness and immunity to the creatures blandishments seemed to have an effect for the devil relies on willing submission and cannot easily force those who genuinely repudiate his blandishments the monster fell back gurgling with surprise at my forthright movement leaving an opening using the same hand to push it farther away from mean error for it had a foul putrid smell which was hard to wash offi ran past up the path to the gate i do not know where i ran i was simply concerned with putting as much distance between myself and the hideous deformity as i could eventually i came to the river that runs nearby and walked down to the waters edge to bathe my hand and clean it of the smell that still filled my nostrils i was panting hard from terror and the running and must have stayed there crouched down and huddled against a boat drawn up on the shore for the night looking at the water for upward of an hour or more then eventually i roused myself convinced that the danger must surely be past and began to walk once more calm but on the alert for more attacks i heard the dogs some half an hour later they caught up with me shortly after that and after i was manhandled to the ground kicked and abused i was informed to my absolute astonishment and disbelief that sir william compton had been brutally attacked and that i was being held responsible for the deed i need not i think dwell too much on these events my treatment was abominable and the accusations leveled against me a disgrace while it is necessary and reasonable that criminals be treated in such a fashion to incarcerate and humiliate gentlemen in such a brutal manner is beyond comprehension the period i spent awaiting trial was one of the deepest distress and in my weakened state the blundy girl sensed her opportunity and i was driven near mad by the constant pains and visions that she sent to me night and day i had been ready for the witch to launch another attack but did not realize she had such strength and evil purpose it took some thought to grasp the full cunning of what had happened and once understood the explanation is straightforward it cannot be doubted that sir william heard me leave the house and came to investigate and at that moment his form was taken over by a demon so effectively that my eyes could not penetrate the disguise after i stabbed it with my dagger the spell dissolved and the fiendish cloak evaporated it was a devilishly evil attack for the witch must have realized by then that she could not destroy me so she thought instead to have others act for herhaving me hanged would accomplish the task perfectly when i was thrown into the jail cell and shackled with chains to its wall i quickly came to realize that without extraordinary fortune she would succeed for i had indeed stabbed sir william and brought him near to death and what was more he had survived and would undoubtedly say that i attacked without warning my defense was no defense at all for who would believe me if i told the truth and for many days i could do little but sit in my loathsome cell and wait i was not without visitors and messages but they were of little comfort my dear uncle wrote to say that he washed his hands of me entirely and would not help my cause in any way thomas tried his best although i could see his disapproval very clearly on his face but he tried at least when he could tear his mind off the fact that the final contest with grove for the living was nearing and would take place when lord maynard came to dine in the college then came lower accompanied by marco da cola i will not repeat a description of lowers impudent and premature demands for my corpse colas account is accurate enough on that first occasion the italian did not acknowledge me and i pretended also not to know him as he clearly wished it but he returned alone that same afternoon on the pretext of bringing me some wine and we had a conversation in which he told me of what had transpired that terrible night for himself he said he spoke from hearsay alone he had heard and seen nothing of importance it was only the sudden commotion of people shouting women wailing and dogs barking that aroused him and brought him from his bed to investigate from then on his whole occupation was with sir william and his wound for he had labored hard throughout the night and was alone responsible for the fact that he had not died he assured me that sir william would recover and had already made so much progress that he felt free to leave him in the care of his wife i told him my heart was glad although i knew it would not yet be welcome i begged him to deliver a message assuring sir william of my joy at his safety telling him of my total innocence and asking whether he was conscious of the fraud perpetrated on his body this he undertook to do and then having formed my plan for escape i urgently repeated my request that dr grove come to see me as soon as possible i was astonished when wallis turned up in his stead the next evening but my mind quickly saw that this happy chance presented fresh opportunities he questioned me about sir william and asked a huge raft of inane and pointless questions about marco da cola which were so imbecilic i will not trouble to record them here naturally i told him as little as possible but subtly kept the conversation going with little hints and suggestions until i was sure the jailer would be too drunk to pay much attention then i overpowered him trussed him upi confess i tied the knots tighter than i would have done for groveand left he was so surprised and indignant i almost burst out laughing with pleasure it was so very simple i could scarcely believe my good fortune knowing that wallis was safe and sound gave me an opportunity i could scarcely dared have hoped for as i knew that his room would be open to my attentions so i crossed the town to new college and used his key to get through the main gate again the simplicity of the task made me believe that i was under special protectionthe door to his room was unlocked the bureau was easily opened and the folio of documentseven labeled sr japrestcottwas in the second drawer half a dozen sheets of papers all so incomprehensible i assumed they must be the coded missives i sought these i stuffed under my shirt for safekeeping and prepared to leave delighted with my success i heard the low but horrible scream when i was on the landing about to descend instantly i froze convinced first that the devils had come for me once again and when i was reassured on that point worried that my luck had changed and that the noise would draw attention and lead to my discovery hardly daring to move i held my breath and waited but the quadrangle remained as quiet and deserted as it had been before i was also perplexed it was a noise of great pain and clearly came from dr groves room immediately opposite walliss with some trepidation i knocked on the inner doorthe great outer door was not closedthen quietly pushed it open and peered inside grove was still alive but only barely so and the sight tore at my heart and drew anguished protest from my mouth his face was contorted with the most excruciating pain his limbs twitching and fluttering as he thrashed about on the floor like a madman in the throes of an attack he looked at me as i lit a candle in the grate and held it over him but i do not think he recognized me rather with an unsteady hand he indicated something on the table in the corner then with froth and spittle gurgling from his gaping mouth he fell back on the floor and expired i had never witnessed such an agony and pray with fervor that such a sight should never again assault my eyes i was petrified by the sight and dared not move half afraid he was dead and half that he would come back to life again it was only with the greatest of effort that i stirred myself and looked to see what he had pointed at in that last pathetic gesture the bottle and glass on the table still contained a great deal of liquid i sniffed cautiously and it gave no hint of mortal danger but it seemed at the very least likely that poison lay behind what i had just witnessed then i heard the footsteps coming up the stairs and terror gripped my heart as tightly as my hand gripped a knife i saw on groves desk louder and louder they grew up one pair pausing on the landing then the other it could not be wallis surely i thought he could not have escaped and i knew that if any man came into this room i would have to kill him the steps grew louder and stopped on the landing and there was a long pause before the thunderous knocking came on the door to groves room perhaps it was not perhaps it was simply the lightest of tapping but it seemed to me loud enough to waken the dead from their graves i stood there in darkness and prayed desperately that the visitor would think that grove was not there and go away but in my nervousness and efforts to be quiet i accomplished the opposite for i brushed against a book on his table and sent it crashing to the ground all my prayers and wishes were of no avail then there was a pause and then i heard the latch of the door moving the unmistakable sound of the door itself creaking open then a footfall on one of the loose and creaking oak floorplanks when i saw that the visitor had a lantern and would soon see both myself and groves body i knew i could hide no longer so i reached forward and grabbed him by the neck and pushed him backward out of the room my antagonist had little strength and put up almost no resistance to me in his surprise and terror it took scarce a second or two to wrestle him to the ground on the landing stop the lantern from setting fire to the entire building and then see who he was thomas i cried in the greatest surprise when the feeble light played across his ashen frightened face jack he whispered hoarsely with even greater astonishment what are you doing here i released him quickly and brushed him down and apologized for manhandling him what i am doing is very simple i said i am escaping but i think maybe you have some explaining to do his head fell when i said that and he looked as though he was about to burst into tears it was very strange all this conversationa priest and a fugitive huddled close together on the landing talking in whispers while in the nextdoor room only feet away there lay a stillwarm corpse the look on his face i may say would have hanged him in any courtroom in the land even had the jury not known the long and bitter story which had led up to this event oh dear god help me he cried what am i to do you know what i have done keep your voice down i said testily i have not gone to all the trouble of escaping just to be caught by the sound of your wails whats done is done you have been stupid beyond belief but there is no going back you cannot undo it now why did i do it i saw the warden standing there and even before i knew it i had accosted him and told him a complete pack of lies about that servant of his what thomas what are you talking about blundy that girl i told the warden that grove had gone back on his word and that id seen her sneaking into his room tonight then i realized yes yes lets not get into that what did you come here for anyway i wanted to see him before it was too late it is too late but surely there must be something i can do stop being childish i snapped back at him of course there isnt neither of us have any choice i must run you must go back to your room and sleep still he sat there on the floor clutching his knees thomas do as i say i commanded leave it to me it was his fault he moaned i couldnt stand it any more the way he treated me hell not make that mistake again i replied and if you keep calm well both survive to see you with a bishops miter but not if you panic and not unless you learn how to keep your mouth shut i could not bear to remain there any longer so i pulled him to his feet together we crept down the stairs and at the bottom i pointed him in the direction of his room you go back to your room and sleep as best you can my friend give me your word you will say nothing and do nothing without discussing it with me first again the wretch just hung his head like a schoolboy thomas are you listening yes he said finally raising his eyes to look at me repeat after me and swear you will never mention anything of this evening or you will hang us both i swear he said in a dull voice but jack enough leave everything to me i know exactly how to deal with this do you believe me he nodded you will do as i say another nod good go away then goodbye my friend and i pushed him in the back to get him walking and waited until he was halfway across the quad then i went back up to groves room where i took his key so i could lock the door and his signet ring the plan that had leaped fully formed into my mind was so simple and complete that it must have been due to some inspiration for i must modestly admit that i could hardly have devised such a perfect solution unaided what had happened was perfectly clear and colas document confirms it for that was the day lord maynard had dined and the great contest for his favor had taken place between grove and thomas as might be expected thomas was outwitted outthought and humiliated he had never been one for public dispute but had prepared himself so much and worked himself into such a fit of anxiety about the encounter that he was barely capable of speech grove instead was ready for he had encountered cola and knew that the italian would be the perfect foil for demonstrating his orthodoxy and robust defense of the church so the italian sat there thinking he was engaged in a conversation about philosophy while all the time grove was showing his fitness for a parish by disagreeing with everything he said easily enough done since grove removed thomas from the contest by ignoring him and battering him with insults until thomas despaired at being constantly interrupted and walked out i suspect so that no man might see his tears i believe he went mad from despair and denounced grove to the warden shortly after in some halfthoughtout act of desperation then he realized that it would soon be exposed as a lie and a malicious one at that so he went one fatal step further not a goodness for a man of god and yet i knew that thomas had much good in him he had shown me that time and again and even had that not been the case i was bound to him and owed him my assistance for he was not only a friend he was quite incapable of looking after himself the loyalties of lincolnshire i have mentioned before it was the possibility of aiding myself at the same time which indicated that some guardian angel must be about whispering into my mind i should return to my narrative however and say that by the time i left groves room with his signet in my pocket it was nine oclock by st marys and i knew that i had eight hours before the jailer would come to my cell in the castle and discover my escape my movements were unconstrained and i was at total liberty to do whatever i wished what i wished to do at that moment was kill sarah blundy as it had long been clear to me that only through the death of one or the other of us would this diabolical contest be brought to an end i knew of course that this was impossible i could no more kill her with my own hands than she could kill me others had to do that and just as she had laid a trap for me that i should be hanged so i could do the same to her it was slightly before midnight i think that i made my way through the fortifications that still surrounded the town and avoided the night watch certainly i heard the great bells of the city making their mournful toll as i walked swiftly across the fields parallel to the london road which i dared not use until i was past heddington village dawn was beginning to come over the horizon by the time i approached the village of great milton i waited until the morning was well advanced spending my time observing the house unseen to see how many people there were and what might be my best means of escape should that be necessary then my heart thudding in my chest i prepared myself walked up to the door and knocked it was pleasantly warm in the hallway which was surprisingly far from opulent i knew of course that thurloe had made himself as rich as croesus during his years of power as cromwells henchman and was disconcerted to see him in such modest accommodation i only saw one servant in all the time i was there and although the house was comfortable it was not of the size and splendor i expected but i assumed that this was another example of the arrogant humility of the puritans who make such a show of their piety and disdain for worldly possessions personally i always detested them for that grabbing with one hand and praying with the other it is the duty of men of rank to live in a suitable state even if they have no inclination the servant an old fellow who blinked like an owl brought suddenly into the light told me that his master was busy at his books and that i should wait in the main parlor mr thurloe would be glad of a visitor to divert him he said not this one i thought to myself as i followed his instructions and walked in the commodious warm room at the eastern end of the house not this one he came in a few minutes later a gaunt man with long thin hair around a highdomed forehead his skin was pale almost translucent and apart from heavy lines around his eyes he seemed younger than i knew he must be now i knew what had transpired and how he had manipulated men good and bad to his will i was half minded simply to run him through then and there without wasting further time hed find out who his assailant was soon enough i thought when the flames began to lick around his soul i was determined but felt my resolution ebb with every step he took toward me for months now lying awake at night i had imagined myself whipping out my fathers sword and thrusting it into his heart intoning some suitable words as he expired with a look of cowardly terror on his face crying for mercy slobbering with fear while i stood implacable over him i had no sword but groves knife would do as well easy to imagine harder to accomplish killing a man in battle when the blood is hot is one thing dispatching one in a peaceful parlor with the fire crackling comfortably in the grate and the smell of burning apple logs in the air is quite another doubt assailed me for the first timewould killing a man unable to defend himself not suddenly lower me to his level would not my great act be demeaned if it was performed in an unseemly manner i suspect i would not be so bothered now although as it is unlikely that i will ever be in such a situation again the lord having smiled on me it is easy to say and difficult to prove perhaps indeed it was my doubt and my hesitation which earned me that divine forbearance good morning sir you are welcome he said quietly examining me curiously all the while i see you are cold pray let me get you some refreshment i wanted to spit at him and say i would not drink with a man like him but the words stuck in my throat and in my weakness and confusion i stood there mute while he clapped his hands and asked the servant to bring some ale do sit sir he said after another long silence when he had again examined me carefully for i had with my normal politeness jumped up to bow to him when he entered and please be careful you do not impale yourself on your dagger all this he said with a wry smile and i blushed and stammered like a schoolchild caught throwing things in class what is your name i believe i know your face although i see so few people now that i trick myself into recognizing total strangers he had a soft gentle and educated voice quite unlike anything i had expected you do not know me my name is prestcott ah and you have come to kill me is that right it is i said stiffly feeling more and more confused there was another long pause as thurloe sat marked the page in his book closed it and laid it neatly on the table then he placed his hands in his lap and looked at me once more well go ahead i would hate to detain you unnecessarily dont you want to know why he seemed almost puzzled at the question and shook his head only if you wish to tell me as far as i am concerned compared with meeting the lord and his standing in judgment of me of what importance is the why or the wherefore of men do take some ale he added pouring out a glass from the broad earthenware pot the servant had brought i shrugged the glass aside its very important i said petulantly realizing as i spoke that i was drifting further and further away from my imagined behavior in that case i am listening he said although cannot understand what injury i may have done you you are surely too young to be my enemy you killed my father he looked worried at the statement did i i dont recall it at last he was talking in a way which angered me which i knew was necessary if i was going to accomplish my aim you damnable liar of course you do sir james prestcott my father oh he said quietly yes of course i remember him but i thought you must have meant someone elsei never harmed your father i tried to at one stage of course he was one of the handful of the kings servants who was not a fool that was why you destroyed him you couldnt catch him or do battle with him so you poisoned mens minds against him with lies and clawed him down that way you hold me responsible you were very well then if you say so he said calmly and lapsed into silence again he had wrongfooted me i dont know what i expectedeither a vehement denial or an outrageous justification of his deeds i certainly did not anticipate him not seeming to care one way or the other defend yourself i said hotly with what i do not have your knife or your strength so if you want to kill me you will not find it a difficult task i mean defend what you did why you have already decided that i am guilty so i fear that my feeble replies will not sway you thats not fair i cried realizing as i spoke that this was the sort of childish remark a man like my father would never have made few things are he said my father was no traitor i said that may be the case are you saying you didnt destroy him you expect me to believe that i havent said anything but since you ask no i did not of course i have little influence over whether you believe me later in lifetoo late to be of use to me theni understood how john thurloe had risen to such an eminence that he was the one person in the land who dared contradict cromwell you punched thurloe rose up again sweetly reasonable and softvoiced you kept on punching he kept on getting up always gentle and never losing his temper until you felt ashamed of yourself and listened to him instead then when you were off balance he simply persuaded you around to his point of view he never thrust himself forward never forced his opinions on you but sooner or later the anger and opposition exhausted themselves by dashing against his persistence you did it to others and you expect me to believe that you didnt to my father which others you didnt say he was innocent you had the chance it was not my job to ensure that my enemies were strong and unified besides who would have believed me do you think a certificate of honesty from me would have cleared his reputation if the kings party wished to tear into themselves and chase ghosts what was that to me the weaker they were the better so weak that the king is on his throne and you are here in obscurity i sneered conscious not only that his arguments were good but also that i had never even considered them before so clear and obvious had his guilt appeared to me only because the protector died and he thoughtwell no matter he said softly there was a vacuum and nature abhors a vacuum charles didnt win his throne back he was sucked back by forces far greater than he could have mustered on his own and it remains to be seen whether he is strong enough to keep his seat you must have been delighted i said with heavy sarcasm delighted he repeated thoughtfully no of course not i had worked for ten years to make england stable and free from tyranny and it was no pleasure to see that blown away on the winds but i was not as upset as you might imagine the armies were on the march and the factions only cromwell could have controlled were forming again it was the king or war i did not oppose charles and i could have done so you know had i so wished charles would have been in his grave for years by now he said it in such a calm and matteroffact way that for a moment i didnt grasp the full horror of what he was saying then i gasped this little man had gravely decided as a matter of policy whether his rightful monarch anointed by god would live or die charles by grace of thurloe king of england and i knew that he was saying nothing more than the truthi was sure that he and the protector had considered such a course if they had rejected it it was not because they recoiled from such a crimethey had committed so many alreadybut because it was not to their convenience but you didnt no the commonwealth acted within the law and suffered gravely as a result how much easier it would have been if the elder charles had succumbed to a mysterious illness and died with our hands clean in public however shamefully we had behaved in secret but we tried him and executed him murdered him you mean and executed him in full public view never once seeking to hide what we were doing the same goes with the other traitorsloyal patriots i suppose they now arewho were caught name me one who was murdered in secret without being publicly tried everyone knew there had been thousands but as they had been done away with secretly naturally i did not know their names and i told him so i see so i killed countless people but you cannot name a single one are you intended for the law mr prestcott i said that due to the family misfortunes i was indeed i wondered i was a lawyer myself you know before i took to public service i very much hope your family fortunes mend as i do not think you will be a great adornment to the profession you do not present a very good case we are not in a court of law here no he agreed you are in my parlor but if you wish you may turn it into a courtroom and you may make your first speech i will answer and you can then make up your mind come now it is a handsome offer you get to be prosecution judge jury and if you win your case executioner such an opportunity comes very infrequently to a man of your age for some reason i didnt even question him anymore it was too late now for the bold action i had originally intended i now wanted him to acknowledge i was right and hear him admit that he deserved my punishment that was why i fell in with himand why i still think that he was wrong i would have made a good lawyer even though i am profoundly grateful i was not reduced to such a state well i began the thing is no no no he interrupted me gently we are in a court sir your presentation is a disgrace never begin a speech with well the thing is do they not teach rhetoric in the university anymore now begin properly always making sure you address the judge respectfullyeven when hes an old fooland the jury as though you are sure they are a benchful of solomons even if youve spent the morning bribing them start again and dont be shy you cant be shy if you want to win my lord members of the jury i began even after all these years i am still amazed by the way i meekly did as instructed much better he said go on but try to pitch your voice a little more effectively my lord members of the jury i said heavily and with some irony for i did not wish it thought that i gave way to this playacting without some resentment you sit here to judge one of the most evil crimes in the history of mankind for the defendant before you is charged not with simple theft or the murder of a man committed in hot blood but with the cold and calculating destruction of a gentleman too good and too honorable to be harmed in any other way this gentleman sir james prestcott cannot speak to tell you of the injuries done to him his family must do that for him in the traditional manner so that his cries for justice from beyond the grave can be assuaged and his soul can sleep in peace very good said thurloe a handsome start as the judge i must request the defendant to keep his silence if this is a law court the proper forms must be maintained my apologies i do not ask you to condemn this man without laying out the full facts of the case that is all i need to do to make you to realize without a shadow of a doubt that this man is guilty i shall state the case and stopno highflown rhetorical persuasion is needed the goodness the loyalty and the courage of sir james prestcott were such that he gave everything in the kings cause and was prepared to give still more when most had given up he returned from exile to work for the blessed restoration which we now all enjoy some joined him in this struggle but few as wholeheartedly and some did so merely out of consideration for their own gain some betrayed their friends and their cause for their own advancement and whenever john thurloe came across such people he used them then protected them by ensuring the blame for the damage they caused fell on the shoulders of others his main informant and the man who should have been punished for the deeds which destroyed my father was john mordaunt i paused here to see whether revealing the depths of my knowledge so suddenly shocked him it did not rather he merely sat there entirely without movement and with no sign even of interest let me explain mordaunt was the youngest son of a noble family which was keen not to take sides in the war and instead wished to profit whoever might triumph mordaunt was supposedly inclined to the king but was too young to take an active part in the fighting and so was sent away like many others to travel abroad where he could be safe in particular he went to savoy and there he met samuel morland a man already in the service of the commonwealth mordaunt was already linked to the kings cause morland to cromwells when exactly the two of them entered into a partnership to advance themselves is uncertain but i think that in all essentials it was a done deed by the time sir samuel returned to england in mordaunt also returned and began to gain a reputation among the royalists his skill intelligence and reputation for acumen considerably aided i believe by the constant information which morland gave him but the price the royalists paid for his reputation was high indeed for mordaunt bought it by betraying every single plot the kings men developed at one stage the traitors made a bad mistake and in mordaunt was arrested in a general roundup of royalist sympathizers it is inconceivable that a man as ruthless as john thurloe would let someone so important escape had he truly been in the kings cause but was he led to the gallows like his associates was he tied to a chair and tortured to discover his valuable hidden knowledge was he at the very least kept in close custody not at all he was released within six weeks it was said because the jury was bribed by his wife it would i believe have taken a very large bribe indeed to persuade a juror to run the risk of releasing the most dangerous man in england and incurring thurloes wrath but in fact no bribe was needed the jurors were instructed how to vote and followed those instructions without payment mordaunt returned to the fray his fame for audacity and courage enhanced and his position unquestioned by this stage it was clear to the royalists that a traitor did exist and must be unmasked thurloe accordingly began to hatch a plan to deflect attention onto others and protect his source of information so he had a series of documents concocted to protect the true traitor they used a cipher my father used contained information he would have known but why pick on him rather than any of the other royalists who would have served just as well perhaps mr thurloe can be acquitted in this respect for i believe that samuel morlands greed played a part here as he profited hugely from my fathers disgrace knowing that the family of his associate john russell would reward him well if he helped them sweep aside obstacles to their plans for the fenlands so morland approached that family and told them that sir james prestcott could be removed if it was made worth his while sir john russell leaped on the information morland provided and began to disseminate it widely and his passionate advocacy deceived sir william compton into denouncing and destroying his closest friend thus the second aspect of the plan which joined the destruction of my fathers reputation to that of his estate was brought into being i do not know whether he ever imagined that so many powerful people desired indeed required his fall thurloe protecting the government mordaunt and morland whose future rested on his shouldering the blame for their deeds and the might of the russell family which gained the freedom it needed to exploit the fenlands everybody profited handsomely from the arrangement and the cost was small only the life and honor of a single man needed to be sacrificed it is impossible to counter accusations made in such a way there were no charges so how could they be refuted no evidence was produced so how could it be shown to be forged my father withdrew with a dignity that was mistaken for cowardice he fled to avoid calumny false imprisonment and even the assassins knife and this was mistaken for guilt and all along thurloe the author of his misfortunes and the one man who could have cleansed his honor said not a word who else could have conceived of such a scheme and who else had the means to put it into operation only john thurloe who knew everything saw everything and was the moving force behind all occult activities and i members of the jury am reduced to the sorry state which you behold i have no resources no connections and no influence except that of argument and my unquenching belief in the justice of my case and the goodness of this court i am sure it will be more than enough is this what i said word for word no of course it is not i am sure that my youth tripped my tongue and that the speech was not half as assured as i like to remember it my friends who read books tell me this is the way of history even great historians write down what the actors should say rather than what they did so it is with myself and if i have improved and polished over the years then i do not apologize for it i remember the occasion though as if i did speak in this way restrained but passionate zealous but controlled standing before him fixed upon his countenance strangely concerned to convince him that what i said was true but realizing that i was as concerned to convince myself he did not reply at once that i remember clearly rather he continued to sit impassively his book folded on his lap nodding quietly after a short while when there was no sound but the crackling and hissing of the logs in the grate he began to reply still maintaining the fiction of the drama i will not condescend to my learned prosecutor by complimenting him on a fine speech sincerely delivered as only a son could manage the honesty of the words i do not doubt the courage and zeal for justice is also beyond question and it is honorable in one so young to take such a weighty task on his shoulders unsupported but this is a court of law and cannot admit of sentiment so i must point out that the case for my guilt is thin and the proof offered is insubstantial the word of a father carries weight with a son but not with a court if you are to translate your own convictions into accepted fact you must rest your case on much more than the protestations of a man under accusation that i destroyed an innocent is a grave charge and cannot be allowed to stand by mere assertion sir james prestcott was accused of treachery and he was destroyedi admit i am the obvious person to suspect for long years i was responsible for the safety of the government and i do not deny that the methods i used were many and various this was necessary for there were indeed plots against us so numerous that i can no longer recall them all time and again agitators tried to return the country to the horrors of war and civil strife it was my job to prevent this and performed the task to the best of my abilities was there an informer a traitor in the ranks of the kings men of course not one but very many there are always people willing to sell their friends for money but often i did not need the wares they tried to peddle the royalists were always the most foolish of conspirators the proposed risings involved so many people with loose tongues that we would have been deaf indeed not to have heard of them the satanic skill attributed to me was flattering but wrongfor the most part my success was due solely to the stupidity of those who pitted themselves against me as for samuel morland he was not without ability but his greed and faithlessness made him less than useful and i had long wanted to dismiss him from my office i could not do so because he held in his hands our most useful informer on the doings of the kings men whom he called mr barrett of all the governments sources of information this mr barrett was by far the best we merely had to ask and mr barrett provided the answer through samuel and samuel refused to say who this man was if i disposed of samuels services i also lost mr barrett and samuel was clever enough to realize this was the only reason i tolerated his presence i often wondered whether he was passing information as well as receiving it and took care that he knew as little as possible about our offices operations as long as this trade did not become too disadvantageous i did not discourage it who was mr barrett you are quite right i also concluded it was john mordaunt and had him arrested so i could interview him personally and try to establish a direct connection that would eliminate the need for samuel but mordaunt denied everything either he suspected a trap or he was indeed innocent or his loyalty to samuel was too great either way i got nothing from him it was a mistake on my part for my action made clear my enmity to samuel and when his opportunity came he conspired against me and caused my temporary ejection from office when i recovered my position he then went over to the kings party for fear of my revenge and denounced your father to win acceptance so you see i do not wish here to dispute your case that the traitor was john mordaunt and that your father was sacrificed to protect him although i would dispute some details if there was leisure to do so i dispute one assertion only however and do so because your case against me rests entirely on it and i can prove it wrong you say i caused your fathers disgrace that i organized the forgeries and their dissemination and i say plainly that not only did i not do so i could not have done so for when this happened i no longer had any place or influence in the government i was dismissed from the republics service late in when richard cromwell decided he could no longer survive as protector and gave up the struggle a pity he was not without ability i fell from power with him and was without influence for many months it was in this period that the material relating to your father was created and it was passed to sir john russell and thence to sir william compton this is a matter of simple fact i said there was a grave flaw in your reasoning and this is that flaw however true your general case might be i cannot have been responsible for it such a simple mistake i made and it hit me as a hammer blow with all my earnest inquisition i had never stopped for a single moment to consider the chaos that attended the dying days of the commonwealth the incessant struggling for position and treachery amongst old partners as they strove to save themselves and their corrupt edifice from destruction cromwell died his son took over fell from power and was replaced by cabals of fanatics in parliament and in all this thurloe lost his grip for a while i knew that and had not considered it important had not checked the facts and the dates and from the moment i had started talking thurloe had sat there calmly waiting for all my eloquence to end knowing that with a simple puff he could blow over my entire case against him you are telling me that morland alone brought about the destruction of my father that would be one interpretation thurloe said gravely indeed from the evidence you have presented it would be the obvious one what am i to do i thought you had come here to kill me not to ask my advice he knew he had escaped in effect he had told me that on two occasions when i had seen mordaunt and later morland i had had the guilty ones in my grasp one i had left with my thanks and best wishes the other i had considered a mere instrument a greedy little wretch perhaps but essentially a source of information and nothing more i felt a fool and was ashamed that this man should see my stupidity and lay it out so calmly it is time to draw this to an end thurloe resumed do you find me guilty or not i have said you have the decision i will abide by your verdict i shook my head tears of frustration and shame welling up in my eyes not good enough sir he pressed you must pronounce not guilty i mumbled pardon i am afraid i did not hear not guilty i shouted at him not guilty not guilty not guilty do you hear now perfectly thank you now as you have shown your devotion to justiceand i appreciate how much it has cost youi will show mine if you want my advice i will give it tell me everything you have done read said thought and seen then i will see if there is any way i can help you he clapped his hands again and again the servant appeared this time to be asked for some food and more fuel for the fire and then i began to talk and explain starting at the very beginning and leaving out only the help and assistance given to me by lord bristol i had promised to say nothing and did not wish to anger a future patron by going back on my word i even told him of my enchantment by sarah blundy and my determination to bring our contest to an end once and for all but this topic i dropped it was none of his business and i could see from his face that he did not believe in such matters you have a gift to offer in your ability to accuse mordaunt for many people dislike him and he is closely associated with lord clarendon you must sell your goods to the right people and you will get a high price to whom sir william compton i imagine will be understandably anxious to prosecute you for your attack as he also detests lord clarendon he might consider it worthwhile waiving his suit if you contributed to the downfall of his greater enemy and if clarendons friend mordaunt is weakened then clarendon will be gravely weakened more people than sir william compton would thank you generously for that you must approach them and see what they offer in return that is all very well i said scarcely daring to hope for so much after so many frustrations but i am a fugitive i cannot go to london nor even to oxford without being arrested how can i approach anyone the majesty of the kings justice however he shrugged off people like thurloe i was learning did not consider the law a matter of great importance if his enemies wished to destroy him innocence at law would not save his life if he had sufficient strength no amount of guilt would bring him into danger the law was an instrument of power no more and he offered me a dangerous bargain a terrible choice i wanted justice but thurloe told me there was no such thing that all motion was the conflict of power if i wanted to reestablish myself i had to drag down the enemies of others in the same way they had dragged down my father i could achieve my aim but only by abandoning the purpose of it it took many days of thought and prayer before i accepted when i had done so thurloe made the journey into oxford during which he discussed the matter with dr wallis after their encounter at the play although i had strong misgivings he told me that wallis was by far the easiest way of communicating with those men in government who might assist despite the way i had abused him in the jail thurloe did not seem to think it would be hard to win walliss cooperation although he never troubled to explain to me why this should be so well i asked eagerly when at last i was summoned on thurloes return will wallis help thurloe smiled perhaps if there is an exchange of information you mentioned an italian gentleman at sir william comptons da cola yes a most civil man for a foreigner yes cola dr wallis is most interested in your opinion of him i know that he has asked me before although i have no idea why he was so fascinated that need not concern you in the slightest will you say on oath what you know of this man and answer any other questions he might pose freely and frankly if he will help me then of course i will it is harmless enough what do i get in return dr wallis is able i understand to give you crucial information about the package your father had intended to send to your mother that package contained everything he knew of mordaunt and his activities whom he saw what he said and all the consequences with that in your possession your case will be easily won he knew this all along and did not say so he does not have it himself and he is a dark and deep man he never gives something for nothing fortunately you now have something to offer but he can tell you whom you must approach to obtain it now do you agree to this bargain yes i said enthusiastically of course with all my heart particularly if he only wants information in return for a prize like that he could have my life and willingly too good thurloe said smiling with pleasure that is settled now we have to remove the threat of the law and renew your freedom of movement i mentioned your concern about this woman sarah blundy and of the ring that you have from dr groves body the woman has now been placed under arrest for his murder i am glad to hear it i said more exultation gripping my heart i have told you how i know she killed him you will testify against her your sense of justice will be noted and the charges against you dropped do you give me your word that this girl actually killed grove i do it was a lie i know and even as i spoke i resented bitterly the need to speak it in that case all will be well but only i repeat if you answer all questions dr wallis poses my heart was close to bursting with delight as i contemplated how i was triumphing in every single sphere truly i thought i was blessed that so much should be given to me so swiftly i was all enthusiasm for a moment but then my spirit deflated it is a trap i said wallis will not help me it is just a lure to get me to go back to oxford i will be thrown back into jail and hanged that is a risk but wallis is after bigger game than yourself i think i snorted it was easy i thought to be calm and detached at the thought of someones elses neck being stretched i would have liked to see how he contemplated a march to the hanging tree himself the next move came a few days later i had reluctantly come to accept that i would have to take the risk and place myself in walliss hands but my courage had failed me and i was in this state of indecision when thurloe came softly into the room where i was spending my time and announced that i had a visitor a signor marco da cola he said with a faint smile it is strange how that man shows up in the most unexpected places he is here i said standing up with astonishment why because i invited him he is staying nearby and when i was told i thought i really must meet the gentleman he is most charming i insisted on seeing cola for i wanted to hear everything it was thurloe who suggested that he might prove ideal as the intermediary for approaching the magistrate in oxford for i think even he did not trust wallis as much as he said i do not need to justify i hope what i told him i have given enough evidence to show how i had to escape the curse upon me and how limited my resources were i had begged for release from sarah blundys curse but had been rebuffed she had tricked me into attacking my own guardian the efforts of magicians priests and wise men to repulse her had all failed andthough i have not mentioned it in my story as much as i could have donealmost daily i was assaulted by strange happenings and my nights were a torment of fervid visitations so that i had no peaceful sleep she attacked me mercilessly perhaps with the hope that i would be sent insane i now had the possibility of striking back once and for all i could not possibly afford to let that chance slip through my fingers and i also had my loyalty to thomas so i told cola that i had visited her cottage on my escape and had seen her as she came in wild and excited i told him that i had found groves ring in her dress and how i had instantly recognized it and taken it from her how she had turned pale when i demanded how she had come by it and how i would testify to all of this at her trial i almost believed it myself by the time i had finished cola agreed to relay this to the magistrate and even reassured me by saying he was sure that my willingness to come forward in the name of justice even though i was placing myself at risk would stand me in good stead for the future i thanked him and indeed felt so warmly toward him that i could not forbear from giving him some information of my own tell me i said why is it that dr wallis concerns himself with you are you friends no indeed he said i have only met him once and he was very uncivil he wishes to talk to me about you i do not know why cola repeated he had no understanding of it then brushed the matter aside and asked me when i proposed to come to oxford i think it would be best to wait until just before the trial i hope the magistrate will grant me bail but i am in a mood not to be overtrusting so you will see dr wallis then almost certainly good i would like to offer you hospitality afterward to celebrate your good fortune and he went i mention it only to demonstrate that there was much which cola does not include even when he gives an account of conversations much of the rest of what he says is more or less correct however the magistrate arrived in high dudgeon and was all for arresting both thurloe and myself until he heard of my evidence against blundy then he was all sweetness and accommodationalthough i suspect dr wallis may have already intervened and told him of the probability that sir william would withdraw his suit as indeed he did a few days later then i waited until word came that the trial was to begin and journeyed back into oxford i did not have to give evidence as it turned out as the woman confessed to the crimea surprising thing for as i say on this she was innocent but the evidence against her was strong and perhaps she realized that it was all over i did not care i was merely glad that she was to die and that i did not have to perjure myself she hanged the next day and instantly i felt her malign presence lifting from my spirit like the first breath of cool clear wind after a thunderstorm has removed the oppression from the air it was only then that i realized how much she had tormented me and how constant had been the drain on my soul in effect there ends my story as well for the rest is outside the scope of colas account and much of my own triumph is already well enough known i never saw cola again for he left oxford shortly afterward but wallis was highly satisfied with what i told him and gave me all the information i required within a month my name was restored and although it was considered impolitic to proceed directly against mordaunt his rise was forever blocked the man who at one stage was going to be the most powerful politician in the country ended his days in grubby obscurity shunned by his old friends enough of whom knew the truth about him the favor of many men in high places in contrast won me the rewards my birth and position merited and i exploited my good fortune so successfully i was soon able to begin rebuilding my estates and in the fullness of time i built my mansion just outside london where my detested uncle comes to pay court to me in the futile hope that i will pass some goodness on to him needless to say he goes away emptyhanded i have done much in my life which i regret and if i had the opportunity there is much i would now do differently but my task was all important and i feel reassured that i am acquitted of any serious offense the lord has been good and though no man deserves it my salvation has been no injustice i would not have so much and such a tranquillity of mind had i not been blessed by his merciful providence in him i place all my trust and have endeavored only to serve as best i can my vindication is my assurance of his favor the character of compliance the idols of the theatre have got into the human mind from the different tenets of philosophers and the perverted laws of demonstration all philosophies hitherto have been so many stage plays having shewn nothing but fictitious and theatrical worlds francis bacon novum organum scientarum section ii aphorism vii having been sent the collected notes of the papist marco da cola i feel it necessary to comment lest others also come across his outrageous scribblings and believe what he says so let me state it plainly that this cola is a pernicious deceitful and arrogant liar the wideeyed naïveté the youthful enthusiasm the openness he presents in his narration are nothing but the most monstrous of frauds satan is a master of deception who has taught his servants his tricks ye are of your father the devilfor he is a liar and the father of it john i intend to expose the full extent of the duplicity he reveals in this memoir of his this true account as he has it of a voyage to england this cola was the worst of men the most savage of murderers and the greatest of deceivers it was only by the grace of providence that i escaped that night when he tried to poison me and it was the greatest misfortune that grove took the bottle for himself and died in my place i had half expected some attempt once he arrived in oxford but had thought more in terms of a knife in the backi never conceived of such a cowardly assault and was not prepared for it as for the girl sarah blundy i would have spared her had that been possible but could not do so an innocent died one more of colas many victims but many more would have done so had i not kept my counsel it was a hard decision to take but still i try to acquit myself of wrong the danger was great and my own sufferings were hardly less i say this calmly and with consideration but it has cost me much to do so for the arrival of the manuscript came as the greatest shock lower indeed had not intended to send it to me even though he sent one to that man prestcott it was only when i heard of its existence that i demanded to see it and made it clear i would brook no refusal my intention was to expose the manuscript as a piece of imposition as i could not believe it genuine but now i have read it i know my initial assumption was wrong contrary to my belief and the assurances of those i had reason to trust it is clear that marco da cola really is still alive i do not know how this can be and i most certainly wish it were not so since i did my best to ensure his death and was certain i had succeeded i was told that he had been taken to the edge of the boat and there pushed into the north sea that his deeds might be punished and his lips forever sealed the captain himself told me the boat had hove to for many minutes until the man sank beneath the waves the knowledge had given me some solace over the years and it is cruel to have that consolation so rudely ripped away for that manuscript shows plain that those i trusted lied to me and my triumph ended in fraud i do not know why but it is now too late to discover the truth too many of those who might know the answer have died and i now serve new masters i feel i should explain myself i do not say you note justify myself as i believe that throughout my career i have been consistent i know that my enemies do not accept this and i suppose that the reasonableness of my actions in the course of my public career if such you can call it has not been absolutely clear to uninformed minds how is it they say that a man can be anglican presbyterian loyal to the martyr charles then become chief cryptographer to oliver cromwell deciphering the most secret letters of the king to aid the parliamentary cause then return to the established church and finally use his skills to defend the monarchy once more when it was restored is that not hypocrisy is that not selfserving so say the ignorant to which i reply no it is not and anyone who may sneer at my actions knows very little about the difficulties of rebalancing the humors of a polity once it has become subject to disease some say that i changed sides from day to day and always for my own advantage but do you really believe that i needed to settle merely for the professorship of geometry at the university of oxford had i been truly ambitious i would have aimed at a bishopric at the very least and do not imagine i could not have had itit was not my aim i have not been governed by selfish ambition and have studied more to be serviceable than great i endeavored at all times to act by moderate principles in compliance with the powers in being since my earliest days when i discovered the secret patterns of mathematics and dedicated myself to their exploration i have had a passion for order for in order lies the fulfillment of gods plan for us all the joy of a mathematical problem solved with elegance and the pain of seeing the natural harmony of man disrupted are two sides of the same coin in both cases i believe i allied myself to the cause of righteousness nor did i desire fame and reputation for myself as a reward indeed i shunned these as vanity and was content for others to take the great positions of church and state knowing rather that my secret influence was of far greater weight than theirs let others talk it was my task to act and i did so to the best of my ability i served cromwell because his iron fist could bring order to the land and stop the bickering of faction when no one else could and i served the king when that godordained role passed to him on cromwells death and i served each well not for their sake certainly but because by doing so i served my god as i have tried to do in all things my desire for myself was merely to be left in peace to approach the divine through the mysteries of mathematics but as i am a servant of god and of the realm as i am of philosophy i have frequently been constrained to put such selfishness aside now there is another who will surpass me as david surpassed saul or as alexander surpassed philip i can do so easilythen it was a real hardship mr newton says he sees so far because he stands on the shoulders of giants i hope it will not seem vanitous if i say that my shoulders are among the strongest to support his glory and i am ever mindful though too modest to repeat in public of that saying of didacus stella a dwarf standing on the shoulders of a giant may see farther than a giant himself more than this i could have seen farther myself and taken some of his great fame had my duty not called me to other things so insistently now that it is so many years ago many people assume that the restoration of the kingdom was a simple matter cromwell died and in due course the king returned would that it had been that straightforwardthe secret history of that momentous event is known only to a few at the beginning i thought that at best the king might last six months a year if he was lucky before the passion of faction erupted once more it seemed to me that he would have to fight for his inheritance sooner or later the country had been in turmoil for near twenty years there had been war and strife property had been trampled on the rightful rulers of the country killed and expelled all stations of men upturned i have seen the wicked in great power and spreading himself like a green bay tree psalms were people who had become used to authority and riches simply going to renounce these baubles was it really to be expected that the army unpaid and discarded would quietly accept the kings return and the defeat of everything they had striven to establish and could it be hoped that the kings supporters would remain united when the opportunities for dissent presented to them were so great only men without power do not desire it those who have felt its touch crave ever more of its embrace england was a country on the edge surrounded by enemies within and withoutthe least spark could have rekindled the flames and in this powder keg the most powerful men in the kingdom were engaged in a struggle for the kings favor which only one person could win clarendon bristol bennet the duke of buckingham lords cavendish coventry ormonde southamptonthere was not room for all in his majestys favor and only one person could run his government for him for none would tolerate partners the battle was fought in the dark but its consequences sucked many men in i was one and took upon myself the task of damping the flames before all was consumed i flatter myself that i succeeded well despite the efforts of marco da cola he says at the start of his manuscript that he will leave out much but nothing of significance that is his first great lie he puts in nothing which is of significance i will have to do that to expose his perfidy my involvement in the matter which this cola tries to hide began near two years before he arrived on these shores when i traveled to london to attend a meeting of likeminded natural philosophers at gresham college this organization which later became our royal society is not now what it was despite the presence of luminaries like mr newton then it was a ferment of knowledge and only someone who attended could know what a buzz of excitement and endeavor attended those early meetings that spirit has gone now and i fear it will never return who now can match that bandwren hooke boyle ward wilkins petty goddard and so many more names which will live forever now its members are like a bunch of ants forever collecting thek tawdry rocks and bugs always accumulating never thinking and turning away from god no wonder they come to be despised but then all was joyful optimism the king was back on his throne the country was peaceful once more and the whole world of experimental philosophy was there to be explored we felt i think like cabots crew when they first caught sight of the new world and the excitement of anticipation was intoxicating the meeting itself was very fine as befitted the occasion the king himself attended and graciously presented a mace to signify his royal condescension in supporting our endeavors and many of his most powerful ministers came toosome of whom were subsequently elected to our ranks when the royal society was officially formed although it must be said they contributed little but luster afterward once his majesty had made a pretty speech and we were all given the opportunity of bowing personally to him and mr hooke had demonstrated one of his more ingenious and showy machines to entrap the royal imagination i was approached by a man of middling stature with quick dark eyes and a supercilious manner he wore an oblong black patch over the bridge of his nose which covered so they say a sword wound received when he was fighting for the late king personally i am not so sure no one ever saw this famed injury and that patch drew attention to his loyalty more than it covered a wound then he was known as henry bennet although the world later knew him as the earl of arlington and he had just returned from the embassy of madrid though this was not yet common knowledge i had heard vague reports that he was charging himself with maintaining the stability of the kingdom and i was swiftly to receive full confirmation that this was indeed the case in brief he asked me to attend on him the following morning at his house on the strand as he wished to make my acquaintance the next day accordingly i presented myself half expecting to be hurled into the midst of a formal levee surrounded by petitioners and claimants all wanting the attention of a man close to the court there were indeed a few people there but not many and they were ignored i concluded from this that mr bennets star had not yet risen too far or for reasons of his own he was keeping his connections and even his presence in london fairly quiet i cannot say that he was pleasant indeed he had a formality of manner which verged on the grotesque so keen was he to observe all the niceties of protocol and maintain rankings in a clear form it came i believe from spending too long in spain which is notoriously prone to such excesses he took the trouble to explain to me that he had provided a chair with a padded seat as befitted my dignity as a doctor of the university others it seemed had to make do with a hard seat or remain standing depending on their station it would have been unwise of me to hint that i considered such punctiliousness absurdi did not know what he wanted and the government was about to send a visitation to the university to eject members inserted by the commonwealth as i had been so inserted mr bennet was not a man to annoy i wanted to keep my position how do you consider the state of his majestys kingdom he said abruptly not being a man to waste too much time putting his guests at ease or winning their confidence it is a trick often played by men in power i find i replied that all his majestys subjects were naturally delighted at his safe return to his rightful throne bennet snorted so how do you account for the fact that we have just had to hang another half dozen fanatics for plotting against the government this is an evil generation i said luke he tossed a sheaf of papers over to me what do you think of those i looked at them carefully then sniffed dismissivelyletters in cipher ï said can you read them not at the moment no could you read them tease out their meanings unless there is some particular difficulty yes i have had some considerable experience in such matters i know that for mr thurloe was it not i provided no information which might have injured the kings party even though it was in my power to do it considerable harm are you now prepared to do it any good of course i am his majestys loyal servant i trust you remember that i took great risks with my fortune in protesting against the murder of the late king you satisfied your conscience in the matter but not to the point of leaving office or turning down preferment when it was offered i recall he replied coldly and in a manner which gave me little optimism about winning his favor no matter you will be pleased at the opportunity of demonstrating how great your loyalties are bring me those letters deciphered tomorrow morning and so i was dismissed not knowing whether to bless my luck or curse my misfortune i went back to the inn where i habitually stayed in londonthis was before i acquired my house in bow street on the death of my wifes fatherand settled down to work it took all day and most of the night to get the letters done the art of decipherment is a complicated one and was getting more so frequently it is simply a matter of figuring out how one letter or group of letters was replaced by anotheryou work out by substitution that for example a stands for the stands for king dl fd hon gi vs cn and it is simple enough to decide that agvgcdhfh means that the king is in london you will note that while the method much favored by the royalists in the war as they were im afraid to say rather straightforward souls of substituting one letter for another is simple the method of making a letter occasionally substitute for a letter and occasionally for a syllable or a word is more difficult nonetheless it still presents few problems what is more difficult is when the value attached to the letters constantly changesa method first proposed in england by lord bacon but i understand in fact invented by a florentine over a hundred years ago and now claimed by the french an insolent nation which cannot abide that anything should not come from their land they steal that which is not theirs i suffered myself when a wretched little clerk called fermat dared to say my work on indivisibles was his own i will try to explain the essence of this method is that both sender and recipient must have the same text the message begins with a group of numbers which reads say meaning that the key begins on page word five of this text let us suppose that this page beginsso hatach went forth to mordecai unto the street of the city which was before the kings gate esther a puzzling text on which i have given an elucidatory sermon shortly to be published the fifth word to is your starting point and you substitute t for a thus getting an alphabet abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz tuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrs so that your message the king is in london now reads maxdbgzblbgehgwhg the important thing is that after a given number of letters normally twentyfive you move to the next word in this case mordecai and start again so that ma nb and so on variations on this method exist of course but the point is to ensure that the value of letters changes sufficiently frequently for it to be all but impossible to make the code out unless you have the text on which it is based i will explain why this was important later on i was worried that the scripts given me might be of this type i could possibly have deciphered them eventually but not in the time allowed if i am vain about my abilities it is with some justice only one text has ever defeated me and that was in specialthough importantcircumstances which i will deal with later but every time i am handed a coded letter i know that bitter experience of failure might be mine once more for i am not infallible and the possible variant combinations are virtually infinite i myself have constructed codes which are unreadable without the right texts for decipherment so it was perfectly possible that others could do so as well indeed i am surprised that i have not been defeated more often as it is easier to construct an impregnable code than it is to breach its walls fortunately in the case of mr bonnets letters i was again luckythe authors were as simpleminded in their approach as were the royalist conspirators in their day few people i find are prepared to learn from experience each epistle had a different code but they were simple ones and each was long enough to allow me to fix the meanings at seven the next morning accordingly i presented myself once more to mr bennet and handed over my labors he took them and glanced over the fair copy i had prepared would you summarize them for me doctor they appear to be a group of letters to one individual probably in london i said all specifying a date january twelfth there are references in two of them to weapons but not in the others one mentions the kingdom of god which i imagine rules out papists and indicates that the authors are fifth monarchists or groups associated with them internal evidence suggests two of the letters come from abingdon which also indicates a seditious origin to the letters he nodded and your conclusions that the matter should be looked into is that all that seems very casual the letters themselves prove nothing had i written them and been arrested my defense would be that they were all to do with my cousins wedding mr bennet snorted far be it from me to give you advice sir but precipitate haste might be troublesome i assume that you obtained these letters by occult means we have an informant that is correct so if you swoop your informant will be of no further use to you as it will be obvious you knew where to look look sir it is more than likely that these letters indicate that a rising of some sort will happen and that it will be in several parts of the country led from the capital that is what concerns me he said use your informant to find out where the provincial risings are to be and on january eleventh move troops there i take it the king does have troops he can count on no more than a few thousand can be trusted absolutely use them as for london sit back and watch find out who is involved and how many and have troops ready make sure the court is guarded then let the rising happen cut off from any support it will be easy to put down and you will have solid evidence of treason you may then act as you please and collect such praise as will be your due for your prompt action bennet leaned back in his seat and watched me coldly my aim is to guard the king not to gather praise of course for a cleric you seem to have a remarkable grasp of these matters it may be that you were in deeper with mr thurloe than i suspected i shrugged you asked my advice and i gave it you do not have to take it he had not dismissed me so i sat there while he stared out of the window before pretending to notice me again go away sir he said tartly leave me in peace i did as ordered and left thinking that i had not succeeded in disarming a man who could do me very considerable harm and that my tenure at the university would be shortlived i resigned myself to this as best i could i was wealthy enough through my mothers side and had no fear of starvation or penury but nonetheless i liked my position and the stipend it brought and had no desire to relinquish it i had played my cards as well as i could the great virtue of deciphering letters is that it is profoundly difficult for anyone else to say whether you have done it correctly in this case the interpretation allied to a certain knowledge of my own enabled me to demonstrate my potential usefulness at no great cost for the letters clearly indicated that the uprising which so exercised mr bennet was in fact going to be little more than the screaming and yelling of a few dozen fanatics and could in no way threaten the king this band might believe that with gods help they could take london the country and perhaps even the entire world i saw fairly clearly that their socalled rising would be farcical but with a little prodding from bennet as i later learned the government took it seriously and began having nightmares about the bitter and unpaid remnants of cromwells army rising all over the country in late january such is the length of time it takes to get information from london to oxford in winter news began to come through that thomas venners band of fifth monarchist maniacs had fallen into the trap so skillfully set for them and been arrested after creating a stir that had lasted for all of five hours more a sudden decision had led the government to station a squadron of cavalry at abingdon and in half a dozen other places a few days before and to this wise move was attributed the fact that the old soldiers there had remained quiescent in my opinion they had never considered doing anything at all but no matter the effect was made five days after i heard of all this i received a letter summoning me to london i went there the following week and was instructed to visit mr bennet who had now been permitted to move into accommodations in whitehall where he was so much closer to the kings ear i imagine you have heard of the monstrous treason which the government successfully repressed last month he said i nodded the court was mightily alarmed he went on and it has shaken the confidence of many including his majesty who can no longer hold on to the illusion that he is universally beloved i am distressed to hear that i am not there is treason everywhere in this country and it is my job to stamp it out at least now there is a chance that someone might listen to me when i give warnings i sat silently when we met last you gave me certain advice his majesty was impressed by the speed with which the rising was put down and i was pleased to have talked over my policy with you which roughly translated meant that he had taken all the credit and that i should bear in mind that he was my sole conduit to royal favor it was kind of him to spell it out so clearly i nodded i am glad to be of service to you and his majesty i said here he said and handed me a piece of paper it contained a document confirming the kings trusty and wellbeloved servant john wallis in his post as professor of geometry at the university of oxford and another appointing the same trusty and wellbeloved john wallis as royal chaplain to the king at a salary of two hundred pounds a year i am deeply grateful and trust i will be able to repay such favor i said bennet smiled a thin and unpleasant smile that you will doctor and please do not think we expect you to deliver many sermons we have decided to take no action against the radical rump at abingdon or at burford or northampton it is our wish that they should be left at liberty we know where they are and a bird in the hand just so i said but that is of little purpose unless you are constantly informed of what they are doing precisely i am convinced they will try again such is the nature of these people they cannot stop for to stop would be to commit sin they regard it as their duty to continue agitation some as their right sir i murmured i do not wish to engage in dispute rights and duties it is all treason wherever it comes from do you agree or not i believe the king has a right to his place and it is our duty to keep him there so will you see to it i you you do not fool me sir that air of the philosopher does not deceive i know exactly what tasks you performed for thurloe im sure you have heard an exaggerated report i said i acted as cryptographer not as an intelligencer but that is of no matter if you want me to see to it as you put it i am content to serve you but i will need money you will have what you require within reason of course and i beg to remind you that communication with london is not so very rapid you will have a warrant giving you leave to act as you see fit and does that include use of the garrisons nearby he frowned then said very reluctantly in an emergency if need be and how will i stand with the lords lieutenant of the counties you will not stand with them at all you will communicate only with me no one else not even in the government is that understood i nodded very well bennet smiled again and stood up good i am very pleased sir that you agree to serve your sovereign in this fashion the kingdom is far from secure and all honest men must labor to prevent the spite of dissent from emerging once more i tell you doctor i do not know whether we will succeed at the moment our enemies are dispirited and fragmented but if we ever loosen our grip who knows what might happen for once i could agree with him wholeheartedly i will not have it thought that i entered into my role with enthusiasm or without thought i was not going to tie my fortunes to a man who might drag me down with him should he prove to have only an unsteady purchase on power and position i knew little enough about this mr bennet and so the moment i had registered my appointment as royal chaplain with the appropriate offices and dispatched the confirmation of my university position back to oxford to confound my enemies there i set myself to find out a little more about him he certainly had given ample evidence of his loyalty to the king as he had shared exile with him and been entrusted with diplomatic missions of some importance more to the point he was a skillful courtiertoo skillful indeed for lord clarendon the kings first minister had spotted his abilities and rather than enlisting his support had instantly seen him as a threat the enmity grew and bennet grew close to other of clarendons rivals while he waited his chance he also attracted a circle of young men all of whom went around praising each others brilliance he was spoken of as a man who would rise to the very topand nothing ensures success at court as an expectation that success will be forthcoming to sum up he had supporters below him and supporters above him but as long as clarendon enjoyed the kings favor mr bennet would rise but slowly it was uncertain how long his patience would last until it was clear whether he would continue to rise or fall in the attempt i had as much interest as mr bennet in making sure my connection to him remained unknown besides he concerned me in other respects as wellhis love of spain was well known and the idea of helping a man with such sympathies distressed me somewhat on the other hand i desired to be of service and bennet was the only conduit by which my skills and abilities could be put to use nor did i consider the maneuverings of the great to be my affair who reigned supreme at court who had the ear of the king made little immediate difference the kingdoms safety strange days that we lived in depended far more on the activities of those lower folk who were to win my attentions i have mentioned the discontented radicals soldiers and sectaries who formed such a large well of opposition to the government from the moment the king returned there was constant turmoil from these people who were never as meekly accepting of the manifest will of god as their professions suggested they should be venners rising was a mere squib of no great import badly organized funded and led but there was no reason to think it would be the last and constant vigilance was of the utmost importance the enemies of the kingdom had men of discipline and ability in their ranksanyone who had witnessed as i had the triumphs of cromwells armies knew that moreover they were fanatics ready to die for their delusions they had tasted power and in their mouths it was as sweet as honey revelation even more dangerous was the fact that outsiders were ready to manipulate them and urge them on my dealings with cola which i intend to narrate here were more dangerous and more hidden still a trust in god is very fine but god also expects you to look to yourself my greatest concern was that those in power would become complacent and underestimate their enemies although i cannot say i liked bennet we agreed that there was a real danger which needed to be confronted and so i returned to oxford resumed my mathematical enquiry and began weaving a web in which to catch the kings enemies mr bennets perspicacity in choosing me was considerablenot only had i some small skill in the matter already i sat in the middle of the kingdom and of course had a network of contacts throughout europe which could readily be exploited the republic of learning knows no boundaries and few things were more natural than to write to colleagues in all countries to seek their views on mathematics philosophyand anything else piece by piece and at very moderate expense i began to have a better picture than anyone of what was going on i did not of course rise to the level of mr thurloe but although never entirely trusted by my masters i pursued their enemies and largely succeeded in heaping mischief upon them and spending mine arrows among them deuteronomy i first heard of marco da cola gentleman socalled of venice in a letter from a correspondent in the low countries to whom the government paid a moderate competence to observe the activities of english radicals in exile particularly this fellow was requested to watch keenly for the slightest contact between them and anybody close to the dutch government and to note any absences or unusual visitors this man wrote to me in the october of more to justify his gold than for any other reason i suspect and said nothing at all except that a venetian one cola had arrived in leiden and had spent some time in the exiles company that was all certainly there was no reason at that time to imagine that this man was anything other than a wandering student i gave the matter little attention beyond writing to a merchant then traveling to italy to acquire paintings for englishmen with more money than sense asking him to identify this man i might mention in passing that picture dealers now more common since it became legal to bring such works into the country make excellent investigators as they come and go as they please without causing suspicion their trade brings them into contact with men of influence but they are so lowly and absurd in their pretensions to gentility and education that few ever take them seriously i received no reply until the beginning of my correspondents laxity and the winter posts both conspiring to cause delay even then his response produced little of interest and lest anybody think i was careless i append here mr jacksons letter reverend and learned sir in response to your request while in venice to acquire works of beauty for my lord sunderland and others i had leisure to put in hand those enquiries which you requested this cola is it seems the son of a merchant who studied at the university of padua for several years he is near thirty years of age of middling height and wellbuilt i have found out little about him for he left the veneto so long ago several thought him dead he is however reputed to be an excellent shot and fine swordsman reports have it that the fathers agent in london giovanni di pietro acts as observer on english affairs for the venetian ambassador in paris while his elder son andrea is a priest and confessor to cardinal flavio chigi nephew to pope alexandershould you wish me to enquire further i would be more than happy the letter then concluded with hopeful remarks saying that if i wanted to acquire any paintings thomas jackson esquire not that he had any right to call himself such being a mere painter would be most grateful for the privilege of obliging when i received this letter i naturally wrote to mr bennet about this man giovanni di pietroif the venetians did have a correspondent in london i felt the government should know who he was somewhat to my surprise i received a curt note backthis di pietro was already known to them was of no danger to the government and mr bennet was sure i had much more profitable areas of enquiry he reminded me that my task was the repression of sectaries other questions were none of my concern i was too occupied to be other than thankful for this as there were definite signs that the sectaries were indeed rumbling again and i had more than enough to keep me busy reports reached me of consignments of arms flitting about the country of little conventicles of radicals meeting then dispersing most dangerous of all a solid report came that edmund ludlow the most dangerous and able of the old generals still at liberty had been receiving an unusually large number of visitors in his exile in switzerland the beast was stirring but still it was like trying to measure the waters in the hollow of your hand isaiah in several parts of the country i knew that trouble was brewingi did not know why or who was behind it all it should not be thought that my activities took place only in oxfordi was naturally bound to be there during some of the term but much of the year i was at liberty and spent a good part of my time in london for not only did this give me access to the secretary of state mr bennet received his reward that november much of learned society was migrating there as well and i naturally wished to spend time in their company the great venture of the royal society was under way and it was vital that it was constructed along good lines only admitting proper people and keeping out those who wished to pervert it to ungodly endspapists at one extreme atheists at the other shortly after a meeting of the society matthew my servant though far more than that came to me i will dwell much on this young man in my narrative for he was as dear to me as a son dearer in fact when i consider my own sons doltish buffoons with whom no man of sense can converse i despair of my misfortune a foolish son is the calamity of his father proverbs how much have i meditated on the truth of this saying for i have two such fools i tried once to teach the elder the secrets of decipherment but might as well have attempted to instruct a baboon in the theories of mr newton they were left to my wife when young since i was too busy on government business and in the university to attend to them and she brought them up in her image she is a good woman everything a wife should be and brought me an estate yet i wish i had never been constrained to marry the services a woman provides in no manner compensate for the inadequacy of her company and the liberties she curtails i have been greatly occupied at times of my life with the problems of educating the young i have worked on the most unpromising material persuading the dumb to speak and trying from that to arrive at general principles about the malleability of the infant mind i would have young boys entirely removed from the company of women especially that of their mothers from about the age of six so that their minds might be occupied with lofty conversation and noble ideas their reading their education and even their play should be directed by a man of senseand by that i do not mean those wretches who habitually pass themselves off as schoolteachersso that they might be excited to emulate what is great and shun what is ignoble had a boy such as matthew come into my company but a few years earlier then i believe i could have made a great man of him the moment i saw him i was struck with an inexpressible regret for in his carriage and in his eyes i saw the son and companion i had prayed god to give me scarcely educated and even less well trained he was more a man than those children of mine who had every care expended on their puny minds and whose ambition nonetheless extended no further than a desire to secure their own comfort matthew was tall and fair and had such an expression of the most perfect compliance in his manner that he compelled the favor of all who encountered him i first met him when he was questioned by thurloes office about a group thought to be too radical for the countrys peace he was perhaps sixteen at the time i merely attended rather than conducted the interview a business for which i never had much patience and was immediately struck by the forthright honesty in his responses which showed a maturity beyond both his station and years he was in fact entirely innocent of any wrongdoing and was never suspected of such but he was acquainted with many dangerous people even though he did not share their opinions in any way he was reluctant to give information about his friends and i found this innate sense of loyalty an admirable trait and thought that could it but be redirected to more worthy ends this ignorant child might yet be turned into a man of worth his interrogation was kept secret lest he lose credit with his friends and i offered afterward to engage him as a servant at a decent wage he was so astonished by his good fortune that he accepted with alacrity already he had some small learning for he was the orphan of a printer in the city and could read well and write with accuracy and as i tempted him with knowledge he responded with an enthusiasm i have never met before or since in any pupil those who know me may find this incredible for i know i have a reputation for impatience i willingly admit that my tolerance for the idle the stupid or the willfully ignorant is swiftly exhausted but give me a real pupil one burning with the desire to learn who needs only a touch of sweet water to yearn for the whole river of knowledge and my care is all but infinite to take such a boy as matthew to form him and see his comprehension expand and his wisdom develop is the richest of experiences if also the most difficult and calling for unrelenting effort the getting of children is the vulgar work of nature fools can do it peasants can do it and women can do it framing those moving lumps into wise and good adults is a task fit only for men and only they can properly savor the result train up a child in the way he should goand when he is old he will not depart from itproverbs i had no extravagant hopes but i thought that in time i would establish him in some position in the government and ultimately teach him my skills in cryptography that he might be useful and make his way to position my hopes were more than satisfied for however fast matthew learned yet i knew he could go faster but i confess this merely excited my own desires for him still further and i often lost my temper when he misconstrued a phrase or bungled a simple proposition in mathematics but i always thought that he knew my anger came from love and selfless ambition for him and he seemed to try at all times to earn my approbation i knew this knew his devotion to me was so great he would sometimes labor too much and still i pushed him even when my desire was to tell him to rest and sleep or give him some token of my affection once i got up and found him sprawled at my desk all my papers were disorganized candle fat had spilled over my notes and a glass of water had tipped on a letter i was writing i was furious as i am naturally fastidious in matters of organization and straightway pulled him to the ground and beat him he made not one word of protest said nothing in his own defense but submitted patiently to my punishment only later and not from him did i learn that he had been up all night trying to master a problem i had set him and had finally fallen asleep through simple exhaustion it was the hardest thing not to beg his pardon to resist giving way to sentiment he never suspected i think that i regretted my deed for once a perfect submission is undermined and questioned then all authority dissolves and the weaker are the greatest losers we see this everywhere we look i was aware of course of matthews connections with men of dubious loyalty and opinion and could not forbear to use him on occasion to run errands and listen to gossip in this often distasteful and dishonorable business he was invaluable for he was both observant and intelligent in his manner unlike many of those i was forced to rely oncutthroats thieves and madmen for the most part whose word could never be taken on trustmatthew soon won my complete confidence i called him in to me when i was in london and wrote to him every second day while in oxford for i delighted in his company and missed it badly when we were apart as i hope he missed mine by the time he came to me that morning in he had been my servant for several years and had grown in stature to the point that i knew i would soon have to find him a permanent position of his own already i had delayed too long for he was rising twenty and outgrowing his tutelage i could see him straining and knew that if he was not soon released he would come to resent my authority but i held him to me still unable to let go i blame myself for this greatly and think that his desire to leave me may have made him incautious when he told me he was to deliver a package to the private mails on behalf of a group of radicals i immediately took notice he did not know what this package was but had undertaken to take it to a merchant who delivered mails on his ships it was common enoughespecially amongst those who did not wish their letters to be read the unusual occurrence was that someone like matthew was to perform a task more suited for a child it was not certain but he had a feeling that the package might be of significance especially as the destination was the low countries for many months now there had been rumblings all over the country with shadowy figures flitting about and mutterings of discontent but there was no form or unity to the collection of reports which allowed me to discern the shape of their plans left to themselves these radicals presented no serious threat to anyone so great were their divisions and despair but should a man of authority and skill organize and fund them properly they could easily become so matthew had i thought provided the first beginnings of that external correspondence i had long been looking for as it turned out he was wrong but it was the best mistake he ever made excellent i said bring me the package i will have it opened examine the contents and send you on your way he shook his head not so simple im afraid sir wetheyhave learned caution of late i know i am not suspected in any way but i am to be accompanied from the moment it is put into my hands to the moment i hand it over it will be impossible for you to have access to it in such a fashion not for the time you will need to copy it and you are sure it is worth the effort i dont know but you asked me to mention any communication with the exiles you did very well indeed now your suggestions you know i value your opinion he smiled with pleasure at this small token of regard i assume it will stay in the merchants house until it is placed on board one of his ships but not for long they want it on its way as quickly as possible that perhaps will be the only opportunity for obtaining it in secret ah and what is the name of this merchant di pietro he is a venetian and has a house near the tower i thanked him profusely for his work and gave him some small money as a reward then dismissed him to consider what he had said it troubled me a little even though it made no obvious sense for what was a venetian doing helping sectaries in all probability he was merely carrying mail for a fee uninterested in either senders or recipients but i was mindful that this was the second time the name of di pietro had arisen that fact alone made me more determined to examine those letters i had some leisure to ponder the problem but not muchmatthew was due to deliver the package the following evening bennet had told me to leave di pietro alone but he had also told me to find out about the kings enemies in england he had not told me what to do when these two commands were in contradiction so i went to tom lloyds coffee shop where men of trade were wont to gather to exchange news and organize themselves into better profits i knew some people in this world as i would occasionally venture capital in this fashion and had learned who was to be trusted and who deserved only to be shunned particularly i knew a man called williams who spent a considerable amount of time gathering up individuals with money to risk and putting them in contact with traders who needed finance through him i had placed to advantage some small part of my surplus funds in the east indies and also with a gentleman who captured africans for the americas this latter was by far the finest investment i ever made the more so because the captain of the vessel assured me the slaves were instructed vigorously in the virtues of christianity on their voyage across the ocean and thus had their souls saved at the same time as they produced valuable labor for others i told williams when i ran him to earth that i was interested in putting some funds into the activities of an italian house called cola and wondered whether this man was sound and trustworthy he looked at me a little strangely and replied cautiously that as far as he knew the house of cola was funded entirely on its own resources he would be very surprised indeed to discover that he was bringing in outsiders i shrugged and said this was what i had been told thank you for the intelligence then he said your news confirms what i have suspected which is that the house of cola must be in considerable trouble venices war against the turks has devastated his business which has always been in the levant he lost two ships last year with full cargoes and venice still cannot prise open markets controlled by the spaniards and portuguese he is a fine trader but he has fewer and fewer people with whom he can trade is this why he set up here undoubtedly i believe that without the goods england takes from him he would not float for long what exactly is this venture i said i wasnt sure but had been assured it was of the greatest potential probably to do with printed silks very profitable if you know what you are doing but a disaster if you do not sea water and silk do not mix very well does he have his own ships oh yes and very wellfound vessels they are he has an agent in london i believe called di pietro what is he like i know him only a little he keeps himself to himself he doesnt mix much with others in the trading world although he is well in with the jews of amsterdam again a warning for you for if we go to war with the dutch that connection will be worse than useless the house of cola will have to choose which side it is on and will inevitably lose yet more business how old is di pietro oh old enough to know what he is doing in his fifties i believe he talks occasionally of going back home and living an easier life but says his employer has too many children who need to be provided for how many children five i believe but three are daughters poor man i grimaced in sympathy even though the man might well turn out to be an enemy i knew enough to be aware that for a trader whose lifeblood depended on keeping his capital close by three daughters could be a killing burden fortunately even though my two sons were both fools they were presentable enough to be married to women of fortune indeed a grave disappointment williams continued especially as neither of the sons is minded to follow him one is a priest andbegging your pardon doctoruseful only for consuming money rather than creating it i believe the other plays the soldier he did so at least i have not heard news of him for some time a soldier i said with astonishment for this quite important fact had been entirely missed by the picture dealer and i made a note to reprove him for his laxity so i understand perhaps he never showed any inclination to trade and the father was too wise to force him that was why cola married the eldest daughter to a cousin in the levant business are you sure hes a soldier how do you know this i said returning to the question and i could see arousing williamss suspicions doctor i do not know any more he replied patiently all i know is what i hear around the coffee shops tell me what you hear then knowing about the son will reassure you about investing in his business i am a cautious man and believe in knowing everything i can wayward children you must admit can be a ferocious drain what if the son is in debt and his creditors make a claim on the father while he has my money williams grunted not believing me but willing not to press i was told by a fellow merchant who tried to open trade in the mediterranean he explained eventually by the time the pirates and the genoese had finished with him he realized it was hardly worth the trouble but he spent some time there a few years back cruising around and once landed a cargo on crete for the garrison at candia i raised an eyebrow it was a brave or a very desperate man indeed who would try to run a cargo through the turks to supply that particular market as i say williams said he had taken losses and was desperate so he took a chance a successful throw it seems as he not only sold his entire cargo but was allowed to take a cargo of venetian glass back to england by way of reward i nodded anyway there he met a man called cola who said his father was a merchant in the luxury trade of venice now perhaps there are two colas who are merchants in venice i do not know go on he shook his head there you have my entire fund of knowledge on the subject the doings of the merchants children are not my concern i have more immediate matters to worry about what is more doctor so do you so why dont you tell me what it is i smiled and stood up nothing i said certainly i know nothing which might help you to a profit in that case i am not in the slightest bit interested but if ever i nodded a bargain is a bargain i am pleased to say that i discharged my debt in due course as through me mr williams was one of the first to know about the plans to reequip the fleet the following year i gave him enough forewarning to allow him to buy up every mast pole in the country so he could sell them to the navy at the price he named between us we profited handsomely god be praised the merchant he mentioned andrew bushrod i tracked down in the reel prison where he had been for several monthshis creditors had tired of him when a ship carrying most of his capital had gone down and his family had refused to come to his rescue this apparently was his own faultwhen prosperous he had declined to contribute to a cousins marriage portion naturally they felt no obligation to him when hard times came so he was not only in the fleet he was also at my mercy as i had sufficient influence to have him released if he did not cooperate then his sanctuary would be lost and his creditors would pounce it took some effort to sift out the dross from what he told me and his accuracy in point of detail was dubiousit is enough merely to contrast his description of cola with the plump perfumed dandy i later encountered to see that even though his wounds then perhaps affected his appearance briefly stated bushrods account was that he had taken a ship into the mediterranean and to leghorn to sell a cargo of woolen goods there the price he gainedhe was no businessmanjust about paid the cost of the voyage and he was casting around for goods to bring back to england at this point he chanced upon a venetian who told of a hugely profitable voyage he had just made to crete running food and weapons into candia harbor under the noses of the turks the town and its defenders were so short of everything they would pay virtually any price for his part however he would not go back again why not asked bushrod because he wanted to live into his old age the man replied although the turkish fleet was incompetent the pirates were much more effective too many of his friends had been caught and a lifetime in the galleys was the best you could expect if you were the man then pointed out a beggar in the street outside whom he said was once a sailor in a candia ship he had no hands no eyes no ears and no tongue bushrod was not brave and was little interested in saving crete for christendom or for venice but he was out of funds his crew had not been paid and his creditors would be waiting for him when he returned home so he contacted the venetian consul in leghorn who told him what sort of goods would be required and then took a fat contract to bring out any wounded who were fit to travelfour ducats for a gentleman one for a soldier half for a woman they hugged the italian coast as far as messina where they offloaded some pottery then headed as quickly and directly as possible for crete candia he said was the worst experience of his life to be in a town of several thousand people all of whom expected to die shortly abandoned by all christendom aware that their mother country was tiring of them and persecuted endlessly by foes on sea and land was almost too much to bear everything was coarsened and brutal after the longest siege in the history of the world there was an air of desperation and violence which terrified him into lowering his prices afraid that the townspeople would otherwise set on him and take everything he had for nothing he still made a big enough profit to make the voyage more than worthwhile and then set about preparing for the return journey by advertising for passengers one of the people who took up his offer was named cola name i said be more precise man what was his name marco he said that was it marco anyway this cola was in a bad way gaunt and thin gloomy of attitude dirty and unkempt and half delirious from pain and the huge amounts of alcohol he took as his only medicine it was difficult to believe that he could ever have been much of an advantage to the venetian defenses but bushrod soon learned that he was wrong the young man was treated with respect by officers many years his senior and held almost in awe by the common foot soldiers cola was it seemed the best scout in candia adept at slipping past ottoman outposts carrying messages to outlying fortifications and causing all sorts of light disruption on many occasions he had deliberately and successfully set traps for highranking turks and killed them gaining a reputation for bloodcurdling ferocity and ruthlessness he was skilled at striking in silence and escaping undetected and was it seemed something of a zealot for the christian cause despite all appearances to the contrary curious about his passenger bushrod tried to engage him in conversation on several occasions during the voyage back to venicewhich this time passed without incident but cola was reticent hiding behind a gruff and melancholy silence only on one occasion did he reveal himself and that was when bushrod asked if he was married colas face darkened and he said that his fiancee had been taken into slavery by the turks he had been sent out to crete to examine the girl who came from a good family and had agreed to the match she had been dispatched ahead of him to venice and the ship was captured not a word had ever been heard of her again and he very much hoped she was dead against his fathers wishes the young man had stayed in candia to exact such revenge as he could and now and now he no longer cared he was badly injured and he knew that candia would soon fall there was neither the determination nor the money nor the faith to defend it he was undecided whether to return or not perhaps his skills could be better employed elsewhere then marco da cola had reached for a bottle and spent nearly the enure voyage sitting on deck uttering not another word drunk or sober until the ship docked in venice so much for that zeal against the heathen was hardly something of which i could disapprove and yet it was curious we had a soldier or exsoldier consorting with republicans in the low countries the fathers agent a venetian observer sending regular messages to his masters abroad and transporting messages from malcontents in england lots of little pieces none of which added up yet there was something which needed to be unraveled and the obvious starting point was that package which despite mr bennets strictures i decided was within my competence lest anyone think that i could call on an army of assistants in the fashion of thurloe i must hasten to state the true facts although i had a number of people who passed me information i had precisely five in the entire country who could be relied on to act for me and two of these i must confess frightened even me nor was this matter my only or even my main occupation i have mentioned the rising which i knew was being planned and that naturally was my greatest concern but there were also countless other irritations most nonsensical although each with dangerous potential the garrison at abingdon had been purged but was still less than satisfactorily quiescent sectaries and conventicles grew up like so many mushrooms across the landscape giving scope for malcontents to meet and draw courage from each other there were persistent reports that yet again the messiah had returned to usher in the millennium and was traveling the country in some guise preaching and teaching and sowing sedition how many of these characters had there been in the past few years dozens at least and i had hoped that quieter times had put an end to them but it was not apparently the case finally in the middle of the affair i intend to relate a drunken irish magus called greatorex turned up in oxford and held court at the mitre inn to milk the gullible of their coins so i had to divert much time to persuading him to move on his way i had enough on my plate in other words and though i worked without stint i must say that neither then nor later were my efforts ever fully recognized or rewarded for the particular task of getting hold of these letters i had to call on the services of one john cooth whose loyalty to the king was due solely to my having intervened when he nearly killed his wife in a drunken frenzy then slit a mans throat for he said trying to put a pair of horns on him he was in no wise intelligent but was skilled at housebreaking and was thoroughly in my debt i thought he would serve especially as i gave him a strict lecture about what he was to do and how he was to do it in particular i told him there was to be absolutely no violence and i labored the point so much even a man of his diminished wits must understand or so i thought when matthew told me that the package had been delivered to di pietros house and was to go aboard one of his ships the next morning i told cooth to bring it to me as rapidly as possible cooth dutifully returned a few hours later and gave me a package which contained all the mail being sent including the letters delivered by matthew i copied them and he took it back and the next morning matthew came with the news that signer di pietro had been murdered i was appalled by this and prayed to the lord for forgiveness for my foolishness it was fairly obvious to me despite cooths denials what had happenedhe had gone into the house and instead of just taking the package had decided to help himself to the contents of the treasury as well di pietro was roused came to investigate and cooth had coldbloodedly cut open his throat so badly the head was almost severed from the body eventually i wrung a confession out of himwhat was it to me he said whether hed killed the man or not id wanted the package id got the package i lost patience and cut him off he was going back to jail i said and if he so much as breathed a word of this hed hang even he understood my seriousness and the matter went no further i soon learned that cola had an english partner who wanted the entire business and was unconcerned about discovering the author of a deed which had served him so profitably it took many days but after much effort i felt i could relax relatively certain that mr bennet would not hear of the affair this unfortunate business at least provided me with di pietro s mailbag which turned out to be far more interesting than even i had hoped for not only did it include the letters being sent to the radicals it also contained another unmarked in any way which came from a different and unknown source i only looked at it because i remembered the habits that thurloe had inculcated into his office one of which was that when examining a mailbag for suspicious correspondence check everything else it contains as well there were twelve letters in all one from the radicals ten entirely innocuous and concerned only with trading matters and this one its lack of address alone would have alerted my attention the fact that the seal on the back was entirely blank merely added to my determination i only wished that little samuel morland had been there by my side for no man was ever swifter at removing a seal nor better at putting it back unnoticed my own efforts were more laborious and i cursed mightily as i wrestled with that most delicate task but i did it and did a fine job so that once it was battered a little by transporting i felt sure no one would see my handiwork and it was worth the effort inside was as fine a piece of coding as i had ever seena very long letter of about twelve thousand characters in the complicated random cipher i described earlier i felt a tingling of excitement as i contemplated it for i knew it to be a challenge worthy of my skill but at the back of my mind was a more worrying thought for ciphers are like music and have their own rhythms and cadences this one as i scanned it sounded in my mind as being familiar like a tune heard once before but i could not yet place the melody many times have men asked me why i took up the art of decipherment for it seems to them to be a vulgar occupation not in keeping with my position and dignity i have many reasons and the fact that i enjoy it is but the least of them men like boyle are absorbed by teasing out the secrets of nature in which i also take the greatest pleasure but how wonderful it is also to penetrate the secrets of mens minds to turn the chaos of human endeavor into order and bring the darkest deeds from night into daylight a cipher is only a collection of letters on a page this i grant but to take that confusion and turn it into meaning through the exercise of pure reason provides a satisfaction which i have never managed to communicate to others i can only say that it is not unlike prayer not vulgar prayer in which men chant words while their minds are elsewhere but true prayer so complete and profound that you feel the touch of gods grace on your spirit and i have often thought that my success shows his favor a sign that what i do is pleasing to him the letter sent by the sectaries was pathetically easy to unravel and scarcely interesting had i known what it contained i would never have bothered as it was not worth di pietros life or the trouble his murder caused me it spoke of preparations in that pompous language so beloved of sectaries and referred elliptically to a place i confidently identified as northampton but there was little meat nothing which justified the risk i had taken if that lay anywhere it was in the last mysterious letter i was determined to read it and knew i must have the key matthew came to me as i sat at my desk the unreadable letter in front of me in all its defiance and asked whether he had done well very well i told him very well indeed although largely by chanceyour letter is uninteresting it is this other one which fascinates me i held it up for him to examine which he did with his habitual neatness and care you know this already you have unraveled it all i laughed at his faith in me a different letter a different source and no doubt a different addressee but i know nothing and have unravelled less i cannot read this letter the code is based on a book which determines the sequence of the cipher which book that i do not know and unless i can find out i will understand nothing but i am sure it is important this sort of code is rare i have come across it only a few times and then written by men of the highest intelligence it is too complex for fools you will succeed he said with a smile i am sure of that i love you for your confidence my boy but this time you are wrong without the key the door will remain locked so how do we find this key only the person who wrote it and the person who will read it will know what it is and have a copy so we must ask them i thought he was joking and began to reprove him for his levity but i saw in his face that he was quite serious let me return to smithfield i will tell them that there was an attempt to steal the letter which failed and i will offer to go myself on the boat to guard it and ensure it comes to no harm then i will discover to whom this one is sent and what is the key the mind of youth sees in such a simple and direct way that i could hardly conceal my amusement why do you laugh doctor he asked his brow furrowing what i say is right there is no other way of discovering what you need to know and you have no one else to send matthew your innocence is charming you would go you would be discovered and all would be lost even if you escaped unharmed do not bother me with such foolishness you treat me always like a child he said saddened by my remark but i can see no reason for it how else can you discover what this book is and who it is sent to and if you cannot trust me who else can you send i took him by the shoulders and looked into his angry eyes do not be upset i said more gently i spoke as i did not out of contempt but concern you are young and these are dangerous people i do not wish you to come to harm i thank you for it but i desire nothing more than to do something of value for you i know my debt to you and how little i have repaid it so please sir give your permission and you must decide fast the letters must be returned and the boat leaves tomorrow morning i paused and studied his fair face its perfection spoiled by his resentment and knew from the sight more than from his words that i would have to loosen the bonds or lose him forever still i tried one more time if i be bereaved of my children i am bereaved genesis he looked at me gently and with such kindness i remember it still provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged colossians i bowed to that and let him go embracing him as he left and watching from my window as he walked down the street outside until he was lost from sight in the crowds i saw the spring in his step and the joy in his walk that came from his freedom and i grieved over my loss i spent the afternoon in prayer for his safety i did not hear from him for a whole fortnight and was tormented by distress and fear every day lest the boat had sunk or he had been discovered but he acquitted himself better than i had expected and showed more skill than many an intelligencer properly waged by the government when i received his first letter i wept with both relief and pride most reverend sir the letter began following your instructions i shipped aboard the bark colombo and made my way to the hague the crossing was terribly bad and at one stage i was sure the mission would fail because it seemed certain the ship would sink with all hands fortunately the master was an experienced man and brought us through safely if very ill by the time we docked i had thoroughly ingratiated myself with this man and learned that he did not wish to spend much time in port he was distressed about the death of di pietro concerned for his job and wanted to head back for london as swiftly as possible so i offered to deliver the letters to their destination on his behalf saying i would be glad of the chance to spend some time in this part of the world as he had no notion there was anything special about any of them he agreed readily and says he will bring me back to london when he comes over with his next load of goods we went through the list as properly as any post officer and checked the addresses of each envelope against the list he had in his hand this one has no address i told him picking up the letter which interests you so much nor it has but no matter it is here on my list and he pointed out for me to see that he had instructions in di pietros own handwriting that this particular letter was to be delivered to a man called cola in guldenstraat sir i must tell you that the house concerned is that of the ambassador of spain and that this cola is well known there i have not yet delivered it for i was told he would not be there until tomorrow so i refused to hand it over saying i was under strict instructions to give it into his hands alone in the meantime i have prevailed on the english in this place to give me lodging which they agreed to with great friendliness for they feel cut off and anxious for any news of home when i return i will of course call upon you to offer such further news as i have found please be assured dearest and kindest sir etc etc even though the affection of my dear boys salutation warmed me i fear i might have forgotten myself sufficiently as to box his ears with frustration had he been present i realized that he had done a fine job but nonetheless he had not succeeded as completely as i needed i still did not have the name of the book that formed the key and without that i was not greatly advanced but however much he had failed in this i realized he more than made up for it elsewhere for i knew that the ambassador of spain esteban de gamarra was an implacable dangerous foe of england that one piece of information alone justified everything i had done so far for this cola i had been told months earlier was associating with radicals and now here he was with an address at the spanish embassy it was a fascinating puzzle the information placed me in a quandary because if i had disobeyed by pursuing di pietro interfering in this matter was even more grave mr bennet was still my sole protector and i could not afford to lose his good will if i could not replace him with someone better however any form of link between the spanish and the radicals was of the utmost seriousness the prospect of an alliance between the upholder of catholicism and the most fervent fanatics of protestantism was hardly to be countenanced but nonetheless i held in my hand the first faint glimmerings of such a connection and i could not allow what seemed unlikely in abstract to overawe the most direct and compelling evidence this has ever been my lodestone in philosophy as in governance the mind of man is weak and often cannot grasp patterns that appear to be against all reason the codes i have spent so much of my life in deciphering are a simple example of this for who could understand if they did not know how a jumble of meaningless letters could inform the reader of the thoughts of the greatest in the land or the most dangerous in the field it is against common sense and yet it is so reason beyond ordinary human understanding is often to be met with in gods creation so much so that i have had occasion to laugh at mr locke who makes so much of common sense in his philosophy great things doeth he which we cannot comprehend job in all things we forget this at our cost reason said spaniards would not pay to put republican sectaries in power nor would these selfsame sectaries willingly subordinate their desires to spanish policy yet the evidence was beginning to hint at precisely some such understanding between them i could at that stage make nothing of it and so declined to elaborate fantastic theories but at the same time i refused to reject evidence simply because it did not immediately coincide with reason i was certain to be ridiculed if i presented my information to mr bennet who prided himself on his understanding of the spanish and was convinced of their friendship nor could i take any action against the sectaries for as yet they had done nothing ill so i could do nothingonce i had deciphered the letter discovered who had written it and amassed more evidence then perhaps i could present a stronger case but until then i had to keep my suspicions to myself i very much hoped that matthew would remember my instructions that getting the key to the letter was vital as it was extremely difficult to communicate with him in any way in the meantime i wrote a report to mr bennet informing him in general terms that something was stirring among the radicals and assuring him of my best service a week later matthew repaid my trust in him and i received another letter which contained something of the information i required he offered four possibilities apologizing for being able to do no better he had delivered the letter once more and this time had been shown into a small room which appeared to be an office he found it disgusting for it was lined with crucifixes and stank with the odor of idolatry but while waiting for cola himself to appear he saw four volumes on the desk and swiftly noted down their titles i was pleased by this as it vindicated my faith in himto act so was intelligent and courageous and he would have been in great danger if anyone had come through the door while he was writing unfortunately the finer points of the cryptographers art were lost on himhe did not realize perhaps this was my fault for not having instructed him properly that each edition of a book differs and that the wrong edition made my message as unintelligible as the wrong book all i had to go on was the following which he had copied out letter by letter in total ignorance of its import titi liuii ex rec heins lugd il polyd hist nouo corol duaci thom vtop rob alsop eucl oct almost as importantly and very much more dangerously he encountered cola himself and gave me an early indication of the mans powers of deception i have the letter still of course i keep every remembrance of matthewevery letter every little exercise book he once filled is in a silver box lined in silk and bound with the lock of hair i stole one night while he lay asleep my eyesight is fading now and soon i will be able to read his words no longer i will burn them for i could not bear to have anyone else read them to me or snigger at my weakness my last contact with him will be lost when the light flickers out even now i do not open that box up very often as i find the sadness difficult to bear cola at once began to exercise his charm trapping the ladtoo young and naïve to realize the difference between kindness and its simulacruminto acquaintanceship then the appearance of friendship he is a chubby man with bright eyes and when he appeared and i gave him the letter he chuckled with thanks clapped me on the back and gave me a silver guilder then he questioned me closely about all things showing great interest in my replies and even begged me to return that he might question me further i must say sir that he gave no sign of any concern with matters political nor did he ever mention anything the slightest bit improper rather he showed himself the perfect gentleman courteous in manner and easy to approach and talk to in all things so easy it is to delude the trusting this cola began to steal his way into matthews affections no doubt conversing with the facility of the passing acquaintance never approaching the care that i had devoted to the lad over so many years it is easy to entertain and fascinate harder to educate and love matthew alas was not yet old or discriminating enough to tell the difference and was easy prey to the ruthlessness of the italian who beguiled with his words until he needed to strike the letter disturbed me for my main concern was that matthews natural amiability might permit some illchosen words to slip out and alert cola to my awareness of him i forced my mind to concentrate on problems more easy to resolve and took up once more the question of the coded letter and its key only one of the books matthew mentioned could be the one i needed the problem was to determine which one the easiest solution was denied mefor i knew that euclid had only been printed in octavo but once in paris in and i had that edition in my own library it was simple enough therefore to discover it was not the one i wanted that left the remaining three accordingly the moment i arrived back in oxford i summoned a strange young man of my acquaintance mr anthony wood whom i knew to be an expert squirreler in such matters i had rendered him many favors in those days earning his gratitude for allowing him access to manuscripts in my care and he was pathetically eager to repay my kindnesses to him although as a price i had to listen to interminable discussions about this press and that press one edition after another and so on i suppose he thought i was interested in the minutiae of ancient learning and attempted to curry favor by drawing me into scholarly conversation it took him some considerable time before he returned to my room one evening building works at my house having forced me meanwhile to rent space at new collegea regrettable fact which i will discuss later on and reported that in all probability he had worked out which books were meant although personally he believed that in the case of the thomas more and the polydore vergil better editions existed at a more modest cost i detested having to play such silly games but i patiently explained nonetheless that i had set my heart on these particular versions i wished i said to experiment with making comparisons between the various editions so as to prepare a complete version without faults for the world he admired greatly my devotion and said he understood perfectly the utopia of thomas more he said was a quarto and undoubtedly the translation by robinson which alsop had published in he could tell that because alsop only produced one edition before changing times meant that publishing the works of catholic saints became a risky occupation a copy he said was in the bodleian library the history of polydore vergil was also simplethere were not many new editions of this fine author published in douai after all it had to be the idiosyncratic edition of george lily an octavo printed in copies were not hard to come by and indeed he had seen a version only the other day at mr heaths the bookseller at a price of one shilling and sixpence he was sure he could bargain the man downas if i cared about two pence and the fourth that is a problem he said i think i know which edition you refer to here it is the heins which gives it away of course this refers to the handsome edition of livys histories by daniel heinsius issued in leiden in a triumph of skill and learning which alas never received the approbation it deserved i assume this refers to volume two of the edition which was a duodecimo in three volumes few were printed and i have never seen one i know it only by reputationothers have shamelessly used his insights without ever crediting their true author which is a burden true scholars must constantly bear make enquiries for me i told him with heavy patience i will pay a good price for it if it is to be had you must know booksellers and antiquarians and collectors of libraries and the like if there is one someone like you will be able to find it of that i feel sure the silly man looked modestly down his nose at the compliment i will do my best for you he said and i can assure you that if i cannot find a copy no one else will be able to that is all i ask i replied and ushered him out as quickly as was possible i have read of late a scurrilous pamphlet which without naming me directly said that the crisis with which i was dealing at this stage was a fabrication whipped up by a government to foment fear of sectaries and that it did not in fact exist nothing could be further from the truth i hope i have already made my good intentions and my honesty clear what i did i admiti freely own that i overemphasized the danger of the rising which led to my employment by mr bennet and claim for myself the mistake which led to the regrettable death of signor di pietro i hope there is no doubt about the sincerity of my remorse but the fact remains that the man was carrying subversive and conspiratorial material and it was necessary for the security of the kingdom to have it i feel as though i ought to set out some of my thinking lest it be thought that my punctiliousness over letters and obscure books makes me seem fussy and obsessive for it had struck me as obvious that these books which matthew had told me about were most unusual everybody knows about the sectaries and their pathetic claims to learning selftaught scrabblers in the dust most of them seduced by secondrate reading into the delusion that they are educated educated a bible whose sublime subtlety and symbolic beauty they cannot even begin to understand and a few screeching pamphlets by that handful of dissenters whose arrogance exceeds their shame is all they have by way of education no latin no greek and certainly no hebrew unable to read any language but their own and assaulted by the ravings of false prophets and selfappointed messiahs even in english of course they are not educated knowledge is the province of the gentleman i do not say that artisans cannot know but it is obvious that they cannot assess as they possess neither the leisure nor the training to consider free from prejudice plato said so and i know of no serious person who has denied him and the writer of this letter to cola was using one of these fine texts for his code livy polydore more initially it made me shudder to think of such hands even touching these works but then i reconsideredsome scruffy pamphlet i would have accepted but these where did they get their hands on books which belong only in the library of a gentleman by the time wood reappeared sniffing and twitching like a little mouse i had established that neither the more nor the polydore vergil was the book i required the answer therefore lay in the livyfind it find who possessed it and my investigation would advance in a great leap wood told me that a longdead london bookseller had brought half a dozen copies into the country in as part of a general shipment for scholars what had happened to them after that alas was unclear as the man had been a supporter of the king and all his stock was confiscated in fines when parliament secured its hold on london wood assumed these books were dispersed then so you mean to tell me after all that that you cannot get me a copy he looked a bit surprised by my sharpness of tone but shook his head oh no sir he said i thought you might be interested that is all but they are rare and i have identified only one person who definitely had one which he brought in himself from abroad i know of it because my friend mr aubrey wrote to a bookseller in italy on some other matter mr wood i beg you i said my patience very near to expiring i do not wish to know every single detail i merely need the name of the owner so i might write to him ah you see he is dead i sighed heavily but do not despair sir for by the greatest good fortune his son is a student here and would no doubt know whether the book remains in the family his name is prestcott his father was sir james prestcott thus my story and colas tales as fictional as boccaccio and as unlikely as the rhymes of tasso though less finely hewn begin to intersect through the medium of poor deluded prestcott and i must lay out the details as best i can although i fully admit that i am not entirely clear about some of the circumstances the lad had come to my attention several months previously when i heard of his visit to lord mordaunt mordaunt had properly communicated with mr bennet and news of the event was passed on to me as a matter of course students and sons of traitors seeing fit to interrogate members of the court was no usual occurrence and mr bennet thought that an eye should be kept on the young man i knew few of the details but had heard enough to be certain that prestcotts belief in the innocence of his father was as ludicrous as it was touching i was uncertain what the precise nature of his betrayal was for i had left the governments employ by then but the noise he created signified something of great importance i knew something of it because as my skills were indispensable in early i was requested to work on a letter with the greatest urgency i have mentioned it before for it was my one failure and the moment i saw it i knew that there was little chance of success as much to preserve my reputation as my position the fall of the commonwealth was becoming increasingly certain and i had no wish to prolong my association with it i declined the task the suasion placed upon me was great however even thurloe himself wrote to me using a mixture of flattery and threat to win compliance but still i refused all communications were brought by samuel morland himself a man whose weaselly words and concern for selfadvancement i detested and his presence alone made me obdurate you cannot do it can you doctor he said in his sneering way on the surface so amiable but still barely hiding his cocky contempt for all others that is why you refuse i refuse because i am doubtful why i am asked i know you too well samuel everything you touch is corrupt and deceitful he laughed merrily at this and nodded in agreement perhaps so but this time i have noble company i looked at the letter once more very well i said i will try where is the key what do you mean samuel do not treat me like a fool you know very well what i mean who wrote this a royalist soldier called prestcott ask him for the key then it must be a book or a pamphlet i must know what the code is based on we dont have him samuel replied he fled the letter was found on one of our soldiers why so a very good question indeed samuel said that is why we want this letter deciphered ask this soldier then if you cannot lay your hands on sir james prestcott samuel looked apologetic he died a few days ago and there was nothing else on him either no other paper no book no piece of writing with it morland looked discountenanced for once a fact which gave me some pleasure for he usually adopted such a selfsatisfied air that it was satisfying indeed to see him uncertain and nervous this was all we found we had been expecting more i tossed the letter onto my desk no key no solution i said nothing i can do and nothing i will try to do i do not intend to work myself to death because of your foolish incompetence find sir james prestcott find the key and i will assist you not until then rumors that had swept through government and army in the previous few weeks gave some clue of course i had heard of fighting down in kent also of a frenzied investigation conducted with the greatest secrecy and ferocity later i heard of the flight of sir james prestcott abroad and of his being accused of betraying the rising against the commonwealth that in itself struck me as highly unlikelyi knew something of the man and considered him about as supple as a large piece of oak planking with an absolute conviction in his own beliefs men had sinned men must be punished and revenge takenthat was the alpha and omega of his politics and this limited vision was strengthened by his own privations in the war it made him useless as a conspirator but in my opinion also made him unlikely to conceive of anything so subtle as betrayalhe was too upright too honorable and far too stupid on the other hand he clearly had done something which made both royalists and thurloe earnestly desire his death and his silence and i did not know what that was i assumed the answer lay in the letter which made little samuel sweat so and when he had gone i naturally tried my hand to make it out i made no progress at all for the skill of its author was great far beyond anything i would have expected from a military dolt like prestcott i mention this because the words which wood spoke to me so innocently brought me to a realization i should have had some time before mentioning it now when it actually occurred to me risks making me seem foolish all i can say is that i will not accept judgment from those with inferior skills to mine recognizing a form of code is like recognizing a style in composition or poetry it is impossible to say what triggers the realization and i doubt there is another man alive who would have seen that the letter i had found in di pietros mailbag sent to this marco da cola was written in the same code had the same form the same feel as that letter of sir james prestcotts brought to me some three years earlier by samuel morland once i had grasped the form i could examine the structuretwo days hard work on both of them led me to the inevitable and clear conclusion that both were constructed with the same book a copy of livy i knew had been used to encode the letter to cola and so now i knew that the same livy had been used for the prestcott letter had i been more sure of my ground i would have summoned young prestcott told him the position and asked for the livy however i clearly could not do this without telling him of its significance and as i knew of his obsessions i did not want to be responsible for reopening a matter so obviously sensitivemany people had worked hard to keep those events hidden whatever they were and i would receive no thanks for drawing attention to them once again so i had to approach him in a more subtle fashion and therefore decided to make use of thomas ken this ken was a desperately ambitious young man who had the utmost clarity about his desires for ken gods interests and his own were indistinguishably mingled so much so that one might have thought the whole of salvation itself depended on his getting a year he once had the presumption to ask me for my favor in securing a living in the gift of lord maynard and disposable by new college not being a member of that society i naturally had little say in the matter and it was obvious that dr robert grovemore learned and balanced and certainly more deservingwould carry the day whatever i said but it was an inexpensive way of securing his devotion and i gave him the expression of my support for what that was worth in return i insisted that he help me when i required his services and in due course recommended that he persuade mr prestcott to seek my assistance prestcott duly came and i questioned him closely about his fathers possessions alas he knew nothing of any book by livy nor indeed of any documents at all although later on he did confirm what morland had saidit appeared his mother had been expecting a package from his father which never arrived it was exceptionally frustratingi needed only a little good fortune and i could not only unravel the secret correspondence of this marco da cola i could also take to myself one of the closest secrets of the realm but that fool samuel had allowed the only man who might tell me the answer to die my duties in this period enforced a strange rhythm of life upon me for i was forced to exist like some nocturnal creature which hunts while others sleep and rests from its labors while most of creation is active when all people of rank left london for their estates or to follow the court from one place of idle amusement to the other so i left the country to take up residence in london when the court returned to westminster i removed myself back to oxford i did not find this displeasing the obligations of the courtier are timeconsuming and largely fruitless unless you are chasing the prizes of fame and position if you are merely concerned with the safety of the kingdom and the smooth running of the government then maintaining a presence there is pointless in the entire country fewer than half a dozen people have true power the rest are governed in one way or another and i had more than sufficient contact with those who were truly of significance among these i found few natural allies and many who either deliberately or because of the limits of their comprehension worked against the interests of their own country such a state i may say was to be found everywhere in those days even amongst the philosophers who thought they were merely teasing out the secrets of nature having no care for thought they did not consider what they did and allowed themselves to be led down the road to the most dangerous of all positions as the years have gone by the parallels have become ever more clear to me for it is easy out of greed or generosity to fall into traps set by others a few weeks ago for example i prevailed in a controversy which until i pointed out the dangers seemed the most minor of matters a question that could excite only the most abstruse minds the secretary of state no longer mr bennet wrote to me to ask whether this land should join with the rest of the continent and adopt the gregorian calendar i believe my opinion was solicited merely to gain approval for something which had already been agreedit was surely absurd for this country alone in europe to have a different calendar and be forever seventeen days behind everyone else they changed their minds swiftly when i pointed out the implications of such a seemingly harmless move for it struck at the heart of church and state encouraging papists and dismaying those who fight to keep foreign dominance at bay do our armies contest the arrogant might of france merely for our independence to be given away under more peaceable guise to accept this calendar is to accept the authority of rome not merely as the unsubtle say because it was a reform that the jesuits devised but because to bow our heads means also to accept the right of the bishop of rome to determine when our church celebrates easter to say when all major festivals and holy days fall once conceded in principle all else follows naturally to bow to rome in one thing will lead to obedience in others as well it is the obligation of all englishmen to resist the blandishments of those siren voices who say that such small matters will bring benefits with no disadvantages it is not true and if we must stand alone then so be it englands glory has ever been to resist the pretensions of continental powers which seduce into slavery and wheedle into subjection honoring god is more important than the unity of christendom thus my response and i am glad that it prevailed the argument has been settled once and for all so it was after the restoration and the stakes were then even higher many men were open or concealed catholics and had insinuated themselves into places of high influence at court there were those i do them credit and say it was for reasons genuinely held who believed that the best interests of the state lay in binding it closely to france others wished to obstruct the ambitions of the bourbons by making common cause with the spanish week by week and month by month the factions contested with each other and foreign bribes flowed in not a minister nor officeholder failed to enrich himself from this battle for that is what it was at one moment the spanish faction held the upper hand as mr bennet and others consolidated their positions and took more power into their hands at another the french struck back subsidizing the dowry paid for the kings new wife and the dutch looked anxiously from one great enemy to another knowing that if they allied with one they would be attacked by the other the interests of justice and religion were lost sight of in their entirety as the battles at court played out in miniature the greater battles that were yet to come on the seas and fields of europe and there were two great enigmasthe king who would have allied with anyone who paid enough to subsidize his pleasure and lord clarendon who opposed any foreign entanglements believing his majestys position at home to be so insecure that the least trembling from abroad would shake his throne irrecoverably his views prevailed in but others such as lord bristol held the opposite view thinking either that fine victories abroad would strengthen the crown or secretly hoping for the opportunities that defeat would offer for many wanted to bring about clarendons fall and worked tirelessly to accomplish his ruin a defeat in arms would destroy his career more surely than anything else and i do not doubt that many loyal servants of the king lay awake at night hoping that one would come to pass for the moment though the greatest weapon the opponents of clarendon had was the scandalous behavior of his daughter which had convulsed the court scarcely six months before and severely weakened the chancellors position for the wretched woman had married the kings brother the duke of york without troubling to gain permission first that his daughter was well pregnant by the time of the nuptials that clarendon loathed the duke of york deeply that he was as deceived as the king none of this was of any consequence royal authority had been held to ridicule and the king had lost a valuable card in the diplomatic gamethe dukes hand in marriage would have been a fine inducement to seal an alliance it was said clarendon himself would not have the subject raised in his presence and was said to pray daily that the queen would give birth to an heir so that he could be acquitted of conniving to put his own daughter on the throne which would surely happen should the king die without legitimate issue it was not a matter easily forgiven and his enemies above all lord bristol who had the finest wit of them all made sure it could not be forgotten either such maneuverings among the mighty and the puffedup did not attract my attention overmuch foolishly so perhaps as more attention to the details of such petty squabbles would have helped me greatly i was as yet far from understanding that these intrigues were fundamental to my own enquiries and without them i would have had no grounds for concern over anything this however is a matter which will become clear in its proper place at that time i saw myself in all modesty as a servantone of importance perhaps but nonetheless with no interest in courtly battles nor even with a concern for influencing the policy of the realm my task was to tell my masters the secret history of the kingdom so they might reach their decisions with knowledge if they wished to do so in this my importance was crucial for good intelligence is the mother of prevention and the measures of suppression being taken were far from complete town walls were being razed but not fast enough sectaries of all sorts were being arrested and fined but there were always more and the more cunning kept themselves in concealment anybody reading this account may wonder why i was prepared to give such attention to the question of marco da cola since i have as yet described little to justify my effort in fact he was still only of passing interest to me one of those lines of enquiry which are pursued for the sake of thoroughnessthere was nothing solid on which i could concentrate and little more than curiosity to keep my attention focused i had it was true established a possible link between the exiles and the spanish and he and his family formed that link i had an incomprehensible letter and an intriguing connection with another document written three years previously finally i had the enigma of cola himself for it struck me as unusual that he could spend many months in the low countries without his profession of soldier being commonly known nor could i understand why his father a man of known ability was prepared to release his only effective son from his family obligations yet not only was the younger cola apparently entirely unengaged in trade he was not even married such were my thoughts and i mentioned the puzzle to mr williams my merchant friend when i met him the day after i arrived in london in early let me pose you a problem as an adventurer i said let us say that you lose your main markets and trading partners through ports being closed by war you have three daughters one of whom is married and two are rapidly approaching marriageable age you have only one useful son what tactics do you adopt to defend and expand your business once i have stopped panicking and praying for a turn of good fortune he said with a smile i can think of worse situations to be in but not many let us say you are a naturally calm man what do you do let us see much depends on the reserves i have at my disposal and the relations i have with my family of course will they step forward and help that might fend off an urgent crisis and give me time to recover but it gains me room to maneuver it does not solve the problem obviously the need is to find new markets but to break into a new port requires money as it is often necessary to sell at a loss for some time to establish oneself now the easiest solution is to establish an alliance with another house you marry a son if you have one and if your position is strong a daughter if it be weak the situation you describe indicates the need to marry a son to advantage for that brings money into the business rather than putting it out however you are also at a disadvantage of course for you need markets and that suggests that marrying a daughter will be required and where do you find the money for that any possible ally will be aware of the problem and drive a hard bargain will they not mr williams nodded in agreement that is precisely the case in my position i think i would have to consider a marriage of the son out of business to a lady of as much fortune as could find and immediately use the dowry to marry a daughter to trade with good fortune my family might end up with a small surplus without luck i might have to borrow at interest to fund the difference but that would be no problem if my trade recovered it is not a strategy that is guaranteed to bring success but it offers by far the best chance of it why do we have sons except for such purposes so if i said this trader not only seemed to have no plans to marry his son but had even let him go wandering europe where he is out of reach and consuming substantial amounts of money then i would be strongly adverse to venturing money in any enterprise with which he is concerned am i right in thinking that you are still occupying yourself with the house of cola i nodded with great reluctance i had no desire to take mr williams into my confidence in any way but he was too intelligent to be fooled and an honest admission i considered might be enough to bind him to obligations of silence do not think that such matters have not come into our minds as well he said our we traders we are jealously eager to hear news of our competitors and sad though it is rejoice too much to hear of a rivals downfall the better of us are always reminded that such a fate can easily befall anyone of course it takes very little ill fortune to turn riches into dust one storm or a war unforeseen can be a catastrophe you may rest easy on that score i reassured him i cannot predict the weather but no war will catch you unawares if i am able to assist you i am grateful for that i have a large cargo bound for hamburg next week i would like it to arrive as far as i am aware the prospect of dutch pirates being allowed free run of the north sea does not appear imminent but it would still be wise to guard against the unscrupulous anticipating matters believe me i have taken every precaution possible i am proof against the single privateer good now if i may return to cola what does the community of traders say that the fathers affairs are bad and getting worse in a word he has long suffered his eastern markets to be whittled away by the turks crete is now all but lost he made a brave venture to open up a new business in london but that has been crippled by the death of his manager here and the audacity of his english partner who has taken the business for his own and there are rumors he has been selling ships to raise money three years ago he had a fleet of more than thirty ships now it is down to almost twenty and he has warehouses in venice full of goods which is money moldering to no purpose if he does not move them he cannot meet his creditors if he does not do that he is finished he is held in good credit everyone is held in good credit until they stop paying their bills so how do you explain the fathers actions or the sons i cannot he has an excellent reputation so i must assume there is very much more to the situation than is accessible to a coffeehouse gossip like myself i cannot imagine what that might be be assured that if i hear anything i will let you know instantly i thanked him and left my interpretation of the situation was correct and for that i was glad but i was no closer to fathoming the problem than i was before the next piece of information which advanced my enquiry came from my involvement in the royal society and took another ten days to fall into my lap more by the grace of god than my own efforts fortunately there was much to occupy my mind in that period or i would have become very illtempered it is a great failing and one have long labored to overcome blessed is he that waiteth daniel the text i know by heart but do not find it easy to follow i have mentioned this august organization already and hinted how communications developing with men of curiosity all over the world aided my work i had initially taken on the task of secretary for correspondence myself but found my other duties burdensome and gradually relinquished the task to mr henry oldenburg a man of no experimental bent but with a pleasing ability to encourage others he called one morning to summarize recent correspondence with me because i knew well that notice of experiments and discoveries properly communicated was of the greatest importance to prevent foreigners claiming credit which was not theirs the reputation of the society was the honor of the country and the prompt establishment of priority was vital i may say here that this process gives the lie to colas complaints over the matter of blood transfusion as it was established and not by us that public knowledge of discoveries gives precedence lower did this cola did notwhat is more he is unable to provide any evidence whatsoever of his claims while lower can not only produce letters announcing his discovery but can also call on men of unimpeachable integrity like sir christopher wren to vouch for him to demonstrate i am not partial in this matter i can also cite mr leibniz when he laid claim to a new method for interpolation by contrasting series of differences when told that regnauld had already communicated a similar proposition to mersenne leibniz immediately withdrew any claim to priorityhe accepted that making the matter known was decisive similarly it is clear that colas complaints are quite without foundation for who did what first is unimportant not only did he fail to publish his initial experiment was conducted in secret and ended with the patients death in contrast lower not only performed before witnesses he eventually gave a demonstration before the whole society long before any squeak of protest was heard from venice during my discourse with oldenburg we discussed many questions of membership and regulation with great amiability before passing onto more liberal matters then i received the greatest shock i have heard by the way of a most interesting young man who might be considered at some stage as a corresponding member in venice we lack as you know any useful contacts with the curious of that republic i was genuinely delighted and not at all suspicious at this for oldenburg was always keen to search out new ways of binding philosophers of all lands together and make the enterprise of one known to others i am delighted to hear of it i said who is this young man i heard of him from dr sylvius he replied for he has been sitting at that great mans knee and is highly thought of for his skill his name is cola and he is a wealthy young man from a good family of well established traders i expressed the greatest of interest better still he is to come to england shortly so we will have an opportunity to talk to him and find out his qualities for ourselves sylvius says this he is coming to england apparently so he intends to come next month i believe i was about to write him a letter expressing our desire to welcome him on his arrival no i said do not do that i greatly admire sylvius for his knowledge but not for his judgment of his fellows if you extend an invitation to this young man and he turns out to be of no great ability we may find it difficult to avoid a snub by not electing him we will find him soon enough when he arrives and can examine him at our leisure oldenburg agreed to this without demur and as an extra precaution i took the letter from sylvius to study more carefully there was little more in it although i noted that what he said was that cola was due to come to england on a matter of urgent business now what could that be he had no interest in trade and coming to tour this part of the world could hardly be described as a matter of urgency so why was this former soldier corning here the next day i thought i could guess most reverend doctor and revered master the letter from matthew began i write in the greatest haste for i have news which may be of some considerable importance to you i have ingratiated myself most thoroughly in the servants quarters of the spanish embassy and pride myself that i have learned many secrets should i be discovered my life will be at an end but the value is such that i must take the risk i do not know what is planned with any exactitude for i pick up only gossip but servants always know far more than they should or than their masters suspect and it is noised here that a great coup is being planned for april against our country señor de gamarra has it seems been planning this for some time with men of high rank in england itself and his scheming is near to fruition more than this i cannot discover for there are limits to the knowledge even of chambermaids but it may be that i will know more later i must tell you sir that i believe your suspicions of marco da cola to be erroneous for he is a gentleman of the greatest friendliness and i have detected no military aspect to him at all quite the opposite in fact heseems made for gayness and amusement and his generosity as i can myself attest is great indeed a kinder less secretive gentleman i have rarely met moreover it appears he is to leave shortly and in a few days time is to give a farewell feast with music and dancing to which he has invited me as his particular guest so great has been my success at winning his favor he pays me a great compliment in keeping me by his side and i am sure you will agree it is the best place for me to be if i am to determine whether or no he means us ill i am sorry sir that i cannot say more at present i fear my enquiries will arouse suspicions if i ask too much my anger and dismay at this piece of youthful folly knew no bounds although i did not know whether i was more angry at matthew for his stupidity or at this cola for the way he had so filthily wormed his way into his affections i had never permitted him such entertainments for they are both sinful and spoil a childs education faster than any other mistake in their upbringing rather i had attended to his soul knowing that hard though it is because of the natural frivolity of youth work and the inculcation of duty were both more proper and rewarding that this cola should use such tricks to turn him away from righteousnessand i feared away from mecaused great anger as i knew how easy it was to do as well as i knew the difficulty of remaining unyielding when all my desire was to see a smile of pleasure on his face unlike cola though i would not buy his affection even more the way such devices were used to befuddle his senses concerned me as even at a distance i could see that matthews assurances about cola were wrongi knew already he was coming to england for oldenburg had told me so and the coup being planned was set for just after the time when he would arrive on our shores it was easy to forge the connection between the two and i realized that the time i had at my disposal was very much less than i anticipated i felt as though i was a novice playing a game of chess and that my opponents pieces were slowly moving across the board setting up an assault which when it came would be as irresistible as it was sudden on every occasion i thought that if only i had more information i could make sense of the whole business but every time that extra intelligence came into my hands it again proved insufficient i knew there was some plot and i knew approximately when it was to take place but although i knew its agent i did not know its object or its sponsors i may say that i found myself very lonely in my thoughts for i was being forced to consider great matters without the advice of others to temper my mind and hone my argument ultimately i decided i would have to present my case to someone else and thought carefully about whom i might choose i could not of course talk frankly to mr bennet as yet nor could i countenance an approach to another member of thurloes old intelligencing organization as their loyalties were entirely suspect indeed i felt entirely alone in a suspicious and dangerous world for there were few who were not potentially at least sympathetic to one side or the other accordingly i made an approach to robert boyle too abstracted of mind to be concerned with politics too noble of purpose to be seduced by faction and a man of the most notorious discretion in all matters i had and have still a high opinion of his ingenuity and piety although i must say i do not believe his achievement as great as his fame yet he was the best possible advocate of the new learning for faced with his ascetic nature his cautious endeavor and his profound devotion it was difficult for any man to accuse our society of harboring subversive or impious notions mr boyle who disguised i think a certain naïveté under the cloak of gravity believed that the new science would aid religion and that the fundamental truths of the bible would be confirmed by rational means i felt in contrast that this would hand a weapon of unparalleled power to the atheists since they would soon insist that god submit to the proofs of the scientist and if he could not be pinned to a theorem they would say they had proved he did not exist boyle was wrong but i admit it was with the best of reasons and this dispute between us never produced a breach in our friendship which if never warm was of great duration he was of the best family and had a balanced though weak constitution and sound education all these produced an excellent judgment which was never swayed by considerations of gain when i discovered him at his sisters house in london i asked him to visit and gave him a fine meal of oysters lamb partridge and pudding and then persuaded him to treat the conversation in the utmost confidence he listened silently as i laid outin greater detail than i originally plannedthe whole pattern of hint and suspicion which concerned me so greatly i am greatly flattered he said when i had done that you choose me for such confidence but i am not certain what you want of me i want your opinion i said i have certain evidence and i have a partial hypothesis which is in no way contradicted by any of it yet it is not confirmed either can you think of an alternative which fits as well if not better let me be clear you know this italian gentleman is connected both to radicals and to the spanish you know that he is coming to our shores next month those are your essential though not your only facts you believe that he is coming here to cause us harm that is your hypothesis you do not know what that harm might be i nodded so let us see if indeed there is an alternative which might supplant your main hypothesis let us start by proposing that cola is what he saysa young gentleman touring the world with no interest in politics he falls in with english radicals because he meets them by chance he knows high spaniards because he is a gentleman of quality from a wealthy venetian family he plans to come to england because he wishes to gain some knowledge of us he is in fact entirely harmless you leave out the secondary facts i said which bolster one proposal but weaken the other cola is the senior son of a trader in considerable difficulties his first obligation should be his family yet he is in the low countries spending money in idle amusements you need a good reason for such behavior which my thesis can absorb while yours cannot he had little or no reputation for curiosity until the moment he arrived in leiden but was known for his courage and bravado with arms in your thesis we must account for a remarkable change in character in mine we do not and you do not take account of the central matter which is that he was the recipient of a letter disguised in a code previously used by a traitor against the king innocent tourists of curiosity i think rarely receive such missives boyle nodded and accepted the counterargument very well he said i concede your hypothesis is the stronger and must take priority so i will attack your conclusion we grant that cola is in potential an imminent danger does that lead inevitably to the conclusion that this danger will be realized if i understand it rightly you have no idea or notion of what this man might do when he comes here what could one solitary individual accomplish that would pose such a danger he can say something do something or be a means of transmission i replied these are the only types of action which are possible any danger he poses must be contained in one of these three categories by transmission i mean he could bring a message or money or take either of these away i cannot think this is the case both the radicals and the spaniards have more than enough means of transporting anything they choose without making use of a man such as he similarly i cannot see what he might say that could pose any form of threat and which would require his presence in this country so that leaves deeds i ask you sir what deed can a single solitary man accomplish that would pose a danger to this kingdom if as seems reasonable his profession is of significance in determining his movements boyle looked at me but did not venture an answer you know as well as i i continued that the one thing a soldier does which others do not do is kill people and one man cannot kill many the fewer who die the more important they must be to make an impact i lay out this conversationin abridged form for we talked many hours on the matterto demonstrate that my fears were not the product of a mind suspicious of everyone and seeing dangers in mere shadows no other hypothesis fitted the case as exactly and so no other should be considered until it was discredited this is the rule of experiment and applies to politics as much as it does to mathematics or medicine i presented my argument to boyle and not only did he fail to come up with an alternative explanation he was forced to concede that my own hypothesis was by far the one which best fitted the available facts i did not believe i had reached certainty only a scholastic would claim such prowess but i could claim a probability more than strong enough to justify my concern strike at the body and the wound soon heals even though it may be a great gash strike only one small blow at the heart and the effect is catastrophic and the living breathing heart of the kingdom was the king one man indeed could bring all to ruin where an entire army would be ineffective lest this seem incredible and my fears fantastic i beg you consider the number of such murders in recent history only half a century before that great man henry iv of france was stabbed to death as were the prince of orange and henry ii before him under forty years ago the duke of buckingham was murdered by his own servant judicial murder had ended the lives of the earl of strafford archbishop laud and the blessed martyr charles i myself had encountered many plots to murder cromwell and even the lord chancellor in exile condoned the murder of the commonwealths ambassadors at the hague and madrid public life was steeped in blood and the murder of a king aroused no more repugnance in the breasts of many than did the slaughter of a domestic beast we had become inured to the most horrendous of sins and thought of them as instruments of policy i knew now that this plot i had detected was not the work of the fanatics whose role i suspected would be merely to take the blame for any atrocity committed for the benefit of others those others had to be the spanish and the ultimate aim would be to detach england from its freedoms and bring our country back into romish subjection kill the king and his brother an avowed catholic succeeds to the throne his first act is to swear vengeance on the assassins of his beloved charles he blames the fanatics and swears to extirpate them all moderation is thrown to the winds and the men of extremes take power once more the result would be war of course in which englishman would be pitted against englishman once more this time though it would be more terrible still for the catholics would call on their spanish masters for aid and the french would be bound to intervene the nightmare of all princes since elizabeth that this land should become the cockpit of europe was fearsomely close for this last speculation i had no direct evidence yet it was a reasonable projection from the evidence to hand for logic allows us to see the future or at least its likely development just as in mathematics when we can imagine a line and then imagine it projected out farther even to infinity through the exercise of rational thought so in politics we can consider actions and calculate consequences if my fundamental hypothesis was grantedand it stood up to boyles criticism as well as to my own dispassionate queryingthen certain results would follow i have laid out those possibilities to ensure my fears are understood i admit that i was wrong in detail and will at the appropriate moment lay out my errors pitilessly but nonetheless i claim the overall structure of my hypothesis was sound in that it was capable of accepting modification without having to be abandoned matthew would not i was sure make any more progress in the hague he had become foolish through colas attentions and could not see the evidence which i knew was in front of his eyes more i was concerned about him for he risked placing himself in peril and i desired him away from cola as swiftly as possible nor was this concern misplaced for the lord granted me the most frightening of dreams which proved my worries had foundation on the whole i do not greatly attend to such things and indeed i dream only rarely but this one was so clearly spiritual in origin and so clearly foresaw the future that even i resolved to take note though i had not yet received matthews letter about the feast yet it was in my vision and i later discovered that was the very night the feast took place for it was on olympus and matthew was servant to the gods who plied him with all manner of food and wine until he was drunk and silly then one man at the table whom i knew to be this cola though i did not know his face crept up and took him from behind plunging a sharp sword into his belly again and again until matthew cried out with the greatest of pain and i was in another room seeing it all but unable to move telling matthew to get away but he would not do so i woke up in great fear knowing that the greatest danger threatened i hoped matthew was safe and worried without end until i knew he was unharmed i thought cola was on the way to england but could do little to discover his whereabouts so meagre were my resources i also had to decide whether i should pass a warning to his majesty but decided against because i knew it would not be taken seriously he was a courageous not to say foolhardy man and had lived so long in the expectation of sudden murder that it no longer swerved him from his devotion to pleasure and what was i to say highness a plot exists to kill you so your own brother might take your place without proof such a statement would at the very least mean a swift end to my pensions and places i do not accept that the diagonal of a square is incommensurable with its sides because someone tells me i accept it because it can be demonstrated to be so and in this matter while i could advance a theory better than any other i could not yet demonstrate it a week later matthew returned to england and told me that marco da cola had indeed left the low countries and that he did not know where he had gone what was more the man had near a ten day start for matthew had been unable to find a boat which would take him to england for some days after this farewell feast of his and i suspect had so convinced himself of the mans harmlessness he had not hurried to return to my side disappointed and concerned though i was matthews very presence in the room lifted my heart the intelligent gaze which gave his face such beauty rekindled the warmth in me which was extinguished in his absence it was no surprise to me that cola had taken to him and kept him by his side i thanked god for his safe return and prayed that all my fears had been merely phantasms of a disordered and worried mind with no substance to them but i was swiftly disabused of that for when i chastised him for his laxness and told him he was most certainly in error about the italian for the first time in our acquaintanceship he refused to bow to my superiority and told me frankly i was wrong what do you know he asked you who have never met the man who have no proof but only suspicion i tell you i do know him have spent very many hours in the most pleasant conversation and he is no danger to you or any other man you are deceived matthew i replied you do not know what i know so tell me i will not these are high matters of state which are no concern of yours it is your duty to accept my word without question and not be deceived into thinking a man harmless because he pays you compliments and gives you presents you think he bought my affections you think me such a fool is that it because you never say a word to me except to criticize and whose only gift has been to beat me when i make a mistake i think you are young and inexperienced i said certain now that my worst fears had indeed been realized you must remember that i know what is best for you but i forgive you for your words i do not want your forgiveness i have done everything you asked of me and more it is you who accuse all men falsely who should ask forgiveness i was tempted to hit him but held myself back and instead made an attempt to end a discussion which was as foolish as it was inappropriate i will not justify myself to you except to say that when i can tell you everything i will do so and you will understand how wrong you are now come matthew my boy you are just arrived and we are fighting this is no way to begin come and take a drink and tell me of your adventures i truly wish to hear it all eventually he was calmed and reassured and sat beside me and bit by bit we resumed our habitual relation spending the next few hours in solitary and pleasant company he told me of his travels delighting me with his skill at observing and his ability to go to the heart of the matter without diversion although he said nothing of colas farewell and i found that i did not ask him in return i told him how i had passed the time in his absence of the books i had read explaining to him the importance of controversies and disputes in a way which i confess i had not done before he left me that evening and i thanked god in prayer for such a companion for without him my life was empty indeed but my heart was uneasy as for the first time i had failed to command him and had had to ask for his friendship he had given it but i did not know whether i could count on it forever i knew that before very long i would have to reimpose the correct order and remind him of his subservience lest he become arrogant the thought deadened my mood and then when i considered what he had told me i became more somber still i was sure that if not actually in england already then cola was on his way and was likely to arrive before i could pick up his trail again whatever the italian intended i hoped very much that he would not act swiftly the next morning i sent matthew back to his friends in east smithfield in the hope that they would have heard some news i did not expect much from this and was not greatly disappointed when he reported that they knew nothing but it was an obvious step to take and one of the few that i could take with ease then i went amongst my trader friends enquiring with as much subtlety as urgency allowed whether they knew of any boat which had brought a lone passenger to these shores italian spanish or french cola might well have passed himself off as any of these and many sailors would not have cared to tell the difference again my hopes were not high and again i learned nothing of interest it was not certain but i thought it likely he would have arrived by one of the lesser ports of east anglia and if he had spanish money at his disposal could well have come in a boat hired for the purpose at this point the resources i had at my disposal were exhausted i could of course write to every portmaster in east anglia although not without making my interest generally known receiving the replies could take up to a month and even then i would be unable to judge the usefulness of any information received not being personally acquainted with my correspondents what was i to do otherwise walk the streets of london in the hope of recognizing a man i had never seen and who was known to no one in this country sit in my study and hope that he made himself known to me before he executed his task neither option seemed sensible and with the very greatest reluctance i decided i would have to provoke some sort of reaction that would bring him to light or frighten him off it was a finely judged experiment which would only be successful if it produced a single result i was like an experimentalist who has his theory and conducts an experiment to confirm it i had not the luxury of the true philosopher who can perform his operations and construct his theory from the evidence of his eyes i pondered this matter for a day before concluding that had no alternative and as the opportunity offered i decided to throw hesitation aside the society was to hold a meeting at which many matters were to be discussed and the evening concluded by the public vivisection of a dog these are always popular and i fear that several operators conducted their experiments more to excite the pleasure of the audience than for any utility but many always wished to come guests were encouraged to spread the fame of our work and the company afterward was always merry and free i straightaway asked mr oldenburg if he would do me the favor of inviting señor de moledi as a guest of honor impressing on that gentleman that his presence would be warmly appreciated this de moledi was spains representative in england and a close associate of caracena the governor of the spanish netherlands and a man with a great hatred of all things english it was inconceivable he would be ignorant of any attempt on the king even though he would have been wise not to know too many details consequently if i was to stir the pot a little he was by far the best person to approach if my intervention worked and produced some practical response i might at last have the solid evidence i needed and would be finally in a position to lay out my suspicions with some hope of being believed the meeting that evening was a crowded one although the communications read out by mr oldenburg in his dull monotone scarcely deserved much attention one paper on the geometry of the parabola was as absurd as it was incomprehensible and my opinion was crucial in having it and its author rejected out of hand another by mr wren on the sundial was as usual with that fine man a model of lucidity and elegance but scarcely of major significance correspondence from abroad produced its usual crop of interest mixed in with bombast and faulty thinking the only matter of moment i recall and consulting the minutes of the meeting i see my memory serves me well was an excellent reading by mr hooke on his work with a microscope of his own devising however detestable that man was as an individual he was one of the finest artisans of our little group close in observation meticulous in recording his revelations of the entire worlds to be found in a simple drop of water astonished us all and produced an almost tearful commentary from mr goddard who praised the lord mightily for his creation and for his goodness in allowing his creatures to comprehend ever more of his works then prayers ended the formal session and those who had a mind to watched the experiment with the dog i could see from his expression that de moledi had as little taste for the bowlings of a tormented beast as i and so i approached him and said that no one would take it as an insult to the gathering if he did not attend for my part i also intended to absent myself and if he wished to take a glass of wine with me i would be honored by his company to this he assented and having already arranged the matter beforehand i led him through to the room wren maintained at gresham college where a good canary wine awaited us i hope sir you did not find the occupations of we men of curiosity distasteful i know that it must seem a strange interest and that some consider it impious we spoke in latin and i was pleased to find that his own fluency in that blessed tongue was no less than mine he seemed the most courteous of men and if most spaniards were like him i could see how a man like mr bennet who placed such store in the niceties of address might be seduced into loving the nation for my part i was safe from being deceived by such matters for i knew all too well what lay behind the fine manners on the contrary i found it eminently diverting and i very much hope that men of good curiosity from all over christendom will join together in free discourse there are many in spain as well who are interested in these matters and i would willingly introduce them to your society if you find that agreeable i accepted with pleasure and made certain i would remember to warn oldenburg of the danger spain is a country which had ruthlessly subjected all enquiry to persecution and for such a place as this to desire communication with us would have been laughable had it not been so cruel i must say i am glad to make your acquaintance dr wallis and even more pleased to have the opportunity of talking to you in private i have of course heard much of you you surprise me your excellency i do not know how my name has come to your ears i did not realize you took an interest in mathematics i take very little excellent pursuit though it no doubt is i have no head for figures at all that is a pity i have long believed the purity of mathematical reasoning is the finest training a man might have in which case i must own to my deficiencies for my great interest is canon law but i did not hear of you for your expertise in algebra rather for your skill in the comprehension of codes i am sure whatever you heard was greatly exaggerated i have few abilities in that line of work so great is your reputation as the finest man in the world that i was wondering whether you might share your knowledge with whom with all men of good will who wish to bring the darkness into light and ensure the peace of all christendom you mean i should write a book about it maybe you should he said with a smile but that would be a long operation and bring you little reward more i wondered whether you might travel to brussels and give instruction to some young men of my acquaintance who would prove i am sure to be some of the finest pupils you have ever had naturally this labor would be well rewarded the audacity of the man was astonishing he slipped so easily and readily into the suggestion it fell from his lips so normally that i did not even feel resentment at the proposal there was of course not the slightest chance of my even considering the offer perhaps he knew that in my life i have had many such proposals i have turned them all down even good protestant states i have declined to aid in any way at all most recently rejecting a hint that i should instruct mr leibniz in my art i have always been determined that my skill should be my countrys alone and should not be available to any who might become an antagonist your offer is as generous as my worth is small i replied but i fear my university duties are such that i would never be allowed leave to travel a great pity he replied with no trace at all of surprise or disappointment if your circumstances ever change the offer will undoubtedly be renewed as you have done me a great honor i feel obliged to repay your kindness instantly i said for i must tell you that a plot is afoot by your enemies to besmirch your reputation by spreading the most scurrilous rumors and this comes from your work does it it comes from different places i know many people of high standing and converse frequently with them let me tell you frankly sir that i feel strongly you should be allowed to defend yourself against idle tittletattle you have not been in this country long enough to understand the power of gossip in a country so illused to the discipline of strong and firm government i am grateful for your concern tell me then what is this gossip i should concern myself with it is said that you are no friends of our monarch and that should misfortune befall him people would not have to look far to find the source of his troubles de moledi nodded at these words slander indeed he said for it is known that our love for your king is complete did we not aid him in his exile when he was cast out and penniless provide him and his friends with a home and money risk war with cromwell because we would not abandon our obligations to him few people i replied remember past goodness it is in the nature of mankind to think the worst of their fellows and does a man such as yourself harbor such suspicions i cannot believe that any man of honor could intend harm to a man so manifestly loved by god i said that is true the great difficulty with lies is that they are hard to contradict especially when others spread them with malicious intent they must be contradicted i said if i may speak plainly he gave his assent your interest at court and your friends there will be hurt by these stories if they are allowed to go unchecked and you wish to assist me forgive me for saying so but i did not expect such a kindness from a man such as you whose opinions are well known i freely admit i have no great love for your country many men within it i honor deeply but your interests and ours must ever be in conflict i can say the same for france however the wellbeing of england must always lie in ensuring that no foreign country ever attains a predominant position amongst us that has been the policy of the wisest of our princes for generations and must continue when france is strong we must look to the habsburgs when the habsburgs are strong we should bolster france and do you speak for mr bennet as well i speak for no man but myself i am a mathematician a priest and an englishman but i am sure you know the admiration mr bennet has for your country his position also will not be aided by such talk de moledi stood up and bowed graciously i understand well that you are the sort of man to whom thanks should only be offered in words and so in words alone do i offer them i will say only that a different man would go from this room very much the richer for his kindness i wrapped up my warning to de moledi in no bad advice and as was my continual habit before my failing eyes made the practice impossible i wrote down a short account of my meeting with him to aid my memory i have the note still and i see that the counsel i gave was practical and wise i had little expectation that it would be taken however the state is like a large ship with a numerous crew once set on a course it is difficult to change tack with any speed even when such an alteration is manifestly sensible de moledis response to my conversation was swift however far faster and more determined than i had anticipated the following evening one of mr bennets men came to my house and handed me a letter which informed me that my presence was urgently required his standing had increased grandly since our previous meeting and he wished all to know of his power as secretary of state for the south it is unwise even now to compare any man unfavorably with cromwell but there was a simplicity about that great bad man which was far more impressive for being totally unpracticed and unfeigned for cromwell truly was a great man the greatest i believe this country has ever known his clarity of mind his strength and certainty were such that born to a gentlemans estate he made himself a kingdom had he been born to a kingdom he would have made himself an empire he reduced three nations which perfectly hated him to entire obedience governed by an army which wished his ruin and inspired fear across a continent and beyond he held the country in his palm yet would often greet a visitor himself and pour wine with his own hands he had no need of display for there was no mistaking his authority i said this once to lord clarendon and he agreed with my account mr bennet was a lesser man with smaller genius all of his worth could have fitted into cromwells thumbnail and yet what pomp he had adopted the progression through the antechambers had increased to positively spanish proportions and the obsequious behavior of the servants had grown to such an extent that it was hard for a simple man such as myself to repress a certain sense of disgust at the display it took a full fifteen minutes to make my way from the entrance to his chambers into his presence king louis in all his present magnificence i think cannot be more difficult to approach than was mr bennet then it was all for show and in conversation he was as english as he was spanish in manners indeed his bluntness came close to discourtesy and he kept me standing throughout the interview what exactly do you think you are doing dr wallis he shouted waving a piece of paper at me too far away for me to see are you mad that you disobey my express orders i told him i did not understand the question i have here a strongly worded note he said breathing heavily that i might feel see and hear his anger all at the same time from a very indignant spanish ambassador is it true that you had the presumption yesterday evening to lecture him on the peace of christendom and tell him how his countrys foreign policy should be run it most certainly is not i replied my curiosity at this turn of events was overcoming my alarm at the evident anger my patron was demonstrating i knew mr bennet well enough to know that he lost his temper very rarely for he believed firmly that such demonstrations were inappropriate in a gentleman false shows of rage were not tactics he used to overawe his clients and i came to the conclusion that on this occasion he was perfectly sincere and genuinely furious this of course made my own situation the more perilous since he was not a man whose favor i could afford to lose but it also made the conversation more interesting as i could not easily understand the source of his fury how do you explain the offense you have given him then bennet continued i do not know what the offense is i conversedi thought most pleasantlywith señor de moledi yesterday evening and we parted with mutual expressions of regard it may be that i angered him by refusing a large bribe i do not know i thought i had turned down the offer with the greatest of tact might i ask what is the complaint he says you all but accused him of fomenting a plot to kill the king is that true it is not i never mentioned any such thing nor would i ever have dreamed of doing so what do you think you said i merely told him that it was strongly held by many that his country wished england no good it was not an important part of the conversation but it was cautiously said bennet said you say nothing without deliberation so now i want to know why your reports to me in the last few months have been so obviously full of halftruths and evasions that i am beginning to tire of them now i command you to tell me the exact truth and i warn you that if i am not satisfied of your total candor i will be highly displeased faced with such an ultimatum i could do no other and it was the greatest mistake that ever i made i do not blame mr bennet i blame myself for my weakness and i know that the punishment meted out to me for my error was so crushing a burden that i have suffered for it every day of my life since i am graced in that i come from a hardy longliving family on both my mothers and my fathers sides and i live in full expectation of continuing in this world for many years yet on innumerable occasions since that day i have prayed that this blessing be taken from me so great is the remorse i suffer i told mr bennet of my suspicions in full and i now believe in greater detail than i needed provide i told him of marco da cola and the threads of suspicion that had attached themselves to him i told him of my understanding that he was if not already here then on his way to this country and i told him of what i believed he planned to do when he arrived bennet listened at first impatiently then with becoming gravity to my account and when i had finished he got up and stared for many minutes out of the window of the little chamber where he habitually carried on his business eventually he turned to face me and i could see from his expression that the anger had passed i was not however to escape further reproof i must commend you he said for the diligence your love of his majesty has produced i do not doubt for a minute that you have acted with the very best of intentions and that your desire was simply and wholly the safety of the realm you are a most excellent servant i thank you but in this matter you have made a serious error you must know that in diplomacy nothing is ever as it seems and what may appear as common sense is often the opposite we cannot go to war who should we fight the spanish the french the dutch all together or in combination and with what are we meant to pay an army parliament will barely provide to keep a roof over the kings head as it is you know i am sure that i am partial to the spanish that i regard the french as our greatest enemy even so i will not countenance an alliance with them any more than i could support a pact against them for the foreseeable future at least we must steer a delicate course between these obstacles and allow nothing to push the king into the arms of one side or the other but you know as well sir i said that spanish agents are operating freely spending their gold to buy support of course they are and so are the french and the dutch what of it as long as all spend with the same enthusiasm and none gains the upper hand then no harm is done your comments in themselves do little harm please do not think that but if your suspicions become generally known then the french interest will be strengthened young louis has deep coffers his majesty is tempted already even though it would be a disaster it is imperative that nothing disturbs the balance which those who have the interest of the country at heart have created now tell me does anyone else know of this suspicion you have absolutely not i said i am the only person with a full knowledge of it my servant matthew no doubt has some understanding since he is an intelligent boy but even he does not know the full story and he is where he is now back in england but you need have no fears about him he is totally bound to me good talk to him and make sure he understands i am happy to obey your wishes in this matter i continued but i must repeat that as far as i can see the matter is a serious one nonetheless with the sanction of the spanish crown or not this man is coming to the country and i believe him to be very dangerous to us what am i to do about it surely you do not think that he should be left in peace bennet smiled i do not think you need have any concern on that score sir he said this is not the only tale of conspiracy and i have finally persuaded his majesty to increase the guard around him night and day i see no chance of even the most desperate of assassins reaching him this is no ordinary soldier sir i said he had a reputation for daring and ruthless murders against the turks on crete he must not be underestimated i understand your concerns bennet replied but i must point out that if you are correctand i do not accept that you are sothe comments you made to de moledi will have been noted he will take the greatest of care to make sure nothing occurs which thrusts us into the arms of his greatest enemy an alliance with france would surely follow any such event for this scheme could only work if its true author never became known and you have ensured that that cannot be there the interview ended i left with my position badly but not irrevocably weakened i had not lost his favor and certainly had not been threatened with any sanction far more important was the fact that my confidence was shaken i had not anticipated de moledis reaction he had indeed behaved as an innocent might well do in the circumstances with surprise and protest and what mr bennet said was true an assassination of the king now made no sense if its sole achievement was to deliver england into the hands of the french i did not realize although i was beginning to suspect that my conclusions were based on faulty propositions this required more and more terrible evidence before all doubts were swept away i never discovered precisely when marco da cola arrived in england or by what means although i am certain he had already stepped ashore before i spoke to the spanish ambassador this belief was later confirmed by jack prestcott when i interrogated him by the third week of march cola was in london and i assume he was warned that something of his purpose had become known to me he must also have learned that matthew was my servant and that the lad also knew much that was dangerous i saw matthew that morning he came to my house in the greatest of hurry his face flushed with achievement to say that he had found cola in london and planned to go and see him instantly i knew i had to prevent any such encounter you will not i said i forbid it his face fell then turned dark with anger an expression i had never before seen on him at once all my fears returned after i had successfully kept them at bay hoping that all would be well once more now he was back by my side why what nonsense is this you look for this man and when i find him for you you forbid me to discover where exactly he is he is a killer matthew a very dangerous man indeed matthew laughed in the lighthearted way he had which had once given me such pleasure but did so no longer i do not think an italian holds much danger for a child of london he said certainly not this one oh but he does you know the streets and the alleys and all the ways across the town far better than he but do not underrate him promise me you will leave him be his laughter faded and i could see i had wounded him once more is that it or do you want to deny me a friend who might do me good who might patronize me freely without requiring so much in return who listens to me and values my opinions instead of forever criticizing and imposing his own i tell you doctor this man was kind and good to me he did not beat me and always behaved well stop it i cried anguished that i should be compared to another in such a cruel way and have this colas success thrust at me merely to wound my heart it is true what i say you must not go near him i cannot bear the thought of him touching you hurting you in any way i wish to protect you i can look after myself and i will show you that i can i have known thieves and murderers and fanatics since the day i was born yet here i am unscratched and unharmed and you think nothing of this and talk to me as though i were a child you owe me a great deal i said angry with his anger and wounded by his words and i will have your respect and courtesy but you will not give it as i also deserve you never have that is enough get out of my room and come back when you are ready to apologize i know why you wish to see him i know what he is and what he wants of you i see it better than you can why else would a man like him keep a boy like you by his side do you think it is for your wit you have little your money you have none your learning you have what i gave you your breeding i picked you up from the gutter i tell you if you go to him tonight i will not have you in this house again do you understand i had never threatened him so before and had not intended to do so then but he was fast slipping from my grasp the temptation of dissoluteness was growing on him encouraged by this man and it had to be stopped immediately he had to know i commanded and was his master otherwise he would have been quite lost but it was too late i had delayed too long and the corruption had already gone too deep still i thought he would have asked my pardon and realized his error as he had been prepared to do so recently in the past but he stared at me not knowing whether i was serious or not and seeing that gaze i weakened and spoiled all matthew i said my boy come to me for the first time in my life but god help me not for the first time in my dreams i took him in my arms and held him tightly to me hoping to feel the softness of his response instead matthew stiffened then pushed his arms hard against my chest and broke away stumbling backward in his haste to part from me leave me be he said in a hushed voice you cannot command me nor forbid me anything it is not me who has done wrong here and not this italian who keeps me for impure reasons i think and he walked out leaving me to bitter anger and the sadness of regret i never saw matthew alive again that same evening marco da cola coldbloodedly cut his throat in a dark alley and left him to bleed to death even now i can hardly bear to recall the details of the day i learned that no amends would ever be made my housekeepers husband i had allowed the woman to marry the previous year and had such a regard for her honesty that i did not see fit to throw her out came himself to gresham college where i was dining with mr wren to tell me of the calamity he was a big slow stupid man fearful of my wrath but courageous enough to bring the bad news himself he trembled as he stood there before me and told me what had happened with some resource he had gone to the scene itself when the news came and asked those who lived nearby what had transpired it appeared there had been a murderous assault a few hours previously matthew had been attacked from behind his mouth covered and his throat slit with a single cut there had been no noise no sound of any shouting none of the normal commotion that signifies a struggle or a robbery in progress the culprit was not seen by anyone and matthew was left to die it was not a duel not a fight of honor he was not given the chance to die in the knowledge at least of having acted as a man should it was pure and simple murder carried out in the most despicable manner my dream had warned me and i had let it happen nonetheless i see from colas memoirs he even has the audacity still to indicate his crime although he pretends it was selfdefense he says he was set on by bravoes who he claims he thought were sent by the former associate of his father with what nobility and courage did he defend himself against such bloodthirsty rogues with what modesty does he recount how all alone he sent them packing he does not say of course that his assailant was but a boy of nineteen who never fought a man in his life and who certainly intended him no harm he does not say that he followed the boy and deliberately set upon him leaving him no chance of defending himself he omits to say that he committed this one crime that he might be free to commit still greater ones later and he does not say that he extinguished the light of my life by that deed cast all into darkness and ended all joy forever matthews death rested on my shoulders for my mistrust excited him to bravado and it mattered not that i suffered most from the mistake such a glory to god my absalom my clay which i had fashioned myself into the finest of creation would to god i had died for thee my son my son samuel his obedience matched his piety his piety his loyalty and his loyalty his beauty i had imagined growing old with him by my side to comfort me as no woman ever could he alone made the day bright and the morning glow with hope such love had saul for david and i wept at the bitterness of my punishment he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me matthew how often had i read those words without understanding the burden they lay on all mankind for i had never loved any man or woman before and the lesson was swift and harsh and i rebelled against it i begged the almighty it should not be that my servant was wrong that another had died in his place and i knew the cruelty of desiring that another suffer instead of me that another father should grieve for me our lord had accepted his cross but even he had prayed the burden might be taken from him and so i prayed as well and the lord told me i had loved the boy too much and made me remember those nights when he had slept in my bed while i lay awake listening to his breathing wishing only to reach out and touch him and i remember how i begged deliverance from my desires and also wished them fulfilled this was my punishment so fully deserved i thought i would die under the pain of it and never recover from the loss and in my heart my anger grew fierce and cold for i knew also that it was marco da cola who had tempted my dearest boy away from me and seduced him so he would not notice as the knife slipped from its scabbard i asked that god should say to me as he had to david i will deliver thine enemy into thine hand that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee samuel i vowed that this colas brutality would undo him it is writtenwhoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed genesis i give thanks that i allow no man to see my emotions and that i have ever had a deep sense of duty for it was only that which forced me to rise and rededicate myself to my purpose and so i prayed then forced myself once more to my task a harder deed i have never done for i maintained always my habitual demeanor which men call coldness while all the time my very heart was bleeding with grief i will add no more of this matter it is properly for no mans ears but i will say that from then on i had one purpose in mind one aim and one desire and that stayed with me in my dreams and every second of my waking day i abandoned all desire to show my superiority by deciphering that which defeated all others books by livy letters to cola now become mere links in my great evidential chaini knew of them already and did not need to hold the one in my hand or comprehend the precise meaning of the other they had served their purpose and i had a more urgent task before me than the solution of intellectual puzzles matthew had said he did not believe that he was suspected by cola in the low countries had the italian done so the boy would surely have died before ever he set foot on english soil it was accordingly clear that cola had discovered this in london and thus also certain that the information had reached him because i had told mr bennet of my suspicions and named matthew as one privy to them i should have known that there is no such thing as a discreet courtier nor can any man keep a secret in whitehall so i resolved that i would no more inform mr bennet of my progressnot only did i not want loose talk to warn cola further i also wished to stay alive myself and knew that if the italian had slaughtered matthew because of the little he knew then how could he avoid making a similar attempt on my life nonetheless it was no surprise to me at all when i heard that a young gentleman of curiosity had arrived in oxford and had expressed the intention of staying some time but it was a considerable surprise when virtually his first move was to establish contact with the blundy family here i must pause and give an account of that family since colas own narrative is not to be believed in any particular and it is obvious that if prestcott touches on the subject in his scribblings then he will give nothing but a wildly misguided account he formed some strange fascination for the girl and was convinced she intended him harm although how she could have accomplished this feat i do not pretend to understand nor was it necessarysince prestcott seemed intent on doing himself so much harm there was little point in anyone else adding to it i knew of edmund blundys reputation as an agitator in the army and heard he had died equally i was naturally aware that his wife had settled in oxford along with her daughter through my informers i kept watch on them for a while but on the whole let them beif they kept within the law then i saw no reason to persecute them even though their dissent in matters of religion was blatant as i hope i have made clear my concern was the good ordering of society and i had little interest in quibbling as long as an outward show of conformity was maintained i know that many some people for whom i have a high regard in other matters such as mr locke hold to the doctrine of toleration i disagree most strongly if that is taken to mean worship outside the body of the established church a state can no more survive without general unity in religion than it can without common purpose in government for to deny the church is ultimately to deny all civil authority it is for this reason i support the virtuous mediocrity which the anglican settlement observes between the meretricious gaudiness of rome and squalid sluttery of the fanatical conventicles with the blundys mother and daughter i was pleased to see that the lesson inflicted on them by the failure of their aspirations was learned although i knew that they kept up contact with all manner of radical acquaintance in oxford and in abingdon their personal behavior gave little cause for concern once every three months they attended church and if they sat resolutely and stonyfaced at the back refusing to sing and standing only reluctantly that did not concern me they signified their obedience and their acquiescence was a lesson to all who might have contemplated defiance for if even the woman who had once directed the fire of soldiers on royalist troops at the great siege of gloucester no longer had the will to resist then why should less fiery folk do otherwise few people know of this tale nowadays i mention it here partly because it illustrates the character of these people and partly because it deserves to be recorded the sort of anecdote indeed in which a man like mr wood takes such delight ned blundy was already in the service of parliament at that stage and his wife followed him with all the other soldiers women that her man might be fed and clothed in decency on the march he was part of edward masseys troop and was in gloucester when king charles laid siege many know of that fierce encounter in which the resolution of one side was met by the determination of the other and neither lacked anything in courage the advantage was with the king for the towns defenses were slight and illprepared but his majesty as was usual with a prince ever more noble than wise failed to move with the necessary speed the parliamentarians began to hope that a little more endurance on their part would enable the relieving army to come to their assistance persuading the citizenry and the ordinary soldiers of this was not an easy task the more so as the officers bravery depleted their ranks leaving many platoons and companies headless on the occasion i refer to a company of royalist soldiers attempted to break through one of the weaker sections of the towns defenses knowing that the soldiers defending it were disheartened and irresolute indeed it seemed initially that the bold assault would be successful for many gained the walls and the discouraged defenders began to pull back within minutes the wall would be theirs and the entire besieging army would pour over then the woman of the tale stepped forward girded her petticoat into her belt and picked up the pistol and sword of a fallen soldier follow or i die alone she is said to have shouted and charged into the mob of attackers hacking and cutting all around so ashamed were the parliamentarians at having their cowardice exposed by a mere woman and so commanding was the tone of their new leader that they reformed themselves and charged also they refused to give any further ground and the ferocity of their assault forced the royalists back as the attackers made their way to their lines once more the woman formed the defenders into a line and directed fire into their backs until the very last musket ball had been used up as i have said this was edmund blundys woman anne who already had a reputation for bloodcurdling ferocity i do not necessarily believe that she bared her breasts before charging into the royalist ranks so that they would be less able to strike at her through gallantry but it is certainly possible and would be quite appropriate to the reputation she established for immodesty and violence such was this woman who i believe was more violent in temper and deed than was her husband she laid claim to being a wise woman saying her mother had such power and her mothers mother before her she even intervened to make speeches at soldiers gatherings exciting awe and derision in equal part she it was i believe who incited her husband onto ever more dangerous criminal belief for she utterly scorned all authority unless she chose willingly to accept it a husband she maintained should have no more authority over a wife than a wife over a husband i have no doubt that she would eventually have claimed that man and donkey should live in equal partnership as well and it was certainly true that neither she nor her daughter had renounced such beliefs while most grudgingly or with enthusiasm set aside old opinions when times changed and the king returned some persisted in error despite the manifest withdrawal of divine favor these were the people who saw the return of the king as gods test of their belief a brief hiatus before the coming of king jesus and the establishment of his thousandyear rule or they saw the restoration as a sign of gods displeasure and an incentive to become ever more fanatical to win back his approval or they spurned god and all his works bemoaning the turn of events and sank into the lassitude of greed disappointed anne blundys exact beliefs i never fathomed and indeed had no interest in doing so all that counted for me was that she remained quiescent and in this she seemed more than willing to oblige i did however once question mr wood on the matter for i was aware that his mother employed the girl in their house as a general workall you know of her background i imagine i asked him her parentage and her beliefs oh yes he said i know what they were and i know what they are now why do you ask i have an affection for you young man and i would not wish your family or your mother to be besmirched i am grateful for the attention but you need have no fear the girl is in perfect conformity with all the laws and is so dutiful that i do not believe i have ever heard her express a single opinion except when his majesty returned when her eyes filled with tears of perfect joy you may rest assured that this must be so for my mother will scarcely have even a presbyterian in the house and the mother i have met the woman only a few times and found her quite unremarkable she has scraped together enough money for a washing house and works hard for her living i think her only concern is to put by enough money for her daughter to have a dowry and this is sarahs main concern as well again i know something of her reputation through my researches but i believe the madness of faction has left her as entirely as it has left the country as a whole i did not completely take mr woods word since i had my doubts about his ability to see deeply into such matters but his report settled my mind and i gladly turned to more interesting quarry occasionally i took note that the daughter would travel to abingdon or banbury or burford that men of doubtful loyaltysuch as the irish magus i mentioned earlierwould visit their little cottage nonetheless i had few worries they seemed determined to abandon their previous desire to remake england in their own image and appeared content simply to make as much money as their positions and abilities would allow to that laudable aim i could not object and i paid them little attention until marco da cola went straight to their cottage on the pretext of treating the old woman for her injury i have naturally read his words on this subject with the greatest of care and am almost admiring at the consummate skill with which he makes all out to be innocent and charitable his technique i note is to tell something of the truth in everything but wrap each little fragment of veracity in layer upon layer of falsity it is hard to imagine a man would take such trouble and if i did not know the truth of the matter i would undoubtedly be convinced of the genuineness of his candor and the extent of his generosity but look at the matter from a wider perspective with the benefit of more information than mr cola is willing to provide conversant with radical circles in the low countries he comes to oxford and within hours makes the acquaintance of the family who knows more such people than anyone else in the county even though they are far outside his social sphere he visits them three or four times a day and is more attendant than a real physician would be with even the wealthiest of clients no man of sense or reason acts in such a way and it is a tribute to mr colas tale that on reading it such absurd and unlikely behavior seems perfectly comprehensible once mr boyle told me he had also gravitated into the society of the high street philosophers i knew that at last i had some possibility of learning more about the mans movements and thoughts i hope you do not mind that i took him under my wing in this way boyle said when he mentioned it to me but your account was so fascinating that when the man himself appeared in the coffee house i could not resist examining him myself and i must say i think you are entirely wrong about him you did not dissent from my argument but it was an easy speculation based on abstraction now that i have met him i do not concur we must always take character into account surely for that is the surest guide to a mans soul and therefore to his intentions and deeds i see nothing in his character which would coincide with your speculations about his motives quite the reverse but he is cunning and you are trusting you might as soon say a fox is harmless to a hen because it approaches gently and softly it is only dangerous when it strikes men are not foxes dr wallis and nor am i a hen you admit the possibility of error though of course and boyle smiled in that thin and arrogant way of his which indicated his difficulty in even conceiving of the notion so you see the wisdom nonetheless of keeping an eye on him boyle frowned with displeasure at the idea i will do no such thing i am happy to oblige you in many ways but i will not play informer i know you occupy yourself in such a fashion but i do not wish to be involved in any way it is a base and shabby trade you profess dr wallis i greatly respect your delicacy i said ruffled at his words as he rarely expressed himself with such force but sometimes the safety of the kingdom cannot afford such a fastidious approach the kingdom cannot afford to be cheapened by squalid activities among men of honor either you should take care doctor you wish to guard the integrity of good society yet you use the habits of the gutter to do so i would like to reason men into good behavior i replied but they seem remarkably impervious to such persuasion just be careful you do not harry men too much and push them into unreasonable behavior they would not ordinarily countenance it is a risk you know i would normally agree but i have told you of mr cola and you agreed that my fears are reasonable and i have more than enough wounds of my own now to be sure of the danger this man poses boyle expressed his sympathies for matthews death and gave me words of comfort he was the most generous of men and was willing to risk a rebuff by intimating that he was aware of the magnitude of my loss i was grateful to him but could not allow his words on christian resignation to deflect me from my aim you will pursue this man to the end but you have no certainty that he did kill your servant matthew was following him closely he is here to commit a crime and is a known killer you are right i have no absolute proof for i did not see the deed nor did anyone else i defy you however to assert with any reason he is not responsible perhaps so replied boyle but in my case i will not condemn until i have more certainty take my warning doctor be sure your anger does not obscure your vision and drag you down to his level mine eye affecteth mine heart it says in lamentations make sure the reverse does not become too true he stood up to go at least if you will not help i trust you have no objection to my approaching mr lower i said angered at the lofty way he could dismiss matters of such importance that is between you and him although he is careful of his friends and quick to take offense on their behalf i doubt he will assist if he knows what you want as he is greatly taken with the italian and prides himself on his good judgment of men thus forewarned i asked the doctor to see me the next day i had some regard for lower at that time he affected a frivolous and carefree manner but even a man less acute than myself could see that he had a burning desire for fame and craved worldly success more than anything else i knew that staying in oxford cutting up his beasts and playing the assistant would not satisfy him forever he wanted recognition for his work and a place with the greatest of the experimentalists and he knew as well as any that to stand a chance in london he would need luck and some very good friends indeed this was his weak spot and my opportunity i summoned him on the pretext of asking his advice about my health there was nothing wrong with me then and apart from a weakness about my eyes nothing wrong with me now either nonetheless i affected a pain in my arm and submitted to an examination he was a good physicianunlike many of those quacks who intone ponderously come up with some complex diagnosis and prescribe an expensive and fatuous remedy lower confessed himself quite bemused and said he didnt think there was really anything the matter with me he recommended resta cheap enough remedy it must be said but one which i could not afford even had it been needed i understand that you have made the acquaintance of a man called cola is that right i asked him when we had settled down and i had given him a glass of wine for his trouble taken him under your wing in fact i have indeed sir signor cola is a gentleman and a subtle philosopher boyle finds him very useful he is a man of charm and knowledge and his thoughts on blood are fascinating you greatly relieve me i said for i have a high opinion of your judgment in these matters why do you need relieving you dont know him do you not at all think nothing more on the subject i have always taken it as a principle to doubt the word of foreign correspondents certainly when their opinion is in contestation with that of an englishman i set them aside with pleasure i gladly forget the tales i have heard lower frowned what tale is this sylvius penned a very favorable portrait of him im sure im sure i said and no doubt accurate as far as he could see we must always take men as we find them must we not and assess contradictory reports in the light of our own experience but the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison james somebody says something evil about him come sir be frank with me i know you are too good a man to calumnize but if malicious reports are being spread it is best the subject of them know so he can defend himself you are right of course and my only hesitation is that the report is so weak that it is scarcely worth giving it any attention i have no doubt in my mind that it is utterly false certainly it is difficult to believe that a gentleman could act in such a coarse fashion which coarse fashion is this it concerns signor colas days at padua a mathematician there with whom i have correspondence mentioned the matter he is known to mr oldenburg of our society and i can vouch for his good faith he said merely that there had been a duel it seems that one man had conducted some ingenious experiments on blood and had told all about them to this cola cola then claimed the experiments as his own when called to acknowledge the true author he issued a challenge fortunately the fight was stopped by the authorities these misunderstandings do happen lower said thoughtfully they do of course i agreed heartily and it may well be that your friend was entirely in the right as he is your friend indeed i expect that he was some people are greedy for fame though i am glad philosophy is usually so free of such impositions to suspect ones friends and mind ones words lest they steal the glory that is rightfully ones own would be intolerable although as long as the discovery is made what does it matter who is credited with it we do not conduct ourselves for fame after all we are doing gods work and he will know the truth of the matter what should we care then for the opinions of others lower nodded so firmly that i could see i had successfully put him on his guard besides i carried on nobody would be so foolish as to enter a dispute with someone like boyle for who would believe his claims against the word of such a man it is only those whose reputation is not well established who are vulnerable so there is no problem even if cola is as my correspondent described my reasoning in talking thus to lower was entirely honorable even if it involved a deception i could not tell him of my real concerns but it was vital that cola should not have liberty to practice his deceit by exploiting lowers trust he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul ezekiel by exciting lowers concern over colas probity i had made him more likely to discover the mans duplicity where it truly lay i persuaded him not to mention the matter for i told him that if the report were true no good would come of it and if it were false it would merely create an enmity where none should exist he left me a more sober man more distrustful than he had been when he arrived and that also was a goodness it was unfortunate however that his lack of control so nearly frightened cola awayhe was too open to dissemble and colas manuscript shows all too well how easily his doubts and worries bubbled to the surface in anger and harshness during the conversation lower also mentioned that cola had accompanied him to visit jack prestcott in his jail cell that the italian had willingly provided the boy with wine and it appeared returned to deliver it in person spending a good long while in his cell conversing with him this was another curiosity which had to be examined with care cola was a venetian and sir james had served that country and perhaps he was merely showing consideration for the son of a man who had served his country well the other link was the copy of livy for sir james had encoded a letter using it in and cola had received one disguised with the same book three years later i could not fathom it at all so realized i would have to interview young prestcott againand this time thought i would get the truth from him as his current situation left him little scope for being difficult with me i may say that i was beginning to have some doubts about my understanding of colas aims for his actions did not correspond with what i assumed he intended to accomplish i was not i repeat again at all dogmatic in my belief the conclusions i reached derived from fair principles and a reasoned unprejudiced comprehension to put it simply it was borne in on me that if he desired to strike against the king who now divided his time between whitehall tunbridge and the racecourses at newbury then oxford was a strange place to be living and yet here cola was and showing no signs whatsoever of moving away it was for this reason that when dr grove informed me the italian was to dine in college that day i overcame my repugnance and concluded that i must be present so i could see and hear the man for myself perhaps here i should sketch a character of dr grove for his end was tragic and he was along with warden woodward the only fellow of new college for whom i had any regard that we had nothing in common apart from holy orders is certainly true the merits of the new philosophy had entirely escaped him and he was also even more severe than i in his belief in the necessity for total conformity in the church for all that he was nonetheless a man of kindly disposition whose ferocity of policy lay oddly with his generosity of spirit he had no cause to love me for i represented everything he detested yet he sought out my acquaintanceshiphis principles were of a general nature and in no way affected his judgment of individuals apart from being a divine he thought of himself as a private astronomer although nothing had ever been published and i am sorry to say nothing ever was even had he lived i suspect that the fruit of his labors would never have seen the light of the day for grove was so modest of his skills and so unconcerned with public acclaim that he believed publishing both arrogant and presumptuous rather he was one of that everrarer breed of man who honor god and university in modest silence believing learning to be its own reward he had returned to his university when the king had returned to his throne and he now wished to leave and take up a living of his own in the country when the next one came available the chances of him doing so were good for against him was ranged merely the paltry and youthful figure of thomas ken whose claim appealed to some simply because they wished to rid themselves of a dreary presence in the college in some ways his imminent departure saddened me for groves company i found strangely conducive i would not say we were friends that would be going too far and certainly he had a manner of address that was easily found objectionable by those who did not perceive the goodness within groves weakness was a quick tongue and a barbed wit which he had never mastered he was a man of contradiction and his conversation could never be taken for granted he could be the kindest of men or the most waspish he had indeed perfected the technique of being both at the same time it was grove who invited me to lodge at new college when building works made my home uninhabitable death and a delayed election to a fellowship had created a vacancy in a room and the college as was its practice had decided to rent the space out until a new fellow staked a claim i had never before enjoyed the common life even as an undergraduate myself and was more than content to put it behind me when i gained my first preferment as a professor of course i was entitled to marry and keep my own home and so it was near twenty years since i had lived cheekbyjowl with others i found the experience strangely entertaining and the solitude of my own room suitable for work i even regretted my youth and wished again for that irresponsibility when all is still to be done and nothing is certain but the feeling soon passed and by this time the appeal of new college was waning fast apart from grove all the fellows were of low quality many were corrupt and most inattentive to their duties i withdrew more and more and spent as little time as possible in their midst grove was my companion on many evenings for he took to knocking on my door in his desire of discussion i did my best to discourage him at first but he was not easily put off and eventually i found that i almost welcomed the disturbance for it was impossible to brood overmuch when he was there and the disputes we had were of high quality even though we were often sadly mismatched grove had trained himself in scholastic disputation which i had done my best to shake off as constricting the imagination and as i endeavored to point out to him the new philosophy simply cannot be expressed in terms of the definitions and axioms and theorems and antitheses and all the other apparatus of fonnal aristotelianism for grove this was fraud and deceit as he held as a matter of doctrine that the beauties and subtleties of logic contained all possibilities and that if a case could not be argued through its forms then that proved the flaw of the case i am sure you will find mr cola an interesting disputant i said when he told me that the italian would sup that same evening i gather from mr lower that he is a great enthusiast for experiment whether he will understand your sense of humor i cannot predict i think i will dine in myself to see what results grove beamed with pleasure and i remember him wiping his red inflamed eye with a cloth splendid he said we can make up a threesome and maybe drink a bottle together afterward and have a real discussion i will order one i hope to have great sport with him as lord maynard is dining and i wish to show my skills in dispute lord maynard will then know what sort of person will be taking his living i hope this cola does not take offense at being used in such a fashion im sure he will not even notice besides he has a charming manner and is perfectly respectful quite unlike the reputation of italians i must say since i have always heard it said they are fawning and obsequious i understand he is venetian i said they are said to be as cold as their canals and as secretive as the doges dungeons i did not find him so muddleheaded and with all the errors of youth no doubt but far from cold or secretive you may find out for yourself though here he paused and frowned but i forget i have no sooner offered you a bottle than i find i must withdraw my invitation why is that mr prestcott you know of him i heard the tales he sent a message wishing to see me did you know i was his tutor once tiresome boy he was not intelligent and no head for learning and very strange indeed all charm one moment sulks and tantrums the next a nasty violent streak in him as well and greatly given to superstition anyway he wishes to see me as it appears the prospect of hanging is making him reconsider his life and his sins i do not want to go but i suppose i must and here i took a sudden decision realizing that if i was to trade with prestcott i had best do it as soon as possible it may have been mere whim or perhaps an angel guided my lips as i spoke it may have been simply that i did not trust a sudden display of piety from prestcott who i had been told only the day before was in no repentant frame of mind it does not matter i took the fateful decision you certainly must not i said firmly your eyes look fearfully sore and i am certain that exposure to a night wind will only weaken them further i will go in your place if it is a priest he wants i suppose i can do that as well as you and if it is you he particularly desires to see then you may go at a later date there is no rush the assize does not come for more than a fortnight and waiting will only make the boy more compliant it required few of the arts of persuasion to make him take my advice reassured that a needy soul was not being neglected he thanked me most sincerely for my kindness and confessed that an evening tormenting an experimentalist was very much more to his liking i even ordered the bottle for him as his eye was so bad it was delivered by my wine seller and placed at the foot of the staircase with my name on that was the bottle cola poisoned and why i know it was intended for myself i see from my commonplace book that i spent that day in an ordinary fashion i attended divine service at st marys as usual for i always gave my loyalty when in town to the university church and endured a tedious and quite erroneous sermon on matthew in which even the most ardent could find no merit even though we tried in discussion afterward i have sat through many such in my life and find myself having some sympathy for the papist style of worship irreligious heretical and ungodly it may be but at least catholicism does not so greatly expose its members to the nonsense of pompous fools more in love with the sound of their own voices than with their lord then i attended to business my correspondence took an hour or so for i had few letters to answer that day and i passed the rest of the morning at work with my book on the history of the algebraic method writing with great ease those passages wherein i demonstrated with unchallengeable proofs the fraudulent claims of vieta all of whose inventions were in fact conceived some thirty years previously by mr harriot small stuff but it occupied me fully until i donned my gown and descended to the hall where grove introduced me to marco da cola i cannot put in words the suffocating loathing i felt on first casting eyes on the man who had extinguished matthews life so carelessly and with such ruthlessness everything about his appearance disgusted me so much so that i felt my throat tightening and thought for a moment that nausea would overcome me entirely his air of amiability merely pointed up the magnitude of his cruelty his exquisite manners reminded me of his violence the expense of his dress the speed and coldness of his deed god help me i could not bear the thought of that stinking perfumed body close to matthew those fat and manicured hands stroking that perfect young cheek i feared then that my expression must have given away something informed cola as that i knew who he was and what he was to do and it may even be that it was the look of horror on my face which prompted him to move faster and attempt my life that same night i do not know both of us behaved as well as we could neither i think gave anything away thereafter and to all outsiders the meal must have appeared perfectly normal cola has given his account of that dinner wherein he mixes insult to his hosts with exaggeration about his own conversation oh those splendid speeches those reasoned responses the patient way in which he smoothed ruffled feathers and corrected the egregious errors of his poor seniors i must apologize even at this late date for not having appreciated his wit his sagacity and his kindliness for i confess all of these fine qualities completely escaped my notice at the time instead i saw or thought i saw for i must have been wrong an uneasy little man with more mannerisms than manners dressed like a cockatoo and with an insinuating assumption of gravitas in his address which failed completely to disguise the superficiality of his learning his affectation of courtly ways and his scorn of those kind enough to offer him hospitality was apparent to all who had the misfortune to sit near him the flourish with which he produced a little scrap of cloth to vent his nostrils excited the ridicule of all and his pointed remarksin venice everyone uses forks in venice wine is drank from glass in venice this in venice thataroused only their disgust like many who have little to say he said too much interrupting without courtesy and favoring with the benefit of his wisdom those who did not desire it i felt almost sorry for him as grove with a twinkle in his eye goaded him like a stupid bull pulling him first one way then the other persuading him to make the most ridiculous statements then forcing him to contemplate his own absurdity there was no matter under the heavens as far as i could see on which the italian did not have a firm and fixed opinion and not a single opinion which was in any way correct or thoughtfully arrived at in truth he astonished me for in my minds eye i had imagined him to be quite other it was hard to comprehend how such a man could be anything other than a buffoon incapable of causing harm to any man unless he bored him to death or asphyxiated him with the wafts of perfume that escaped his body only once did he let down his guard and only for the most fleeting of instants did i penetrate through that mask to what lay underneath then all my suspicions returned in full force and i realized that he had almost succeeded in his aim of disarming all caution i was unprepared for it although i should not have been so easy in giving my contempt for that merchant i had interviewed in the reel prison had forewarned me he had mentioned his astonishment that hardened soldiers on candia treated the man with the greatest respect and i allowed myself to be taken in as well until the moment came when for the only time in the evening cola was thrust into the background by the eruption of hostility between grove and thomas ken for cola was like one of those actors who strut the stage preening themselves in the light of the audiences attention while they have eyes on them they are the characters they pretend to be and all present believe that they are indeed seeing king harry at agincourt or a prince of denmark in his castle but when another speaks and they are in the background watch them then see how the fire in them goes out and how they become mere actors again and only put on their disguise once more when their turn to speak comes once more cola resembled such a player when ken and grove exchanged quotations and ken walked heavily out bowed down by the certainty of his defeatfor the election to the living had been set for the next week and groves victory was assuredcola let slip the mask he had worn so well in the background for the first time he leaned back to regard the scene being played out before his eyes i alone watched him the squabbles of college fellows had no interest for me as i had witnessed so many already and i alone saw the flicker of amusement and the way in which everything said and unsaid in that fight was instantly comprehensible to him he was playing a game with us all and was confident of his success and he was now underestimating his audience as i had underestimated him he did not realize that i saw that instant into his soul and perceived the devilish intent that lay hidden there coiled and waiting to be unleashed when all around had been lulled into thinking him a fool i took succor from that flash of understanding and thanked the lord for allowing me such a sign for i knew then what cola was just as i knew i could defeat him he was a man who made mistakes and his greatest error was overconfidence his conversation was tedious even to grove but good manners dictated that he be invited back to share a drink after the supper was concluded and the final blessing given i know this to be the case even though cola says differently he says that grove escorted him directly to the college gate and there all contact between them ceased this cannot be as a man of groves natural courtesy would not have acted so i do not doubt that the refreshment was curtailed and i do not doubt that grove lied by saying he had to go and visit prestcott as a way of getting rid of the man but it is inconceivable that the evening would have ended as cola says it is another deliberate falsehood i have detected in his account although by this time i believe i have indicated so many that there is scarcely point in continuing the exercise further what is certain is that cola expected me to go to my room find the bottle of brandy laced with poison at the foot of my stairswho else might it have been for since grove was the only other person on the stairs and he was supposed to be absent that eveningand expected me to drink it he then returned late in the night and though he did not find me dead ransacked my room and took not only the letter i had intercepted but also the letter given to me by samuel in it was an evil scheme made all the worse later by his willingness to stand by and let the blundy girl die in his place for i have no doubt he procured that arsenic in the low countries then lied outright in saying he had none in his pharmacopoeia it is monstrous to contemplate but some men are so wicked and depraved that no deceit is beyond their powers what cola did not anticipate is that the real object of his murderous venom would be so far beyond his reach for i did go to see prestcott and even though i had to suffer the greatest indignation at that wretched boys hands at least the affront was matched by useful information it was a cold evening and i wrapped myself up as well as i could for the interview prestcott at least had enough friends in the world to provide him with blankets and warm clothing although their generosity did not extend to allowing him a fire in the grate or anything other than candles of the cheapest pig fat which sputtered and stank as they gave off their feeble light i had mistakenly omitted to bring any of my own so the conversation took place in virtual darkness and to this as well as my foolish generosity of spirit do i attribute prestcotts ability to surprise me in the way he did the meeting began with prestcotts refusal even to listen to me unless i had promised to unshackle him from the thick heavy chains which bound him to the walla necessary restraint as i later learned you must understand dr wallis that i have been chained up like this for nearly three weeks and i am mightily tired of it my ankles are covered in sores and the noise of the chains rattling every time i turn over is sending me mad does anyone expect that i will escape burrow through the four feet of stonework to the outside world leap down sixty feet into the ditch and run away i will not unchain you i said until i have some expectation of cooperation and i will not cooperate until i have some expectation of continuing to live beyond the next assizes on that i may be able to offer you something if i am satisfied by your replies then i will assure you of a pardon from the king you will not go free as the insult to the compton family would be too great for them to bear but you will be suffered to go to america where you can make a new life he snorted more freedom than i desire he said freedom to plow the earth like some peasant wearied to death by the dronings of puritans and hacked to death by indians whose methods i may say we would do well to imitate here some of these people would make any sensible man reach for his hatchet thank you good doctor for your generosity it is the best i can do i said although i am not sure even now whether i intended to do it but i knew that if i offered him too much he would not believe me if you accept you will surely live and later on you may win a reprieve and be allowed to return and it is the only chance you have he thought a long while slumped on his cot and huddled in his blanket very well he said reluctantly i suppose i have no choice it is better than the offer i received from mr lower im glad you at last see reason now then tell me about mr cola he looked genuinely surprised at the question why on earth do you want to know about him you should only be glad that i do why did he come and see you here because he is a civil and courteous gentleman do not waste my time mr prestcott indeed i do not know what else to say sir did he ask you for anything what could i give him something of your fathers perhaps such as a copy of livy that again tell me doctor why is that so important to you that is not your affair in that case i do not care to answer i thought it could do me no harm as prestcott did not have the book in any case the book is the key to some work i am doing if i have it i can decipher some letters now did cola ask you about it no here prestcott rolled on his little cot and convulsed with merriment at what he thought was a fine joke at my expense i began to weary mightily of him truly he did not i am sorry doctor he said wiping his eye and to make amends i will tell you what i know mr cola was recently a guest of my guardian and was staying there when sir william was attacked without his skill i understand sir william would have died of his injuries that night and he is evidently a formidably clever surgeon to patch him up so neatly he shrugged and that is all there is to be said i can tell you no more what was he doing there i gathered they had a joint interest in trading matters colas father is a merchant and sir william is master of the ordnance one sells goods the other uses government money to buy them both desire to make as much money as possible and naturally they wished to keep their association quiet for fear of lord clarendons wrath that at least is how i understand things and why do you understand them so prestcott gave me a look of contempt come now dr wallis even i know how sir william and lord clarendon detest each other and even i know that if the faintest whiff of corruption attached itself to sir williams exercise of his office clarendon would use it to eject him apart from your own supposition do you have any reason to think this fear of lord clarendons wrath is why colas association with sir william was kept hidden they talked of clarendon incessantly sir william hates him so much he cannot keep him out of his conversation at times mr cola was exceptionally courteous i think in listening so patiently to his complaints how is that prestcott was so naïve that he did not even begin to comprehend my interest in everything that cola did or said and as gently as a lamb i led him through every word and gesture that he had heard the italian utter or seen him make on three occasions when i was there sir william returned to the subject of lord clarendon and every time he harped on about what a malign influence he was how he held the king in the palm of his hand and encouraged his majestys licentiousness so that he might have free run to loot the kingdom how all good englishmen wished to oust him but were unable to summon the resolve or the courage to take decisive action you know the sort of thing i am sure i nodded to encourage him and to establish that sympathy in conversation which encourages greater openness of discourse mr cola listened patiently as i say and made valiant attempts to deflect the conversation into less heated areas but sooner or later it came back to the lord chancellors perfidy what particularly incensed sir william was clarendons great house at cornbury park i believe i must have frowned here as i could not grasp the meaning of it the wealth that had been heaped on clarendon since the restoration had indeed incited great envy but there seemed no particular reason why this should focus on cornbury prestcott saw my perplexity and for once was kind enough to enlighten me the lord chancellor has acquired large portions of land right up into chipping norton deep into compton territory sir william believes that a concerted assault is being launched on his familys interest in south warwickshire as he said not long ago the comptons would have known how to deal with such impudence i nodded gravely since my penetration into this great mystery was deepening with every word that dropped from prestcotts lips i was beginning to think even that i would keep my word to the lad for his testimony might well prove useful in the future and i could not have that were he to swing mr cola successfully diverted the talk onto other matters but nothing was safe once he mentioned his experience of english roads even that brought sir william back to the topic of clarendon how so prestcott paused it is a very trivial matter of course it is i agreed but tell me nonetheless and when you have done i will ensure you are unshackled and remain so for the rest of your short stay in this place i have no doubt that like all people in similar circumstances he invented where he could not remember such duplicity is common and was expected it is the task of the expert interrogator to separate wheat and chaff and allow the winds to blow away the rubbish from the precious seed they were talking of the road which runs northward from witney to chipping norton and which cola had taken on his way to compton wynyates why he did so i cannot imagine as it is not the most direct route but i gather he is one of these curious gentlemen nosy i call them who peek and pry at all things not their affair and call it enquiry i suppressed a sigh and smiled at the boy in what i hoped would appear as sympathy prestcott at least appeared to take it as such it is apparently the road which my lord clarendon takes on his way to cornbury and cola joked that if sir william was fortunate clarendon might be shaken to death by the journey or drowned in a waterfilled hole so bad was the condition of the road and so lax the county at maintaining it do you really want to hear this sir i nodded continue i said i could feel the tingle in my blood as i knew i was almost there and could brook no further delays tell me prestcott shrugged sir william laughed and tried to match him by saying that maybe he would be shot by a highwayman as well for it is known he always travels with only a small retinue many a man had been murdered of late with the assailant never apprehended then the conversation went on to other things and that prestcott said is that end of the story i had it i knew i had unraveled the layers of the problem and penetrated deep into its heart it was like one of those conundra sent out in competition by mathematicians to challenge their rivals however formidable in appearance however deliberately designed to perplex and confuse yet there is always a simplicity at their core and the art of victory lies in careful thought and a calm working through of the outer reaches until that center is arrived at like an army laying siege to a castle the skill lies not in a wide assault around the perimeter but a gentle probing of the outworks until the weak spot of the defensesfor there always is oneis revealed then all the strength of the attack can be focused on that one point until it gives way cola had made the mistake of visiting prestcott i had persuaded prestcott to tell me of their connection and now i had nearly the whole plot in my hand and my earlier error was made clear cola was not here to kill the king as i had thought he was here to murder the lord chancellor of england but i still could not credit that this thickheaded gentleman sir william compton was capable of such subtle deviousness that he might plot with the spanish for months and sponsor a hired murderer as i say i knew him a challenge or some such bravado i could have understood but not this i had gone far but not far enough behind compton i was sure lay another there had to be and so i questioned prestcott further seeking out every contact he had made every single name sir william or cola had mentioned he gave some useless answers but then decided to bargain some more and now sir he said moving his legs so the chains around his ankles rattled and chinked against the floor i have talked long enough and had confidence in your fidelity to give you much with nothing in return so now unlock these shackles that i may walk about the little room like a normal man god help me i did as he asked seeing little harm in it and wishing to give him encouragement to continue in a cooperative fashion i summoned the jailer who unlocked the shackles and presented me with the key asking me to be so good as to relock them once more when i left it cost a shilling in bribes then he left the cell and prestcott listened in what i thought was mournful silence as the steps echoed down the stone staircase once more i will not go into the details of the humiliation i suffered at the hands of that madman once the footsteps had died away prestcott had the cunning of the desperate i the inattention of the concerned for my mind was on what he had told me in brief within minutes of being left alone once more prestcott had used violence on me stopping my mouth binding my hands and shackling me to the cot so tightly i could neither move nor raise the alarm i was so outraged i could barely even think correctly and was suffused with rage when he finally put his face close to mine not pleasant eh he hissed in my ear and i have endured many weeks of it you are lucky you will be here only for one night remember i could easily have killed you but i will not that was all he then sat unconcernedly for some ten minutes or more until he judged the time was right then put on my heavy cloak and hat picked up my biblemy family bible given into my hands by my own fatherand bowed in a gross parody of courtesy to me sweet dreams dr wallis he said i hope we do not meet again after five minutes i gave up struggling and lay until the morning brought my release such is the providential goodness of the lord that he is at his most gentle when his judgment seems most harsh and it is not for man to doubt his wisdom instead he can only give thanks with the blindest faith that he will not abandon his true servant the next morning my complaints were revealed for the petty whinings they were when the full extent of his goodness was revealed to me i say now that the lord is good and loves all who believe in him for by what other means could my life have been preserved that night only an angel of goodness guided by the hand of the most high could have steered me away from the abyss and by preserving me allowed the kingdom to escape calamity for i do not believe that i was so favored for my own worthless life which is no more significant in his eyes than the least grain of dust but as he has so constantly shown his favors to his people so he chose me to be the instrument of their preservation and in joy and humility i accepted the responsibility knowing that by his will i would succeed i was released shortly after dawn began and straightaway went to the magistrate sir john fulgrove to report what had happened so he could raise the alarm and begin the hunt for the fugitive i did not at that stage report my interest in the boy although i did urge him to make sure if possible that he did not lose his life if caught then i ate in an inn for being a prisoner is hungry work and i was chilled to the bone and only then deep in thought did i return to my room in new college and discover the horrors that had taken place that night for grove had died in my place and my room had been ransacked with my papers gone colas authorship of this outrage was as clear to me as if i had seen him pour the poison into the bottle with my own eyes and his calm audacity in coming back to the college to be the very first to discover with what expressions of shock with what distress and horror the results of his own wickedness appalled me i was told by warden woodward that he it was who attempted by subtle inference and weasel words to steer the college toward thinking that grove had died of a seizure and it was in order to expose this lie that i asked woodward to have lower investigate the matter lower was of course flattered by the request and willingly obliged my trust in his skills was not given without reason either for one look at groves corpse made him pause and look highly perturbed i would hesitate strongly to say this was a seizure he said doubtfully i have never seen any man foam at the mouth so in such a case the blueness of the lips and the eyelids is consistent with such a diagnosis however and i have no doubt that my friend fastened onto these signs too speedily could he have eaten something the warden asked he ate in hall did he not if it was that then you should all be dead i will examine his room and see what there is to be found there if you like and thus lower discovered the bottle the sediment inside it and returned to the wardens lodgings in great excitement explaining the experiments which might be devised to show what the substance was woodward was not at all interested in these details although i found them fascinating and having conversed on many occasions with mr stahl myself i realized lower was perfectly correct in proposing to use his services there was of course the question of cola for any such move would be bound to alert him accordingly i decided that it would be best to confront the matter head on and suggested to lower that he involve the italian at every stage of the investigations to see whether his actions or speech gave any hint of his thoughts i could easily have had him arrested on the spot but i was also certain that i had not yet fathomed the whole of the mystery i needed more time and cola had to be at his liberty a while longer although i did not make my reasoning plain lower caught the inner meaning of my recommendations surely you do not suspect mr cola of this he asked i know you have heard ill reports of him but there can be no reason for him to do such a thing at all i reassured him absolutely but pointed out that as he was perhaps the last person to see dr grove naturally some doubt must attach to him it would be discourteous to a guest to make this known however and i begged that no hint of the suspicion come to his attention i would not have him return to his native country speaking ill of us for all the world i said which is why i think it a good idea if you persuade him to attend the dissection for you can have him stand alone near the body and touch it and see whether it accuses him i have no reason to believe that is an accurate test of such matters he said nor i but it is a recommended procedure in such matters and has been employed for generations many of the finest lawyers admit it as a useful part of examination should some prodigious eruption of blood occur from the corpse when cola approaches it then we will know of it if not then his name is halfcleansed of stain already but do not let him know he has been tested in such a fashion it is not my intention to repeat what others have said nor to retell stories which i did not myself witness everything i say comes from my direct encounter or from the testimony of men of unimpeachable character as cola was unaware of the suspicion in which he was already held he had no reason to distort his account of that evening when he lower and locke cut up dr grove in warden woodwards kitchen for that reason i understand the account he gives of it is largely truthful lower reported to me that he had arranged for cola to stand alone by the naked corpse before any incision had been made into the flesh and seen well that the soul of grove had not called out for vengeance nor accused his murderer of the deed whether this means such examinations are in fact of no merit or whether proper prayers must be offered or whether as some say the test must take place on consecrated ground to work i do not presume to speculate for a while at least lower had the suspicions of the man he thought his friend lifted from his shoulders and i had the leisure to pursue my thoughts and conduct my first examination of the blundy girl i summoned her to my room the following afternoon on the pretext of wishing to interview her for a post in my household for the builders wretched idlers though they were were at last coming to the end of their labors and there was every prospect i might once again have a home to call my own having risen in state somewhat in the previous year i had decided that i would have four servants not three as before and give in to my wifes ceaseless importuning by giving her a girl of her own the prospect filled me with sadness for i was having at the same time to consider finding a replacement for matthew and the weight of his loss bore the more heavily on me by contemplating the dirty illiterate stupid wretches who presented themselves and who were no more fit to clean his shoes than to fill them not that i would ever have considered sarah blundy for any post although in all matters of outward show i could have done a great deal worse i am not one of those men who might allow a good christian wife to have some french strumpet to comb her hair a sober hardworking girl of sense and piety is required instead clean in her habits and unslovenly of behavior such girls are hard to find and with different antecedents and beliefs sarah blundy would have been in all respects admirable i had not encountered her directly before and i noted with interest the dignified subservience of her entry the modesty of her address and the sense of her words even cola i recall comments on these very same qualities but the impertinence that he also detected was not hidden for long for the moment i told her frankly that i had no intention of giving her a position she raised her jaw and her eyes flashed with defiance you have wasted my time in summoning me here then she said your time is there to be wasted if that is what i choose to do with it i will have no insolence from you you will answer my questions or face serious trouble i know well who you are and where you are from her life i must say here was no concern of mine had she foisted herself off on some unsuspecting man who was ignorant of what she was her good fortune would not have grieved me greatly but i knew no man would willingly take her if her past was known for to do so would expose him to public contempt through this i could force her to comply you have i believe recently acquired the services of an italian physician for your mother a man of great standing and high dignity in his profession might i ask by what means you pay for this she flushed and hung her head at the accusation remarkable is it not that such generosity should be offered few english physicians i am sure would be so carefree of their time and skills mr cola is a good kind gentleman she said who does not think of payment im sure not it is true she said with more spirit i told him frankly i could not pay him not in money anyway and yet he labors on your mothers behalf i think of him only as a good christian he is a papist good christians can be found everywhere i know many in the church of england sir more cruel and ungenerous than he mind your tongue i do not want your opinions what is his interest in you and your mother i know of none he wishes to make my mother better i care to know no more than that yesterday he and dr lower conducted a strange and wonderful treatment which cost them great trouble and has it worked my mother is still alive praise be and i pray she will improve amen but to return to my question and this time do not try to evade to whom have you delivered messages on his behalf i know your connections with the garrison at abingdon and with the conventicles to whom have you gone with messages letters someone must take his communications for he sends none in the post she shook her head no one do not make me angry i do not wish to i am telling you the truth you deny you went to abingdoni consulted my notebooklast wednesday the friday before that the monday before that that you walked to burford and stayed there the tuesday that you have met tidmarsh as part of his conventicle even in this town she did not reply and i could see my knowledge of her was a shock what were you doing what messages were you delivering who did you see no one two weeks ago an irishman called greatorex also visited you what did he want nothing do you take me for a fool i do not take you for anything i hit her for that for though a tolerant man i will not accept more than a certain degree of insolence once she had wiped the blood from her mouth she seemed more subdued but still she gave me nothing i have delivered no messages for mr cola he has said little to me and less to my mother she whispered he talked to her a great deal on one occasion that was when he sent me to buy him drugs from the apothecary i do not know what they said you must find out why should i so because i tell you i paused and realized that appealing to her better nature was fruitless so took some coins from my desk and placed them before her she looked at them with astonishment and disdain then pushed them back i have told you there is nothing but her voice was weak and her head bowed as she spoke go away now and think well on what you say i know you are lying to me i will give you one further chance to tell me the truth about this man otherwise you will regret your silence and let me give you a warning mr cola is a dangerous man he has killed on many occasions in the past and will do so again without further words she left she did not take the money still in front of her but gave me a look of burning hatred before she turned away she was cowed i knew that even so i was not sure it was enough thinking about my deeds once more i can see already that an ignorant would consider me harsh i can hear the protests already the necessary courtesies between high and low and so on to all of which i agree without reservation gentlemen are indeed under an obligation to give a daily demonstration that the positions in which god established us all are just and good as with children they should be chided with love corrected with kindness chastised with a firm regret the blundys however were very different there was no point in treating them with kindness when they had already thrown off any acknowledgment of their superiors both husband and wife had scorned the links which bind each to all and accompanied this revolt against gods manifest will with quotations from the bible itself all these diggers and levellers and anabaptists thought they were shedding their chains with gods blessing they were instead severing the silken cords which kept men in harmony and would have replaced them by shackles of thickest iron in their stupidity they did not see what they were doing i would have treated sarah blundy and anyone with kindness and respect if it had been deserved if it had been reciprocated if it had not been dangerous so to do my frustrations at this stage were gigantic when talking to prestcott i had the whole affair in the palm of my hand but it had slipped away from me through my own foolishness i admit also that i was anxious to preserve my own life as well and was fearful that another attack would be launched against me it was for this reason that i took the step of informing the magistrate that in my opinion dr robert grove had been murdered he was aghast at the news and perturbed at the implications of what i told him the warden has no suspicions of foul play and would not thank me for telling you of mine i continued nonetheless it is my duty to inform you that in my opinion there is sufficient reason for suspicion and it is therefore imperative that the body be not buried of course it mattered not to me what happened to the body the confrontation with cola had already taken place and yielded no useful result i was more concerned that cola know his deed was being uncovered bit by bit and that he felt my opposition to his aims with luck i thought he might communicate with his masters to tell them of all that had transpired for a brief while i was on the verge of having the man arrested i changed my mind because of mr thurloe who traveled into oxford to see me shortly after cola has described the way he approached me at the play in his memoir and i have no intention of repeating it the shock he noted on my face was well seeni was astonished not only because i had not seen thurloe for near three years but because i hardly recognized him how changed he was from his days of greatness it was like meeting a total stranger who yet reminds you of a person once known in appearance there was little obvious alteration for he was the sort of man who looks old when young and young when old but his demeanor bore no trace of that power which he had held so firmly in his hands while many had bitterly resented the loss of authority thurloe seemed like one glad to be rid of the burden and content in his reduction to insignificance the set of his head his face and the expression of deep concern had passed from him so totally that these small details altered the whole had changed almost beyond recognition when he approached me i paused awhile before making my greeting he smiled back quietly as if seeing my confusion and acknowledging the cause of it i do believe he had so firmly placed that period of his life behind him that even had it been offered he would have declined to take on any public office he later told me that he spent his days in prayer and meditation and counted that as of more worth than all his efforts for his country he was largely unconcerned with the society of his fellow men and as he made clear did not like to be disturbed by those who sought to recall what was now irretrievably past i bring a message from your friend mr prestcott he murmured in my ear perhaps we might talk once the play was over i went straight home i had moved back to my domestic comforts that afternoon and awaited him he was not long in coming and sat down with all the calm imperturbability that was his normal mode of conduct i understand your taste for power and influence has not been slaked dr wallis he said which does not surprise me in the slightest i hear you have been questioning this young man and have enough influence to have him pardoned if you so desire you are attached to mr bennet now i believe i nodded what is your interest in prestcott and this italian gentleman you ask him about he asked even the shadow of thurloes authority still blinded more than full exposure to the powers of a man like mr bennet and i say that it never occurred to me not to answer him nor to point out that he had no right whatsoever to question me i am certain that there is a plot which might return this country to civil war of course there is thurloe said in that calm way with which he greeted all matters however serious when at any stage in the past few years has there not been what is new about this one what is new is that i believe it to be organized by the spanish and what is it to be this time massed attack by fifth monarchists a sudden cannonade by rebellious guardsmen one man the venetian gentleman who now passes as a philosopher he has already killed twice my servant and dr grove and he stole letters from me which are of the greatest importance this is the physician you asked prestcott about he is no physician he is a soldier a known killer and is here to murder the earl of clarendon thurloe grunted for the first time in my life i saw him surprised you would be best to kill him first then then his paymasters will try again and swiftly at least this time i know who he is next time i might not be so lucky i must use this opportunity to uncover the english end of the conspiracy and stop it once and for all thurloe stood up took the heavy poker from the hearth and rearranged the logs on the fire so that he sent a shower of sparks up the chimney he did this for some time it was always a habit of his to occupy himself with some trivial physical task while he thought eventually he turned to me once more if i were you i should kill him he repeated if this man is dead then the plot is at an end it may be revived but it may not if he slips away from you then you will have blood on your hands and if i am wrong then an italian traveler dies ambushed on a road by highwaymen a great tragedy no doubt but all except his family will forget it within weeks i cannot believe you would take your own advice in these circumstances you must when i looked out for oliver i always moved immediately when i heard of a plot against his person risings conspiracies all those minor matters they could be left to run a little because they could always be defeated assassination is different one mistake and you are ruined forever believe me dr wallisdo not overreach yourself with subtlety you are dealing here with men not geometry they are less predictable and more given to causing surprise i would agree wholeheartedly with you i said were it not for the fact that i have no man i could rely on to do this and a botched attempt would only make him more cautious and for suitable help i would have to inform mr bennet more thoroughly i have told him a little but very far from all ah yes thurloe replied thoughtfully that ambitious and pompous gentleman you consider him less than safe i reluctantly noddedi still did not know how cola had found out so quickly about matthew it was certainly possible though dreadful to contemplate that bennet himself might have passed on that information and might also be involved in the plot against clarendon thurloe leaned back in his chair and considered sitting so long and quietly that i was half afraid he had fallen asleep in the heat of the fire that perhaps his mind was no longer what it was and that he could no longer occupy himself with such matters but i was wrong eventually he opened his eyes and nodded to himself i would doubt his involvement if that is what concerns you he said is there something you know that makes you conclude this no i know less of the man than you do i proceed from character no more mr bennet is an able man very able indeed everyone knows it and the king is more aware than most for all his faults this is not a prince who surrounds himself with fools he is not like his father mr bennet will dominate the government when clarendon goes as soon he must he has power within his grasp all he has to do is wait for the fruits of office to fall in profusion into his lap now is it likely that a man such as this would suddenly indulge himself in these grandly extravagant actions which can in no way improve his prospects risk all on the throw of dice when patience will soon bring all he wants that is not his way i think i am glad you think so but there must be a sponsor in england this is certainly true do you know who this is i shrugged helplessly it could be any one of many dozen people clarendon has enemies without end for good reasons and bad you know that as well as i do he has been attacked in print and in person in the house of commons and in the house of lords through his family and his friends it was only a matter of time i think before someone attacked his body that moment may be soon a rash man it must be thurloe observed to act in such desperation as however good a soldier your venetian is the chance of him missing and being captured must always be there it may be of course that he is being held in reserve that he will be called into action only if other attempts to ruin lord clarendon fail such as i asked feeling that once again thurloe was teaching me as he had an entire generation of servants of the state how do you know all this sir i keep my ears open and i listen thurloe replied with quiet amusement a course i recommend to you doctor and you have heard of another plot maybe so it seems that enemies of clarendon are trying to weaken him by associating him with treason in particular the treason of john mordaunt in betraying to me the rising of in this matter they seek to employ the good offices of jack prestcott the son of the man who took the blame for that regrettable event mordaunt i asked incredulously are you serious oh perfectly serious thank you shortly before cromwell died he continued i myself attended a meeting alone with him where he mapped out his own death which he knew could not be greatly delayed he could barely walk so much had his final illness gripped him and so severe were the treatments meted out to him by his physicians he knew as well as any he had but a little time remaining and he regarded the prospect unflinchingly wanting only to ensure that his affairs on earth were settled before the lord took him he instructed me how to proceed confident that his orders would be obeyed even though he was no longer here to enforce them his protectorate would pass temporarily to his son richard he said and that would buy the time necessary to conclude negotiations with charles about how best to effect a restoration of the monarchy the king was to be allowed back only if he was shackled with so many chains limiting his deeds that he would never act as his father had naturally the whole affair was to be kept the closest guarded secret no meeting was to be noted no letters and not a word should be spoken outside the small circle on both sides privy to the talks i did as i was told because he was rightonly cromwell kept civil war at bay and when he went it would resume unless the breach in the nation was healed and the english are a monarchical people who love subjection more than freedom it was desperately difficult as if the fanatics on either side knew of it then we would all be cast aside even so they carne close to taking power again and i was thrown out of office for a while even then though i kept the talks going with john mordaunt representing his majesty one of the conditions of course was that all plans and plots for risings should stopand if the royalists themselves could not stop them we were to be given enough information so we might do so accordingly mordaunt gave us full details of the rising which was put down with considerable loss of life many more would have died had war resumed properly but that would not save mordaunt if the details of this transaction were known the trouble is that this young man prestcott is trying to prove his father innocent and must inevitably prove mordaunt guilty if he is to succeed for he has been told enough to know who was really responsible then it would be assumed that clarendon gave mordaunt his orders did he thurloe smiled no the king gave them himself but clarendon would accept the blame to save his majesty from criticism he is a good servant and better than this king deserves prestcott knows of all this not exactly he is convinced that mordaunt was a traitor acting on his own behalf i have encouraged him in his belief that samuel morland was in league with him this gets ever more bizarre i commented why did you do that for the obvious reason that otherwise he would have acted on his belief in my responsibility and slit my throat you might incidentally do me the service of seeing samuel next time you are in london and warning him that this young man has decided to kill him and you say someone has been helping prestcott i believe so thurloe replied who he is too cunning to say unless the price is right his testimony is worthless in any case i said furious that the little wretch dared bargain with me and on such a matter in a court of course it is but you understand politics better than that doctor what does he want proof of his fathers innocence i do not have it thurloe smiled i grunted i suppose there is no reason why i should not promise him anything he wants once i have his testimony of course thurloe wagged his finger at me indeed but do not take him for a fool sir he has some wit even though i doubt his sanity he is not a trusting man and wants an indication of your good will first you do something for him he will reciprocate he does not trust anyone what does he want he wants charges against him abandoned i doubt i could accomplish that my relations with the magistrate are not such that he will readily do me any favor you do not need one mr prestcott is willing to provide damning evidence that some woman called blundy murdered this man grove i am not certain how he came by it especially as you tell me fhis italian was responsible but we must use such opportunities as we are given it should be possible to persuade the magistrate that a certain conviction in a murder case is better than a possible conviction in one of assault her trial means his freedom and cooperation i stared at him uncomprehending before realizing he was perfectly serious you want me to connive in judicial murder i am not an assassin mr thurloe you do not need to be all you have to do is talk to the magistrate then keep your silence you never did such a wicked thing i said believe me i did and gladly it is the servants duty to take sin onto his own shoulder so that his prince may remain safe ask lord clarendon it is to safeguard good order that is no doubt how pontius pilate consoled himself he inclined his head no doubt he did but i think the circumstances are different it is not in any case as if you do not have an alternative this woman does not have to die but you would not then find out who is sponsoring the italian nor would you have that much chance of bringing him to trial but i sense you want more than this i want cola dead and i want those who brought him here destroyed thurloes eyes narrowed as i said this and i knew that the intensity of my reply the hatred in my voice had let him see too much it is unwise he said in matters such as this to be swayed by sentiment or by a desire for revenge by grasping too much you may lose everything he stood up and now i must leave you i have delivered my message and given my advice i am sorry that you find it so hard although i understand your reluctance if i could persuade mr prestcott to be more reasonable then i would certainly do so but he has the pigheadedness of youth and will not be swayed you if i may say so have some of the same qualities i prayed for guidance that night but no word of help or comfort came to me i was entirely deserted and abandoned to my own indecision i was not so blind as to forget that thurloe undoubtedly had his own reasons for intervening but i did not know what these might be certainly he would not avoid deceiving me if he felt it necessary he had few powers left and i fully expected him to use those that remained at the very least i felt i should keep open all possible courses and a few days later i spoke to the magistrate who immediately placed sarah blundy under arrest as she had already been questioned it was natural that she would be afraid and i did not wish anything to be rendered impossible by her precipitate flight had she run she knew more than enough people to give her refuge and i would have had little chance of ever finding her again by that stage cola had gone on his medical tour with lower i was furious when i heard of this and immediately feared that his expedition might be the culminating point of his conspiracy but mr boyle reassured me when he informed me in a letter from london that the lord chancellor did not intend to leave for his country estate for another few weeks my nightmare of an imminent ambush on the london road the coaches ravaged and all blamed on old soldiers turned highwaymen ebbed away from me as i realized that cola must bemerely filling in idle time as he waited perhaps indeed thurloe was right and cola was in england only for employment if a more peaceable attempt to unseat clarendon failed moreover i was glad of the breathing space the knowledge gave me for i had momentous decisions to make and was about to embark on a course which would either bring me to ruin or would pull down one of the great men in the landthis is not something anyone does with a light heart so in that peaceful week in which cola traveled the countryside i understand that his account is again accurate in some details for lower told me that he labored with diligence among his patients i considered all the possibilities which lay before me went over all the evidence indicating my conclusions about the dangers this man cola posed were correct and i could see no fault in them and defy anyone else to doubt them eitherno innocent ever acted in such a guilty fashion apart from that i renewed my assault on sarah blundy for i thought that if i could persuade her to say what interest cola had in her family then i might spare myself from the humiliation of having to give in to the wishes of a halfcrazed adolescent like jack prestcott she was brought to me in a small room normally occupied by the castle warden incarceration had done little for her appearance and as i swiftly discovered had in no way eroded her insolence i trust you have meditated on the matters we talked of before i am in a position to help you if you will only allow me to do so i did not kill dr grove i know that but many people think you did and you will die unless i help you if you know i am innocent then surely you must help me anyway you are a man of god perhaps that is true but you are a loyal subject of his majesty yet you refused to help me when i asked you for only the slightest assistance i did not refuse i knew nothing that you wanted to hear for someone who may shortly be hanged you seem remarkably reluctant to avert that terrible fate if it is gods will that i should die then i will do so willingly if it is not then i shall be spared god expects us to labor on our own behalf listen girl what i ask is not so dreadful you have become involved no doubt innocently in the most fiendish scheme imaginable if you assist me you will not only go free you will be rewarded well what scheme i certainly do not intend to tell you she fell silent you said i prompted that your benefactor mr cola talked on occasion with your mother what did they talk about what did he ask you said you would find out she is too sick to be asked all she has told me is that mr cola always showed her the greatest courtesy and listened with great patience whenever she felt like talking he said little himself i shook my head in exasperation listen you stupid girl i all but shouted at her this man is here to commit a horrendous crime the first thing he did when he got here was contact you if you are not helping him what was the purpose of that i do not know all i know is that my mother is sick and he has helped her no one else offered and without his generosity she would be dead more than that i do not know or care to know she looked at me straight in the eyes as she continued you say he is a criminal no doubt you have good reason for that but i have never seen or heard him behave in any way except with the utmost civility more perhaps than i properly deserve criminal or papist that is how i judge him i state here that i wished to save her if i could if she would only allow me to do so with all my heart i willed her to break and say everything she knew with good fortune she would make prestcotts testimony unnecessary and i could then refuse his bargain i pressed again and again far longer than i would have done with anyone else but she would not give way you were not in new college that evening nor were you at home tending your mother you were running errands for cola tell me where you were and who you spoke to tell me what other errands you have run for him in abingdon and bicester and burford that you will counter the evidence against you and win my help at one and the same time she lifted her head to me defiant once more there is nothing i know that can help you in any way i do not know why mr cola is here if he was not motivated by christian charity i do not know why he is helping my mother you have been carrying messages for him i have not you were carrying one for him on the night grove died i was not where were you then i have established you were not tending your mother as your duty required i will not tell you but as god is my witness i have done nothing ill god is not testifying at your trial i said and sent her back to her cell i was in a black humor i knew at that moment that i would trade with prestcott may the lord forgive me i had given the girl every opportunity of saving herself but she threw her own life away the next day i received an urgent letter from mr thurloe i quote it here as direct testimony to events i did not myself witness most honored sir it is my duty and pleasure to acquaint you with certain developments which you have a right to know as a matter of urgency for you must act swiftly lest the opportunity slip the italian gentleman who interests you so much has been to this village and although he has now left in the company of mr lower once more i believe heading back for oxford he has greatly frightened mr prestcottreports of colas ruthlessness have so struck the young man that he was greatly concerned of his intentions in coming here as much out of curiosity as in any hope of discovering his design i spent a good time talking to him and discovered a young man both highly personable and charming although this perception did not deflect me from taking my normal precautions to guard against sudden attack none materialized however and i took the liberty of informing him of the arrest of sarah blundy so that he might not be afraid of returning to oxford if such concerns motivated him i trust this meets with your approval while prestcott and cola talked i took it upon myself to see dr lower and impressed on him the necessity of ensuring that cola did not slip away undetected he was greatly perturbed and i must say quite angry at the thought that he had been deceived but eventually agreed to comply with my wishes and give no hint of any suspicion he is too transparent in his emotions however to give me great confidence that he will manage such a feat i spent much of the night in an agony of indecision before i came to the inevitable conclusion prestcott demanded a high price and his soul would burn in hell for it but it was a price i could not bargain down i needed that testimony and i needed to know who was behind the conspiracy against clarendon i hope my account here shows how much i tried on three occasions at least i had done my best to find a way around the predicament for more than a week i had avoided acting in the vain hope that an alternative would allow me to escape the decision and had risked much in the delay with a heavy heart i concluded i could delay no more sarah blundy died two days later on this subject i have no more to add my words would serve no purpose john thurloe came to see me that same afternoon i do not know whether to offer congratulations or not doctor you have done a terrible right thing more important than you know even i think i know the significance of my deeds i said and their cost i think not then with that implacable coolness i knew so well thurloe told me the greatest secret of the realm and for the first time i understood plainly how he and people like samuel morland had enjoyed such immunity from any sanction since his majestys restoration and i also learned the true nature of sir james prestcotts treachery a betrayal so dangerous it had to be disguised in a lesser treason that it might never be known i had a man in my office a soldier thurloe said who served as a particularly reliable emissary on all sorts of matters if i wanted a particularly dangerous letter delivered or prisoner kept safe then this man could always be relied upon he was perfectly fanatical in his hatred of monarchy and held a republic to be an essential beginning for gods kingdom on earth he wanted a parliament elected by vote including the vote of women and the propertyless a distribution of land and perfect toleration of all worship he was in addition highly intelligent quickwitted and able if a little too thoughtful for perfection but i considered him totally loyal to the commonwealth because all possible alternatives he thought so very much worse unfortunately i was wrong in my assessment he was a lincolnshire man and years before had formed an attachment to a local landowner who had defended the people of that place from the depredations of the drainers at a moment of crisis this loyalty came back to haunt him and overwhelmed all sense and reason i must say we knew nothing of this until we found the letter samuel asked you to decipher on his body what is this to do with anything sir please do not tell me riddles i have enough of my own that landowner of course was sir james prestcott and the soldier was ned blundy the husband of anne and the father of the woman who died two days ago i stared at him in the greatest surprise on my last visit i told you of the way john mordaunt informed me of the rising another smaller plot which he also told me about was a local piece of troublemaking planned for lincolnshire by sir james prestcott it was not serious but general ludlow was going to send off a regiment to deal with the problem before it could cause any trouble ned blundy knew of it as he was asked to deliver dispatches on the matter and out of this fenland loyalty of his passed on a warning which saved prestcotts life which would otherwise have most certainly been forfeit the association once renewed led to the divulgence of more and more secrets for both were fanatics and found common cause in hating those who wanted peace blundy applied himself to learning all the secrets of the talks about a restoration which he could do more easily than was proper for men are never as discreet or careful as they should be through him prestcott learned of them as well he knew which members of the kings party had been deliberately handed over to the government which plots had been betrayed in advance so they could do no harm and he became a very angry man intent on revenge when he heard that the king himself was coming to england in secret for final talks with me he could contain himself no longer he went down to deal that same february in when the king was due to arrive and lay in wait i do not know how long he was there but one morning after the talks had been going on the king went for a walk in the gardens of the house we were using sir james came out at him and tried to kill him with his sword i knew nothing of any of these talks and certainly nothing of any assassination attempt so well had the matter been hidden by all concerned and i was astonished both to learn of it and that thurloe was telling me now why did it not succeed it very nearly did the king received a cut in the arm which shocked him mightily and would certainly have died had not another hurled himself in front of him and taken the final fatal blow in his own heart a brave and good man i said perhaps certainly a most unusual one for it was ned blundy who sacrificed himself in this fashion and died for a man he detested and permitted the restoration of that monarchy he had spent his life opposing i stared at him blankly at this extraordinary tale thurloe smiled when he saw my incomprehension and shrugged an honorable man who believed injustice and saw none in murder perhaps i am certain sir james had not consulted him in any way over what he intended i can give no greater explanation to you of his motives and think none is probably neededblundy was a good soldier and loyal comrade but i never once heard of him killing unnecessarily or acting with any cruelty to his enemies i am sure he was happy to save prestcotts life but not to assist prestcott in killing another even if it was a king and sir james why did you not kill him it seems to be your preferred solution in such cases he was not an easy man to kill the meeting took place with the very minimum of people and almost no guards sc pursuit was impossiblewe relied on secrecy rather than force for safety so sir james escaped with few difficulties after the attack and daily we expected to hear that he had put his knowledge into circulation on both sides we hunted furiously but to no avail we could not say what he had done as that would have involved revealing the depths of our talks and so our only hope was to discredit him in advance so that if he did speak out no one would believe him samuel did his usual competent job forging letters and there were enough people amongst the kings men who could be bribed to accept the situation without too much enquiry prestcott fled abroad and died it is ironic he was the worst of traitors to his king but was entirely innocent of the crimes of which he was accused your problem at least was at an end no it was not he would not have acted in such a desperate way on ned blundys word alone he insisted on seeing evidence and ned provided it what sort of evidence letters memoranda dockets dates of meetings and the names of people at them a great deal of material and he did not use it thurloe smiled sadly indeed not i was forced to conelude that he did not have it that ned blundy had kept it together with the key to the ciphers which hid their meanings and this was the man samuel mentioned yes shortly before his death blundy visited his family for the last time it was reasonable to conclude he must have left it with them on such a matter he could rely on no one else not even the oldest comrade in arms i had their house searched on several occasions but discovered nothing but i am certain that either the girl or her mother knew where it was and that they were the only ones to know blundy was too sensible to trust others with such a secret and they are dead they cant tell you where it is now precisely nor can they tell jack prestcott thurloe smiled which is the greatest relief of all because if he had that material then he could have asked for an earldom and half a county and the king would have given it to him and clarendon would have fallen without a murmur and this is what you told prestcott i would give him i said merely you would give him information which you can now do since i have passed it on to you you know already what prestcotts information is no but i must be strictly honest and say that i can guess what it is and you decided not to tell me so i would have that girl killed that is correct i would have preferred to have those documents of blundys so i could destroy them but as that seemed unlikely to come about it was best no one else should have them either they would damage the standing and safety of too many people including myself you had me commit murder for your own ends i said flatly appalled by the mans ruthlessness i told you power is not for the squeamish doctor he said quietly and what have you lost you want your revenge on cola and his patrons and prestcott will let you have it then he signaled for prestcott to be brought and the youth came in preening himself in satisfaction at his own skill at least i was sure that would not last long i had agreed to spare him from trial but i knew the knowledge he would have from my lips would be a greater punishment nor was i in a mood to spare him anything he began with lengthy and hypocritical assertions of his great gratitude to me for my kindness and mercy these i cut short brusquely i knew what i had done and i wanted no congratulations it was necessary but my hatred and contempt for the man who had forced me to it knew few bounds thurloe i believe saw my impatience and anger and intervened before i became too outraged the question is mr prestcott who has guided you to your conclusions who gave you the hints and suggestions which have led you to your conviction about mordaunts guilt you have told me much about your enquiries but you have not told all and i do not like to be deceived he flushed at the accusation and attempted to pretend he was not frightened of the threat implicit in thurloes quiet gentle voice thurloe who could be more terrifying with less effort than any man i knew sat out the bluster i say again you have not told something by your own account you had never heard of sir samuel morland yet found out much about him and his interests quite easily you had no introduction to lord bedfords steward yet were received by him and found him free with all manner of information how did you know to do this why would such a man have talked to you this was the critical moment in your quest was it not before that all was dark and obscure after it everything was clear and lucid someone told you mordaunt was a traitor someone told you of his connection to samuel morland and encouraged you in your quest before then all was suspicion and halfformed idea prestcott still refused to answer but hung his head like a schoolboy caught cheating in his work i hope you are not going to tell us you made it all up dr wallis here has taken substantial risks on your behalf and has entered into a bargain with you that contract will be null and void unless you fulfill your side of it eventually he raised his head and stared at thurloe a strange and i would have said almost maniacal smile on his face i had it from a friend a friend how kind of him would you care to share the name of this friend i felt myself leaning forward in anticipation of his reply for i was sure his next words would answer the question for which i had risked so much kitty he said and i stared at him in total puzzlement the name meant nothing to me at all kitty thurloe repeated as imperturbable as ever kitty and he is she she is or was a whore a very wellinformed one it seems she is now very wellplaced in her trade it is extraordinary is it not how fortune favors some people when i first met her she was walking to tunbridge to ply her trade six months later she is comfortably installed as the mistress of one of the greatest men in the land thurloe smiled encouragingly in that bland way of his she is a girl of great good sense prestcott continued before her rise i was kind to her and when i encountered her by chance in london she paid me back handsomely by retelling gossip she had heard by chance yes i was walking around and she saw me and approached me she happened to be passing im sure she was now this great man who keeps her his name is prestcott drew himself more upright in the chair my lord of bristol he said but i beg you not to say i told you i promised my discretion i sighed heavily not only because my case was advanced immeasurably but also because prestcotts answer was so obviously true just as it was not in mr bennets character to risk all on a throw so it was very much in that of bristol to chance all he had so recklessly he thought of himself as the kings greatest adviser although in truth he had no office and little authority his open catholicism had debarred him from position and in all matters he was bested by clarendon on policy it rankled for he was undoubtedly a man of great courage and loyalty who had been by the kings side as long as any and shared exile and poverty with him he was a man of extraordinary qualities and had as good an education as any man of that age a graceful and beautiful person with great eloquence in discourse he was equal to a good part in any affair but was the unfittest man alive to conduct it for great though his qualities were his vanity and ambition far exceeded them and he had a confidence in his capacities which often intoxicated transported and exposed him he espoused policies of the smallest prudence and the greatest hazard but did so with such sweet reason that they seemed the only course to take it would not be difficult to persuade others that he had attempted clarendons murder for he was perfectly capable of inventing such a foolishness you may rest assured that we will not betray your trust thurloe said i must thank you young man you have been very helpful prestcott looked puzzled and that is it you want no more of me later maybe but not at the moment in that case he said turning to me you will favor me with one further piece of information as well the evidence of mordaunts guilt which mr thurloe tells me undoubtedly exists where is it to be found who has it even in my mood of blackness i felt the ability to pity him then he was stupid and deluded cruel and credulous by turns violent in deed and soul full of bile and superstition a monster of perversion but his one genuine feeling was the reverential love he had for his father and his faith in his honesty was so direct it had carried him through all his journeys and troubles that goodness had been so corrupted by rancor it was hard to see the virtuous kernel within and yet it was there i took no pleasure in extinguishing it nor in telling him that his cruelty made him the author of his own ultimate misfortune there was only one person who knew where it was and the name sir i will go there directly he leaned forward eagerly a look of unsuspecting anticipation on his youthful countenance her name is sarah blundy the person you insisted must die you have stopped her mouth for good and that proof will now remain hidden forever for she must have hidden it well you will now never prove your fathers innocence nor get your estates back you name will be forever tarnished with the title of traitor it is a just punishment for your sins you must live knowing you are the author of your own misfortunes he sat back again with a knowing smile you are making fun of me sir it is your way perhaps but i must ask you to be more direct with me tell me the truth please i told him again adding more details then still more details until the smirk faded from his face and his hands began to tremble i say again i took no pleasure in it and though it was just i took no satisfaction either in the hideous additional punishment that was then meted out to him for as i told him precisely how his father had betrayed the king and come close even to murdering him his voice fell into a growl and the hideous demonic look that came over his twisted and contorted features frightened even thurloe i believe it was well that he had not lost his old habits of caution and had a servant in the background ready for all eventualities as i finished prestcott launched himself at my throat and would surely have torn the very life from me had he been granted just a few more seconds before being manhandled to the ground as a priest i necessarily believe in the possession of men by demons but i think that i had always used the notion in careless thoughtless ways i could not have been more wrong and those skeptics who disbelieve in such things are deluded by their own vanity there are indeed demons and they can take over the bodies and souls of men and drive them to frenzies of malice and destruction prestcott was all the proof i could ever need to persuade me to put aside skepticism forever for no human form would be capable of the violent bestiality i saw in that room the monstrous devil in prestcott i believe had controlled his thoughts and deeds for many months but in such careful subtle ways that its presence was unsuspected now it was finally frustrated its fury and violent activity burst out in hideous extremity making him roll on the floor scratching the boards with his fingernails until the blood spurted from them and was dragged in thin red lines down the grain of the wood it took a great effort to restrain him and even we were unable to stop him crashing his head time and again against the furniture and trying to bite us whenever we incautiously put a hand near him and he screamed hideous obscenities all the while although fortunately most of the words could not be made out and continued thrashing around until he was bound and gagged and taken to the university prison there to wait the arrival of some member of his family to take him in charge i would have left for london immediately even had i not been told by mr wood of all people that cola had fled oxford after hearing of sarah blundys death both she and the mother were now dead and i felt that at the very least some of his plans were frustrated his ability to communicate with those supposedly assisting him was greatly diminished enough to make any further sojourn in oxford useless to him more importantly i considered he must have heard of prestcotts descent into frenzyif thurloe was right and the first attempt on clarendon was to be through the young lunatic then he would have realized that the move had failed and it was now time for him to act this thought more than any other prompted me to leave as speedily as possible the journey was as tedious as ever and i lurched along conscious that my quarry was but a few hours ahead of me but no one at charing cross recalled someone answering his description when i arrived and asked questions so i went directly to whitehall where mr bennet was most likely to be found and sent in a message begging the favor of an interview with the utmost urgency he saw me within an hour i resented the delay but had prepared myself for an even greater one i hope this is indeed important doctor he said as i entered his chamber which i was relieved to see was empty save for himself it is unlike you to cause such a commotion i believe it is sir so tell me what is on your mind now still concerned with plots indeed before i explain i must ask a question of the greatest importance when i informed you of my suspicions a few weeks ago did you communicate this to anyone anyone at all he shrugged and frowned at the implied criticism i may have done it is important i would not ask otherwise less than two days after i spoke to you cola murdered my most trusted servant whose name i gave you he then came to oxford and attempted to kill me also he knew i had a copy of a letter of his and he stole it along with another i have kept by me for years i have since become convinced that the man who has organized his presence here is lord bristol what i must know is whether you informed his lordship of my suspicions mr bennet said nothing for a long while and i could see that his acute and rapid mind was assessing every aspect of what i said and every implication of my words as well i hope you do not suggest had i done so i would hardly have raised the subject with you but your loyalty to your friends is well known and you would not expect any man so indebted to the king to act against his interest and i believe colas target is not the king but the lord chancellor this surprised him and i could see that all now began to make sense to his mind in a way it had not before the answer to your question is that i believe i did mention it to lord bristol or at least to one of his entourage and his relations with lord clarendon are as bad as ever they are but not so bad that i can easily consider he would act in such a way he is given to mad schemes but i have always considered him too weak to achieve much perhaps i underestimated him you had best tell me exactly why you conclude this i did so and mr bennet listened with the greatest gravity throughout not even interrupting when i confessed to having been in consultation with john thurloe when i finished he again said nothing for a long while well well he said at last a string to hang an earl it is difficult to credit and yet i must do so the question is how to deal with the situation cola must be stopped and bristol punished mr bennet looked at me with contempt yes of course it is easier said than done however do you know what colas plans are not in detail how he communicates with lord bristol no whether there be any letters or hard evidence that he has ever done so no and you expect me to do what charge his lordship with high treason perhaps you forget perhaps that just as i am your patron so he is mine if i am to break with him then i must justify myself absolutely or be accused of perfidy if lord bristol falls half the court falls with him and there will be few restraints on clarendon and even fewer on the king the economy of the entire government will be disrupted and crippled i tell you dr wallis i find it hard to credit that the man can risk so much he does he must be stopped and you must take his place bennet looked at me i do not flatter you or tell you anything you do not feel in your own heart your value to his majesty is well known your usefulness in balancing the interests of lord clarendon would be equally clear lord bristols lack of moderation has prevented him from doing that you can and can do so the better if you are free of his foolishness you have to break with him and pull him down yourself if you do not you can be certain that he will fall anyway and you will go down with him still he stared at me but i was emboldened to continue for i knew that i was speaking to his soul you are bound to him as a man who has brought you up and advanced you and i know you have repaid that debt loyally and well but you are not obliged to aid him in evil and his attempt at such a thing dissolves all ties finally he reacted to my words and rested his head in his hands his elbows on the desk the most informal posture i had ever seen him adopt throw the dice you think doctor and if clarendon is killed anyway and bristol actually succeeds what mercy for me and mine then have you thought how long you would retain your position not many weeks but i doubt i would live long in any case so the loss of office would be a minor problem for me i have long considered what my true degree should be at court you no doubt think me ambitious and so i am but i am also a good servant to his majesty and whatever my own beliefs i have always advised him for the best i deserve the highest places in the land clarendon has always blocked me as he blocks all who are younger and more agile than he and you tell me that i have to abandon a man who has always been kind to me and keep in power one who detests the very air i breathe i am not saying you should keep him in power i am merely pointing out that you must not in any way associate yourself with his murder and to stay silent is such an association mr bennet considered then gave way as i knew he would in due course do you plan to confront lord bristol or inform lord clarendon i asked the latter i have no desire to level accusations others can do that come dr wallis you must come as well i had never before met the lord chancellor of england in person although i had naturally seen him on numerous occasions his grotesque corpulence did not surprise me although the ease with which we gained access to him did he maintained little formality about his person no doubt his years in exile when he lived a handtomouth existence and often even had to do without so much as a servant had taught him the virtues of simplicityalthough i noted that similar deprivation had imparted no such lesson to mr bennet as mr thurloe had said he was a man of the utmost loyalty to his master the king who had on numerous occasions treated his servant shabbily and was in future years to treat him more shabbily still nonetheless clarendon stood resolutely by him steering him away from such follies as he could he worked tirelessly while in exile for his majestys return and strove mightily to keep him there once this great goal was accomplished his great weakness was that which attends many older men for he placed too great store on the wisdom of age no doubt deference is a virtue but to expect it without question is great foolishness and stirs up only resentment mr bennet was one whom he had needlessly antagonized for in their common good sense they were natural allies but clarendon blocked bennets friends on all occasions and would rarely allow the spoils of office to go to anyone outside his own circle the antagonism between the two men was scarcely discernible however mr bennets punctiliousness and clarendons natural gravity meant that anyone less observant or less knowing than myself would have assumed that relations between the two were entirely cordial but they were far from that and i also knew that underneath the coolness of his manner mr bennet was certainly highly anxious of the outcome of this meeting when dealing with matters of true importance mr bennet was not a man to disguise his meaning with elaborate phrases or halfspoken implications he introduced me as his servant and i bowed then he announced curtly that i had a matter of the utmost importance to communicate clarendons eyes narrowed as he recalled who i was i am surprised to see you in such company doctor you seem able to serve many masters i serve god and the government sir i replied the former because it is my duty the latter because am asked to do so were my services not required and requested i would happily live in pleasant obscurity he ignored this reply and walked heavily about the room in which we had found him mr bennet stood silently a look of barely concealed disquiet on his face he knew that his future rested entirely on how i conducted myself in the encounter dye find me fat sir the question was obviously addressed to me the lord chancellor of england came to rest in front of me wheezing with the effort of taking a few steps his hands resting on his hips as he spoke i looked him steadily in the eye of course i do i said he grunted with satisfaction then hobbled over to his seat and sat down gesturing to us that we might do the same many men have looked me straight in the eye as you did and sworn blind that the resemblance to adonis was extraordinary he observed such is the power of high office it can even distort mens sight it seems i throw such men out now mr bennet tell me what it is that makes you overcome your detestation for me and why you bring this gentleman with you i will allow dr wallis to speak if that is agreeable to you he has all the information at his fingertips and it will sound better from him the chancellor turned to me and i once more recited my tale as briefly as possible again i must confess all my weaknesses for this narration is of no use if i behave in an italian manner and leave out what is not in my interest i did not tell lord clarendon about sarah blundy i had lived with the facts for so long now that none of it even surprised me anymore it was instructive to see how more ordinary men if i may for a moment call the lord chancellor such reacted to accusations i now took for granted clarendons face grew stony and pale as i laid out my investigations and conclusions his jaw clenched hard in anger and eventually he was unable even to look at the bearer of such news there was a long a very long silence when i finished mr bennet would not speak the chancellor it seemed could not for my part i considered my role over i had done my task and reported my findings to those with the power to act i was aware of the momentous thing i had done and realized anew the tremendous power of words which can tumble men from on high in an instant and accomplish more in a few sentences than entire armies in a years campaign for men are held above their fellows by the gossamer of reputation which is so soft and fragile a breath can blow it away eventually clarendon spoke and subjected me to the closest interrogation i have ever endured in my life he was a lawyer and like all lawyers loved nothing more than the chance to show off his skills in questioning my interrogation went on for the better part of an hour and i answered as best i could calmly and without resentment again i will be open about the matter for the most part my answers satisfied him but his skill probed my case mercilessly and whatever weaknesses existed were soon laid out for him to inspect so dr wallis your belief in mr colas military skills comes from a trader who conveyed him to venice from italy i replied he had no reason to lie to me as he did not know of my interest in the man he was not of any breeding but i consider him a reliable witness nonetheless he reported what he saw and heard my conclusions are in no part based on his opinions and colas links with radicals well attested by my informants in the low countries and by my own servant he also formed a strong connection with a notorious family in oxford with sir william compton he was seen by a reliable witness at sir williams house and stayed there for many days they discussed you on several occasions the route you planned to take in a few weeks time and expressed the hope you might be ambushed on the road with my lord bristol sir william is of lord bristols interest as i am sure you know so is mr bennet here i told mr bennet of my suspicions before i had any inkling of who colas master was he told lord bristol and within twentyfour hours my servant was murdered by cola i was myself the target of an attack a few days later that is insufficient it is but it is not all lord bristol is known to favor a spanish alliance and cola also has strong connections with the governor of the netherlands he is a known catholic and hence does not acknowledge the authority of the king parliament or the laws of this country and it is not the first time he has attempted a foolish scheme moreover his hand has guided a young man for many months in an attempt to attack you by destroying the reputation of lord mordaunt eventually i had no more clarendon would be convinced or not it is a strange business trying to persuade a man he is to be killed and it says much for lord clarendon that he wanted good reason before he would own himself satisfied many men less than he would have happily leaped at the suspicion and invented any extra evidence in order to destroy a rival but they have never met no man has seen them together there are no letters no one has overheard any conversation between them i shook my head no but i would doubt if it is likely common sense dictates that all contact be through a third party clarendon leaned back in his chair and i heard the joints creaking from the strain mr bennet had sat quite impassively throughout showing no sign of emotion on his face neither helping me nor hindering me he was entirely quiet until clarendon turned to him you are convinced of this sir i am convinced you may well be in danger and that all possible means should be taken to prevent any harm coming to you that is generous from a man who loves me so little no you are his majestys closest minister and it is the duty of all to protect you as the king himself if the king chose to dismiss you i would not exert myself to prevent your fall you know that i am sure but it is as treasonable for anyone else to force his majesty as it is criminal to kill a man outside the law if bristol wishes this i will have none of him do you think he does that is the question is it not i do not intend to sit here and see whether a knife in my back proves dr wallis correct i cannot charge lord bristol with treason for the case is not strong enough and the king would see any attempt to prosecute as a misuse of my office and i will not adopt such methods myself you have in the past mr bennet said rarely and i will not in this case lord bristol has been at the kings side and his fathers side before that for more than twenty years and i have been with him we shared exile despair and deprivation together i loved him as a brother and do still i cannot harm him the discourse which passed between the two men continued in such a way moderation subtlety and regret being the only emotions and feelings they expressed this is the way of the courtier who talks in a code more deep and impenetrable than any of the petty conspirators who were my daily antagonists i do not even doubt that they meant everything that they said but left unsaid and understood by each other beneath the words a more pitiless conversation was taking place with each man bargaining and plotting how to turn the situation i had created to their own advantage i do not despise them for this each man believed i am sure that the triumph of him and his was for the general good nor do i think such flexibility an error in the past few years england had suffered greatly at the hands of rigid men of principle who would not bend and could not change that clarendon and mr bennet competed for the kings favor added luster to his majestys glory forcing that favor taking away his right to choose was the sin of parliament in the past and lord bristol in the present that was why both had to be opposed nor was i surprised that both men wished to comprehend fully the potential damage to themselves of bristols fall for the consequences would be great as they are whenever a mighty interest collapses the digby family which he headed had a strong following in the house of commons and in the west country many of his friends and family had been placed at court and in offices of state removing lord bristol was one thing rooting out his family was another i hope we may take it that this italian must be stopped the chancellor said with the first glimmerings of a smile i had seen since i had told him my information that is the beginning the more serious problem if i may put it so is lord bristol i do not wish to accuse him let alone bring articles of impeachment against him myself will you do so mr bennet he shook his head i cannot too many of his people are my people as well it would tear us apart and i would not be trusted again i will not support him but cannot plunge a knife into his back they both fell silent willing the end yet shrinking from the deed eventually i ventured to speak somewhat abashed at offering counsel to such people without being asked but confident that my skills matched theirs perhaps he can bring about his own fall i said both men looked at me gravely wondering whether to upbraid me for having spoken or encourage me to continue eventually clarendon nodded that i had his permission to speak lord bristol is foolhardy easily wounded in vanity and honor and excessively fond of grand gestures this he has demonstrated he must be forced to act in a way which is so intemperate and foolish that even the king becomes exasperated with him and how do you suggest we accomplish this he has made an attempt i think through this young man called prestcott which has now failed then cola must also be stopped afterward he must be goaded and provoked until he loses all reason it would take some considerable time to hire another killer many months at least you must whittle away at his position quickly before he can try again for example there are many things you might do he is steward of my university you might suggest he be relieved of the post on the grounds of his catholicism eject some of his supporters from their positions that will not provoke merely irritate my lord may i speak plainly clarendon nodded your daughter married the duke of york against your will and without your knowledge clarendon nodded slowly ready to anger mr bennet sat absolutely still watching me as i spoke the most dangerous words i had ever uttered even to mention the notorious match to the chancellor could end a mans career for it had nearly ended his when it became known it was rash even to allude to it and even rasher to bring it up as i was about to do as best i could i ignored the cold and stony look from the chancellor and pretended not to notice that mr bennets support was manifestly absent i hesitate to recommend such a course but my lord bristol must be made to think that her majesty the queen is barren and that you were well aware of this when you advocated the match there was dead total silence after i uttered the words and i feared that i would bring his wrath upon me again he surprised me rather than erupting in fury he merely asked in a cold frigid voiceand how would that serve lord bristol is jealous of your ascendancy if he believes for certain that you connived to place your own daughter on the throne by exploiting the queens incapacity he will be consumed with jealousy at your prospects and could be persuaded to try and impeach you in the house of commons if mr bennet refuses to support such a move at the crucial moment it will fail and the king will have to deal with a man who has tried publicly to usurp his authority by forcing his chief minister out he would have to act to preserve the crowns reputation how would this tale be put into circulation a young colleague of mine at oxford dr lower is greatly desirous of making his way in london were you to favor him i am sure he would allow it to be said that he had been called in secret to examine the queen and found clear evidence of her barrenness naturally if put on oath mr lower would tell the truth and deny he had performed any such examination of course mr bennet intervened you have no choice if you accept this proposition but to trust that i will come out in your support at that crucial moment i am happy to give you my word but on such a matter as this do not expect it will be enough i think sir that ways can be found to make it in your interest to keep your word bennet nodded that is all i ask you agree to this idea i said in astonishment that it should meet with so little resistance or objection i believe so i will endeavor to use the fall of lord bristol to bolster my position as the kings chief minister mr bennet will use it to strengthen his so that he might pull me down in due course that comes afterward however for the time being we must consider ourselves allies in a common and necessary purpose and the italian must not cause any troubles bennet said he cannot be arrested nor brought to any account where he can speak the government cannot afford to be shaken by tales of treason so close in amongst the kings friends he must be killed i said lend me some soldiers and i will ensure it is done and this too was agreed i left the meeting some time later confident that my duty was complete and that now i could concentrate on my personal vengeance after this encounter clarendon kept to his house surrounded by guards and put it out that his gout a real complaint for he was tormented by the disease mercilessly and had been for many years past was upon him again his visit to cornbury was canceled and he cowered at home leaving only to make the short journey from piccadilly to whitehall to wait on the king and i hunted for cola using all the powers i had been given to search out his whereabouts i had fifty soldiers ready for use and every informer was pressed into service all of the radicals i could lay my hands on were arrested in case the italian had taken refuge with them the spanish ambassadors house was discreetly watched back and front and i had people going around nearly every tavern inn and hostel asking for information the docks were watched as well and i asked my merchant friend mr williams to put it abroad that any foreigner asking for a passage was to be reported to me immediately the french i believe do these things more effectively as they can call on what they term a police to ensure order in their towns after the experience of searching for cola i came to think that such a body might be of some use in london as well although there seems no chance of it ever being established perhaps with such a force cola might have been found more quickly perhaps he might not have come so close to accomplishing his aim all i knew was that for three days of disappointment i searched in vain there was not even a whisper of the man which i considered incredible for one normally so noticeable that he was in london was certain there was nowhere else for him to go but it was as if he had dissolved into the air like a spirit i had of course to make regular reports to lord clarendon and mr bennet about my progress and i could sense their ebbing confidence as day after day i told them of my failure mr bennet said nothing directly but i knew him well enough to see that my own position was now at stake as well and that i had to find the italian speedily if i was not to lose his support the visit on the fourth day of my search was the worst for i had to stand throughout the interview once more and suffer his evergrowing coldness which bore heavily on me as i walked afterward across the courtyards of the palace to the river then i stopped for i knew that i had detected something of the utmost importance but could not instantly place in my mind what it could be but i had a presentiment of the greatest danger which would not leave me however much i thought and tried to discover what idea had been raised in my mind it was a beautiful morning i remember and i had decided to revive my spirits by walking from mr bennets quarters across cotton garden then through a small passageway into st stephens court to get to westminster stairs it was in this little passageway enclosed by heavy oak doors at either end that the worry came upon me first but i shrugged it off and continued to walk only as i stood on the quayside and was about to get into my boat did the understanding come to me and i immediately made my way as swiftly as possible back to the nearest guards sound the alarm i said once i had established with him my authority there is an assassin in the building i gave him a swift description of the italian then returned to mr bennet and burst in on him without this time waiting for any formalities he is here i said he is in the palace mr bennet looked skeptical you have seen him no i smelled him i beg your pardon i smelled him in the corridor he wears a particular perfume which is quite unmistakable and which no englishman would ever use i smelled it believe me sir he is here bennet grunted and what have you done about it i have alerted the guards and they are beginning to search where is the king and the chancellor the king is at his prayers and the chancellor is not here you must place extra guards mr bennet nodded and straightaway summoned some officials and began giving orders for the first time i think i understood why his majesty held him in such high regard for he acted calmly and without any show of disturbance but moved with the greatest dispatch within minutes guards were surrounding the king the prayers were brought to an early conclusionalthough not so hastily that any alarm was given to the attending courtiersand small parties of soldiers fanned out across the palace with its hundreds of rooms and courtyards and corridors searching for the intruder i hope you are right sir mr bennet said as we watched a small party of officials being stopped and scrutinized if you are not then you will not have to answer to me then i saw the man i had sought for so many days mr bennet occupied a set of rooms on the corner with one pair of windows giving out onto the thames the other onto the alleyway leading to parliament stairs and down this walking calmly from old palace yard past the princes lodgings i saw a familiar figure without any shadow of a doubt it was cola as cool as ever though dressed less conspicuously looking for all the world as though he had a perfect right to be there there i shouted grabbing mr bennet by the shoulder it took him a long time to forgive the action there he is quickly now without waiting i ran from the room down the stairs shouting for guards to follow me as swiftly as possible and i stood like horatius codes himself barring the way to parliament stairs the waiting boats and colas only chance of escape i had no notion of what to do next i was quite unarmed perfectly alone and without any means of defending myself against a man whose murderous skills were well attested but my desire and my duty impelled me forward for i was determined he should not escape me and the revenge i was bound to seek had cola pulled his weapon and lunged at me the moment he saw me standing in front of him his escape would have been certain and my death equally assured i had only surprise in my armory and i was quite aware that it was but a feeble weapon it worked nonetheless for when cola did see me he was so astonished that he did not know how to react dr wallis he said and even managed a smile of what could almost have passed as pleasure you were the last person i expected to see here i am aware of that might i enquire what you are doing i am seeing the sights sir he replied before beginning my journey home which i plan to do tomorrow i think not i said with relief for i could see soldiers approaching over the courtyard i think your journey is already at an end he turned round to see what i was looking at then his face frowned with puzzlement and dismay i am betrayed i see he said and i breathed a great sigh of relief he was taken with no fuss or disturbance to a room off fish yard and i went with him mr bennet went to find his majesty that he might be informed of events and also i believe to inform lord clarendon that the danger was at an end for my part i felt dizzy with my success and gave thanks that i had discovered the man before rather than after he had caused any damage i saw him locked in then began to question him closely although for all the information i collected i might as well have saved my breath colas bravado amazed me for he affected to be delighted at the sight of me despite the circumstances he was pleased he said to see an old face i have felt myself very solitary since i left your fine town dr walks he said i do not find the people of london greatly welcoming i cannot imagine why but you were hardly a popular figure in oxford when you left either he looked distressed at the comment it seems not although i am quite unaware of what i did to deserve such churlishness you have heard of my dispute with mr lower i imagine he mistreated me very badly i do not mind telling you and i am at a loss to explain why i shared all my ideas with him and was sorely treated in return maybe he learned more about you than your ideas and was not pleased to be harboring such a person no man likes to be deceived and if he was too gentlemanly to challenge you openly it is not discourteous to indicate annoyance a crafty look of caution came over his bland wide face as he sat down opposite and studied me with what seemed to be vague amusement i suppose i have to thank you for that do i mr lower told me you were forever burrowing your nose in other peoples business and occupying yourself with matters that were none of your affair i may claim that honor i said determined not to be drawn by his offensive tone i act for the good of the country and its legitimate government im glad to hear it so should all men do so i like to think of myself as equally loyal i believe you are you proved that in candia did you not his eyes narrowed at my demonstration of knowledge i was not aware that my fame had spread so far and you knew sir james prestcott as well oh i see he replied a false understanding dawning you had it from that strange son of his you must not believe everything you hear from that young man he has the most bizarre of delusions about anything and anyone connected to his honored father he is quite capable of inventing any tale about me in order to reflect glory on that poor man i can hardly think of sir james as a poor man can you not i met him under different circumstances when he was reduced to selling his sword for hire and with scarcely a penny to his name a sad fall that when no one of his fellows would reach out a hand to help him can you really condemn him so much what loyalty did he owe anyone by then he was the bravest of men the most courageous of comrades and i honor his memory as much as i lament his end and so you come to england yourself and tell no one of your own bravery a period of my life which is entirely at an end i do not wish to recall it you associate with the kings enemies wherever you go they are not my enemies i associate with whomever pleases me and whom i find good company i want my letters back the ones you stole from my room he paused then smiled i know of no letters sir search me and my belongings if you wish but i may say i resent the imputation that i am a thief such things should not be said lightly by one gentleman to another tell me about my lord bristol i must say i am not acquainted with the gentleman his face was entirely passive and he looked me evenly and unflinchingly in the eye as he came out with this denial of course not i said nor have you heard of lord clarendon he oh indeed who could not have heard of the lord chancellor naturally i have heard of him although i do not know what the question signifies tell me about sir william compton cola sighed what a lot of questions you ask sir william as you know was a friend of sir james he told me that if i ever came on a tour to england that sir william would be glad to offer me hospitality which he most generously did and was attacked for his pains not by me as that seems to be the implication of your statement i understand young prestcott did that i merely kept him alive and no one will deny i did a fine job sir james prestcott betrayed sir william compton and was detested by him you expect me to believe he would willingly ask you into his house he did as for the detestation i saw no sign of it whatever enmity there was must have died with him you discussed the murder of the lord chancellor with sir william the change in the italians demeanor as i made this statement was remarkable from an easygoing affability the manner of a man who feels himself in no danger at all he stiffened only slightly but the difference was extreme from here on i could sense he watched his words more carefully at the same time though the air of amusement persisted in some fashion as though he was still confident enough to anticipate no great danger for himself is that what this is about we discussed many things including an ambush on the road to cornbury english roads i gather are full of perils for the unwary do you deny you placed a bottle with poison in it for me to drink that night in new college here he began to look exasperated dr walks you are beginning to weary me greatly you ask about the attack on sir william compton even though jack prestcott was charged with the crime and all but owned his authorship by his escape you ask about the death of dr grove even though that girl was not only hanged for the offense but even confessed to it quite voluntarily you ask about discussions on lord clarendons safety even though i am here quite openly in london and the chancellor is in excellent health may that happy state continue for him so what is your purpose you do not deny either that you killed my servant matthew in london in march here he affected an air of puzzlement once more you lose me again sir who is matthew my face must have shown the full coldness of my anger as he looked disconcerted for the first time you know perfectly well who matthew is the lad you so generously took under your wing in the low countries the one you took to your feast and debauched the one you met again in london and murdered so coldbloodedly when all he ever wanted from you was friendship and love colas flippant air had now evaporated and he twisted and turned like a fish to avoid confronting what even he knew was his duplicity and cowardice i remember a young lad in the hague he said although his name was not matthew or so he told me the outrageous charge of debauchery i will not even dignify with an answer for i know not where it originates as for murder i merely deny it i admit that i was set upon by a cutpurse shortly after i arrived in london i admit i defended myself as best i could and ran off the moment i could the identity of my assailant and his condition when we parted company i cannot vouch for although i did not think him so badly injured if someone died i am sorry for it if it was this boy i am sorry for that as well although i certainly did not recognize him and would not have hurt him if i had however much he had deceived me but i would advise you in future to pick your servants with more care and not give employment to people who supplement their wages with nighttime thievery the cruelty of this statement cut through me like colas sword cut matthews throat and i wished at that moment i had a knife of my own or more freedom to act or a soul which could encompass taking the life of another but cola knew full well that i was under constraint he must have sensed it the moment i arrived and he used his knowledge to bait and torment me be very careful what you say sir i said barely controlling my voice i can do you great harm if i wish it was for the time being an empty threat and he must have sensed it also for he laughed easily and with contempt you will do what your masters tell you to do doctor as do we all i draw now to an end all else i heard of at second hand or saw as an observer and i do not presume to comment at length on matters better left to others i was however on the quay the next day when cola was brought to the boat i watched the carriage roll up and saw the italian with a carefree spring in his step march down the gangplank onto the deck he even saw me and smiled and bowed ironically in my direction before disappearing below i did not wait to see the boat get under way but took a carriage back to my house and left for oxford only after i had heard from the captain of the vessel himself that cola and his luggage had been tipped into the water some fifteen miles away from the shore and in such heavy weather that he could not have survived for long even though my revenge was complete it brought me little satisfaction and it took many months before anything of my old calm returned my happiness never did eventually mr bennet now lord arlington insisted on my services again my reluctance and distaste proved no defense against his desires in the months in between much had happened the alliance of clarendons and bennets interests held long enough for both to accomplish their aims faced with the destruction of his plan of murder the open rumor that in due course lord clarendons daughter would sit on the throne of england and the constant harassment of his people bristol hazarded all and tried to impeach the chancellor of treason in parliament it excited nothing but ridicule and contempt and bennet dissociated himself from the move what assurances of support he had given bristol in advance to tempt him into action i do not know his majesty was so offended by the attempt to force the removal of his minister that he exiled bristol to the continent clarendons position was strengthened and bennet received his reward by adopting as his own many of bristols family more importantly the prospect of a spanish alliance received a mortal blow and was never mooted again the understanding between the two men could not last long both of them knew that and all the world knows how it ended lord clarendon as good a servant as a king ever had was eventually forced into exile himself confronting from his poverty in france the ingratitude of his king the cruelty of his comrades and the open avowal of catholicism by his daughter bennet rose to take his place and ultimately he too fell from power toppled by another as he had toppled clarendon such is politics and such are politicians but for a while at least my efforts safeguarded the kingdom the discontented though well funded from spain could achieve nothing when faced by a government undistracted by division i am still constantly aware so many years later of the terrible cost of this triumph all was caused by my desire to punish the man who had brought me such sorrow and now i discover that this man whom i hated as much as i loved matthew eluded my grasp and escaped my wrath i performed ignoble deeds and even so was frustrated of my revenge i know in my heart that i was betrayed as the captain of that vessel who told me plain he had seen cola drown would not have dared lie to me unless he was frightened of another more powerful still but i do not know who took these decisions to spare cola and hide it from me nor yet why they were taken nor do i have much chance now of discoveringthurloe bristol clarendon they are all dead bennet sulks in his gloomy retirement and talks to no man lower and prestcott manifestly do not know and i cannot imagine mr cola will deign to enlighten me the only person i have not talked to is that man wood but i am certain he knows little except scraps and details of no significance i have never disguised what i have done though i have never advertised my deeds either i would not have done so now but for the arrival of this manuscript what i have done i own at least events proved me correct in all substance even those who would criticize me must take this into accounthad i not acted clarendon would have died and the country might well have been consumed once more that fact and that alone more than justifies all i did the injuries i suffered and those which i imposed on others and yet though i know this to be true the memory of that girl has begun to haunt me it was a sin to wash my hands of her and stay quiet while she was condemned to death i have known it always but never accepted it before now i was tricked by thurloe into that dreadful deed and was motivated solely by my desire for justice and always thought this excuse enough all is known to the highest judge of all and to him i must entrust my soul knowing that i have served him to the best of my ability in all my acts but often now late at night when i lie sleepless in my bed once more or when i am deep in the frustration of prayers which no longer come i fear my only hope of salvation is that his mercy will prove greater than was mine i no longer believe it will an instance of the fingerpost when in a search of any nature the understanding stands suspended then instances of the fingerpost shew the true and inviolable way in which the question is to be decided these instances afford great light so that the course of the investigation will sometimes be terminated by them sometimes indeed these instances are found amongst that i evidence already set down francis bacon novum orcanum scìentarum section xxxvi aphorism xxi a few weeks ago my old friend dick lower sent me this huge pile of paper saying that as i am a voracious collector of curios and suchlike perhaps i should have it for himself he was tempted to throw it all away such were the lies and sad contradictions it contained he said in a letter for he has now retired to dorset where he lives in considerable ease that he found the manuscripts wearisome two men it seems can see the same event yet both remember it falsely how he went on will we ever reach certainty on anything even when of good will he pointed out several instances in which he was a direct participant and said they had occurred in an entirely different fashion naturally one is the extraordinary attempt to decant new blood into widow blundy through a goose quill which signer cola claims as his own lower whom i know to be a very honest man disputes this account entirely he mentions two men you note cola and wallis though there be three manuscripts naturally he omits entirely that of jack prestcott as he is bound to do the law cannot punish and indeed takes no note of a man who is insane if his current actions are beyond reason how can his memories be trusted they are merely the babblings of disorder filtered through the distortions of disease prestcotts sad mind has thus transformed bedlam into his great house his head is not shaved for his wig as he says but to allow the application of vinegar to his frenzy those poor wretches who restrain the lunatics become his servants and the many visitors he complains of are those characters who pay their penny every saturday to peer through the iron bars of the cages and laugh at the madmen in their distress i have done it myself on the occasion recently when i went to talk to prestcott on the matter but i found no diversion or satisfaction in it but several of prestcotts statements are true i know it and admit it even though i have no cause to love him he went mad lower tells me when he was confronted with proof that his own malice had frustrated all his hopes and efforts and that the warnings he had received from that irishman were true after all perhaps so my point is that up to then he was more or less sane and so perhaps his recollections are as well even if the meaning he drags from them is entirely false it requires intelligence after all to present a case as he doeshad he kept his wits he might have been a fine advocate after all every single person he talked to told him that his father was guilty and he was with the greatest of skill he points to evidence of innocence and ignores all that which suggests the true depths of his fathers turpitude at the end i almost believed him even though i knew better than most that it was a tissue of nonsense but is the poor souls account any the less trustworthy than the others which are also twisted and distorted albeit by different passions prestcott may be mad but cola is a liar perhaps there is but one lie of commission in contrast to all the omissions and evasions which might otherwise be discounted he lies nonetheless for as ammian says veritas vel silentio consumpitur vel mendacio truth is violated by silence and by falsehood the falsity is contained in such an innocuous sentence it is not surprising that even wallis overlooked it but it distorts every other thing in the manuscript and makes truthful words false because like a schoolmans argument it draws conclusions with impeccable logic from a false premise marco da cola gentleman of venice respectfully presents his greetings so he begins and from there on every word must be considered carefully even the manuscripts existence must be considered for why did he write it at all after so many years on the other hand to say he is mendacious does not mean that the motives and deeds attributed to him by wallis are correct the venetian was not at all what he seemed nor what he claims now to be but he certainly never had designs on the safety of the kingdom or the life of lord clarendon and wallis himself was so used to living in the dark and sinister world of his own devising that he could no longer tell truth from invention or honesty from falsehood but how can i tell which assertion to believe and which to reject i cannot repeat the same events time and again with subtle variations as stahl did with his chemicals to demonstrate how dr grove had died even if i could the infallible philosophical method seems inadequate when it comes to problems in which motion derives from people rather than dead matter i once attended a class on chemistry given by mr stahl and must say i emerged none the wiser lowers own experiments on blood transfusion first produced the belief that this was the greatest cure for all ills and later when many people in france had died the savants decided that no on the contrary this was a fatal and inadmissible procedure it cannot be both gentlemen of philosophy if you are right now how were you so wrong before how is it that when a man of god shifts his opinion it proves the weakness of his views and when a man of science does so it demonstrates the value of his method how is a mere chronicler such as myself to transmute the lead of inaccuracy in these papers into the gold of truth my main qualification for commenting on these bundles is the disinterested state which is we are told the primum mobile of a balanced understandinglittle of this has anything to do with me second i think i can with justice claim a certain knowledgei have lived my entire life in oxford and know the city as even my detractors admit better than anyone else has ever done finally of course i knew all the actors in this drama lower was then my constant companion as we ate together at least once a week at mother jeans through him i met all the men of philosophy including signor cola i worked with dr wallis for many years when he was the keeper of the university archives and i was their most assiduous frequenter i even had the honor of discoursing with mr boyle and once attended a levee in the presence of my lord arlington although i regret to say i did not have the opportunity of making my addresses to him more than this i knew sarah blundy before her misfortune and not being a man given to puzzles and conundrums i will reveal my secret immediately for i knew her after it as well hanged dissected and burned though she was more i think i am the only person who can give a proper accounting of those days and show all the goodness which prompted such cruelty and the providential grace that brought out such malice on certain matters i can appeal to lower for we share many secrets but the crucial knowledge is mine alone and i must convince on my own authority and by the dexterity of my words curiously the less i am believed the more certain i will be that i am correct mr milton set out in his great poem to justify the ways of god to men as he says he has not considered one question howeverperhaps god has forbidden men to know his ways for if they did know the full extent of his goodness and the magnitude of our rejection of it they would be so disheartened they would abandon all hope of redemption and die of grief i am an historian and to this title i adhere despite critics who make out that i am what they term an antiquarian i believe truth can come only from a solid foundation of fact and i set myself from an early age to begin the task of building such a basis i intend no grandiose schemes for the history of the world mind you cannot build a palace before you have leveled the ground rather just as mr plot has written very finely the natural history of our county so i am engaged in its civil history and what a deal there is i thought it would take a few years of my life now i see i will die an old man and the task will still be unfinished i began once an early intention of the priesthood had left me by wishing to write about our late troubles during the siege when the parliament men first took the town then cleansed the university of those less than perfectly in agreement with them but i rapidly perceived that there was a nobler task awaiting me and that the entire history of the university might vanish forever were it not safeguarded so i abandoned my original work and began the greater one even though i had amassed considerable material by that stage and publication would undoubtedly have gained me both the fame in the world and the patronage of the mighty which have forever eluded my grasp however i care not for thisanimus hominis dives non arca appellari solet and if it be considered one of tullys paradoxes to say that it is a mans mind not his coffers which confers richness then that shows that the age of rome was just as blind and corrupt as our own it was because of this earlier work that i met both sarah blundy and her mother who will figure so much in my account i had heard of ned the old womans husband several times in my travels through the documents and although not a major figure in my tale of the siege the passions he aroused excited my curiosity a blackhearted villain the devils child worse than a murderer a man one shuddered to behold a latterday saint one of the manifest elect kind softspoken and generous two extremes of opinion and not much in between they could not both be correct and i wished to resolve the contradiction i knew that he took part in the mutiny of left the town when it was put down and as far as i was concerned left my story as welli did not know then whether he was alive or dead but he had taken a role in a matter which made something of a stir and it seemed a pity to miss the opportunity of an eyewitness account even that of a woman if i could not find the man himself when i discovered in the summer of that his family lived nearby i was apprehensive of the encounteranne blundy had a reputation for being a wise woman from those who did not dislike her or a witch from those less favorably inclined her daughter sarah was known to be wild and strange but had not yet gained that reputation for skill in healing which led mr boyle to wonder if any of her recipes could be used for the poor i must say however that neither the pathetic description offered by cola nor the cruel one of prestcott do the old woman any justice even though she was near fifty the fire in her eyes communicated to her daughter as well spoke of a lively soul wise she was perhaps although not in the way normally meantno muttering or shambling or obscure incantations shrewd rather i would say with an air of amusement which mingled strangely with a deep although heterodox piety nothing i saw ever gave an indication of the murderous harpy of walkss tale and yet i do believe that on this he speaks the truth more than most he has himself shown that we are all capable of the most monstrous evil when convinced we are right and it was an age when the madness of conviction held all tightly in its grasp gaining her confidence was no easy matter and i am not convinced i ever won it entirely certainly had i made my approach to her later when her husband was dead and the king was back on his throne she would inevitably have assumed i was sent to trap her especially as i knew dr wallis by then such a connection would have made her suspicious as she had no cause to love the new government and especial reason to fear wallis understandably soi learned soon enough to fear him myself then however i had not yet had my introduction to the man richard cromwell was still holding on to power by his fingertips and the king was in the spanish netherlands eager for his inheritance but not daring to grasp it the country was stirring and it seemed that the armies would soon be on the march once more my own house was searched for arms that spring as was that of everyone i knew we had only sporadic news of the world in oxford and the more i have talked to people over the years the more i realize that in fact virtually no one knew what was going on except for john thurloe of course who knew and saw everything but even he fell from power swept away by forces which for once he could not control take that as proof of how distempered the country was in those days there was little point in approaching anne blundy politely i could not for example write her a letter introducing myself as i had no reason to assume that she might be able to read i had little choice but to walk to her lodgings and knock on the door which was opened by a girl of perhaps seventeen who was i believe the prettiest thing i had ever seen in my lifea fine figure if a little thin a full set of teeth and a complexion unblemished by illness her hair was dark which was a disadvantage and although she wore it loose and largely uncovered she still dressed modestly and i do think that had she been attired in sackcloth it would have seemed a wonderfully becoming garment in my eyes above all it was her eyes which fascinated for they were the deepest black like ravens wings and it is known that of all colors black is the most amiable in a woman black eyes as if from venus says hesiod of his alcmena while homer calls juno oxeyed because of her round black eyes and baptista porta in his physiognomia sneers at the grayeyed english and joins with morison in lauding the deep glances of languorous neapolitan ladies i stared awhile quite forgetting my reason for calling until she politely but not with servility distantly but not with impudence asked me my business please come in sir she said when i told her my mother is out at the market but she should be back any moment you are welcome to wait if you wish i leave it to others to decide whether i should have taken that as a warning about her character had i been with someone better stationed i would naturally have gone away not wishing to presume on her reputation by being alone with her but at that moment the chance of talking to this creature seemed to me the best possible way of passing the time until the mother returned i am sure half wished that the woman might be greatly delayed i sat myself i fear with something of a swagger as a man of parts might do when associating with inferiors god forgive me on the little stool by the fireplace which unfortunately was empty despite the cold how do people converse in such situations i have never succeeded in a matter which others seem to find simple perhaps it is the result of too many hours spent in books and manuscripts most of the time i had no trouble at all with my friends over dinner i could converse with the best of them and i pride myself still that i was not the least interesting but in some circumstances i was at a loss and making conversation to a serving girl with beautiful eyes was beyond my powers i could have tried playing the gallant chucking her under the chin sitting her on my knee and pinching her bottom but that has never been my way and most obviously was not hers either i could have ignored her as not worth my attention except that she was so i ended up doing neither staring at her dumbly and had to leave it to her you have come to consult my mother on some trouble no doubt she prompted after she had waited for me to begin a conversation yes perhaps you have lost something and want her to divine where it is she is good at that or maybe you are sick and are afraid of going to a doctor eventually i dragged my eyes away from her face oh no not at all i have heard of her great skills of course but i am most meticulous and never lose anything a place for everything you know that is the only way i can proceed in my work and my health is as good as man might expect thanks to god babbling and pompous i excuse myself by pleading confusion she assuredly had not the slightest interest in my work few people have but it has always been my refuge in times of trouble and when confused or sad my thoughts fly to it toward the end of this affair i sat up at nights week after week transcribing and annotating as a way of shutting the world out locke told me it was for the best strange thati never liked him and he never liked me but i always took his advice and found it answered amen she said so why have you come to see my mother i hope you are not betrayed in love she does not approve of philters and such nonsense you know if you want that sort of foolishness you can go to a man in heddington although personally i think he is a charlatan i reassured her that my quest was entirely different and that i did not wish to consult her mother on any such business i was beginning to explain when the door opened and the woman returned sarah rushed to assist as her mother collapsed on a trestle stool opposite wiped her face and got her breath back before she peered at me she was poorly but cleanly dressed with gnarled hands strong from years of labor and a red round open face although age was beginning to gain its inevitable triumph in her manner she was far from the desolate broken bird of a woman she later became and moved with a sprightliness that many others more favored in life do not have at her age nothing wrong with you she said forthrightly after gazing at me in a way which seemed to see me entire her daughter had the habit as well i later learned i think it was that which made people frightened of them and consider them insolent what are you here for this is mr wood mother sarah said as she came back from the tiny room next door he is an historian so he has been telling me and wishes to consult you and what ailments afflict historians pray she said with little interest loss of memory crabbed writing hand i smiled both of those but not in my case i am pleased to say no i am writing a history of the siege and as you were here during that period so were several thousand other people are you going to talk to them all a strange way of writing history that i model myself on thucydides i began ponderously and he died before he could finish she interrupted a comment which surprised me so much i almost fell off my stool quite apart from the speed of her riposte she had evidently not only heard of that greatest of historians she even knew something about him i looked at her more curiously but evidently failed to disguise my astonishment my husband is a great book man sir and takes pleasure in reading to me and getting me to read to him of an evening he is here no he is still with the army i believe he is in london i was disappointed of course but resolved to make do with what i could discover from the wife until such time as blundy himself might return your husband i began was of some significance in the history of the town he tried to combat injustice here indeed the trouble is that no one i have come across seems to agree on what he did and said this is what i want to know and you will believe what i tell you i will set what you tell me against what other people tell me from that the truth will emerge i am convinced of it in that case you are a foolish young man mr wood i think not i said stiffly what axe your religious persuasions sir your loyalties in religion i am an historian in politics an historian as well much too slippery for an old woman like me she said with a slightly mocking tone in her voice are you loyal to the protector i took an oath to the government in power and what church do you attend several i have attended services in many places at present i attend at merton as i am bound to do since it is my college i must tell you i suppose lest you accuse me again of being slippery that i am of an episcopal instinct her head bowed in thought as she considered this her eyes closed almost as though asleep i feared very much that she would refuse thinking that i would twist what she said certainly she had no reason to think that i would be in any way sympathetic to a man like her husband i knew enough of him already to be sure of that but there was nothing more i could do to persuade her of my honorable intentions fortunately i was not stupid enough to offer her money as that would inevitably have been my downfall however much she needed it i must say here that never once did i discern in her or her daughter any of the greed which others claim to have seen so easily although her poor situation would have been ample cause for it sarah she said after a while her head lifting from her chest what do you think of this angular young man what is he a spy a fool a knave someone come to disinter the past and torment us with it perhaps he is what he says mother i think you might talk to him why not the lord knows what happened and even an historian from the university cannot hide the truth from him clever childa pity our friend here did not think of it himself very well she said we must talk again but i have a customer soon who has lost the deeds of his house and i must divine their whereabouts you must come back another day tomorrow if you wish i thanked her for her kindness and promised that i would be there the next day without fail i was conscious that i was treating her with unnecessary deference but something prompted me to act soher person demanded courtesy though her station did not as i was picking my way through the debris and puddles in the street outside i was stopped by a whistle behind me and as i looked around i saw sarah running after me a word mr wood by all means i said half noticing my pleasure at the prospect do you object to taverns this was a normal enquiry in those days as many of the more obscure dissenters did so object and very strongly it was best to find out who you were dealing with early on for fear of bringing down a heap of abuse oh no she said taverns i like i would have led her to the fleurdelys that belonging to my family and a place where i could have drink cheaply but i was concerned for my reputation so instead we went to another place a low hovel scarcely better than her own dwelling i noticed that she was not treated with friendliness when we entered indeed i had the feeling sharp words might have been exchanged had i not been there instead all the woman gave me along with the two tankards was a sneering smile the words were polite the sentiment they hid was not although i could not make it out though i had nothing to be ashamed of i found myself blushing the girl alas noticed and wryly commented on my discomfort not at all i said hastily its all right ive had worse she even had the tact to lead the way to the quietest corner of the place so that no one would see us i was grateful for this consideration and warmed to her for it now mr historian the girl said when she had drunk a quarter of her pot you must tell me frankly do you mean well by us because i will not have you causing us more trouble my mother needs no more she is tired and has found some peace in the last few years and i do not want that disturbed i tried to reassure her on this pointmy object was to describe the long siege and the effect that the quartering of troops on the city had had on learning her fathers role in the mutiny and in stirring up the passions of the parliamentary troops was of significance whatever it was but not criticalall i wanted to know was why the troops had refused their orders then and what had happened i hoped to set all that down before it was forgotten but you were here yourself werent you i was but i was only fourteen at the time and too busy at my studies to notice anything untoward i remember being mightily displeased when new college school was turned out of its room by the cloister and i remember thinking that i had never seen a soldier before i remember standing near the outworks hoping i could pour boiling oil on someone hoping to perform deeds of valor and be knighted by a grateful monarch and i remember how frightened everybody was at the surrender but all the important facts i do not know you cannot write a book based on such paltry material you want facts most people are content to make up their own thats what they did with father they said he was turbulent and wicked and abused him for it their judgment does not satisfy you maybe it will maybe it is even correct but i ask myself questions nonetheless how did such a man come to be trusted by so many of his fellows if he was so verminous how was he also courageous can the noble if i may use the term for such a person coexist with the ignoble and how did hehere i made my first ever venture into gallantryhow did he have such a beautiful daughter if she was pleased by the comment there was no sign of it alas no modest look no pretty blush just those black eyes staring intently at me making me feel more ill at ease i am determined i continued covering over my little essay to discover what transpired you ask whether i mean you ill or well and i tell you i mean you neither then you are immoral the truth is always moral because it is the image of gods word i corrected her feeling yet again that i was misspeaking myself and hiding behind solemnity i will give your father his say he will not get it from anyone else you know he either speaks through me or is forever mute she finished off her tankard and shook her head sadly poor man who talks so beautifully to be reduced to speaking through you i do believe she was entirely unconscious of the insultbut i had no desire at that moment to rebuff her by giving the reprimand she deserved instead i looked at her attentively thinking that this initial confidence might at least get her to speak well of me to her mother i remember once she continued after a while hearing him addressing his platoon after a prayer meeting i cant have been more than nine i suppose so it would have been around the time of worcester they thought they would be fighting soon and he was encouraging and calming them it was like music he had them swaying to and fro as he spoke and some were in tears possibly they would die or be captured or end their lives in jail that was the will of god and it was not for us to presume to guess what that was he had given us only one lantern to discern his goodness and that was our sense of justice the voice of right which spoke to all men in their souls if they would listen those who examined their hearts knew what the right was and knew that if they fought for it they would be fighting for god it was a battle to lay the foundation of making the earth a common treasury for all so that everyone born in the land might be fed by the earth all looking on others even old sick or female as equals in creation as they slept and ate and fought and died they should remember that i didnt know what to say she had spoken softly and gently her voice caressing me as she spoke the words of her father so quiet so kind and i realized with a start so profoundly evil i began very faintly to understand how it was done and what the appeal of this blundy was if a mere girl could be so seductive what must the man have been like the right to eatno good christian could object until you realize that what this man desired was the overturning of the right of masters to command their employees the theft of property from its owners the hacking at the very roots of the harmony which binds each to all quietly and kindly blundy took these poor ignorants by the hand and led them into the power of the devil himself i shuddered sarah looked at me with a faint smile the raving of a lunatic you think mr wood how can anyone who is neither a fool nor a monster think otherwise it is obviously so coming from a family of lunatics i see things a little differently she said i suppose you think my father used ordinary people for his own evil ends is that it something like that i said stiffly that it was devilish was attested by the eating of babies and burning of prisoners she laughed eating babies burning prisoners what liar said that i read it and many people have said so and so you believed it i am beginning to doubt you mr historian if you read there are beasts in the sea that breathe fire and have a hundred heads do you believe that too not unless i have good reason to and what does a learned man like yourself account a good reason the proof of my own eyes or the report of someone whose word can be trusted but it depends on what you mean i know that the sun exists because i can see it i believe that the earth goes around it because logical calculation concludes that and it is not contradicted by what i can see i know that unicorns exist because such a creature is possible in nature and reliable people have seen one even though i have not myself it is unlikely that firebreathing dragons with a hundred heads exist because i cannot see how a natural creature can breathe fire without being consumed so it all depends you see such was my answer and i still think it was a good response presenting complicated ideas in a simple way for her benefit although i thought it unlikely she would understand but far from being grateful for my instruction she continued to pursue me leaning forward in her eagerness to dispute like a starving beggar who had been offered a crust jesus is our lord do you believe that yes why because his coming was in conformity to the predictions of the bible his miracles proved his divinity and his resurrection proved it still more many people claim such miracles and in addition i have faith and hold that to be better than all reason a more earthly question then the king is gods anointed do you believe that if you mean can i prove it then no i replied determined to keep my distance that is not a certain belief but i do believe it because kings have their position and when they are thrown off the natural order is disturbed gods displeasure with england has surely been manifest in past years in the suffering it has borne and when the king was murdered did not enormous floods demonstrate the disruption of nature that had taken place she conceded this obvious point but addedbut if i said these prodigies were because the king had acted traitorously to his subjects then i would disagree with you and how would we decide who was correct it would depend on the weight of opinion of reasonable men of position and character who heard both propositions i do not wish to belabor it or give undue reproof but you cannot be called of position and character nor and here i made another attempt to switch the conversation to a more appropriate topic nor could someone so pretty ever be mistaken for a man oh she said dismissing my kindly warning to mind her own business with a toss of her head so whether the king is appointed by god or justly a king at all depends on the decisions of men is there a vote no i said slightly flushed at finding myself apparently unable to halt this increasingly ridiculous encounter thats not what im saying you ignorant girl god alone decides that men merely decide whether to accept gods will whats the difference if we do not know what gods will is it was time to bring this to an end so i stood up to give her a physical reminder so to speak of our respective positions if you can ask questions like that i said sternly then you are a very foolish and wicked child you must have had a very perverted upbringing indeed even to think of such things i am beginning to see that your father is as evil as they say instead of being sobered by my reproof she leaned back on her stool and let out a peal of laughter very angry now at being answered back in such a way i left her feeling a little shaken and took refuge in my books and notes for the rest of the morning it was merely the first of many occasions when she reduced me to such a display of foolishness do i have to say again that i was young does that excuse the way her eyes fuddled my thoughts and the fall of her hair tripped my tongue i intend to break my own rule about propriety and talk much of sarah blundyit is necessary i do not intend to cause distress by libertine discourse on matters of the heart a subject which as all but courtiers know does not belong on the public page but there is no other way of explaining my interest in the family my concern over her fate and my knowledge of her end i must be regarded as a competent witness where my personal recollection is important and therefore must provide proof of my knowledge words without fact are suspectso i must provide the facts they are simply stated at that time the wood family was still in funds and i lived in a house on merton street with my mother and sister in which i kept the top floor for myself and my books we needed a servant as sluttishness had forced my dear mother to discharge the one we had and i having discerned the blundys were in sore straits suggested sarah my mother was far from happy about the idea knowing something of the familys reputation but i persuaded her that she would be cheap having resolved that i would make up her wages myself out of my small competence besides i asked what was so terrible about her to this she had no specific answer eventually the thought of saving a ha penny a week brought my mother around she consented to interview the girl and reluctantly conceded that she did indeed seem properly modest and obedient but she let it be known that she intended to watch the girl like a hawk and at the first sniff of blasphemy or sedition or immorality she would be out the door and so she and i were brought into close proximity hindered naturally by the necessary distance that must exist between master and servant though she was no ordinary servantindeed she soon achieved an ascendancy in the house which was all the more remarkable for being largely uncontested only once was battle joined when my mother decided there being no man in the house except me and my mother always regarding herself as the head of the household to give the girl a beating expecting that the child would submit placidly to her chastisement as she ought i do not know what the offense was probably very little and my mothers irritability was more likely due to the pain she received from a swollen ankle that had afflicted her for several years sarah did not think this was a good enough reason hands on hips blazing with defiance she refused to bend when my mother advanced on her broom in hand she made it clear that if my mother so much as laid a finger on her she would thrash her back thrown out the house instantly you might think not a bit of it i wasnt there at the time otherwise the incident might never have occurred but my sister said that within half an hour sarah and my mother were both sitting in front of the fire talking with my mother almost apologizing to the child a sight never witnessed before or since thereafter my mother said not a word against her and when sarahs time of trouble came it was she who cooked food for her and took it to the prison what had happened what did sarah say or do which made my mother so charitable and generous for once i did not know when i asked sarah just smiled and said that my mother was a good and kind woman who was not as fierce as she seemed more than that she would not tell and my mother said nothing either she always grew secretive when caught out in a kindness and it may be that it was simply that shortly after her ankle stopped giving her painit is often the case that simple things like this can bring remarkable changes in demeanor i often wonder if dr wallis would have been less cruel had he been less afraid of the blindness that began to creep up on him in this time i myself have been unreasonably offensive to my fellows when blighted by toothache and it is well known that the mistaken decisions that ultimately led to the fall of lord clarendon were taken when that nobleman was wracked with the agonizing pain of the gout i mentioned that i occupied two rooms on the top floor from which other members of my family were excluded i had books and papers everywhere and was constantly afraid that someone in a misguided act of kindness would tidy them up and set my work back by months sarah was the only person i allowed in and even she tidied up only under my supervision i came to dream of those visits to my scholarly aerie and more and more i passed time in conversation with her my room got dirtier and dirtier it is true but i found myself waiting eagerly for the tread of her footsteps on the rickety stair that led to my attic initially i would talk about her mother but that soon became a pretense to prolong her presence even more so perhaps because i knew little of the world and less of women perhaps any female would have interested me but sarah quickly had me entranced slowly the pleasure turned to pain and the joy to anguish the devil came to visit me at all hours at night while i was at my desk working in the library turning my mind from my work and leading me on to foul and lubricious thoughts my sleep suffered my work also and although i prayed mightily for help there was no answer i begged the lord to spare me this temptation but in his wisdom he would not but allowed instead ever more demons to come and taunt me with my weakness and hypocrisy i woke in the morning thinking of sarah spent the day thinking of sarah and tossed myself to sleep at night thinking of sarah and even when i slept there was no respite for i dreamed of her eyes and her mouth and the way she laughed it was intolerable of courseno respectable connection was possible so great was the distance between us but i thought i knew enough of her to believe she would never consent to be my harlot she was too virtuous no matter what her origins i had never been in love nor even shown half as much interest in a woman as in the least of the books in the bodleian library and i confess that i cursed god in my heart that when i did fall and the similarity with the fate of adam i never felt so strongly it was with an impossibility a girl of no fortune or family scorned even in taverns and with a villain for a father and so i remained tonguetied and miserableanguished when she was there worse when she was not would that i had been a robust thoughtless man like prestcott who never bothered with the complexities of affection or even like wallis with a heart so cold that no human being could warm it for long sarah i believe was not without affection for me eitheralthough always respectful in my presence i still felt something in hera warmth the way she looked and leaned forward as i showed her a book or a manuscript which indicated some regard i think she liked talking to me she was used to masculine conversation because of her father who had instructed her and she was hard put to confine her mind to topics suitable for women as i was always ready to talk about my work and was easily distracted into discussing anything else she seemed to regard her visits to clean my quarters with as much eagerness as i did myself i think i was the only man then who spoke to her for some reason other than to give her orders or make lewd remarks i can find no other explanation her childhood her upbringing and her father however remained something of a blank to me she rarely spoke of them except on those occasions when a chance remark slipped from her lips when i asked directly she generally changed the subject i hoarded these occasional comments like a miser hoards his gold remembering each chance phrase and turning them over in my mind adding each to each like coin in a casket until i had a good supply initially i thought her reticence due to shame at the degradation to which she had descended now i think it merely caution lest it be misunderstood she was ashamed of little and regretted less but accepted that the days when people like her might hope of a new world were overthey had tried and failed miserably i will give one important example of how i garnered my evidence shortly after the restoration of his majesty was proclaimed in the town i came back from viewing the preparations for the festivities celebrations erupted all over the land that day both from parliament towns which felt the need to demonstrate their new loyalty and from towns like oxford which were able to rejoice with more genuine feeling we were promised by whom i cannot recall that the fountains and gutters themselves would run with joyous wine that night as in the days of ancient rome i found sarah sitting on my stool and weeping her heart out whatever is the matter that you sob so on a glorious day like this i cried it was some time before i got an answer oh anthony it is not glorious for me she said this being our secret intimacy that i permitted her to address me so in my room initially i had thought that she had one of those mysterious womanly complaints but quickly realized that grander matters were on her mind she was never immodest or gross in her talk but what is there to be so sorrowful about it is a fine morning we can drink and feed at the universitys expense and the king is coming back to his own and everything has been in vain she said does so much waste not make you want to weep even as you celebrate near twenty years of fighting trying to build gods kingdom here and it is all swept away by the will of a few greedy grandees now to refer thus to those great men whose wise intervention had been crucial to the recall of the king so we were told and i believed until i read walliss manuscript should have alerted me but i was in too good a mood god works in mysterious ways i said cheerfully and sometimes chooses strange instruments to work his will god has spat in the face of his servants who worked for him she said her voice falling into a hiss of despair and rage how can it be gods will how can god will that some men be subject to others that some live in palaces while others die in the street that some rule and others obey how can god will that i shrugged not knowing what to say or how to begin saying it just wanting her to stop i had never seen her like this clutching at herself and rocking to and fro as she spoke with a passion that was as disgusting as it was fascinating she frightened me but i could not walk away from her he obviously does i said eventually in that case he is no god of mine she said with a sneer of contempt i hate him as he must hate me and all of his creation i stood up i think this has gone far enough i said appalled at what she was saying and alarmed that someone downstairs might overhear i will not have this sort of talk in my house remember who you are girl thus earning from her a scornful look of contempt the first time i had so totally and instantly lost her affections i felt it deeply being distressed at her blasphemy but even then more pained by my loss oh mr wood i am just beginning to guess she said and walked straight out not even doing me the honor of slamming the door i my good humor gone and strangely unable to recover my concentration spent the rest of the afternoon on my knees praying desperately for relief the loyal celebration that evening was everything that good royalists could have hoped fortown and university vied with each other to be the more zealously loyal starting with my habitual friends i had by that time made the acquaintance of lower and his circle we drank our fill of wine at the fountain in carfax ate beef at christ church then proceeded to more wine and delicacies at merton it was a delightful occasion or should have been but sarahs mood had affected me and taken away my joy there was dancing which i merely watched singing where i was without song speechmaking and toastgiving where i kept my silence food for all and myself without appetite how could anyone not be happy on a day like this above all someone like me who had hoped for his majestys return for so long i did not understand myself was desolate and not good company what is it old friend asked lower pounding me merrily on the back as he came back breathless from a dance already slightly the worse for drink i pointed at a thinfaced man dead drunk in the gutter saliva dripping down his chin see i said do you remember for fifteen years one of the elect persecuting loyalty and applauding fanaticism and now look one of the kings most devoted subjects and soon to be thrown out of his places as he deserves allow him a bit of oblivion for his troubles you think i dont some people always survive he is one oh you are an old misery wood lower said with a great grin this is the greatest day in history and you are all sourfaced and glum come have another drink and forget about it or someone might think you a secret anabaptist and so i did and another and another eventually lower and the others wandered off and i couldnt be bothered chasing after them their simple to my mind good humor and careless pleasure made me melancholy to tears i wandered back to carfax which was a fateful thing to do for as i got there and helped myself all alone to another cup of wine i heard a cackle of laughter from a side street normal enough that evening except this time there was that slight but unmistakable edge of menace which is difficult to describe and impossible to miss made curious by the sound i peered down the alley and saw a group of young oafs gathered in a semicircle against a wall they were laughing and shouting and i half expected to find in the center of the crowd some charlatan or raree man whose wares and tricks had failed to please but instead it was sarah her hair astray her eyes wild her back against the wall and they were taunting her mercilessly harlot they said traitors bastard witchs daughter bit by bit they were working themselves up taking a little step further each time edging toward the point when words ceased and assault began she saw me and our eyes met but there was no entreaty in them rather she bore it all herself almost not seeming to notice the foul words hurled at her almost as though she wasnt listening and did not care she might not want help but i knew she needed it and knew no one but myself would lift a finger for her i worked my way through the crowd put my arm around her and pulled her out and back toward the main street so quickly the mob hardly had time to react fortunately it was not far they did not like the theft of their entertainment and my status as scholar and historian would have served me little had the spot been any more isolated but there were people drunk but still civilized only a few yards away and i managed to get us close enough to safety before the insults erupted into actual violence then i pulled her through the cheerful goodhumored celebrations until seeing their prey lost the mob dissolved and went in search of other sport i was breathing hard and the fright and the drink made me slow to recover my wits im afraid that physical danger is not something to which i am used i emerged more shaken than sarah she did not thank me but just looked at me with what seemed like resignation or perhaps sadness then she shrugged and walked away i followed she walked faster and so did i i thought she was walking home but at the end of butchers row she turned and cut across the fields behind the castle walking ever faster with myself now maddened by my beating heart swirling head and confusion it was in the place called paradise fields once the most beautiful of orchards and now fallen into a sad and infertile neglect where she stopped and turned round as i came up to her she was laughing but with tears coming down her cheeks i reached out for her and she clutched hold of me as though hanging on to the only thing left in the entire world and like adam in paradise i sinned why me i dont know i had nothing to offer her not money nor marriage and she knew that perhaps i was gentler than others perhaps i comforted her perhaps she needed some warmth i do not deceive myself that it was much more but nor do i lower myself now to think that it was any lessperhaps no virgin she was no harlot either prestcott lied cruelly there she was virtue itself and he was no gentleman to say otherwise afterward when her tears had stopped she got up straightened her clothes and walked slowly off this time i did not follow the following day she cleaned my mothers kitchen as though nothing had happened and i was that the lords answer to my entreaties was i sated and satisfied the demons exorcised from my soul no my fever was stoked up even further so that i could hardly bear to see her for fear that my trembling and pallor would give me away i kept to my room and alternated between sinful thoughts and atonement through prayer by the time she came up to my room a few days later i must have looked like a ghost and i heard the familiar steps coming up the stairs with a mixture of terror and joy such as i have never experienced before or since and so of course i was rude to her and she played the servant with me each settling into our roles like actors in a play but all the time willing the other to say something or at least i did i do not know about her told her to tidy up better she obeyed i instructed her to lay a fire she dutifully and without a word did as she was told i told her to go away and leave me in peace she picked up her bucket of water and opened the door come back here i said and she did that too but i had nothing else to say to her or rather i had so much so i went to embrace her and she allowed me standing upright and still enduring a punishment please sit down i said letting her go and again she obeyed me you ask me to stay and to sit down she began when i said nothing do you have something to say to me i love you i said in a rush she shook her head no she said you do not how can you but two days ago was that not something are you so coarse that it meant nothing to you something yes but what would you have me do wilt in the despair of love become your woman twice a week instead of cleaning and you are you going to offer me your hand of course not so what is there to be done or said it was her practicality which maddened me i wanted her to suffer as much as i to rail against the unkindness of fate that so separated us yet her robust common sense did not allow that so what are you you have had so many men that one more has no effect on you many perhaps so if that is what you want to think but not as you mean only ever for affections sake when i was given the choice i hated her for that frankness had i taken her virtue and had she been weeping with remorse at her fall in value i would have understood and comforted her i knew the words for that because i had read them somewhere but to regard her loss as of so little moment and to discover that it had not been given to me but to someone else was more than i could endure later although i could never condone something so obviously in contradiction to gods word i accepted it as much as possible for she was her own law however much she might obey my orders she would never be obedient anthony she said gently seeing my distress you are a good man i think and you try to be christian but i know what you have been doing you see me as a fitting recipient of your charity you want me to be good and virtuous at the same time that you want to roll with me in paradise fields before you go off and marry a woman with as much of an estate as you can find then you will convert me into a harlot who tempted you to sin while you were in drink if that makes your prayers easier and gives your soul comfort you think that of me i do you manage easily enough when you are talking to me about your work then your eyes light up and you forget what i am in your pleasure at talking then you treat me honestly without foolishness or awkwardness only one person has ever done this before and he was my father and i have just learned that he is dead i felt a wave of compassion for her as i heard her words and saw the sadness in her eyes it was something i understood well as i had lost my own father when i was scarcely ten and i knew well how painful it is to be brushed by such grief i felt even more sad when she told me the details for she was told cruelly and falsely it now seems that her father had been killed when going back to his old habits of disobedience and troublemaking the details were unclear and likely to remain so the army was never punctilious about giving details to the families in such cases but it seemed then that ned blundys agitations had finally become too muchhe was arrested given a military trial and hanged forthwith the body cast into an unmarked grave the courage of his last moments which thurloe knew of and wallis discovered was concealed from the family even though they would have taken great solace in it even worse neither sarah nor her mother were told where he rested and did not even discover for some months that it had happened i sent her home to be with her mother and told my own that she was not well she appreciated the kindness i think but presented herself again the next morning and never mentioned the matter again her mourning and grief she kept entirely within her and only i who knew her better than most caught the occasional glimpse of a distant sadness as she worked thus my love for the girl had its birth and my misery should be talked of no more i still waited eagerly for her twice a week so that i could talk to her and for a while she went with me on occasion to paradise fields no one ever knew of this and my discretion was not because i was ashamed to consort with her it was too precious to be the occasion of laughter in a tavern i know how other people consider me the ridicule of my fellows even those i have helped is a cross i have borne all my life cola in his manuscript repeats the remarks of locke and even lower both of whom were pleasant to my face and whom i still count almost as friends prestcott took my help and laughed behind my back wallis did the same i would not tarnish my affections with the scorn of others and my regard for that girl would certainly have excited great ridicule it was in any case only one part of my life much of my time i continued with my work and discouraged by my growing doubts about what i was doing i found myself turning more and more to the collection of facts no longer daring to say what they meant my work on the siege languished and i turned instead to memorials facts carved in stone and brass so that i could assemble a list of the most important families of the county back through the ages it sounds commonplace now but i was the first even to consider the idea and i wandered through all the archives cataloguing manuscripts that no hand had touched for generations as a way of earning small money and making myself useful for what are we but our past if that is lost we become nothing even though i had no immediate intention of making use of the material myself it was my duty and my pleasure to ensure that others could do so if they were so minded all the libraries of oxford were in a dreadful state their most precious treasures neglected for decades as men had turned their minds to the passion of faction and learned to despise the old wisdom because they could not read it afresh in my small way i preserved and catalogued and dipped into the vast ocean of learning that awaited knowing all the time that the life of one man was insufficient for even the smallest part of the wonders that lay within it is cruel that we are granted the desire to know but denied the time to do so properly we all die frustrated it is the greatest lesson we have to learn it was through work such as this that i met dr wallis as he was keeper of the university archives when i most needed access to them even though as professor he should never have been allowed the post although i grant his methodical mind did impose some order on documents which had been sadly neglected for years nonetheless i could have done better doing most of the work unrecognized and better deserved the salary of a year i had heard rumors of course about his occult activitieshis abilities as a decipherer of documents were no secret indeed he rather boasted of them but i knew nothing until i opened his manuscript of his dark work for the government had i known the full extent i think that everything might have become very much simpler wallis was defeated even if he only realized it when he in his turn saw colas narrative by his own cleverness and his obsession with secrecy he saw enemies everywhere and trusted no one read his words and see the motives he imputes to all who came into contact with him does he say anything good about anyone he lived in a world where everyone was a fool a liar a murderer a cheat or a traitor he even sneers at mr newton denigrates mr boyle exploits the weaknesses of lower all men were there to be twisted to serve his ends poor man to think of his fellows thus poor church to have him as minister poor england to have him as its defender he lambastes everyone but who caused more death and destruction than he but even wallis could love it seems though when he lost the one person in his life he held dear his reaction was not to come back to god in prayer and repentance but to unleash still more cruelty on the world and find that it served no purpose i had encountered this matthew of his on several occasions and always felt sympathy for him the obsession was clear to anyone for wallis could never be in a room with the lad without constantly looking at him and making comments in his direction but nothing gave me greater surprise than to read of walliss affection for he treated the boy abominably and all wondered how the lad endured such cruelty admit that the servant suffered less than the children whose inadequacies were publicly and frequently acknowledged so vilely that once i saw the eldest break down in tears under the barrage but nonetheless even matthew had to put up with constant carping and malice only with a man like wallis could this be a way of expressing love i had nothing but disgust for him on one occasion when i saw his face twisted and purpled with rage at the lad and told sarah of it she chided me gently do not think badly of him she said he wishes to approach love but does not know how he can only adore an idea and has to castigate the reality when it cannot compare he wants perfection but is so blinded in spirit he can only sense it only through his mathematics and has no place in his heart for people but it is so cruel i said yes but it is also love can you not see that she replied and it is surely his only route to salvation do not condemn the one spark in him that was given by god it is not for you to judge then however i cared little for any of thisi wanted access to the archives and wallis quite literally had the key to them so as the king returned and tried to reestablish himself on the throne as plots and counterplots swirled over the country like a snow blizzard i left my room in merton street and went to the library where i unbundled and catalogued and read and annotated until not even candlelight permitted me to work any longer i worked in the icy cold of winter when it grew dark in midafternoon and in the boiling heat of summer when the sun beat down on the lead roof just above my head and i grew half crazed from thirst no weather or circumstance deflected me from my task and i grew oblivious to all that was going on around me i allowed myself to pause for an hour or so to eat often in company with lower or others like him and in the evening would allow myself the greatest joy and solace of my life which has always been music wine and music rejoice the heart it can so mollify the mind and soothe tempestuous affections says jason pratensis and lemnius says it soothes also the arteries and the animal spirits so that here i cite mr burton when orpheus played the very trees tore up their roots that they might approach to hear better agrippa adds that the elephants of africa are greatly pleased with it and will dance to a tune however sad and weary an hour of the viol with good company nearly always brought me satisfaction and peace and i would play alone or with others every evening an hour before prayer it is the finest way i know of ensuring good sleep there were five of us who used to meet together twice a week and sometimes more frequently to play and a most delicious harmony it was we rarely talked and scarcely even knew each other but would meet and pass two hours or more in the most perfect friendship i was neither the best nor the worst of the players and by dint of practicing hard frequently appeared the superior we used to meet where we could and in settled in a room which we took above a newly opened coffee house next to the queens college further down the high street and on the opposite side from mr boyles rooms it was here that i first met thomas ken whose companionship led me into the acquaintance of jack prestcott as prestcott says ken is now a bishop and a very grand man indeed so full of circumstance that his meager origins would astonish all who did not know him at that time the thin pinched cleric anxious for advancement the ascetic concerned only to commune with christ has transformed himself into a portly ecclesiastical grandee living in his palace with forty servants dispensing his charity and a loyal devotee of whatever regime happens to hold his income in its grasp it is a form of principle i suppose this willingness to transform the conscience for the common peace but i do not admire it greatly despite the comfort it has brought him i remember with much greater affection the earnest young fellow of new college whose only leisure was to scrape away at the viols in my company he was an execrable musician with little aptitude and no ear but his enthusiasm was boundless and our group was short of a viol and so we had little choice i was truly shocked to learn that he had malevolently invented a tale about sarah which took her one step closer to the gallows so many people seemed to desire her death that even then i sensed a malignant fate taking pleasure in her destruction turning people into her enemies for no reason that i could discern it was through my intervention that sarah began to work for dr grove as thomas quite innocently asked the assembled musicians one evening whether we knew of any servant wanting employment grove recently returned to his fellowship needed such a person and ken was keen to help he hoped to win the affection and patronage of the man and initially tried hard to be obliging unfortunately grove could not countenance people like ken in his college and rebuffed all attempts at friendship kens courtesies were wasted and an enmity grew which did not need a dispute over a parish to become acrimonious i said that i knew just the person and asked sarah the next time i saw her one day a week to tidy his rooms carry up his water and coal empty his pots and see to his laundry sixpence a day id be glad of the work she said who is this man i wont work for anyone who thinks he can beat me you know that i think i dont know him at all so i cannot vouch for his character he was ejected long ago and is only just returned a laudian then am i to work for a stalwart royalist i would find you an anabaptist fellow if there were any but people like this grove are the only ones liable to make an offer these days take it or not as you please but go and see himhe might not be as bad as you fear after all i am a stalwart royalist myself and you manage to contain your disgust more or less when you are around me that earned me one of those lovely smiles i still remember so very well there are few as kind as you she said mores the pity she wasnt eager but her need for work overcame her scruples and eventually she went to grove and took the position i was pleased for this and saw what a delight it is to be able to patronize others even if in a small way through me sarah had enough work to live and even to save if she was careful for the first time in her life she was living a settled respectable existence in her place and apparently content it comforted me greatly as it seemed a good omen for the future i was glad for her and thought maybe the rest of the country would prove equally tractable my optimism was alas badly misplaced i run ahead of myself my eagerness to put all down on paper means that i leave much out which is vital i should measure out my facts so that all who read can discern the pattern of events with clarity this in my opinion is what proper history should be i know what the philosophers say that the purpose of history should be to illustrate the noblest deeds of the greatest men to give examples for the present generation of debased inferiors to emulate but i do believe that great men and noble deeds can look after themselves few in any case stand up to much close examination the view is not unchallenged anyway i think as the theologians wag their fingers and say that truly the whole purpose of history is to reveal the wondrous hand of god as he intervenes in the affairs of man but i find this a doubtful program as well at least as it is commonly practiced is his plan truly revealed in the laws of kings the actions of politicians or the words of bishops can we easily believe that such liars brutes and hypocrites are his chosen instruments i cannot credit it we do not study the policies of king herod for lessons but rather seek out the words of the least of his subjects who finds no mention in any of the histories look through the works of suetonius and agricola study pliny and quintilian plutarch and josephus and you will see that the greatest event of all the most important happening in the entire history of the world entirely passed them by despite their wisdom and learning in the time of vespasian as lord bacon says there was a prophecy that one who came out of judaea should rule the world this plainly meant our savior but tacitus in his history thought only of vespasian himself besides my job as an historian is to present the truth and to tell the tale of these days in the approved fashionfirst causes narrative summation moralwould be surely to present a strange picture of the time in which it happened in that year of after all the king was nearly toppled from his throne thousands of dissenters were locked in jail the rumblings of war were heard over the north sea and the first portents of the great fire and the greater plague were felt throughout the land in all manner of strange and frightening events are all these to be relegated to second place or be seen merely as a theater set for groves death as though that was the most important occurrence or am i to ignore that poor mans end and all events which took place in my town because the maneuverings of courtiers which took us to war the next year and nearly consumed us in civil strife once more are so much more important a memorialist would do one an historian the other but perhaps both are mistaken historians like natural philosophers come to believe reason sufficient for understanding and deceive themselves that they see all and comprehend everything in fact their labors ignore the significant and bury it deep under the weight of their wisdom the mind of man unaided cannot grasp the truth but only constructs fantasies and fictions which convince until they convince no more and which are true only until discarded and replaced the reasonableness of humanity is a puny weapon blunt and powerless a childs toy in a babys hand only revelation which sees past reason and is a gift neither earned nor deserved says aquinas can take us to that place which is illumined with a clarity beyond all intellect the ramblings of the mystic however would serve me ill in these pages and i must remember my calling the historian must work through the proper recitation of facts so i will go back awhile to the start of before the restoration of his majesty before ever i knew paradise fields and shortly after sarah had begun to work in my mothers house and instead of windy rhetoric i will tell how i visited the blundys cottage one day to ask a few extra questions about the mutiny as i approached down the lane i saw a short man leave the cottage and walk swiftly away from me on his back he had a pack such as travelers use i looked at him with some passing curiosity simply because he had come from sarahs house he was not young not old but had a determined gait and walked off without glancing back i only had one look at his face which was fresh and kindly though scored deeply with lines and weatherbeaten like that of a man who had spent most of his life outside he was cleanshaven and had an unruly mop of fair almost blond hair which was uncovered by any hat in build he was slight and not tall yet he had an air of wiry strength to him as though he was used to enduring great privations without flinching it was the only sight i ever had of ned blundy and i regret greatly that i had not arrived a few minutes earlier as i would have dearly liked to question him sarah told me however that it would have been a waste of my time he had never been open with strangers and trusted only slowly she thought it very unlikely he would have been forthcoming even had he not been unusually preoccupied on what turned out to be his last visit i would still have liked to have started an acquaintance i said as perhaps in the future we might meet again were you expecting him no indeed not we have seen very little of him in recent years he has been always on the move and my mother is too old to go with him he also thought it better if we stay here and make our own lives perhaps he is right but i miss him greatly he is the dearest man i know i am worried for him why so i did not see him well but he has the air of a man able to look after himself i hope so i have never doubted it before but he was so serious in his leavetaking that he frightened me he spoke so gravely and gave such warnings about our safety that i am concerned surely it is natural for any man to be concerned for his family when he is not there to protect them do you know a man called john thurloe have you heard of him of course i know his name i am surprised you do not why do you ask he is one of the people i am to be wary of why because my father says he will want this off me if he learns of it she pointed to a large bundle on the floor by the fireside wrapped in cloth bound up with thick cord and sealed with wax at every point he did not tell me what it was but said it would kill me if i opened it or if anyone ever knew it was here i am to hide it securely and never breathe a word to anyone until he comes back to reclaim it do you know the story of pandora she frowned and shook her head so i told her the tale even though preoccupied she listened and asked sensible questions i take it as a good warning she said but i intended to obey him in any case but you promptly tell me before your father is even past the city walls there is no place here to hide it where it would not be found within minutes by a determined searcher and we have few trustworthy friends who would not also be examined i would like to ask you the greatest favor mr wood as i trust you and think you a man of your word will you take it and conceal it for me promise you will not open it without my permission and never reveal its existence to anyone what is in it i have told you i do not know but i can tell you that nothing my father does is base or cruel or means harm it will only be for a few weeks then you can give it back to me this conversationwhich ended with my agreementmay strike any reader of my words as strange for it was as foolish for sarah to trust me as it was for me to hide a package which might have contained any number of horrors to cause me grief and yet both of us chose wisely my word once given is sacrosanct and i never even considered violating her trust i took the package away and concealed it in my room underneath the floorboards where it remained undisturbed and unsuspected i did not even think of opening it or going back on my promise in any way i agreed because i never even considered not doing so i was already falling under her spell and willingly conceded any request which bound her to me and earned her gratitude of course the package was that bundle of documents which blundy had shown to sir james prestcott and which thurloe held to be so dangerous he searched for years to recover it it was for those papers that after blundy died and sir james prestcott fled thurloes agents fanned out across the land given any powers they wanted it was to discover that bundle that sarahs house was ransacked and ransacked again her mother received the injury which killed her her friends and acquaintances those of her father and mother too questioned closely and brutally it was for this package that cola came to oxford and it was for the same package that thurloe steered jack prestcott and dr wallis into hanging sarah lest she reveal its whereabouts and i knew nothing of this but i kept it safe as i had promised and no one ever thought to ask me about it i am very much afraid that my narrative should any have cause to read it will not please as much as those three on which it is based i wish that like them i could offer a simple straightforward narrative of events full of obvious statements and gripped by the adamantine embrace of conviction but i cannot do so because the truth is not simple and these three gentlemen present only a simulacrum of verity as i hope i have already demonstrated i am sworn not to leave out contradictions and confusions nor am i so full of my own importance that i have sufficient confidence to leave out all but what i did saw and said myself for i do not credit that my own presence was of critical importance i must set down fragments all jumbled up and crisscrossing the years so now i go forward again and begin my tale in earnest around the middle of after i had known sarah blundy for nearly three years and the kingdom had been at peace for two i was moderately contented with my lot in life my routine was as unshakeable as it was rewarding i had my friends with whom i associated in the evenings either at dinner or at music parties i had my work which was finally beginning to find the purpose which has occupied me ever since bringing ever richer rewards in knowledge my family was well enough established with no member not even the most distant cousin bringing anxiety expense or dishonor to our door i had secure and unchallenged possession of an annuity which however small was more than enough to provide food and lodging and such necessaries as my work required i suppose that i would have liked more for if i already realized that i would never take on the expense of marriage i would happily have spent more on books and engaged more completely in those acts of charity which illuminate the life of man when properly undertaken this was a minor concern however since i have never been one of those bitter and envious men who desire to be as rich as their fellows and define insufficiency as what they themselves possess all of my friends in those days have become far wealthier than myself lower for example became the most fashionable doctor in london john locke was supported in great style by generous and wealthy patrons and received countless pensions and annuities from the government before the enmity of the powerful forced him into exile even thomas ken battened on to a fat bishopric but i would not change my life for theirs for they constantly have to concern themselves with such matters they live in a world where if you do not perpetually rise then you inevitably fall fame and fortune are of the most evanescent quality i have and can lose neither besides none of the three gentlemen are contented i know they are too aware of the price of their money all three regret the passing of their youth when they thought they would do as they chose and dreamed of greater things without the demands of familythe incessantly open mouths of his own children and those children of his brotherlower might have remained in oxford and carved a name for himself deep into the tree of fame but instead he went to practice as a fashionable physician and has done no useful work since locke detests those who reward him so well but was too used to good living to abandon the habit which now means he must live in amsterdam for his own safety and ken what choices he has made perhaps one day he will take a stand in public for what he truly believes until then he will remain in the torment of his own devising assuaging the demons of selfcriticism by his ever more extravagant works of benevolence as long as i have had my labor i have been contented and wanted no more in those days particularly i believed myself to be delightfully set up and suffered no melancholy longings to distract me i was as i say pleased that i had established sarah in a good and reliable position with dr grove and complacent that the comforting drift of my life would continue unabated this was not to be for bit by bit the events which are narrated in the three manuscripts i have been reading invaded my little world and disrupted it entirely it took a very long time indeed before i was able to reestablish something of the balance that sound scholarship and peaceful existence both require indeed i think that i never did the first pinprick at my bubble of contentment came in late autumn i was in a tavern where i had paused one evening after a long day breathing in the dust of bodleys books i was perfectly quiet and rested having no thought in my mind at all to distract me when i overheard part of a conversation between two low and verminous townsmen i did not want or intend to listen but sometimes it cannot be avoided words force their attention upon the mind and will not be kept out and the more i heard the more i had to hear because my body stiffened and was made icy cold by their gossip that leveller whore the blundy girl that was i think the only phrase which initially my ears discovered amid the general hubbub in the room then word by word more of the conversation came to me rutting cat every time she cleans his room poor old man must be bewitched wouldnt mind a chance myself and him a priest theyre all the same you can tell just by looking really dr grove spread her legs for anybody is there anyone who hasnt i now know these vile and disgusting reports to be absolutely false although i did not know until i read prestcotts manuscript that they had originated with him after his cruel rape even then i did not instantly believe what i heard for many lewd and boastful stories are told in drink and if they were all true then there could scarcely be a virtuous woman in the country no it was not until prestcott himself approached me that my refusal turned to doubt and the creeping demons in my mind began to gnaw at my soul making me hateful and suspicious prestcott has recounted our initial meeting called in as i was by thomas ken to assistken hoped that i would do what he could not and persuade the lad to give up what was liable to be a hopeless quest ken had tried i think but prestcotts violent response to all criticism restrained his efforts he hoped that a cogent detailing of the facts would produce a reasonable response and that prestcott would listen to me if i gave such an account it took only a short acquaintance however before i realized that i neither liked mr prestcott nor wanted to involve myself in his fantasies in any way so when he saw me in the street later and hailed me my heart sank and i prepared a story about how i had not yet completed my investigation that is of no matter sir he said jovially since there is nothing i can do with it at the moment i am shortly off on a tour of the country to my people and to london it will wait until i return no mr wood i need to talk to you on a particular matter for i have a warning to give you i know you to be of a respectable family and no member more so than your much admired mother and i am loath to stand by and let your name be tarnished that is kind of you i said in astonishment i am sure there is nothing we need concern ourselves with what exactly do you mean you have a servant do you not sarah blundy i nodded a feeling of concern creeping over me we do a fine worker dutiful humble and obedient so she no doubt appears but as you know appearances can be deceptive i must tell you that her character is not as good as you like to think it grieves me to hear it and it grieves me to tell you i am afraid that she is engaged in fornication with another of her employers a dr grove of new college do you know the man i nodded coldly how do you know this she told me boasted of it i find that difficult to believe i did not she approached me and offered herself to me for money in the grossest and coarsest fashion naturally i spurned the offer and she as good as said that her qualities could be vouched for by many others many many other satisfied clients she said with a grin and added that dr grove was a new man since she had taken to providing him with the sort of satisfaction the church could not offer you grieve me when you say this i apologize for that but i thought it for the best of course it was kind of you to take such trouble that was the essence of the conversation there certainly was not much more to it but what an effect it had on my mind my first reaction was to reject absolutely what he had told me and persuade myself that what i knew of the girl and my sense of her goodness were more valuable than the testimony of an outsider but my suspicions gnawed at me and would not be tamed and finally consumed me entire could my own sense of her nature be counted more valuable evidence than the actual experience of someone else i thought of her in one way it appeared prestcott knew her to be other and did my own experience contradict what he said had not the girl given herself to me freely i had not paid her but what did that say of her moral nature surely it was mere vanity on my part to think she had lain with me out of regard the more i thought the more i perceived what had to be the truth she alone of all women had allowed me to touch her and i had become infatuated as a result instead of seeing that i could have been anyone the desires of women are stronger than those of mere men this is well known and i had forgotten it when in heat they are ravenous and insatiable and we poor men think it love what is this jealousy this emotion which can overwhelm and destroy the strongest of men the most virtuous of creatures what alchemy of the mind can transmute love into hate longing into repulsion desire into disgust in such a way why is it that there is no man alive immune to its hot embrace that it can banish all sleep all reason and all kindness in an instant what hangman says jean bodin can torture so well as can this fear and suspicion and not men alone for vives says doves are jealous and can die of it a swan at windsor finding a strange cock with its mate swam miles in pursuit of the offending beast and killed it then swam back and killed the mate as well some say it is the stars which cause jealousy but leo afer blames climate and morison says that germany has not so many drunkards england tobacconists france dancers as italy has jealous husbands in italy itself it is said men of piacenza are more jealous than the rest and it is a changeable disease shifting its form from one place to the next for what will drive a man into madness in one place will not affect another elsewhere in friesland a woman will kiss the man who brings her drink in italy the man must die for it in england young men and maids will dance together a thing which only siena abides in italy mendoza a spanish legate in england found it disgusting for men and women to sit together in church but was told such a occurrence was only disgusting in spain where men cannot rid themselves of lascivious thoughts even in holy places as i am prone to melancholy i am more susceptible to jealousy but i know many choleric or sanguine people just as afflicted i was young and youth is jealous although jerome says the old are more so but understanding a disease alas can never cure it knowing whence jealousy comes no more attenuates the malady than understanding the source of a fever less so for at least in physick a diagnosis can produce a treatment while for jealousy there is none it is like the plague for which there is no cure you succumb and are consumed by the hottest of fires and in the end it either burns out or you die i suffered the cloak of jealousy which burned my soul as the shirt dipped in the blood of nessus drove heracles to agony and death for near a fortnight before i could abide the torment no more in that time everything i saw and heard confirmed my worst suspicions and i grasped eagerly the slightest hint or sign of her guilt once i almost brought myself to confront her and went down to her cottage for that purpose but as i approached i saw the door open and a strange man come out bowing in farewell and paying the most elaborate of respects instantly i was sure this was some client and that her shame and degradation was now so great she had taken to plying her trade in her own house for all to see my anger and shock was so great i turned around and walked away my fear so consuming i straightaway went to my room and subjected myself to the most intimate of investigations for the danger of becoming poxridden loomed large in my mind i found nothing but was scarcely reassured since i did not know anything at all of the malady so i summoned all my courage and redfaced with shame took myself off to see lower dick i said i must ask you the greatest favor and beg for your complete discretion we were in his rooms at christ church a commodious apartment in the main quadrangle which he had occupied now for some years locke was there when i arrived and so i forced myself into idle conversation determined to wait as long as necessary before i got him on his own eventually locke left and lower asked what it was that i needed ask away and if i can oblige i will willingly do so you look in great distress my friend are you ill i hope not that is what i want you to determine and what do you think it may be what symptoms do you have i have none no symptoms none at all sounds very serious to me i shall examine you thoroughly then prescribe the most expensive medicines in my pharmacopoeia and you will be well instantly by god mr wood he said with a smile you are the ideal patient if i could have a dozen like you i would be both rich and famous do not joke sir i am deadly serious i fear i may have caught a shocking disease my manner of speaking convinced him i was in earnest and good doctor and kind friend that he was he instantly dropped his bantering tone you are certainly worried i can see that but you must be a little more frank how can i tell you what your illness is unless you tell me first i am a doctor not a soothsayer and so with great reluctance and fearing his mockery i told him all lower grunted so you think this slut may have lain with everyone in oxfordshire i do not know but if the reports are correct then i may be sickening but you say this has been going on for two years or more i know the diseases of venus do commonly take some time to show themselves he conceded but rarely this long you do not notice any signs on her no sores or pustules no running pus or creamy discharges i did not look i said gravely affronted at the idea that is a pity myself i always look very carefully and i would counsel you to do the same in future it doesnt have to be obvious you know you can hide it under a pretense of love with only a little practice lower i do not want advice i want a diagnosis am i sick or not he sighed drop your breeches then lets have a look with the gravest embarrassment at the humiliation i did as i was told and lower subjected me to the most intimate examination lifting and pulling and peering then he put his face close to my private parts and sniffed seems perfectly fine to me he said pristine condition id say scarcely taken out of its wrapping i breathed a sigh of relief so i am not ill i didnt say that there are no symptoms that is all i would suggest you take remedies in large quantities for a few weeks just to be on the safe side if you are too bashful to get them yourself i will buy some from mr crosse and give them to you tomorrow thank you thank you so much not at all now get dressed i would suggest by the way that you avoid all intimate contact with this girl again if she is as these reports suggest then sooner or later she will become dangerous i fully intend to and we must make her character generally known lest others fall into her snare no i said i cannot permit that what if these reports are false i would not calumnize her unnecessarily your sense of justice does you credit but you must not hide behind it such people as she are corrosive to any society and must be known if you must be fastidious then confront her directly and find out at the very least we must pass warning to dr grove so he can act as he sees fit i did not act hastily i needed more than gossip and the testimony of jack prestcott before i was prepared to act instead i kept a more careful watch on her and i admit with shame followed her on occasion when her labors were done i was greatly distressed to have my worst fears confirmed still more for on several occasions she did not go home or did so only briefly instead i saw her leave the town walking purposely on one occasion in the direction of abingdon a town full of soldiers where i knew that trollops were in great demand i could see no other explanation and i note with chagrin that wallis when he discovered the same information decided the only explanation was that she was carrying messages to and from radicals i mention this to indicate the dangers of inadequate and partial evidence for we were both wrong but i did not see this at the time although i think i was prepared to listen openly and frankly to any explanation she might offer the next day after a sleepless night during which i wished fervently that i might be spared the encounter i told sarah to sit down when she came into my room and said i wanted to speak to her on a matter of grave importance she sat quietly and waited i had noticed that in previous days she had not been her usual self and had worked less hard and been less cheerful than was her wont i had not paid a great deal of attention as all women are prone to these moods and scarcely noticed that for her it was out of her normal character i did not know then and did not discover until i read jack prestcotts memoir that this was due to his cruel violation of her naturally she could not tell any of thiswhat womans reputation could endure such shamebut she would not easily forget an offense once committed i understand fully why prestcott submitted to the delusion that she had bewitched him in revenge however ridiculous the belief for her hatred of the malice of others was implacable so much had she been schooled by her upbringing to expect justice i had also noticed that she had spurned my affections and moved out of reach quickly on the one occasion when i had tried to touch her shrugging her shoulder in what appeared to be disgust at my hand on her shoulder i was hurt by this initially then i put it down as more evidence that she was turning away from me for the richer rewards offered by dr grove again i did not know the exact truth until i saw it scribbled down in prestcotts hand i must talk to you on a matter of the gravest importance i said when i had prepared myself properly i noticed and remember well that i had a strange pressure in my breast as i began to talk and my words came breathlessly as though i had run a great distance i have heard some terrible reports which must be dealt with instantly she sat and looked at me blankly with scarcely any interest in her face at all i believe i stuttered and tripped on my words as i forced myself to continue with the interview and even turned to examine my shelves of books so i would not have to look her in the face i have received a grave complaint about your behavior which is that you offered yourself brazenly and coarsely to a man of the university and have been fornicating in the most disgusting fashion again there was a silence of some duration before she repliedthat is true she said that my suspicions and the reports seemed confirmed did not comfort me i had hoped that she would indignantly refute the charges allowing me to forgive her so we might continue as before even at that stage however i did not jump to conclusions evidence must be confirmed independently and who is this man i asked a socalled gentleman she said called anthony wood do not be impudent with me i cried in anger you know perfectly well what i mean do i yes you have abused my generosity by seducing dr grove of new college and not content with that alone you also threw yourself on an undergraduate mr prestcott and tried to get him to satisfy you as well do not deny it for i heard it from his lips she turned pale and i take it as an indication of the foolishness of those who believe character can be read in the face that i assumed this to be shock at the discovery of her wiles you heard that she said her face white from his lips indeed i did then it must be true for a fine young man like mr prestcott could surely never lie and he is a gentleman while i am merely a soldiers daughter is it true is it why do you ask me you think it so you have known me for what near four years now and you believe it so how can i not your behavior is all of a piece how can i trust you in your denial i have not denied anything she said i think it none of your affair i am your employer i said in the eyes of the law your father responsible for your behavior in all particulars so tell mewho was that man i saw coming out of your house yesterday she looked puzzled for a moment then realized who i was referring to he was an irishman who came to see me he traveled a long way why that is not your affair either it is it is my duty to myself as much as it is to you to prevent you from bringing shame on this family what will people say if it becomes common currency that the woods are employing a whore in their house maybe they will say that the master mr anthony wood also lies with the slut whenever he can that he takes her to paradise fields and there fornicates awhile before taking himself off to the library and making speeches about the behavior of others that is different why i am not having an argument with you about abstract matters this is serious but if you can act thus with me you can do so with others that is obviously the case so how many other sluts do you know mr wood i was red with anger at this time and blamed her absolutely for what happened next all i had desired was some sort of frank and open response i would have liked her to deny everything so that i might generously exonerate her or confess it frankly and beg my forgiveness which i would have willingly conferred but she would do neither and instead had the insolence to fling my accusations back in my face very swiftly it seemed we plunged into the darkness of our association for whatever may have transpired between us i was still her master by her words she made it clear she had forgotten this and was abusing our intimacy no man of sense could admit there was any similarity between our behaviors even had the accusation any substance for she was beholden to me while i was free of any dependency to her nor could any man tolerate the foulness of her speech to me even in the heat of passion i had never addressed her in anything but the most courteous terms and could not tolerate such language i stood up in shock and took a step toward her she fell back against the wall eyes wide with anger and pointed at me arm outstretched from her shoulder in a strange frightening gesture do not take a single step closer to me she hissed i stopped dead in my tracks i do not know what i intended certainly i do not think there was any violence in my mind for i have never been one to behave in such a way even the worst of servants has never received a blow from me however much it was deserved i do not claim this as any particular quality and in the case of sarah i know i would dearly loved to have beaten her black and blue to revenge myself for the abuse i had suffered but i am certain i would never have done more than try to frighten that fright however was enough for her to abandon all the show of docility i did not know what she might have done had i taken a further step but i felt then a tremendous will within her and i did not feel able to challenge it get out of this house i said when she had lowered her arm you are dismissed i will not lay a complaint against you however much i have a right to do so but i never want you in here again without another word but with a glance of the purest contempt she walked out of the room a few seconds later i heard the front door close had i been prestcott i might have concluded from this encounter that sarah was evil and possessed certainly there was something powerful and terrifying in her gesture and in the flame of her eyes at that moment this is something i will dwell on properly at the right moment for now however i must say merely that not only did such a thought never occur to me i can refute absolutely prestcotts assertions it requires no great learning or knowledge to do so even by his own account prestcotts conclusions were wrong and he was let down by his own ignorance and derangement for example he says that demons took over the body of sir william compton and changed its shape but this is plainly contradicted by all authority for the malleus maleficarum says plain it is not possible aristotle says this can be caused only by natural causes particularly the stars yet dionysius says the devil cannot change the starsgod will not allow it prestcott never found any evidence of sarah having cast an enchantment over his hair and blood and the visions he suffered were due more i think to the devils he had himself summoned into his mind than any sent there by others nor did he read those signs aright which he had himself summoned for in the bowl of water shown him by anne blundy he sought the author of his misfortunes and she showed him trulyhe saw quite plainly his own father and a young manthat man i believe was none other than himself these two people brought all the troubles on their own heads through their violence and their disloyalty greatorex repeated the warning and again he ignored it jack prestcott had the answer in his hand wallis says so plainly and i know it to be true and yet in his madness he blamed others and helped destroy sarah and put all hope forever out of his reach he very nearly put it out of mine as well i scarcely saw sarah at all for the next few months as i took myself back to my manuscripts and my notebooks when not working though my mind incessantly and disobediently returned to her and my distress grew into resentment and then into the most bitter hatred i rejoiced when i heard that dr grove had dismissed her and that she was without work of any sort i took satisfaction in the fact that no one else would employ her for fear of comment and once i saw her in the street red in face with anger and humiliation subjected to the lewd remarks of students who had also heard the stories this time i did not intervene as i had once before but turned away after i was certain she had seen me so that she would know my contempt continued unabated quos laeserunt et oderunt as seneca has it those you have injured you also hate and i believe i felt already that i had been less than just but did not know how to reverse my harshness shortly after this business when my spirits were still low and my habits continued unsociablefor i knew my humor did not appeal and so avoided the company of my fellow men lest they demand to know what ailed mei was summoned to dr wallis this was a rare occurrence for although i was earning him his salary as keeper of the archives he did not honor me frequently with such attention any business between us was habitually conducted at chance meetings in the street or in the library as everyone who knows wallis will realize the summons alarmed me for his coldness was truly terrifying this is one of the rare matters on which prestcott and cola agreeboth found his presence disturbing it was i think the blankness of his countenance which gave such alarm for it is hard to know a man when the visible indicators of character have been so rigorously suppressed wallis never smiled never frowned never showed either pleasure or displeasure there was only his voicesoft menacing and permanently laced with scarcehidden nuances of contempt beneath a courtesy which could evaporate as swiftly as a summer dew it was at this meeting that wallis asked me to discover for him the edition of livy he sought i will not recount the conversation as it actually took place stripped of his sneering remarks about my character the essence of his version is accurate enough i promised to do my best and did so leaving no library unexamined and no bookseller unbothered by my enquiries but he did not tell me why he wanted iti still knew nothing of marco da cola who arrived several weeks afterward i suppose i must now concentrate more fully on that gentleman and approach the heart of the matter i am aware i have delayed unseasonably it is something which i find painful to recall so great was the torment he caused me i heard of colas existence a few days before i met him on the evening of his arrival i think i ate with lower at a cookhouse and he told me of the occurrence he was quite excited about it lower in those days always had a taste for the novel and the exotic and had yearnings to tour the world there was not the slightest chance that he would do so for he had neither the money nor the leisure to travel nor yet the easiness of mind to put aside his career absence is the greatest danger of all for the physician since once out of the mind of the public it is difficult to fight back into esteem but it pleased him for some time to talk about how he would one day tour the universities of the continent meeting the men of science and discovering what they were doing the arrival of cola rekindled these notions in his breast and i am sure he imagined himself arriving in venice and being treated to the greatest hospitality by colas family to repay the courtesies done in oxford and he liked the man strange as he found him for lower was nothing if not broad in his appreciation of humanity indeed the little italian was hard not to like unless one be of a hard and suspicious turn of mind like john wallis short and already tending to a certain roundness in the belly with bright sparkling eyes which twinkled readily with amusement and an engaging manner of leaning forward in his seat which gave the impression of fascinated attention when you spoke he was a charming companion he was full of observations on all he saw and none of these that i heard was pejorative cola seemed one of those happy few who sees only the best and prefers not to notice the worst even mr boyle who gave his affections with the greatest difficulty seemed to grow fond of him despite walliss warnings this was the most extraordinary of all perhaps for boyle liked peace and quiet he suffered noise and disturbance almost as physical pain and even at the height of the most exciting experiment insisted on an air of moderate calm amongst those who were assisting no servant was allowed to clatter about with equipment or talk above a whisper all had to be done with almost a religious demeanorfor in his opinion to study nature was a form of worship so the success of the boisterous noisy colaalways bursting into peals of laughter whose flatfooted movements led him to bump noisily with loud and extravagant oaths into tables and chairswas something of a mystery to us all lower ascribed it to the italians obvious and genuine love of experiment but personally i put it down to his gentlemanly amiability and we might say with menander that his reception was the fruit of his stately manners mr boyle was excessively sober in his demeanor yet occasionally i suspected that there was part of him which admired those who were lighthearted and cheerful perhaps he would have been himself had he been less stricken with ill health i was not aware that in part boyles attention was prompted by ulterior motives but even this does not suffice for he was not a man who could pretend an affection out of duplicity no walliss intervention with boyle merely makes that italians success the more strikingor makes walliss belief the less acceptable for boyle was as well acquainted with cola as any in england and a fine judge of character i find it impossible to credit that he would have extended his affection had he discerned anything at all which corresponded with walliss fears moreover boyle had no need to fear wallis and i believe held him in a certain amount of distastemore than any he was capable of making up his own mind and his opinion should thus be given more weight when reaching any judgment on this matter the gradual disenchantment of lower with cola however did have much to do with wallis for he preyed like the serpent before eve on lowers fears and hopes twisting them to his own ends wallis knew lower was desperate for success for all his family depended on him since it was clear that his elder brother through the perversions of religious belief would never be in a position to give much support and lower had a large family for not only were his parents still living he had several unmarried sisters who needed portions and innumerable demanding cousins merely to satisfy part of their expectations he would have to be the most successful physician in london it says much for his sense of duty that he applied himself with the greatest success when he took up the challenge and it says as much for the weight of this burden on his mind that he swiftly came to see cola as a threat to his progress lower had after all worked hard with mr boyle and others to deserve and receive their patronage he had done countless labors and small services for no payment and had proved an assiduous courtier the rewards were to be boyles support for his membership of the royal society his approval when he finally plucked up the courage to advance his cause with the college of physicians his patronage when the position of court physician came vacant as well as the huge family of patients that boyles approval could bring to him when he began his practice in london and he deserved all the success and all the support boyle could provide for he was a very good physician indeed having worked so hard and being now at the age of some thirtytwo years on the verge of entering the lists he was frightened lest some event snatch those greatly desired rewards from him cola presented no threat to him and would not have done even had he been what lower feared for boyle patronized those with merit and did not play favorite with his clients but lowers jealousy and worry was inflamed by the words of dr wallis who played on his ambition by saying that cola had the reputation for stealing other mens ideas i do not though my own path has been so different condemn moderate ambition such as drove themistocles to match the glory of miltiades or fired alexander to seek the trophies of achilles rather it is the excess of ambition that becomes pride drives courtiers to beggar themselves and their families and makes good men behave with cruelty and recklessness which all men of sense must condemn walliss purpose was to drive lower into this great fault and for a while he succeeded even though lower battled manfully with his jealousy the conflict within him i believe exacerbated those changes in mood from exultation to darkness from excessive friendliness to bitter condemnation which caused cola so much grief initially however all was very well lower bubbled with enthusiasm as he described his new acquaintance and i could see he hoped that a true friendship would develop indeed he was already treating cola with that consideration and courtesy normally reserved for acquaintances of much longer standing do you know he said leaning forward with an arch look of amusement on his face so good a christian physician is he he has even undertaken to treat the old blundy woman without any hope of payment or reward although as he is italian perhaps he intends to take payment in kind from the girl should i warn him do you think i ignored the remark what is wrong with the old woman i asked fell and broke her leg apparently a nasty wound by all accounts and she is unlikely to survive cola took her on after the daughter had the gall to approach dr grove in public to ask for money is this man any good does he know anything about such injuries that i cannot say all i know is that he has set to work with a great enthusiasm completely mindless of the disadvantages of such a client i applaud his kindness if not his sense you would not treat her yourself with only the greatest reluctance he said then hesitated no of course i would but i am glad i was not asked you have taken a shine to this man indeed he is quite delightful and extremely knowledgeable i look forward to many long conversations during his stay which may be a long one as he is out of funds you must come and meet him visitors to this town are few and far between these days we must make what use we can of them there the subject of itinerant italians was dropped and the conversation passed onto other matters i left my friend later with a feeling of concern in the back of my mind for i was distressed to hear of the misfortunes of sarahs mother this was after all many months since our last encounter and the passage of time had softened my feelings i am not a man much given to hatred and find that i cannot sustain a continued resentment however grave the injury suffered while i had no desire to resume my acquaintance i no longer wished to see that family visited by troubles and still nurtured an affection of sorts for the old woman here again i confess freely and say i wished to play the part of magnitude however much she had caused me injury yet i wished to show myself charitable and forgiving perhaps this was the greatest punishment i could bestow for i would show her the extent of her foolishness and lord it over her with my condescension so after much thought the following evening i covered myself in my cloak put on my warmest hat and gloves cola was certainly right about the coldness of the weather my friend mr plot has meticulously gathered measurements which show it to have been bitterly cold although spring came suddenly and brilliantly only a week or so later winter held the country in its icy grip until the last moment and walked down to the castle i was nervous of being seen and even more nervous about encountering sarah as i had no expectation of being welcomed but she was not there i knocked waited then walked in with relief in my heart thinking that i would be able to comfort the mother without the risk of angering the daughter that woman however was asleep no doubt due to some potion or other and although i was tempted to wake her so that my kindness might not go unnoticed yet i refrained from doing so her face shocked me so gaunt and pale that it resembled a deaths head her breathing was harsh and difficult and the smell in the room was oppressive in the extreme like all people i have witnessed death on many occasions i watched my father my brothers and sisters my cousins and my friends all die some young some old of injury illness plague and simple old age no one i think can reach the age of thirty without knowing death intimately in all its guises and it was in that room waiting its chance there was nothing i could do at that moment anne blundy did not need any practical help i could give and any spiritual comfort would not have been pleasing to her reluctantly i stood watching her overcome by that sudden hopelessness that results from wanting to do well but not knowing how until a footstep at the door roused me from my meditations overcome with a fear and a sudden reluctance to confront sarah herself i quickly took myself into the little room next to the chamber since i knew there was a small door through which i could once again gain the street but it was not sarah the footfalls in the room were far too heavy for that and so i paused out of curiosity to know who had come into the house by carefully peering through the doora deceit i am ashamed to acknowledge as it is the sort of falseness no gentleman should ever perpetratei could see that the man in the next room must be this cola no englishman in those days at least would ever have dressed in such a fashion he was behaving very strangely however and his activities caught my attention in such a way that i compounded my illbehavior by continuing to watch and continuing to make sure that i was myself unobserved first he came in and established as i had that widow blundy was still perfectly asleep then knelt down beside her took out his rosary and prayed deeply for a short while as i say i had considered doing something of the same myself in a more protestant way but knew her better than to think even that would be welcomed then he acted most strangely indeed taking out a small phial which he opened and spreading some oil on his finger he applied this finger gently to her forehead made the sign of the cross and prayed again before putting the bottle back under his coat this was odd enough although might be explained by great personal devotion which i could admire as much as i condemned his error in doctrine thereafter he bewildered me completely as he got up abruptly and began searching the room not out of idle curiosity but a thorough and determined search pulling the small number of books off the shelves and flicking through them one by one before shaking them to see if anything should flutter out one i noted he tucked under his coat so it could not be seen then he opened the little chest next to the door which contained all the blundys possessions and went through that as well meticulously searching for something whatever it was he did not find it for he closed the lid with a heavy sigh and muttered some imprecation in his native languagei did not understand the words but the sense of disappointment and frustration was clear enough he was standing in the room clearly wondering what to do next when sarah arrived how is she i heard her say and my heart stirred to hear her voice again she is not well at all said the italian he had a thick accent but spoke clearly and evidently understood the language perfectly can you not attend to her more i have to work she replied our position is already grave now my mother cannot earn will she recover it is too soon to say i am drying out the wound then i will rebind it i fear she is developing a fever it may pass but i am concerned you must check every half hour for signs of the fever getting worse and strange as it may seem you must keep her warm i see here that my recollection of the conversation matches that of mr cola very well his memory is sound as to the beginning of the matter so i will not continue to repeat what he has already said i will however add that i noticed something he does not mention which is that there was instantly in that room a most palpable tension between the two of them and while sarah behaved perfectly normally concerned only for her mother cola became distinctly and ever more agitated as the conversation proceeded i thought initially that he was alarmed at the thought that his bizarre behavior might have been spotted but realized this could not be i should have left instantly and slipped away while i had the chance to do so unobserved but i could not bring myself to go i am fortunate indeed forgive me sir i mean no insolence my mother told me how well and generously you acted to her and we are both deeply grateful for your kindness we are not used to it and i am truly sorry i misspoke i was frightened for her that is quite all right cola replied as long as you do not expect miracles will you come again tomorrow if can and if she worsens come and find me at mr boyles i will be attending him now about payment he said i reproduce more or less word for word the conversation as set down by mr cola and admit that his account as far as my own memory serves is impeccable i will merely add one thing which strangely finds no mention in his description for as he spoke about payment he took a step closer to her and rested his hand on her arm oh yes your payment how could i think you would forget about that we must deal with that urgently must we not it was only then that she broke away and led him into the room where i swiftly concealed myself in the gloom so i might escape observation very well then physician take your payment and as cola says again with perfect truth she lay herself down and pulled up her dress revealing herself to him with the most obscene of gestures but cola does not mention the tone in her voice the way her words trembled with anger and contempt and the sneer on her face as she spoke cola hesitated then took a step backward and crossed himself you disgust me it is all in his account i merely plagiarize his words but again i must differ on a point of interpretation for he says he was angry and i did not detect that what i saw was a man horrified almost as though he had seen the devil himself his eyes were wide and he all but cried out in despair as he recoiled from her and averted his gaze it was many days before i learned the reasons for this bizarre behavior lord forgive me your servant for i have sinned he said in latin which i could understand and sarah could not i remember it well he was angry at himself not at her for she was nothing to him but a temptation which had to be resisted then he ran stumbling in his hurry out of the room not slamming the door it is true for he left too fast to shut it at all sarah lay there on the straw pallet breathing deeply she rolled over and buried her head in her arms face down into the straw i thought she was merely going to sleep until i heard the unmistakable sounds of her weeping her heart out heavy choking sobs which tore at my soul and rekindled in an instant all my affections i could not help myself and paused not even an instant to reflect on what i was doing she had never cried so before and the sound of such deep sadness flooded my heart dissolving all bitterness and rancor and leaving it pure and clean i took a step forward and knelt down beside her sarah i said softly she jumped in fright as i spoke pulling her dress down to cover herself and recoiling from me in terror what are you doing here i could have given long explanations could have made up a story about how id just arrived and was anxious about her mother but the sight of her face made me abandon any thought of pretense i have come to ask your forgiveness i said i do not deserve it but i have wronged you i am so very sorry it was easy to say and i felt as i spoke that those words had been waiting their chance for months instantly i felt better and relieved of a great weight what was more i truly think i did not mind whether she forgave me or not for i knew she would be quite within her rights not to do so as long as she accepted that my apology was genuine this is a strange time and place to say such a thing i know but the loss of your friendship and regard is more than i can bear did you see what happened just now i hesitated before admitting the truth then nodded she did not instantly reply then began shaking i thought that it was with tears once more but then discerned to my astonishment that it was with laughter you are a strange man indeed mr wood i cannot make you out at all on no evidence at all you accuse me of the most vile behavior and when you see a scene such as that you ask my forgiveness what am i to make of you i hardly know what to make of myself sometimes my mother is going to die she continued the laughter ceasing and her mood changing on the instant yes i agreed i am afraid she is i must accept it as gods will but i find it impossible to do so it is strange why so no one has ever said obedience and resignation are easy i am so frightened of losing her i am ashamed for i can hardly bear to see her the way she is now how did she break her leg she fell lower told me but how could that be she was pushed she came back here in the evening when she had closed the wash house and found a man in the house looking through our chest you know her well enough to realize she would not run away he got a black eye i think but she was pushed to the ground and kicked one of the blows broke her leg she is old and frail and her bones are not strong any more why did you not say so make a complaint she knew him all the more reason all the less he is a man who worked once for john thurloes office as did my father even now he will never be caught or punished for anything he might do but what we have nothing as you know nothing that could interest him at any rate except those papers of my fathers which i gave to you i said they were dangerous do you have them safe still i assured her it would take many hours to find them in my room even if someone knew they were there then i told her of what i had seen that evening and said that cola also had made a thorough search she shook her head sadly lord why dost thou persecute thy servant so i wrapped my arms around her and we lay there together i stroking her hair and giving what comfort i could it was not much i ought to tell you about jack prestcott she began eventually but i hushed her i do not want or need to hear anything i said better that it should be forgotten whatever it was i did not want to hear and she was grateful to be spared the humiliation of having to speak will you return to work for us i asked it is not much to offer but if it becomes known in the town that the woods will admit you into their house it will begin to mend your reputation quite apart from giving you money will your mother have me oh yes she was very angry when you left and has never stopped complaining how much better the housework was done when you were there she smiled at that for i knew my mother had never once allowed herself to issue even the faintest word of praise in sarahs hearing lest it make her grow proud perhaps i will although as it seems i am not to pay for doctors now then my need for money is the less that i said is carrying submission to divine will too far if it can be done then your mother must have attention how do you know this is not a test of your love for your mother and that she is meant to survive her death would be punishment for your negligence otherwise you must have treatment for her all i can afford is a barber and even they might refuse she has refused any treatment i can give her and i could not help in any case why she is old and it is her time to die i think i can do nothing perhaps lower could he can try if he will and i would be happy if he succeeded i will ask him if this cola will say she is no longer his patient then he might be prevailed upon he will not abuse a colleague by doing so without his leave but it sounds as though there should be no trouble gaining that i cannot pay i will see to that somehow dont you worry with the very greatest reluctance i pulled myself up for all the world i would have stayed there all night something i had never done before and which i found strangely enticing to hear her heart beat against mine and feel her breath against my cheek were the sweetest sensations but it would have been an imposition and would also have been noticed the next day she had a reputation to rebuild and i had one to preserve oxford then was not like the kings court nor even had it the laxity of the town now all had ears and too many were swift to condemn i was myself my mother presented only the most cursory of objections when i announced that sarah had repented of her sins and added that in any case they were smaller than common tittletattle pronounced it was a mark of charity to forgive the sinner if regret was genuine and i concluded that i was sure this was the case and she is a good worker who might perhaps now accept a hapenny less a week she said shrewdly well certainly get none better at that wage so it was agreed with yet another hapenny earmarked from my pocket to make up the difference and sarah was reengaged there then followed the problem of her mother and i talked to lower about it a few days later when i had the opportunity he was a difficult man to get hold of then for he was hard at work on his fine examination of the brain the dedication of which made him most anxious to whom should i address it he asked me with a worried frown before i could speak it is a most delicate matter and by far the most concerning part of the whole enterprise surely not i said the work itself he waved his hand dismissively the work is nothing he said pure labor and applied concentration the expense of publication is worse than that do you know how much a good engraver costs i must have highquality illustrations the whole point is lost if the drawings are botched and with some of these people you cant tell a human brain from a sheeps once they are done i need at least twenty all done by a london engraver he sighed deeply i envy you wood you can produce all the books you want and not pay attention to these questions i would like many engravings i said it is very important that readers see the representation of the people i mention so they can judge for themselves that my account of their characters is accurate by comparing deeds and features true true my point is that your words can stand on their own if need be in my case the book is all but incomprehensible if there are not illustrations of great expense so worry about that not the dedication the illustrations he said gravely resuming the worried look are mere money a nightmare but a straightforward one the dedication is my entire future am i ambitious and risk aiming too high or modest aim too low and waste my effort for no gain the book must be its own reward i think spoken like a true scholar he replied testily all very well for you with no family to provide for and content to remain here forever i am as jealous of fame as the next man i said but that will come from admiration of the book not by using it as a weapon to bludgeon your way into the favor of the mighty to whom do you consider giving it in my dreams when i think of glory i naturally think of giving it to the king after all that galileo man in italy addressed one piece of work to the medici and was given a rich court position for life as a result i imagine his majesty being so impressed that he straightaway appoints me royal physician except he said bitterly that there is one already and his gracious majesty is too hard up for two why not be more imaginative there are so many addressed to him already and he cannot be grateful to every author in england you would merely be lost in the melee such as i dont know someone who is rich would appreciate the gesture and whose name would attract attention how about the duchess of newcastle lower cackled oh yes he said very funny i might as well dedicate it to the memory of oliver cromwell a fine way if i may say so to ensure that the world of curiosity never takes me seriously again a woman experimentalist indeed an embarrassment to her family and her sex come now wood be serious i grinned lord clarendon too predictable and might fall from power or die from a seizure before it came out a rival the earl of bristol dedicate a book to a professing catholic do you want me to starve to death a rising star then this henry bennet may well become a falling star a man of learning mr wren one of my best friends but he can no more advance me than i can advance him mr boyle then i like to think i have his patronage already it would be a waste of an opportunity there must be someone i will think on it i told him its not as if the book is about to go to the printers another groan dont remind me unless i get some more brains it never will i do wish the courts would hang someone there is that young man in jail at the moment whose chances are not good jack prestcott it is likely he will be hanged in a week or so heaven knows he deserves it and so you see it was i who reminded lower of prestcott whose arrest had caused something of a stir in the town some ten days previously and caused him to go off to solicit his body and i believe it was true that lower took cola along rather than cola devising some means of visiting the young man in jail as dr wallis assumed indeed as i will make clear mr cola had very good reasons for not having anything to do with prestcott if he could avoid it it must have been a considerable shock for him to come across someone whom he had met before the mention of prestcott naturally brought my mind back to sarah blundy and the condition of her mother and i suggested to lower he might consider treating her no he said firmly i cannot take the patient of another physician even if cola is not one that is the most appalling manners but lower i said he will not treat her and the woman will die if he tells me so then i will reconsider but i hear she cannot pay i frowned at this for i knew well that my friend habitually and to his own disadvantage treated many who could not afford his services lower saw my reaction and looked very ill at ease it would have been different had i offered knowing the situation but she imposed on poor cola quite abominably not telling him she had no money we physicians have our pride you know besides i dont want to treat her you of all people should know what shes like and i am amazed at your asking me perhaps i was wrong the girl has been slandered at least in part i am sure of it besides i am not asking you to treat her im asking you to treat her mother if need be i will stand the cost he thought a moment as i knew he would for he was too good a manand as a physician too much in need of practiceto turn down an opportunity i will talk to cola and see what he says he said i will no doubt see him later now you must excuse me my friend for i have a busy day boyle is running an experiment i wish to observe i will have to consider approaching this young man you mention in jail and in addition to all that i have to go to dr wallis for a consultation is he ill i hope so he would be a fine patient to have if i can cure him he is well in at the royal society and if i have both him and boyle behind me then my entrance will be assured and with high hopes he went off only to be told so i see from walliss manuscript that his friend cola was out to steal his ideas poor man no wonder he was so illhumored with cola later that day although it does him credit that he spoke not a word against the italian for lower tried not to level accusations unless he was sure of his ground few alas put their principles into action in this way i have met many a scientist who will intone gravely of lord bacon and the virtues of the inductive method yet will rush to believe the idlest gossip without any thought of contradiction it seems reasonable to me they say not realizing this is pure nonsense reason cannot seem anything i thought this was the whole point of it it must be capable of demonstration and if it merely seems then it is not reason as is known lower did speak to cola and i to sarah and persuaded her that she had no option but to apologize to the italian so that he would consent to treat the mother once more this i may say was a hard task to accomplish and had it been her own death that was in prospect no words or arguments would have persuaded that proud strange girl to give way but it was anothers life that was at stake and she accepted that she must submit for my part i was concerned lest the italian renew his advances and decided to reduce the possibility by offering payment myself it meant doing without near two months supply of books but it was an act of charity that i thought would be well made i did not however have any money my income in those days came from an annuity on funds i had lent to my cousin to buy his tavern and he had undertaken to pay me the sum of every lady day he performed this task dutifully and i was content that i had placed my small fortune to advantage for nothing is more secure than ones own familythough even this is not always certain however he would not and could not pay in advance and i had grossly exceeded my budget recently in buying a new viol apart from food and the money i gave my mother i was almost without funds for several months and had to live modestly myself to avoid disaster the three pounds i needed for cola was a sum far beyond my resources i could advance near twentyfour shillings borrowed another twelve from various friends who held me in good credit and raised nine shillings by selling some books that left me with fifteen shillings to find and it was because of this that i summoned my courage and made an appointment to see dr grove i had never met the man and knew only of his reputation which stated that he was irascible and difficult in character backward in outlook and with a pronounced tendency to cruelty when he had drunk more than a little he was nonetheless said to be of great brilliance but time and misfortune had perverted this and dedicated his acumen to rancor and bitterness wallis note speaks well of him as does cola and i do not doubt that he could display great courtesy when he chose indeed there was none more charming if he thought you worthy or of a similar rank to himself but a meeting with grove was a lottery and the reception he accorded was in no way influenced by the occasion instead he would use his interlocutors for his own purposes as his mood dictated i was aware of all this and went nonetheless for i could think of no other who might assisti have never had wealthy friends and at that time most of my acquaintance were poorer even than i i was certain now that in the matter of the tales i had heard grove had been slandered as badly as had sarah and was equally sure that he would be grieved his servant had been so punished by baseless malice i understood of course that he might not wish to offer public assistance for the sake of his reputation but was confident that an opportunity for private aid would be most welcome to him so i went and as a result brought about his death i state the fact baldly so there should be no mistaking the matter all in their reports give their conclusions their thoughts their reasons and their suspicions about why and how this event took place many sorts of evidence have been called into the matter cola used confession to conclude sarah was responsible and believed that personal testimony could not be gainsaid she admitted the deed therefore had committed it and i agree that in most cases this is the strongest evidence there is prestcott in his muddled way used the procedures of legal reasoning deciding who best benefited and then as no other information contradicted this concluded that thomas ken was responsible dr wallis applied his own power of logic convinced that his fine mind could encompass all relevant issues and draw valid conclusions all were convinced of the infallibility of their forensical technique resorted to because the one type of witness which could conclude the matter was unavailable to themnone of them saw who put the poison in the bottle i did my lord bacon in his novum organum discusses this point and investigates with his habitual brilliance the various categories of evidence and finds them all flawed none conveys certainty he decides a conclusion which one might think would be devastating for scientists and lawyers alikehistorians and theologians have learned to live with this the former modestly tempering their claims the latter resting their glorious edifice on the more reliable foundations of revelation for without certainty what is science except glorified guesswork and without the conviction of certainty total and absolute how can we ever hang anyone with an easy conscience witnesses can lie and as i know myself even an innocent can confess to a crime he did not commit but lord bacon did not despair and claimed one instance of a fingerpost which points in one direction only and allows of no other possibility the perfectly independent eyewitness who has nothing to gain from his revelation who is in addition schooled in observation and report through a gentlemanly status and education this is the nearest we can get to a reliable witness and his testimony may be said to be conclusive overwhelming all lesser forms i claim here that status and assert that what follows eliminates all possibility of further argument on the subject i sent a brief note to dr grove begging the favor of an interview and in due course received a note saying that he would see me that evening thus perhaps some two hours after mr cola had left the college i knocked on the door naturally i did not refer to the purpose of my visit immediately i might be a beggar but i did not wish to appear an uncivil one so we talked for a good threequarters of an hour which was interrupted frequently by groves belching and farting as he complained loudly of the food that his college chose to serve up to its fellows i wish i knew what that cook did to it he said after a particularly bad attack you would not have thought a good simple roast could be so massacred i swear it will be the death of me in the end do you know i had a guest in this evening young italian man about your age id guess he chewed his way through with no complaint but the look of shock about him was so great i almost felt like laughing straight in his face thats the trouble with these foreigners too used to fancy sauces they dont know what real meats like they like their food like their religion eh he chuckled at his metaphor all dressed up and elaborate so you cant tell whats underneath garlic or incense its the same thing he chuckled again at his little sally and i could see he was wishing he had thought of it earlier the better to irritate his guest i did not point out that his attitude to the food seemed to me a little contradictory here he groaned again and clutched his stomach dear god that food pass me that little packet of powder dear boy i picked it up what is this an infallible purgative although that pompous little italian says its dangerous it isnt bate says it is safe and he is the kings physician if its good enough for a king its good enough for me i should think it is vouched for both by authority and by my own experience then this cola tells me it is useless nonsense two pinches and your bowels empty on the instant i bought a large amount four months back against such occasions as these i believe mr cola is a doctor so possibly knows what he says so he says i dont believe it myself hes too jesuitical to be a real physician i understand he is treating anne blundy of a broken leg i said seeing my chance of bringing the conversation around at the very name dr groves face darkened with displeasure and he growled menacingly like a dog warning a rival for a bone so i hear or was for she cannot afford the treatment and mr cola it seems cannot afford to work for nothing grove grunted but i did not take the warning so eager was i to do my business and depart i have pledged myself for two pounds and five shillings good of you but i need another fifteen shillings which i do not possess at the moment if you have come here to ask me for a loan the answer is no but that girl near cost me eighty pounds a year i nearly lost the living i have been promised because of her i dont care if her mother dies tomorrow it would be no more than she deserves from what i hear and if she cannot afford treatment then that is the consequence of her own behavior and it would be a sin to obviate the punishment that she has brought on herself it is her mother i think who is being punished that is not my doing and no longer my affair you seem to concern yourself greatly with this servant of yours if i may say so why is that perhaps i blushed and that gave the man the hint for he was quickwitted in his malice she works for my mother and it was you who recommended that she come to me as a servant was it not mr wood you who are the fons et origo of my troubles with her and you pay her medical bills as well that is very caring unusually so if i may say it perhaps these rumors that have been circulating about her sluttishness should properly refer themselves to you rather than to me he looked carefully at me and i saw a slow unmistakable look of understanding spread across his face dissimulation has never been a skill have either cultivated or perfected my face is an open book to those who can read and grove had that sort of malice which delights in other mens secrets tormenting and persecuting by his possession of them ah the antiquarian and his servant too wrapped up in his learning for a wife contenting himself with some sluttish rubbish between his books thats it isnt it you possess this little whore and think it love and you play the gallant with this grubby little bug thinking her in your mind a veritable eloise pledging money you do not have and expecting other people to stand you credit so you can impress your lady but she is no lady is she mr wood far from that indeed he looked at me again and then laughed outright oh dear me it is true i see it on your face this is the perfect joke i must say the bookworm and the slut almost the subject for a poem an heroic epistle in hexameters a theme worthy of mr milton himself for no subject is too hideous for his pen he laughed again for my face was burning red with shame and anger and i knew that no denial would persuade him nor deflect him from his entertainment come now mr wood he continued you must see the joke even you must see that the meek little scholar dedicated only to his learning mousing away in his nest of papers eyes red from never seeing the light and we wonder why all this endeavor produces nothing is it some great work that is taking shape in his brain is it the difficulties of conception that delay the birth of a masterpiece is it the sheer magnitude of his task that means the years pass by with no result and then we find out no tis none of these it is because while everyone thinks he is working away he is instead rolling in the dust with his servant better still he has persuaded his mother to have the girl in her house turning his servant into a harlot and his mother into a bawd now mr wood tell me that is not perfect the theologians tell us that cruelty comes from the devil and this may be the ultimate cause for it is most certainly evil in intent but in its immediate cause i do believe that true cruelty comes from a perversion of pleasure for the cruel man enjoys the torment he inflicts on others and like an experienced musician with his viol or virginal can play upon his instrument and make all manner of harmony exciting torment and humiliation distress and empty anger shame regret and fear at will some can produce all of these together or singly with the most delicate touches sometimes playing more loudly on his subject until the motion excited in the mind is all but unbearable then more softly so that the misery is summoned gently and with seductive delight such a man as grove was an artist in his cruelty for he played for the pleasure of his creation and the delight of his skill if thomas ken as i suspect had regularly been subjected to such treatment then i could only admire his humility in bearing such constant assaults all no doubt made unseen and unknown to any of his fellows for private torment is still more delicious to the tormentor and more intense for the sufferer who cannot describe his calvary to others without seeming weak and foolish and thus coming to suffer still more cruelty only this time selfinflicted i make myself seem ridiculous by recounting this i know but i have to retell and can only hope i will be understood all men have been shamed and tormented in some degree and so all know the way in which it unbalances the judgment and fuddles the head so that the sufferer feels like a beaten animal on a leash desiring escape but not knowing how to slip the rope that keeps him in place for my trial was not yet over grove saw all too well what easy quarry i was and how simple it was to impose himself upon me for i had none of those skills which enable others to shrug off attacks or mount defenses against those who wish them ill i cannot imagine he said that dr wains will continue to welcome the presence of a man such as yourself in the archives in which you take such pleasure it is often the case that men do more damage through their lusts than others can ever accomplish think of the condemnation your mother and whole family will be forced to endure when it becomes known that she was running a whorehouse for her son and paying his slut out of her own money why are you doing this i asked in desperation why do you torment me i torment you why do you say this in what way do i torment you i am merely stating the facts surely we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard acts the words of st peter himself is it right for sin to go unpunished and fornication undiscovered he stopped talking and his face darkened all of a sudden as the air of humor vanished and was replaced by the blackest anger like the sky in those moments before the heavens are torn by thunder i know you mr wood i know it was you who sent that girl to me as my servant so your friend mr ken might calumnize me i know it was you who spread stories around the town to blacken my name and so deprive me of my rights mr prestcott told me all this as honest a man as you are deceitful and then you come here to ask me for money like some grubby little beggar with his inkstained hand out no sir you deserve and will receive nothing but my hatred you expect to conspire against me and receive no retribution from my hand you pick a bad enemy mr wood and you will soon discover that you have made the worst mistake of your life i thank you for coming for i now know how to respond i have seen the guilt on your face for myself and believe me i will pay you back in full now get out and leave me in peace i hope you will excuse me for not seeing you to the door my bowels will wait no longer and with a monstrous fart he levered himself up and walked into the next room where i heard him pull down his breeches and settle with a loud sigh onto his chamber pot i could do nothing and had failed most miserably to defend myself from his attacks on me i had sat there reddened in the face like an infant and made no attempt to reply in any but the most feeble of fashions and yet i was man enough to burn with rage at his words and contempt but instead of reacting like a man i behaved like a child bereft of any noble reply made to his face i instead played a foolish prank on him behind his back then sneaked out like some school jester fooling myself that i had at least done something in my own defense for i took the packet of powder on the table and poured it entire into the bottle of brandy which stood next his chair drink that i thought as i left his room and may your entrails torment you then i left him hoping he would be up all night with the most violent stomach aches i swear to god and by all i hold true that i meant him no other harm i wished him to suffer and to be racked with agony it is true and hoped fervently that i had not put too little of the powder in or that it would not prove too weak to serve but i did not wish him dead nor had i any intention of killing him it was long since dark when i left and the night was cold with a north wind and the suggestion of rain in the air a miserable night for any man to be out and yet i could not bring myself to go home and had no craving for the company of my fellows there was only one thing on my mind and i could not possibly talk of it in such circumstances all other conversation would have seemed petty and pointless nor could i summon the calm necessary for music there is usually something immeasurably restful about the unfolding of a piece and the perfectly sweet inevitability of a wellconceived conclusion but any piece of music formed in that way repelled me that night the turmoil of my mind was so far distant from any harmony i found myself instead wishing to see sarah and the desire grew on me despite all my attempts to quash it but i did not want her company or consolation or yet her conversation rather i found a resentment deep within me that sprang from unknown depths as my mind became convinced that she and she alone was the source of the troubles which had been visited upon me i revisited once more all those old suspicions and jealousies which i thought had been suppressed forever instead they burst up once again like tinder in a dry summer forest that catches a spark and turns into a conflagration at the gentlest of breezes my fevered mind imagined that my apology had been farcical my regret misplaced all my suspicions so i told myself were true for the girl was cursed and anyone who befriended her would pay heavily for his affections all this i told myself as i walked wrapped up in my heavy winter cloak my feet already damp from the mud only just beginning to freeze over in new college lane even more did i assure myself of my ill fortune as i crossed the high street into merton street and then turned away from the door of my house unwilling to see my mother and disguise the hurt i might well cause her if grove made good on his promises to turn my family into a laughingstock so i walked on out into st aldates thinking i might go into the countryside and walk along the river for the sound of running water is another sure way of calming the soul as is well attested by innumerable authorities but i did not walk by the river that night for i had barely passed christ church when i noticed a slight figure on the far side of the road wrapped up in a shawl that was too thin to be of much use with a bundle under her arm walking purposefully along at a rapid pace i knew instantly from the appearance and the bearing that it was sarah going off so i thought in my delirium to some secret assignation the opportunity finally to satisfy all my suspicions was there and i took it almost without thinking i knew of course that she was in the habit of leaving oxford either in the evening or for an entire day and night if she was free and i had believed once that it was to go to find business for herself in those small towns where she would not be recognized the penalties for whoredom were such that it was foolish for any woman to ply such a trade in her own town i knew also that this was merest nonsense but the more i told myself that she was a woman of rare goodness the more the demons within laughed so that i thought i would go as mad as prestcott through the contradictions which fought to possess my imagination and so i decided to carry out my own exorcism and discover the truth since she would not tell me herself and her refusal only stoked my curiosity in recounting this i will give another example of how proceeding from faulty assumptions a false conclusion can be drawn from the assembly of indisputable fact dr wallis states that his theory of a deadly alliance between cola and the discontented radicals was confirmed by the behavior of the blundy girl who spent much time traveling from burford in the west to abingdon in the south carrying messages to sectaries who he was sure would in due course rise up as one when the murder of clarendon had thrown the country into turmoil when he questioned her sarah denied doing any such thing but in such a way that he so surely could he penetrate deceit was convinced she was lying to cover her illegal actions she was lying this is true and she was trying to cover illegal actions this is also true in this respect dr walliss understanding of the situation was perfectly accurate for the girl was terrified that he would discover what she was doing and knew full well that the punishment would be severe not only for her but for others as well she was not one of those who sought out martyrdom through pride but rather was prepared to accept it in humility if it could not be honorably avoidedthis indeed was her fate in all other respects however dr wallis was wrong my decision made all unthinking i swiftly retraced my steps to my cousins tavern and begged the use of a horse fortunately i knew that part of the world well and it was a simple matter to take tracks out to sandleigh and then back into abingdon which enabled me to arrive long before she did i wore a dark cloak and a hat pulled down over my forehead and as everyone always tells me i am an inconspicuous person not one to be noticed in a crowd it was easy to place myself on the oxford road and wait for her to pass which she did a half hour later it was also simple to follow her and see what she did as she took no pains to conceal her movements or hide her destination and had no suspicion of being followed the town has a small quay on the river used for landing goods for market and it was to this place that she headed and knocked boldly on the door of a small warehouse that normally stored farmers produce the night before market i was undecided about what i should do next and as i stood there i noticed first one then more people also come up to the door and be given admittance unlike sarah these people were furtive in their movements and were bundled up so that their faces could not be seen i stood back in a doorway for some time to consider this and found myself entirely perplexed i should say that like wallis my instant thought was that this was some meeting of radicals for abingdons notoriety was considerable and virtually everyone in the town from the aldermen down were persistent offendersor so reputation said nonetheless it was strangethe town was infamous for the brazen way it defied the law yet these people were acting in a secretive fashion as if they were doing something of which even sectaries might disapprove i am neither courageous nor daring and placing myself in a position of peril is strange to my nature yet my curiosity was allconsuming and i knew that standing outside waiting for the rain to fall would answer nothing might i be attacked this was a possibility i thought these people had no reputation for placidity in those days and i had heard so many stories over the years i believed them capable of anything a sensible person would slip away a responsible one would make a report to a magistrate but although i consider myself both i did neither instead my heart beating heavily in my chest and my bowels churning from simple fear i found myself walking up to that door and the dour man who guarded it good evening brother he said welcome it was not the greeting i had expected there was no suspicion and instead of the caution i had anticipated i was received with openness and friendship but i still had no idea what all this was about all i knew was that sarah among many others had gone into that building who was she seeing what meeting was she attending i did not know but strengthened by the lack of suspicion i became more determined to find out good evening brother i replied may i enter of course he said with some surprise of course you may although you may not find much room i am not too late i hope i have come from out of town ah he said with satisfaction that is good very good then you are twice welcome whoever you are and he nodded for me to go into the warehouse a little easier but still conscious that i might be putting my neck into a fiendish trap i walked past him it was a small dingy room scarcely lit with huge dark shadows playing on the wall from the few lamps which provided the only illumination it was warm which surprised me as there was no fire that i could see and it was cold outside only gradually did i realize that the heat came from near forty people who sat or kneeled on the floor so quietly and with so little movement that to begin with i didnt realize they were alive at all i thought that i was seeing bales of hay or corn packed tightly together on the floor somewhat at a loss and more perplexed than ever i made my way to the back of the room and squatted down myself in the darkness making sure that my cloak was covering much of my face as everyone there i saw had bared their heads in some gesture of commonality even the women i noted with some disdain were similarly exposed it was strange i thoughtsuch people were known for refusing to doff their hats even in the presence of the king let alone any lesser man only god they said with typical conceit deserved such respect i thought that perhaps i had tumbled into a meeting of quakers or some such but knew enough of them to realize this was quite unlike their gatherings rarely could they manage more than half a dozen people and even less frequently did they gather in such a fashion then i considered that perhaps these were radical sectaries gathered together to plot some uprising the thought made me queasy as i knew that with my habitual ill fortune the magistrates men would undoubtedly surround the place and cart me off to prison as a spreader of sedition but the women and such quietness hardly so such people are characterized above all by raucous shouting as each and all express their opinions and damn all others this tranquil mood was not what i associated with such devils and then i realized that all eyes in the place every single person were focused with extraordinary attention on a dim figure at the front the only person standing although as quiet as all the others it took some time for my eyes to become accustomed to the gloom and i realized that this shadowy figure was sarah herself perfectly immobile with her thick black hair falling loose around her shoulders and her head bowed so that her face was almost entirely obscured again i was mystified it was not as if she was doing anything nor was there any expectation in the audience that she should i think i was the only person there not wholly content with the proceedings how long she had stood like that i do not know perhaps from the moment she came in which was now nearly half an hour i do know that we all sat there for another ten minutes in the most perfect of silence and a strange experience it was to be so very still and immobile with all others in equal quietude had i not been perfectly in command of myself i would have sworn i had heard a soft voice in the roof beams telling me to be patient and calm it frightened me until i looked up and saw it was only a dove fluttering from beam to beam as the presence of people disturbed its rest but even that did not alarm me as much as when sarah moved all she did was lift her head until she was looking at the roof the shock and ripple of excitement that went through the audience was quite extraordinary almost like being hit by lightning a groan of anticipation from some quarters a hiss of breath from others and some shuffling as many of the present leaned forward in anticipation she will talk came a soft murmur from a woman close by followed by a hushing sound from a man next to her but she did not merely moving her head conveyed quite enough dramatic effect for the audience any more excitement it seemed would be too much for them instead she gazed at the roof for a few more minutes then looked down at the assembled throng who reacted with even more tremulous emotion than before even i caught up in the fervor despite myself found my heart beating faster in my chest as the moment whatever it was to be drew nearer when she did utter she spoke so softly and sweetly that her words were hard to hear instead everyone there had to lean forward intently to catch what she was saying and the words themselves set down on paper with my pen give nothing of the mood for she entranced us all bewitched us even until grown men were crying openly and women were rocking themselves to and fro with expressions of angelic peace such as i have never seen in any church with her words she gathered us all to her breast and gave us comfort reassuring us of our doubts calming us of our fears and convincing us that all manner of things was good i do not know how she did it unlike actors she had no technique nor any manner of artifice in her address her hands remained clasped in front of her and made no gestures she scarcely moved at all and yet out of her mouth and her whole body came balm and honey freely offered to all by the end i was shaking with love for her and god and all mankind in equal measure but had no idea why this was all i know is that from that moment i consigned myself freely and without hesitation into her power for her to do as she wished and knowing it would be nothing ill she spoke for well over an hour and it was like the finest consort of musicians as the words flowed and turned and played over us until we too were like sounding boxes vibrating and resonating with her speech i have read the words over again how much i disappoint myself for the spirit is entirely lacking from them nor have i in any way managed to encompass the perfect love she spoke or the calm adoration she evoked in her listeners i feel indeed like a man who wakes from sleep after a wondrously perfect dream and writes it all down in a frenzy then finds that all he has on the page are mere words bereft of feeling as dry and unsatisfying as chaff when the corn is removed to all men i say there are many roads which lead to my door some broad and some narrow some straight and some crooked some flat and commodious while others are rough and pitted with dangers let no man say that his is the best and only road for they say so out of ignorance alone my spirit will be with you i will lay stretched out on the earth licking the dust and breathing in the earth i will give milk from my breast for the earth mother of our mother and for christ father and husband and wife i held him at night as a bundle of spice between my breasts and knew it was myself i saw my spirit on his face and felt the witness of fire on my breasts loves fire that burns and heals and warms with healing like sunshine after rain i am the bride of the lamb and the lamb itself neither angel nor envoy but i the lord have come i am the sweetness of the spirit and the honey of life i will be in the grave with christ and will rise after betrayal in each generation the messiah suffers until mankind turns away from evil i say you wait for the kingdom of heaven but you see it with your own eyes it is here and is always within your grasp an end to religion and to sects throw away your bibles they are needed no morecast out tradition and hear my words instead my grace and my peace and my mercy and my blessing are upon you few see my coming and fewer still will see my going this evening the last days begin and men move to entrap me the same men as before the same as always i forgive them now for i will remember sins and iniquities no longer i am come to give absolution in my blood i must die and all must die and will keep on dying to the end in every generation as i say such as i remember are but a few fragments of the whole discourse which ranged from sensible practicality deep into madness and back again swinging from simplicity into incoherence in a way which made it impossible to tell one from the other it made no difference to any in the audience and it made no difference to me either i take no pride in my captivity and recall it with pain and do not intend to defend or excuse myself i state it as it was and to those who scorn me as i would do myself were i another i can only say thisyou were not there and do not know what magic she wrought all i can say is that i was sweating as if i had the most violent fever was not alone in feeling the tears of joy and sadness rolling down my cheeks and like all others present scarcely even noticed when the words stopped dropping from her mouth and she walked out a little side door it took perhaps a quarter of an hour before the spell dissipated and one by one like an audience when a play ends we came back to ourselves and discovered that all our limbs and muscles were as stiff as if we had labored in the fields for an entire day at harvest time the meeting was over and it was obvious that the only reason it had assembled was to hear sarah speak in that town and amongst those people she had a notoriety that had already spread far the merest mention that she might make an utterance was enough to bring men and womenthe poor the rough and those of low breedingout in all weathers and risk all manner of sanction from the authorities like everyone else i scarcely knew what to do once it had finished but eventually pulled myself together sufficiently to realize i must collect my horse and go back to oxford in a daze of the most complete peacefulness i walked back to the inn where i had left it and headed home sarah was a prophetess only a few hours earlier the notion would have elicited the utmost scorn from me for the country had been benighted by such people for years thrown into the light of day by the troubles in the way that wood lice become visible when a stone is overturned i remember one who had come to oxford when i was about fourteen a man spitting and foaming at the mouth as he raved in the street dressed in rags like some early saint or stoic damning all the world to hellfire before falling to the ground in a convulsion he made no converts i was not one of those who threw stones at him which attacks pleased him mightily as proving the lords favor but like all others i was disgusted by the display and could easily see that whatever he had been touched by it was not by god they locked him up and were then merciful in throwing him out of the city rather than imposing any harsher punishment a woman prophet was much worse you might think even less likely to inspire anything but contempt yet i have already shown that it was not so is it not said that the magdalen preached and converted and was blessed for it she was not condemned nor ever has been and i could not condemn sarah either it was clear to me that the finger of god had touched her forehead for no devil or agent of satan can reach into the hearts of men like that there is always a bitterness in the devils gifts and we know when we are deceived even if we permit the deception but i could say for a moment only what it was in her words that conveyed such peace and tranquillity i had the experience of it merely not the understanding my horse clopped along the empty road better able than i to see where the track led in a darkness only lifted slightly by a moon which occasionally peeped from behind the clouds and i let my mind wander over the evening trying to recapture that feeling that had been mine so recently and which i felt with the greatest of sadness to be ebbing slowly away so preoccupied with my thoughts was i that i scarcely noticed the shadowy figure on the road walking slowly in front of me when i did i hailed it without thinking before i realized who it was it is late and dark to be on such a road alone madam i said do not be afraid but mount up here and i will take you to your home it is a strong horse and will not mind it was sarah of course and when i saw the moon on her face i was suddenly afraid of her but instead she held out her hand and allowed me to pull her up and she sat comfortably behind me her arms around my waist to avoid slipping she said nothing and i did not know what to say i felt like telling her that i had been at the meeting but feared to come out with some foolishness or have my words taken as a mark of deceit and mistrust so instead we went along in silence for a half hour before she began to talk herself i do not know what it is she said in my ear so quietly that a man not three paces away would not have heard there is no point wondering as i am sure you do i have no recollection of what i say or why i say it you saw me i knew you were there you did not object i think that what i have to say is for anyone who wishes to listen it is for them to judge whether it is worth the effort but you keep it secret not for myself that does not matter but those who listen to me would be punished as well and i cannot ask for that you have always done this your mother too no she is wise but has nothing of this her husband neither as for myself it started shortly after his death i was at a meeting of simple people and remember standing up to say something i recollect nothing more until i found myself lying on the floor with them all gathered around me they said i had spoken the most extraordinary words it happened again a few months later and after a while people came to hear me it was too dangerous in oxford so now i go to places like abingdon i often disappoint them as i stand there and nothing comes over me you heard me this evening what did i say she listened as though i was reporting a conversation which she did not hear then shrugged when i was finished strange she said what do you think am i cursed or mad perhaps you think i am both there is no harshness or cruelty in what you say no threats or warnings nothing but gentleness and love i think you are blessed not cursed but blessings can be even heavier burdens as many people in the past have discovered i found that i was talking as quietly as she so that i might have been talking only to myself thank you she said i did not want you of all people to scorn me you really have no idea what you say there is no preparation none the spirit moves in me and i become its vessel and when i awake it is like coming out of the most gentle dream your mother knows of all this yes of course at first she thought it was just a prank because i had always been scornful of fanatics and all those who run around pretending to be possessed to get money from people i still am and that makes it worse to have become one myself so when i stood that first time and she heard of it she was shocked by my impiety they were not our people in the conventicle but they were good and kind and she was distressed i might make fun of them it took quite a lot to convince her that i had not been deliberately offensive she was unhappy about it and still is she thinks that sooner or later it will lead me into trouble with the law she is right i know a few months back it nearly did i was at tidmarshs and there was a raid by the watch i only just got away but there is not a great deal i can do about it whatever is sent me i must accept there is no point in doing anything other do you think i am mad if i went to someone like lower and told them what i have just witnessed he would do his very best to cure you when i left that hall this evening a woman came up to me fell down on her knees in the ice and kissed the hem of my dress she said that her baby had been dying the last time i came to abingdon i walked past the door and it was instantly well do you believe her she believes it your mother believes it many others in the past few years have held me responsible for such deeds mr boyle heard of it as well my mother she was wracked with pain with a swollen ankle it made her very illtempered and she tried to beat me i held her hand to make her stop and she swore that at that moment the pain and the swelling went she never mentioned it to me i begged her not to it is a terrible reputation to have and boyle he heard something and thought i must have knowledge of herbs and potions so asked for my recipe book it was difficult to refuse him as i could hardly tell him the truth there was a long silence broken only by the sound of the horses hooves on the road and the snuffle of its breath in the cold night air i do not want this anthony she said quietly and i could hear the fear in her voice what whatever this is i dont want to be a prophet i dont want to cure people i dont want them coming to me and i dont want to be punished for something i cannot prevent and do not will i am a woman and i want to marry and grow old and be happy i dont want humiliation and imprisonment and i dont want what will happen next what do you mean an irishman came to see me an astrologer he said he had seen me in his charts and came to warn me he said i will die that everyone will want me dead anthony why would that be what could i have done im sure hes wrong who believes people like that she was silent leave then if it worries you i said go away i cannot nothing can be changed you will have to hope this irishman is wrong and you are mad then i do hope so i am frightened oh i am sure there is nothing to worry about really i said i shook myself to cast off the atmosphere of ominous terror that had grown around us and when i did so i saw more clearly the foolishness of our conversation set down here i suppose it seems even more so i dont hold with irishmen or astrologers and from my limited experience prophets and messiahs these days tend to rush around telling all the world of their powers it is most unusual to hope that the cup be taken from you she laughed at least but noticed my allusion for she knew her bible well and looked curiously at me when i spoke it for my part i swear i did not notice till later what i had said and it passed from my mind easily as we plodded on as i look back i think that time on the horse was the happiest in my life the return of the easy intimacy which i had so wantonly destroyed through my jealousy was such a blessing that had it been possible i would have continued on to carlisle simply to preserve and lengthen our time together the conversation of perfect amity and the feel of her arms around my waist despite the freezing chill in the air i felt no cold at all and might have been in the most commodious parlor not on a muddy wet road near midnight i suppose the tumultuous events of that evening and night had fuddled my mind and so shocked me out of my normal caution that i did not set her down on the outskirts of town so that we were not seen together in such a fashion rather i kept her with me all the way back to my cousins tavern and even then could not let her go how is your mother she is in comfort you can do nothing for her she shook her head it is the only thing i have ever wished for myself and i cannot have it youd best go and tend her then she is in no need of me a friend who knows me well offered to spend time with her and only leave when she was sure she was asleep so i could attend that meeting she will die soon but not yet so stay with me still we walked back to merton street and went into my house mounting the stairs quietly so that my mother would not hear and then in my room we loved each other with a passion and ferocity i have never before nor since felt for any living person nor has anyone shown such love to me i had never before spent a night with a woman had someone lying by my side in the quietness of the dark hearing her breath and feeling her warmth beside me it is a sin and it is a crime i say it frankly for i have been taught so all my life and only madmen have ever said otherwise the bible says it the fathers of the church have said it the prelates now repeat it without end and all the statutes of the land prescribe punishment for what we did that night abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul it must be so for the bible speaks only gods truth i sinned against the law against gods word reported i abused my family and exposed them even more to risk of public shame i again risked permanent exclusion from those rooms and books which were my delight and my whole occupation yet in all the years that have passed since i have regretted only one thingthat it was but a passing moment never repeated for i have never been closer to god nor felt his love and goodness more we were not discovered sarah arose at dawn and slipped softly downstairs to begin her duties in the kitchen and only after the fire was going and the water brought in did she leave to see her mother i did not see her again for two days and did not know that she discovered her mother abandoned by the friend and in need of the assistance which prompted her to apologize to cola and submit to his experiment with transfusion she was sworn to silence and was a woman of her word in all respects for myself i went back to a blissful sleep and awoke late so it was several hours before i walked to an inn for some bread and ale an occasional extravagance i indulge in when i am feeling at ease with the world or wish to avoid my mothers conversation it was only then as i was sitting dreamily over a pot that i heard the news there are countless tales in myth to warn us of our hearts desires king midas wished to be so rich he desired that everything he touched might turn to gold and legend has it that he died of hunger as a result euripides talks of tithonus whom eos loved so well she begged zeus to give him eternal life but mistakenly she asked not for youth as well and he suffered an eternity of decrepitude until even the cruel gods took pity on him and i wished to be spared the scandal which grove in his malice threatened to visit on me the memory of him cut into my mood and i prayed that his mouth might be stopped forever and that i should not suffer for what i had done and said however deserving i was of punishment i had scarcely finished my ale when i heard that my wish had been granted the moment i heard the news my blood ran cold with horror for i was absolutely certain that my own prayers and private vengeance had been responsible i had killed a man i believe there is no crime greater and i was tormented with remorse at my deed so much so that i felt as though i should instantly confess cowardice soon overcame this urge as i thought of the shame of my family should i do so and i convinced myself that i was not really to blame i had made a mistake that was all the intent was lacking my guilt was limited and my chances of discovery small so speaks the mind but the conscience is not so easily quelled i recovered from the shock as best i could seeking out all the information available in the attempt to discover some small detail to convince me that i had not in fact caused this awful event i persuaded myself for a brief while that all was well then tried to return to my labors and found all my concentration gone as my rebellious soul confronted me with what i had done and still i could not take any step to relieve myself my contentment vanished my sleep soon after and in the days and weeks that followed i grew haggard and sickly in my struggle i aim for sympathy but do not deserve any for it was easy to remedy and cleanse myself of disquiet i merely had to stand and say i did this all else would be taken care of but to die myself and make my family live under the obloquy of having engendered a murderer to have my mother hooted through the street and spat on my sister living out her old age in spinsterhood as no man would attach himself to her my cousins trade dry up into failure because no one would drink in his tavern these were real concerns oxford is not london where all sin is forgotten within a week where criminals are celebrated for their deeds and thieves rewarded for their endeavors here all know the business of all and the desire to maintain good morals is acute however great secretive breaches might be my greatest loyalty is and always has been to my family i have lived to bring what little luster is in my power to my name and maintain our position of respectability i would have accepted that the courts might punish me for i could not deny that it would be deserved but i recoiled in horror at doing such great injury to my people they struggled as it was due to our losses in the troubles and i would not add to their burden i nursed my guilt to myself for the next few days and kept to my room in miserable solitude refusing food and conversation even with sarah whom i dared not look in the face i had told her i had been to see grove but dared not tell her what i had done as i could not abide her disgust nor could i burden her with information she would be obliged to share i spent much of my time in prayer and even more staring blankly at empty pieces of paper on my desk as i failed to get my mind to concentrate on even the dullest and most mechanical of tasks and in those few days i missed much of importance in my tale for it was in those days that lower discovered the bottle of brandy and took it to stahl dissected dr grove to see if the corpse accused cola through bleeding and performed the experiment of transfusion on anne blundy it was also in these days it seemed that the finger of suspicion first began to point at sarah but i swear i was totally unaware of this i was aware only of lowers growing discomfort with the italian and his fear that cola was out to steal his glory myown opinion of the dispute between the two is a complicated one yet i think it will serve both i think tell the truth even though their conclusions be opposite nor do i think that this is necessarily a contradiction i do accept of course that there is one truth but except on rare occasions we are not given to know it horace says nec scire fas est omnia it is not gods will we should know all a sentence taken i believe from euripides to know all is to see all and omniscience is gods alone i state the obvious i suppose for if god exists so does truth and if there was no god a thing not to be imagined in seriousness but as a philosophic jest alone then would truth disappear from the world and the opinion of one would be no better than that of another i might also reverse the theorem and say that if men come to think all is merely opinion then they must come to atheism as well what is truth said jesting pilate and would not stay for an answer i do believe that the fact we know in our hearts there is truth without having to reason about it is the prettiest proof of gods existence there can be and as long as we strive to discover it so we also strive to know god but with lower and cola we have no assistance from the divine and must reason it out as best we can cola has put his account on paper for all to see lower told me and many others his version although he disdained to enter the lists by publishing any sort of justification for his claims he had published his account in the transactions he told me because he was assured by dr wallis that cola had drowned in an accident when leaving the country and even had he been assured of the mans health he would have done so in his recollection colas notions were only of the vaguest sort he spoke of rejuvenating blood by some magical means but said not a word about transfusion it was only when lower described his own experimentation with injections that cola hit on the idea of transferring new blood and accomplishing the desired aim in that fashion lower had had this possibility in the back of his mind for months by then and it was only a matter of time before it took place he points out that even by colas own account it was he who performed most of the technical labors consequently the credit should be his when i received this account and compared both versions i was frankly astonished that the dispute could arise at all for it seems to me that it was the meeting of the two men which produced the result and that both were responsible in equal part for the idea when i wrote this to lower he ridiculed the idea with some asperity and made it clear that he put it as kindly as he could but his irritation showed through only an historian who has no ideas could imagine such an absurdity he repeated this assertion a week or so ago when he made one of his now very rare visits to oxford and called on me to pay his respects the transfusion of blood he said was a discovery did i agree i did and the essence of an invention or discovery lay in the idea not in the execution agreed and it was whole and entire not consisting of parts an idea was like one of mr boyles corpuscles or lucretiuss atoms and could not be reduced further it is the essence of the conception that it is entire and perfect in itself it was an aristotelian concept that sounded strange on his lips but i agreed one cannot have half an idea if it cannot be divided then obviously not therefore they all must have a single point of origin as you cannot have one thing in two places at the same time i agreed therefore it was reasonable to assume that it could arise in the mind of only one man i agreed again and he nodded with satisfaction convinced he had disproved my attempt to restore amiable agreement between the two men his logic was impeccable but i must say i still do not accept it although i am incapable of saying why nonetheless he proceeded to his next theorem that if one of the pair had conceived the idea of transfusion first then the other must be lying when he claims its authorship given his starting point i agreed this was again an inevitable conclusion and lower rested content with the notion that in a choice between himself and cola then he had the higher claim for who would take the word of an italian dilettante above that of an english gentleman not that it was unknown for the latter to lie or miscomprehend the truth but because the chances of it were very much smaller this is well known and accepted i did not enquire whether it was equally accepted in italy although i scarcely ventured out during those days on the few occasions i left either my house or the library i encountered the italian the first time our meeting was deliberate for i sought him out in mother jeans cookhouse the day i heard of groves death the second time it was by accident after the play on the first occasion in particular the conversation threw my mind into the utmost confusion he has recounted this talk between us in his memoir and it was clear at the time that he believed he had deceived me i found him to be sober and courteous with an intelligent air and of moderate conversation he was clearly gifted in tongues for although the conversation tended to be in latin it seemed to me that he missed very little when we lapsed into english despite his skill however he gave himself away badly to anyone with the sense to listen for what doctor or soldier for that matter could talk so knowledgeably about heresies long dead could refer so learnedly to the works of hippolytus and tertullian or had even heard of elchesai zosimus or montanus papists i grant are more interested in such obscurities than protestants who have learned to read the bible for themselves and thus need less knowledge of the opinions of others but few even of the most devoted romanists would have such matter readily to hand for use in dispute cola did not act like a physician when he searched the blundys cottage now he did not talk like one either i found my curiosity about him getting ever greater even so this was a minor matter in comparison to the substance of the conversation and the direction he gave me so unknowingly i have often thought about this phenomenon which occurs so frequently in the lives of all men that we almost fail to notice it anymore how often have i had a question on my mind and picked a book at random off the shelf often one i have never heard of before yet found the answer i seek within its covers it is well known that men feel impelled to go to that place where they are to encounter for the first time that woman who is to be their wife similarly even peasants know that letting the bible fall open where it will and putting a finger randomly on the page thus revealed will more often than not give the most sound advice that any man could wish to hear the thoughtless call this coincidence and i note amongst philosophers a growing tendency to talk of chance and probability as though this was some explanation rather than a scholarly disguise for their own ignorance simpler people know exactly what it is for nothing can happen by chance when god sees and knows all even to suggest anything different is absurd these coincidences are the visible signs of his manifest providence from which we can learn well if we will only see his hand and contemplate the meaning of his actions so it was that i was driven against my will to sarahs house that night cola searched it came across her on the abingdon road and followed her and so it was also in my conversation with cola all those things which the scoffers call chance and accident and coincidence show the direction god takes in mens affairs cola could have taken any example at all to illustrate his point any one of which would have done as well or better than a tale of a longextinct and forgotten heresy so through what inspiration did he mention that most obscure branch of the montanist heresy what angel whispered in his ear and directed his mind so that by the time i left the cookhouse my limbs were trembling and my body sweating in each generation the messiah would be reborn would be betrayed would die and be resurrected until mankind turns away from evil and sins no more these were his words and they frightened me greatly for sarah had said precisely the same only the night previously for the next few days it was my greatest obsession and all thought of dr grove passed from my mind i read what little i had at home first of all then went to new college to ransack the small library of thomas ken and scarcely noticed that poor tortured mans look of grief and anxiety i wish i had for had i attended more he might have spoken and sarah perhaps would have been spared but i ignored his misery and later it was not possible to make him shifthe had gone to grove to beg his forgiveness for the calumny he had spread but found only that he was trapped in his falsehood as he discovered prestcott but did nothing to alert the magistrate or the watch he could not retract his lie about seeing sarah going into groves room without risking also being forced to confess that he aided a felon in his escape between facing the wrath of god after death or the vengeance of dr wallis in this life he preferred the former and has paid dearly for it ever since for he stood by while an innocent was hanged that he might enjoy eighty pounds a year i cannot condemn too harshly my own sin was scarcely the less for when i did speak it was too late he lent me such books as i wanted and when i had done with them i went to the bodleian where i searched for the tale that cola had told me fragments in tertullian and in hippolytus were all as he said i found references in eusebius and irenaeus and epiphanius as well and the more i read the more my reason revolted against what i saw for how was it possible that sarah unlettered as she was could have quoted almost word for word a whole series of prophecies made more than a thousand years ago there was no doubt about it time and again the words were the same almost as though it was the same person talking this longdead woman prophesying on a hilltop in asia minor and the girl who talked so strangely in abingdon of her death it was an effort but i put it all aside it was a mad time and the air was still filled with lunacies of all sorts even after two decades which had all but exhausted mens appetites for enthusiasm in religion i told myself that she was deluded caught up in the corruption of the age and that in due course when she was less concerned with her mother and her own future then she would cast off these foolish notions and endanger herself no more it is often the case that men succeed in persuading themselves through the exercise of reason that what they know to be true is not so merely because they cannot understand it to recover from this melancholy i forced myself back into society and in particular agreed willingly to lowers suggestion that i accompany him and cola to the play i had not seen one for near four years and much as i love my town i admit it has few diversions to occupy a brooding mind when it needs distraction i had a splendid day i recall for despite mr colas criticisms i found the story of lear and his daughters both entertaining and moving as well as most excellently acted and i also enjoyed passing the rest of the evening in good company and again had my interest in the italian aroused i spent a considerable time talking to him and used the opportunity to probe him as much as i dared whatever there was to be discovered however remained elusive to my intelligence cola parried my questions about himself with ease and forever returned to matters in which his own beliefs and opinions played no part indeed he seemed more than aware of my curiosity and amused himself in avoiding any answer of substance i could not of course ask him directly about my interests much as i would have liked to know why he had searched sarah blundys cottage it was impossible to put the question in any fashion which would have produced a useful reply but by the time he left he was aware of my suspicions about him and he looked at me more warily and with greater respect than before once he and lower had gone locke and i spent another hour in agreeable conversation before we too left the inn and retired i wished my mother good night and passed some time in my daily reading of the bible and was on the verge of retiring for my night when a hammering on the door brought me back down the stairs to open up the door i had just laboriously closed up it was lower apologizing greatly for the disturbance but asking for a moment of my time i am at a complete loss he said when i had ushered him into my room and asked him to keep his voice down my mother detested any sort of disturbance in the evening and i would have had to endure many illhumored days thereafter if lowers conversation or boots had awoken her what did you think of cola he asked abruptly i gave a noncommittal reply as it was clear to me that it mattered not at all what i thought of him why do you ask because i keep on hearing shocking tales about him he said i was summoned by dr wallis as you know not only is this cola a man who habitually steals the ideas of other people but wallis now seems to believe he may have had some involvement in the death of dr grove did you know that i anatomized the man the point was to see whether his body accused cola and did it my heart was beating faster as this subject was raised my worst nightmares were coming true before my eyes and i had no idea how i should best react until that moment i had no idea that groves death was under investigation and had not only persuaded myself that i was safe but had even reached some conviction in my mind that his death was in no way connected with myself no of course not or maybe it did by the time id cut him open it was impossible to say whether he was bleeding in accusation or not either way the test produced nothing why does wallis think this i have no idea he is a close man and never says anything unless he has to but his warnings have alarmed me and now it seems i have to take cola off on tour with me i shall lie awake every night convinced he will slip a stiletto into me i wouldnt concern myself too much i said he seemed a perfectly ordinary man to me for a foreigner and i know from experience that dr wallis gets a strange pleasure in appearing to know more than other people often it is not the case but merely a device to encourage confidences lower grunted still there is something odd about the man now it has been pointed out to me i can feel it i mean what is he doing here hes meant to be sorting out his family affairs but he should be in london for that and i know that he has done nothing whatsoever about them instead he has attached himself to boyle and is remarkably obsequious to him and is taking on patients in the town only one surely i pointed out and that scarcely counts but what if he decides to stay a fashionable doctor from the continent bad news for me and he is remarkably keen to hear all about my patients i do believe that he may be thinking about trying to steal them from me lower i said sternly for a wise man you are the biggest fool i know sometimes why would a man of means the son of a wealthy italian merchant want to set up in oxford to take your patients be reasonable man with great reluctance he conceded the point and as for having anything to do with the death of dr grove then i must say i think that total fantasy why on earth would he or anybody else want to do such a thing do you know what i think what i think grove killed himself lower shook his head that is not the point the point is that i am to spend the next seven days in the company of a man whom i increasingly distrust what am i to do about it cancel the trip i need the money go on your own it would be the height of discourtesy to withdraw an invitation once given suffer in silence condemn not on the word of others and try to establish for yourself what he is meanwhile i said as you are here and know him better than anyone i must ask your advice on something i do so reluctantly as i am loath to excite your suspicion still further but it is a curiosity which i cannot explain go ahead so in as unsensational a way as i could manage i told of my visit to the blundy cottage and how i had seen cola come in establish the woman was asleep then search the entire premises i decided to leave out what happened thereafter why dont you ask sarah blundy if anything is missing he is her physician i do not want to undermine that trust nor to have him refuse again to treat her mother what do you think i think i will sleep on my money bag when we are in the same bed he said it seems odd that you spend considerable effort trying to assuage my suspicions then reignite them again at the last i apologize his behavior was strange but i hardly think your own fears have much substance the conversation reawoke my own concerns and i must note at no point did lower mention that the magistrate had already begun investigating sarah as a possible culprit had he done so then i would have behaved differently rather my thoughts as lower left me to peaceful solitude once more turned more to colas strange behavior and i decided to reach the bottom of the matter before i did so however i decided it would be best to question sarah on the matter physician or no from that shelf she said when i had recounted the incident there is nothing of value there only some books which belonged to my father she examined the books carefully there is one missing she said but i never read it as it was in latin your father read latin i asked in some surprise he was a man of parts that i knew but i had not realized his selflearning had proceeded that far no she said he thought it a dead language and of no use to anyone but fools and antiquarians begging your pardon she added with a faint smile he wanted to create a new world not revive an old besides he once told me he did not think we had anything to learn from pagan slavemasters i let my disapproval pass without comment so where did all these books come from she shrugged i only ever thought of them when i considered selling them i asked a bookseller but he offered me very little i was going to give them to you as a gift for your kindness if you would accept them you know me better than to think i would easily turn down a gift of books i said but i would refuse you are in no position to be so free with your possessions i would insist on paying you and i would refuse the offer so we could fight a good long while over it and there are more pressing things to accomplish not the least of which is that you cannot give and i cannot buy what may be in the possession of mr cola i think i should see if i can get it back first of all to start with i walked all the way down to christ church and made sure that lower and cola had indeed set off that morning on their tour then i walked over to mrs bulstrode colas landlady in st giles i had known this lady since i was at least five years old i had played before i exhausted puerile occupations with her son who was about my age and is now a corn merchant in witney on many occasions she had given me an apple from her garden or a lick of delicious honey from the hives she kept on a minuscule plot of land she with great pomp was always pleased to call her country estate for she was a woman of pretension despite the dourness of her religion and liked to play the lady of quality those who knew her enough to see the fraud ridiculed her without mercy those who knew her better saw the generosity within and forgave a failing which though grave never once stopped her from an act of charity nor a word of kindness i was welcomed into the kitcheni was old enough an acquaintance to knock on the kitchen doorand greeted with great warmth half an hours conversation was required before i could bring myself and her round to the matter at hand i explained that i was a close acquaintance of mr colas i am glad to hear it anthony she said gravely if he is a friend of yours then he cannot be so bad to know why do you say that has he misbehaved not exactly she conceded in fact in all respects he is a man of great politeness but he is a papist and i have never had such a person in the house before nor do i want one again although i do believe we may yet win him over do you know he prayed with us the other night and went to church with mr lower last sunday and said he found the experience very uplifting i am gratified to hear it and for my part i can confirm that he is a man of kindness since he is treating the mother of our servant at moderate cost i think you can sleep easy in your beds at night however what i wish to ask you is thiscould i go to his room for he borrowed something from me which i need badly in my work and i hear he has gone off for a week it was no sooner asked than agreed and as i knew where the room was i was left in peace to mount the two pair of stairs to the little attic which cola rented out inside all was as spick and span as i would have expected from a room under the tutelage of mrs bulstrode who regarded dust as the devils seed and never ceased her campaigns of exorcism colas belongings were few and for the most part contained in a great traveling trunk and that trunk unfortunately was securely locked having come so far i was determined not to go away emptyhanded and i examined that great traveling lock with the most particular attention in the hope that it would suddenly spring open before my eyes but it was designed not only to ward off the attentions of thieves but also of the likes of mrs bulstrode who was certain to have examined it if an easy opportunity presented itself for her curiosity about the unknown was as great as that of the most diligent experimentalist violence or the key were the only options and i could employ neither my long hard glaring at the chest made little impact in persuading it to open up to me and eventually i accepted that no amount of wishing would make the slightest difference with the greatest reluctance and no small amount of resentment i rose from my haunches and made to leave but first out of simple irritation i gave the chest a powerful kick to demonstrate that i was not best pleased and the lock sprang open with a heavy thud the clasp being very ingeniously springloaded a device i had never seen before i was astonished at this and at a loss to explain how it might be that a man could be so rash as to leave all his possessions unprotected in such a fashionunaware until i read the manuscript that the heavy fall endured on the journey from london had broken the lock in such a way that it could no longer be relied upon gifts from god should never be spurned it had pleased him to grant my wishes and i was sure that it was for a good reason with a prayer of thanks on my lips i knelt down in front of the chest as though it were an altar and began to search in as methodical a fashion as cola himself had used to search the house of sarah blundy i will not list his possessions comment on the quality of the clothing or the bags of money which gave the lie to his stories of poverty for he had in his possession at least one hundred pounds in gold far from being reduced to having to take patients to survive he had enough to live as a gentleman for well over a year no i will merely mention that i swiftly discovered three books wrapped up in a chemise near the bottom of the chest as though they were the most precious objects on earth and accompanied by a sheet of paper which gave the name of a tavern in cheapside called the bells and several other scribbles which seemed also to be addresses the first book was particularly gorgeous tooled in gold with a fine metal clasp intricately carved and chased it was my passion as a bibliographer which made me pause and examine it for it was the finest venetian work and such splendid workmanship is only rarely seen in this country i had a pang of the greatest envy when i saw it and i swear that had i been only a fraction less honest i would have taken it as well it is a fine thing no doubt that so many books are now printed and that their cost steadily falls even for the best scholarship i count myself lucky that i live in this country where books can be had at moderate expense though still more than the netherlands had i a longing for travel i would go there for i could buy many books and have the cost of the travel in the money saved but sometimes it is borne in on me that there are disadvantages to this happy situation of course it is the learning which is important of course the quality of scholarship must come first and it is better that wisdom should reach the most people possible for sine doctrina vita est quasi mortis imago says dionysius cato without learning life is but the image of death and of course were it other i could afford many fewer books but sometimes i regret the days when people valued books properly and spent lavishly on them occasionally in the bodleian when my concentration deserts me and my spirits flag i order up one of those wonderful codexes that have found their way into the library or i go into a college and look through a book of hours marveling at the love and skill which went into the creation of such glorious works i imagine the men who made them the scribes and the paper makers and the illustrators and the binders and contrast them with the poor sad works i have on my own shelves it is like the difference between a quaker meeting house and a catholic church one is devoted to the word and nothing but it has its virtue i suppose but god is more than mere word although he was that in the beginning the speech of man alone is all but dumb in the task of expressing his glory and the meanness of the protestant constructions is an insult to his name we now live in an age where the houses of politicians are grander than the houses of god what does that say about our corruption so i sat awhile and feasted my eyes on this little book of colas and traced my finger over the complexities of the binding a roomno merely a shelfof books like these would give me the greatest possible joy although i knew i might as well aim to become chancellor of england as hope to possess such a wonder it was a psalter and a fine example and i flipped open the little clasp and opened it up to see whether the printing matched the binding for i knew well that venetian work was the finest to be had and received a tremendous shock for inside the book had been hollowed out into two carefully cut cavities initially my distress was for the book as to butcher such a wonderful object was the nearest thing to sacrilege i could imagine then i concentrated on the three little bottles that nestled so carefully in the hollows each sealed by wax at the top one contained a dark thick liquid like oil one a clear fluid which might as well have been water the third however was the most interesting for it was the most elaborate bottle of all covered in gold and jewels and worth in my inexperienced estimation many dozens of pounds this contained nothing except a thick illshaped lump of old wood what it meant was obvious even to a dolt like myself so i placed the book aside and consumed by curiosity for the first examined the others with only a casual eye until i realized what they were it was several minutes as i flicked through and considered before it dawned on me that here was something of great and strange significance for both volumes were the same one from sarahs house and the other i assumed cola had already each was a volume from livys history in the same edition as the one which dr wallis had so urgently entreated me to find for him many months previously sarah blundy was arrested the next day i now know at the instigation of john wallis and the news rippled through town and university like a tidal wave running up a creek in high wind everybody knew that she was guilty and applauded the magistrate for his decisiveness as much as they criticized him for the delay in reaching a conclusion that had in retrospect been obvious to every single citizen since the moment they heard of dr groves death only two people i think dissented from this opinionmyself who knew the truth and my mother whose belief was the more virtuous for being founded on nothing at all but as she said she knew the girl and she would not accept that anyone in her household could act in such a fashion had she known the truth i say it would have killed her she was a strange woman that blessed mother of mine as good a mother as any man had for she was strict and punctilious in all matters jealous of her rights and watchful of the obligations of others no woman or man was swifter to condemn sin or pass comment on a moral failing no woman was so careful in her devotions praying not less than ten minutes in the morning when she rose and more than fifteen every night before she retired she attended the best church and listened with care to sermons which she often did not understand but which she found uplifting nonetheless and she was charitable with the greatest caution so that neither too much nor too little was given from her pocket to the deserving careful with money she undoubtedly was and jealous of her reputation but not so much that either substituted for her duty to god and so confident was she of her knowledge of gods mind that when public opinion and her own differed in point of detail she had no doubts whatsoever that she knew best when she heard of sarahs arrest she waited not a moment before announcing to all in our great kitchen that a serious injustice had been committed sarah for whom she now had a proprietorial affection was without blame in the matter she said she had not laid a finger on that fat prelate and if she had it was undoubtedly well deserved not content with mere words either she straightaway packed a hamper with food and her own homemade ale walked boldly off to mrs blundys cottage to fetch warm clothes took my best blanket in fact my only blanket from my bed and marched in full public gaze to the prison where she did her best to give comfort to the poor girl and ensure that she was as guarded as clothes and provisions and stern words to the jailer could make her against jail fever she has asked to see you she said to me gravely on her return she was in no good humor as she had been jeered at by several low folk who habitually hang around outside the jail in the runup to the assizes taking perverted pleasure at seeing the prisoners arriving in chains why such people have nothing better to do i do not know but i am sure that any wellrun town would send them away or punish them harshly for their idleness and you must go directly my heart sank at this and i felt like a bull on a rope being dragged into the butchers yard for slaughter with all its efforts to escape the inevitable coming to naught before i heard of the arrest i had convinced myself that the worst danger was over if no one was ever blamed for the death of grove then it would be foolish to volunteer my own neck the moment i heard about sarah i heard also the rustle of the rope and my bowels tightened as i saw the inevitable looming up in front of me of course i had to go to the girl i even managed to make myself angry at her as though it was her fault she had fallen quite unfairly into suspicion but as i walked up the stone steps to the jail i knew as well that this was merely distress at my situation and the trap i was now firmly in sooner or later i would have to own my deeds for if i had committed a crime in killing grove i would not have any other souls weighed in the balance against me as well sarah was surprisingly cheerful when i saw her the womens cell had not yet filled with the congregation of crones who would soon be brought in from all over the county to await the judges pleasure and she had only been there a few hours the dark and the damp had not yet begun their deadly work on her spirits stop looking like that she said when she saw my sorrowful countenance looming up at her out of the dark im the one in jail not you if i can be cheerful you can manage to look a little more lighthearted how can you be so in such a place because my conscience is clear and i believe the lord will look after me she said i have done my best for him in my life and refuse to accept he will forsake me now and if he does then it will be for a good reason sometimes i confess such humility tired me excessively but i had come to give courage and finding it already present i could hardly settle down to convince her that her optimism was misplaced you think me foolish she said you are wrong for i know that i had nothing to do with this business indeed and god knows it too as i do whether the courts will be in his confidence is another matter what can they say courts have to produce evidence do they not and you know as well as i where i was that night and if necessary you must say so i told her but she shook her head no that would replace one scandal with another and i will not believe me anthony it will not be necessary then i will no she said firmly i suppose you think you are being kind but you will not be the one to suffer the law on this would hardly touch you but i would have to leave and i cannot with my mother in such a condition nor could i expose those people in abingdon and elsewhere to sanction believe me anthony there is no danger no one could possibly think i would or could behave in such a way i did my best to persuade her she was wrong that not only could the town think it it was already convinced but she would have none of it and eventually told me either to talk of something else or to leave her in peace an imperious command which was strange in her circumstances but quite like her you will say nothing of this to anyone she said it is my wish and my command you will say what i permit you to say and no more you will not interfere in this matter do you understand me i looked at her strangely for serving girl though she was she looked and spoke like one born to commandno sovereign could have given orders with as much resolution or with as much confidence of being obeyed very well then i said reluctantly after a long pause in which she waited for the assent she knew i must give tell me about this cola what is there to say you have not seen with your own eyes it may be important i replied and what i saw confuses me slightly i saw him approach you then recoil it was not your doing that made him pull back it was more as though he had horrified himself is that true she admitted it and you would have let him have his way had he not removed himself you had already told me i had nothing to lose and i suppose that is the case if he insisted on payment there was little i could do to prevent him taking it nor would any protests before or after have helped me i have learned this with others she touched my arm as she saw my face fall i do not mean you and yet he pulled away why i suppose he found me disgusting no i said that is not possible she smiled thank you for that i mean it does not fit with what i saw maybe he had a conscience in which case he joins you as the only two men in my acquaintance so equipped i bowed my head at those words conscience i had indeed scarcely a minute went by that i was not aware of it these days listening to its warnings and acting upon them however were different here i was the author of this girls misfortunes able with one word to bring them to an end and what was i doing i was giving her comfort and acting the part of the sympathetic helper i was so generous and so helpful that it entirely covered my turpitude so no one suspected the depths of a guilt which daily grew ever deeper and more monstrous and still i lacked the courage to do as i should it was not for lack of desiremany times i imagined myself going to the magistrate and telling him what had happened and exchanging my life for hers many times i saw myself standing as the stoic making my sacrifice with unflinching honesty and bravado i have recovered the object he stole i said and i am mightily puzzled by it it is a book by livy where did it come from i believe it was with the bundle my father left just before he died in that case i would like to open that package i have never touched it because you asked me not to but now i think we must it may contain the answer she gave her permission with some initial reluctance then i made to leave but before i did i once again implored her to let me speak hoping that there might be a way for her to escape without my having to confess but she would not allow it and i was bound to her wishes in the circumstances i could hardly hope to escape by inflicting more hardship on her i must talk about this book i think for i have forgotten to mention my examination of it to look at there was nothing especially worthy of note it was an octavo bound in only inferior calfskin with tooling done by a man of skill but who was no master in his trade there were no markings to give its ownership and i was sure it had not come from a scholars library for i knew of none who did not mark meticulously his ownership and the place on the shelves where it might be found nor were there any of the marginalia i might expect to have found in a book that had been wellread and studied it was battered and bashed but my practiced eye told me that this was more due to the illtreatment of movement and abuse rather than excessive reading the spine was in perfect condition and was the most undamaged part of the whole inside the text was untouched except for some small ink markings which underlay certain letters on the first page a b was so marked on the first line an f on the second and so on each line had one letter marked and knowing that wallis was interested in puzzles i thought perhaps they made up some acrostic so i wrote them all down and came up with the merest jumble which had no sense in it at all i spent a good halfday on these fruitless pursuits before admitting defeat placing the volume on my shelves behind some other books so that it would not be noticed should anyone come alooking then i turned my attention to the packet still secured with unbroken seals even now it is strange to consider that such a small object could unleash such fury in the world that so many people could contemplate such cruelty to gain possession of it that i could have had about me such a powerful weapon all unknowing for so long a time nor did i even realize this until i opened it half a days careful consideration opened up all the secret history of this realm to my eyes but it was not until i read walliss account that i understood fully how these matters fully affected the tragedy unfolding before me and grasped the extent to which the mathematician was deceived by john thurloe still perhaps the most powerful person in the kingdom despite his lack of position what he told wallis was to some extent truehis account of how sir james prestcott and ned blundy both fanatics though for different causes formed an alliance was confirmed in every particular for half of the documents or more consisted of letters between thurloe and clarendon cromwell and the king in which their mutual courtesy was as striking as their knowledge of each others characters and aspirations one letter in particular would have caused uproar had it been publicly known for it expressly said that the king had instructed mordaunt to pass on details of the rising of and an accompanying piece of paper listed some three dozen names many locations of arms and details of gathering places even i knew that many of those named were subsequently killed another was an outline of an agreement between charles and thurloe sketching out conditions for a restoration of the monarchy saying who was to be favored what limits were to be placed on royal power and outlining details of laws to control catholics it is clear that had sir james prestcott recovered these and made them known at the time the royal cause would have been utterly blasted and the career of john thurloe as well for both sides would have rejected absolutely those people willing to abandon principles established at the cost of so much blood this was however the lesser part of the bundle and although it would have been of considerable danger in i doubt it would have shaken the throne in no the more dangerous documents came in a separate package and those were undoubtedly provided by sir james prestcott himself for just as saltpeter and niter can cause little harm when separate but can bring down the strongest castle when conjoined to make gunpowder so these two groups of papers drew extra power from their association for sir james prestcott was a catholic and a member of that papist conspiracy to bring england back into the thrall of rome of course he was why else would his son attract the support of the papist earl of bristol what else explains the horrified silence of his family the refusal to talk of the unspecified injuries he had done them which jack prestcott notes but treats as another example of their callousness his wifes family was most fervently of the protestant persuasion and to have one of their number embrace rome was to them quite unforgivable why else would they refuse to help sir james in his trouble against all instincts of obligation why else pack young jack off to the compton family where he could be placed under the tutelage of the resolutely anglican robert grove it is in the nature of papists to entrap their own family to wheedle their way into their minds and corrupt them could there be any hope that a youth as easily led as jack prestcott would withstand his adored fathers blandishments no whatever else happened it was essential for his safety and the familys standing that he be kept safe and that having given up his estates sir james should not recover them in my opinion the family stands acquitted of greed and mendacity although i leave it to others to disagree with my verdict sir jamess conversion came i believe during his first exile a period in which many royalists weakened by misfortune and adversity embraced popery with a most despairing anguish he entered the service of the venetians at the siege of candia and in his time abroad came greatly into contact with many people of substantial influence in the roman church eager to spy out any advantage for themselves in englands misfortunes one such was the priest with whom he corresponded in these letters i will explain this later at the moment will merely point out the shock that must have been felt by any catholic who had given near twenty years of his life in fighting for the throne to discover that the king was prepared to agree to the most ferocious measures of persecution against him and his kind the news he had that the king was preparing to reach a deal with richard cromwell and thurloe pushed him into action and also pushed him from loyalty into his final treachery for pestcottr knew that at the same time charles that most duplicitous of men was also negotiating with the french the spanish and with the pope himself soliciting their support and money in return for a promise to ensure complete toleration of catholics when he was reestablished he promised all things to all men and reneged on all his agreements when he was on the throne once more even his advisers did not know the full extent of his duplicity i think for clarendon knew nothing of the discussions with the spanish while mr bennet was kept in ignorance of the talks with thurloe sir james prestcott alone knew it all because ned blundy told him of one side and his correspondent a priest deeply involved in these discussions told him of the other that priest was called andrea da cola whom prestcott must have met while in the service of venice it grieved me greatly later on but even now i do not see how i could have pieced together events in such a way that i might have prevented sarahs death had i known that wallis and thurloe were looking for those documents and would have given me anything i wanted for them had i realized they were even involved at all in the machinations which put her on trial had i understood the full significance of colas presence in this country i could have gone and said stop this trial immediately set the girl free they would have obeyed me and granted my every wish i think but i did not know this and did not realize it until i read the words of wallis and prestcott and understood for the first time that sarahs trial was no mere miscarriage of justice but had instead an overarching inevitability to it that could not be avoided many people have over the years talked greatly of the rewards and punishments god metes out to his servants to show his approval or disfavor a battle lost one wonboth are signs from god a loss of fortune when a ship sinks in heavy seas a sudden illness or a chance meeting with an old acquaintance who brings news these too occasion prayers of lamentation or thanks perhaps it is so but how much more is it when countless deeds and decisions secretly taken and only half known slowly accumulate over the years to produce the death of an innocent in such a way for had king charles not been duplicitous had prestcott not been a fanatic had thurloe not been concerned for his own safety had wallis not been vain and cruel had bristol not been ambitious had bennet not been cynical had government in sum not been government and politicians not what they are then sarah blundy would not have been led to the scaffold and the sacrifice would not have been made and what can we say of such a victim whose death is the culmination of so much sin but is accomplished so quietly that its true nature is never known as i say i did not know this and at that moment sitting in my room surrounded by these bits of old paper i upbraided myself instead for my cowardice for taking refuge in a matter which then seemed of no importance to me at allfor i did not care at that moment whether king charles of england kept his throne or not nor did i care about his policies or whether catholics were persecuted or given complete toleration all i cared about was sarah in jail and the fact that i was running out of excuses and would soon have to confess to prepare myself and work up my courage i decided to talk to anne blundy for i was sure she could give me the strength i needed cola mentioned that she had been placed in the care of john locke during his absence and this man performed his duties with the utmost punctiliousness although with little enthusiasm frankly he said it is a waste of my time although no doubt good for my soul to act in a way which will bring no reward to either of us she is dying wood and nothing will change that i perform my tasks because i promised lower i would do so but whether i give her herbals or metals practice new or old medicine on her bleed her or purge her it will make no difference at all this he said in a low voice in the street outside the cottage where i met him he had just been in to pay his daily visit which as he said was more for form than anything else my mother came down every day with food as sarah had insisted that this be done rather than the food coming to her in prison and the old lady did not want for a blanket or sticks in the fire more than that could not be done the stink of corruption inside was severe and caught in my throat as i went in all the doors and windows were fast shut to keep out the bad winds which was necessary but had the unfortunate consequence of allowing none of the foul air to escape from the chamber and the old lady who had always been perverse in having the shutters and doors wide open except in the most icy weather complained bitterly of this locke had closed everything up the moment he arrived and her inability to move from her bed made it impossible for her to open them again she begged me to oblige her and although reluctant to do so i eventually agreed on condition she permitted me to close them all again when i left i did not want a fight with locke about countering good medical practice on a whim whatever the reasoning i must say that i also was greatly relieved when the winds began to sweep the foulness out of the room and natural light replaced the darkness anne blundy also seemed to benefit from the sweetness of the cold air she breathed deeply and sighed as though a great torture had come to an end i had not been able to see her in the gloom and was shocked when i had opened the shutters and turned round to look properly at her the wasting of her face and the deathly pallor were the most noticeable of course and i saw her for the first time without a covering to her head so that the thinness and wispiness of her hair was most obvious she looked twice the age of a few months previously and my sadness bore in on me so much that my throat tightened and i could not speak you are a strange young man mr wood she said after i had asked her how she was and said all the usual things that one says in these circumstances so kind and so cruel by turns i pity you it was strange to my ears to have this pathetic bag of bones pity me and insulting to be called cruel for i never was so with deliberation why do you say this to me because of what you have done to sarah she said do not look at me like that you know what i mean for several years now you have given her something which has been of the greatest value you have talked to her and listened to what she has to say you have been her companion and as near to friend as man can be to a woman what do you mean by that dont you know that the world has changed and that a girl of her sort must learn to remain silent especially in the company of gentlemen this sounds strange from your mouth i see what is going on around me who cannot when it is so obvious but you are too blind to notice it seems so i thought at least i thought you were a simple scholar who was so enthusiastic about his learning that he would share it with anyone but that is not the case for having taught her that she can be listened to and made it so this becomes the one day in the week she looks forward to you then cast her off and will have nothing to do with her anymore then take her back again what will you think of to hurt her now mr wood i should never have let you into my house i never intended her hurt and as for the rest i think that i have taught her nothing she seems to be the teacher now i think she looked immeasurably sad and reluctantly nodded i am very frightened for her she is so strange now i think she must come to harm when did she start speaking at meetings she looked at me sharply you know of this did she tell you i found out on my own when ned came back that last time and then we heard he was dead we talked time and again about him it was our memorial for him as we could not bury his body we talked of his parents and his life and his battles and campaigns i was griefstricken as i loved him very much he was all the world to me and my greatest comfort but my grief led me into indiscretion and sarah never misses anything i talked about the edgehill campaign when ned commanded a platoon and ended with a whole company of his own and i told how he was away for more than a year and how much i missed him i nodded thinking there must be a point to this for she was not a woman to ramble in speech even when ill sarah looked at me very quietly and gently and asked the simple question she had never asked before so who then is my father she stopped until she was satisfied that my face did not register disgust it was true of course ned was away for a year and sarah was born three weeks before he returned he never questioned or reproached me and always treated sarah as his own the matter was never referred to again but sometimes when i saw them sitting together by the fire with him teaching her to read or telling her stories or just holding her to him i could see a sadness in his eyes and i felt griefstricken for him he was the very best of men mr wood he truly was and what was the answer to the question she shook her head i will not lie and cannot tell the truth i spend my days and nights considering my sins to prepare for my death and i need all the time i have left i have never claimed to be a good woman in any way and there is much to repent but the lord will not reproach me for fornication still not an answer to my question but i hardly wanted to know in any case i take little pleasure in such gossipy matters at the best of times and anne blundy in any case was beginning to drift from me into her memories i had a dream the most wonderful dream of my life that i was surrounded by doves and one dove perched on my arm and spoke to me call her sarah and love her it said and you will be blessed amongst women i found myself shivering strangely as she said this then smiled bravely at her you have done as you were told at least thank you sir i have shortly after i told her this sarah started traveling and talking and healing yes who was that man the one i saw leaving the house a few months back she thought for a moment to decide how much to say his name was greatorex and he calls himself an astrologer what did he want i dont know i was here when he knocked on the door i opened it and he was standing there white as a sheet and trembling with fear i asked him who he was but he was so frightened he could not say anything to me then sarah called from inside that i was to let him in and he came in and he just went down on his knees in front of her and asked her blessing the memory still alarmed the mother and the telling of it alarmed me then what sarah took him by the hand and told him to stand as if she was not at all surprised then led him to the seat by the fire they talked for more than an hour what about sarah asked me to leave them alone so i didnt hear just the beginning this man said he had signs of sarah in the stars and had crossed the sea and traveled here to see her as they had directed him for we have seen the star and are come to worship i said quietly and anne blundy looked sharply at me do not say things like that mr wood she said please do not or you will turn as mad as i am becoming i am well past the stage of madness i said and i am frightened beyond speech i now had only a short time to follow the urgings of my conscience for the trial was due to begin and the preparations for the assize were already under way i drank a certain amount before i could force myself to act and i still recoiled from my task but eventually i succeeded in overcoming my cowardice and walked to holywell to ask for an audience with sir john fulgrove the magistrate though it was his busiest day of the year he granted my request but did so with such brusqueness that i became even more nervous and stammered and shook as i tried to speak well man i dont have all day it is about sarah blundy i said eventually well what of her she is innocent i know it a simple sentence but it cost me an agony to come out with it to step over the cliff and willingly cast myself down into the inevitable perdition that must follow i claim nothing for my courage my honor or my fortitude i know better than most what i am i was not born to be a hero and will never be one of those to whom future ages look for example and instruction other men than myself better men i should say would have said these words earlier and with more dignity of manner than the poor sweating shaking performance that i put on yet we must do as we can i could do no more than this and though it might elicit a sneer from those stronger than myself i say that it was the most courageous act of my life and how do you know it as best i could i repeated my story and said that i had placed the poison in the bottle she was seen in the college he said she was not there how do you know to this i could not reply having given my solemn word that i would not betray her on the matter of her prophesying so i lied instead and in the lie ruined all she was with me where in my room when did she leave she did not she stayed with me all night and your family will say this they did not see her they were in the house i imagine i can ask them you know im sure they were in the house and did not see her enter did not see her climb to your room did not see her leave again no heard nothing all night long no i see and you took this powder to his room for the purpose no he had it there and asked me to add it to his bottle for his stomachache but not half an hour before he had been told it was useless and said he would never use it again he did not mean it everybody who heard him believed he did and was grateful to the italian for the advice he was not that is corroborated by witnesses who were present i cannot help that and can you tell me how dr groves gold signet ring came to be discovered in her hands did you steal from his body and place it there no so how did she come by it i know nothing of this sir john leaned back in his chair and eyed me gravely i do not know what you are trying to accomplish sir it is clear to me that you are lying to protect this creature and it is a serious business to deflect justice from its true path i beg you to think more carefully and stop acting in this foolish fashion but it is true it is all true it is not it cannot be so you cannot explain away the evidence proving her guilt and those facts you cite to demonstrate her innocence are in no way convincing you will not help me what do you want she has been before the grand jury and a case was found if you persist in this nonsense i cannot stop you from rising in court and saying your piece there although if you do so i tell you it will make no difference and the judge may well see fit to punish you as well so i went to dr wallis hoping to persuade him to use his secret influence on the girls behalf not knowing he had already determined on her death and i told my story a second time and for a second time it seemed i was not believed i owe you no favors mr wood he said and can in any case do nothing for you it is for the judge and the jury to decide the girls fate i know you have heard stories of my works for the government but they are exaggerated i can no more stop her trial than i can start it do you at least believe me we were in his room and the interview was a strange onethere was a weariness about the man that i had not noticed before i did not know of course how much this matter was plucking at his conscience and how aware he was of the wrong he was doing he had convinced himself that he was acting nobly and when a man does this to assuage his soul it is a rash person indeed who seeks to persuade him otherwise i do not i believe this tale comes from your selfishness i think you would rather have your pleasure with this girl than see justice served i know more about her than you think and i am convinced that if she hangs then no great injustice will be done she did not do this wallis took a step toward me overwhelming me with his bulk and the sheer power and malice of his personality that whore you like so much mr wood is helping a conspirator a subversive and an atheist she is helping the most dangerous man in the country commit a monstrous crime and that man has already slaughtered my servant i will have my revenge and that man will die if sarah blundys death helps me to my revenge then so be it i care not whether she is innocent or guilty do you understand me now mr wood then you are the greatest of sinners i said my voice shaking in shock at what i heard you are no priest and are not fit to hold the bread in your hands you are not wallis was a big man powerfully built and very much taller than me without any more words he stood up and grabbed me by my collar and began dragging me to the door i tried to protest and say this was no behavior for a priest but when i began to speak he shook me like some dog and pushed me hard against the wall before opening the door onto the street do not meddle sir he said coldly i care nothing for your concerns and have no time for your whining leave me in peace and say no more or you will pay heavily for it then he pushed me out of the door and kicked me hard with his foot so that i tripped down the stone steps into a cold muddy puddle which splashed up all over my clothes as i knelt there with the water seeping into my shoes and breeches i knew i had failed even if i shouted from the rooftops it seemed people would stop their ears and refuse to acknowledge what was so obviously the truth i do not know whether it would have been different had i spoken earlier but it was certainly too late now and the realization made me sink my head into that puddle and weep with anguish as the rain spattered more mud onto me it was as though heaven itself had intervened and made me like some lunatic in the street shouting out to all the world but finding people averting their eyes and pretending not to notice in the deepest rage i beat my fist on the muddy earth and cried in despair at gods cruelty and for my reward and solace heard two passersby laugh with disgust at the raving drunkard they saw on his knees before them the start of sarahs trial began the most anguishing wonderful two days of my life in which i felt with full force both the power of gods punishment and the sweet grace of his forgiveness again cola has described the proceedings and does so with perspicacity i will not repeat his account but rather must add to it for he has quite naturally omitted certain events which he could not know sarah had commanded me not to interfere and i had already done so but could not bring myself to disobey in her presence this will seem weakness on my part but i do not care if it doesi speak the truth and say that no man who knew her as i did would have acted differently i was hoping someone else would speak for her or present evidence of her innocence yet they did not sarah herself said nothing except to admit her guilt so that her body could go to lower and her mother receive treatment and when she uttered that word guilty so quietly and with such resignation my heart broke and i determined that i would try for the third time to persuade people of the truth then i heard the judge say those words does anyone have anything to add for if there is one who will speak for the defendant then he must do so now my lord i said i was going to cry out to the whole room that this poor girl was as innocent as christ himself that she had no hand in groves death and that i was responsible for his end i was going to demonstrate the truth of my assertions with every scrap of evidence and eloquence i had and was confident that while the latter might let me down the former would carry conviction i was going to save her and i hesitated tonguetied in my anguish and my indecision and in that moment the opportunity was lost i know many in the town even in the university hold me in contempt and ridicule me behind my back and i have always taken care not to allow the opportunities for humiliation to be created this time i disregarded all thought of my dignity and in my brief pause some fellow made a ribald remark and others laughed and this encouraged still more for the court as a sentence of death is to be passed becomes a solemn place full of apprehension and dread men leap eagerly at anything which will break that atmosphere and render it less awful within seconds the court erupted in jeers and even had i shouted at the top of my voice i would not have been heard redfaced with embarrassment and consumed by shame at my failure i felt locke pull me down hoping as i resumed my plea the judge would restore order and call on me once more to say my piece he did not rather with a supercilious smirk on his face he thanked me for my eloquent words and deliberately encouraged more laughter then he sentenced sarah blundy to die when i heard those words i ran out of the courtroom to avoid further misery and took myself to my room where i locked myself in and prayed for guidance i had no idea what i should do and i stayed in mute immobility until my mother put her head around the door and told me there was a visitor who would not take no for an answer she had told him to go away and he had refused absolutely to budge until he had seen me and a few moments later in marched jack prestcott as cheerful as he was insane he frightened me greatly for his deterioration since i had last seen him was very great indeed and the look in his eyes to my mind suggested a man who could fall into violence at any moment should he be crossed or contradicted ho there my friend he said as he walked in for all the world like a seigneur condescending to pay a call on one below his social rank i hope i find you well i neither know nor care what reply i made i could have recited an extract from the bodleian catalogue i think for all the difference it would have made jack prestcott was not interested in anything but the sound of his own delusions which poured from his mouth in a thick torrent he kept me there for half an hour as he recited to me all his ills and how he had overcome them every detail was put in much as he later put it down in his manuscript indeed some of the words and phrases and sentences some of the little asides and comments were precisely the same and i believe that in all the years that have passed between that visit and his putting pen to paper he has done nothing except go over in his mind the selfsame account repeating endlessly in his delirium the same events when he dies he may go to hell it would be no more than deserved but in my opinion he is in it already for tully says true a diis quidem immortalibusquae potest homini major esse poena furore atque dementia what greater punishment can the gods inflict upon a man than madness i was at a loss to understand his purpose in coming for i knew he hardly recognized me as a friend and i had certainly done nothing to encourage any intimacy i thought perhaps he wanted to consult me on matters of historical fact and did my best to indicate i would not assist him in any way but instead he held up his hand to silence me in a gesture of the most perfect condescension i have come to provide you with material not to ask your opinion he said with a sly smile i wish you to keep these papers if you will i will certainly reclaim them some day perhaps if my suit still has to go formally to law but i shall be on the move in the next few months and am in no position to guard them carefully if you keep them you will be doing me as much a favor as i am doing you for dr walks would surely want them back if he knew where they were i do not want them and have no desire to help you in any way i said yes he said nodding his head with the gravest satisfaction when your life of my father comes out and people see through your pen the great man he truly was then your career will be made and let me assure you that i will not abandon you all the expenses of publication i will bear a thousand copies at least i think in the finest bindings and on the best paper mr prestcott i said more loudly you are a liar and a murderer and the foulest person i have ever encountered you are killing the dearest person i know the best person in the world for no reason i beg you to consider what you are doing it is not too late to change and undo the damage if you go to the magistrate now and to do the job perfectly he said as if i had merely muttered some conventional appreciation of his kindness you must have these but on condition that you say nothing to anyone about them until the book is ready for press more paper i took the proffered sheets and looked at them complete nonsense written on them i leave it to you to detect their importance he said it can serve as a puzzle for you then he laughed outright at the look of consternation on my face i must explain he said for i see your perplexity these all come from the drawer of dr wallis i stole them a few weeks back prestcott leaned forward on his chair and said in a conspiratorial whisperthey are in a most cunning code and have all defeated the good doctor he is properly mad about it please i said stop talking like this can you not hear me cant you understand mr boyle conducted his experiments with his vacuum pump cola mentions some of them and noted that as the air was sucked out the sound of the animal inside it becomes fainter and fainter until it can be discerned no more as prestcott stood before me conducting the conversation he wished to have hearing answers which were in his mind alone and oblivious to my words i felt like some poor experimental beast banging my hand against an invisible wall and shouting out at the top of my lungs but receiving no response or understanding for my efforts yes he prides himself on his skill and yet these letters elude his mind completely he chuckled but he told me the key even though he thought me too stupid to notice apparently you need a book of livy and with it all will be revealed he thinks i must say i do not mind him reading his own but i no longer want him reading my fathers letters which is why you must have them he will not think of looking here and with this remark prestcott bade me farewell and went off to amuse himself before his fateful interview with john wallis the next day both of them have given their accounts and wallíss is obviously the correct one for prestcotts assault on him caused something of a stir and there was a great crowd in the high street a few weeks later to see the young man escorted from bocardo jail by his uncle and carried off so wrapped in chains he could scarcely move it was a kindness to all especially for him that he should be so confined he was too murderous to be free and too mad to be punished i hope it will be understood that i thought he received more consideration than he deserved but he left me those letters and in particular that one crucial letter which wallis intercepted on its way to cola in the low countries the only copy indeed and the only proof of that italians purpose here i put it aside with scarcely a glance even though i now knew something of how to read it i cared nothing at that moment for intellectual puzzles instead i tidied up my room with methodical precision added the papers to my collection under the floorboards and thus occupied my body in useless tasks while my mind resumed its melancholic reverie then i left the house to visit sarah one last time she would not see me the jailer instead told me that she was on her own for her last evening and wished to see nobody i insisted and offered him a bribe and begged and finally persuaded him to go back and ask again she will not see you he said with a look of sympathy she said you will see her tomorrow well enough her rejection saddened me more than anything and i am so selfish that all i could think of was my own sorrow at being deprived of an opportunity to give consolation i confess i drank more than i should have done that night and also that it soothed me not at all tavern after tavern and inn after inn i went to but could scarcely abide the company of all those happy and cheerful faces i drank in solitude and turned my back when even people i counted as friends approached me everywhere i went people who knew who i was came up to me and asked me about sarah and what i thought of her and every time i was too miserable to speak the truth in the fleurdelys then in the feathers and finally in the mitre i shrugged and said i did not know that it was none of my concern she might have done it for all i knewall i wanted to do was forget it all so selfpitying had the drink made me eventually i was thrown out for having drunk too much and slipped over and fell into the gutter once more this time i stayed there until i found myself being bodily picked up do you know mr wood said a soft singsong voice in my ear i do believe i just heard a cock crow is that not strange for this time of night leave me alone i think perhaps i would like to talk to you sir so this stranger this valentine greatorex led me to his room and sat me down by the fire and dried me then sat opposite and regarded me seriously but with great calm until i spoke myself i went to the magistrate and told him she was innocent i said i told him that i had killed dr grove not sarah he did not believe me is that so then i went to dr wallis and told him and he would not believe me either i expect not why do you say that because otherwise she might not die tomorrow you know her well i think better than anyone tell me please i want to know everything about her jack prestcott talks of this man and how his voice fascinated and soothed so that those he spoke to almost fell into a dream of tranquillity and obeyed his every command so it was with me and i told him everything i knew about sarah everything i have put in this manuscript and very much more for he was fascinated by her conversation and wished to hear every word she had ever uttered as i spoke of her words at the meeting i had attended he gave an enormous sigh and nodded with satisfaction and i must save her i concluded i must there must be something i can do ah mr wood you have read too many chivalrous romances he said kindly do you see yourself as launcelot du lac perhaps sweeping down on your charger and rescuing your guinevere from the pyre fighting off your enemies and taking her to safety no i thought if i went to the lord lieutenant or the judge they would not hear you he said any more than the magistrate or this man wallis or even the entire court could hear you they hear ye indeed but understand not see ye indeed but perceive not it says so in isaiah and so it is but why do so many people want her dead you know full well already but will not accept it in your heart you know what you have seen you know your scripture and you have heard her own words there is nothing you can do and nothing you should do i cannot live without her that is your punishment for your part in this i had no spirit or energy to say any more and the drink had so fuddled my brain i could barely have spoken even had i wanted to it was greatorex who eventually pulled me out of the chair and took me into the cold air outside which revived me enough to walk steadily it is a purgatory my friend but not of long duration you will see go and sleep if you can pray if you cannot it will soon be over i did as he said and spent the entire night in the deepest prayer for myself and for sarah begging god with all my might that he should intervene and stop the madness he had visited on the world my faith is weak a disgrace to anyone who has in life been favored as i have i have been spared riches and fame and power and position just as his goodness has saved me from poverty and great illness whatever dishonor is mine i have brought on myself and whatever accomplishment is by his grace alone despite that i did not believe enough i prayed fervently i used every device i knew to achieve that peaceful sincerity of submission that i had felt but once when on a horse in dead winter with sarah behind me one small part of my soul at least knew that i was doing nothing but filling out the hours until the inevitable took place again and again i threw myself back into the struggle getting ever more desperate in my attempts to force my rebellious spirit into calm but i had spent too long amongst the rationalists and those who told me that the age of miracle was past and the signs of the divine given to the fathers of the church had been taken from the world never to come again i knew it was not the case and knew that god could and did intervene in mens affairs still but i could not accept it with my whole heart i could not say those simple words thy will be done and mean it i meant i know thy will be done if it agrees with what i want and that is not prayer nor is it submission my prayers failed and shortly before dawn i lifted up my head and abandoned the attempt and knew that i was alone i knew that i would receive no help and that the one thing i desired most of all would not be given me i would lose her and at that moment knew that sarah was the most precious part of my life and the most precious thing that would ever be in my life i accepted my punishment and in the quiet of dawn and despair perhaps then i prayed truly for the first time all i know is that the darkness lifted from me and a feeling of the most profound peace came to rest on my soul and i found myself on my knees once more thanking god with all my heart for his goodness i did not know what would happen and could not understand how it could possibly be that the inevitable march of mans cruelty could be thrust aside but i no longer questioned or doubted i dressed myself as warmly as possible took my thickest cloakfor although spring had come it was still frosty at dawnand joined the throng of people walking down towards the castle to see the execution there was only one person to die that day the judge was as merciful with others as he was vengeful with her and the affair would be over in only a short time as i approached the mob gathered round the big tree in the courtyard the rope already hanging from the thick bough and the ladder in place my heart sank and the doubt came upon me once again but with a mighty effort of will i pushed all such thoughts from me i did not even know why i was there certainly there was no purpose in it and i did not wish sarah to see me but i knew that it was necessary somehow and that her life depended on my presence although i could not begin to comprehend how lower was also there with locke and a few burly fellows one of whom i recognized as a porter from christ church strange company i thought before it dawned on me what he was proposing i had not seen him now for several days but i should have realized he would not readily pass up an opportunity to get more material for his book he was a kind man but dedicated to his work the look of grim determination on his face as he paced up and down was not that of someone who anticipated any enjoyment from imminent events but he was certainly not going to flinch from them i avoided him i had no desire for conversation and i scarcely even noticed another small party standing to one side talking loudly and making coarse jokes which clustered around the regius professor had i paid more attention i have no doubt i would also have given more significance to the whispered conference between lower and his associates to the way they positioned themselves next to the hanging tree and the look of grim satisfaction on lowers face as he surveyed the coming battlefield and the disposition of his forces and then sarah was brought out in heavy chains and between two large guards although scarce any were needed so small and frail and weak did she look it made my heart break to see her her eyes were heavy and the blackness of the rings around them was made more visible by the deathly pallor of her face her beautiful dark hair was uncovered but seemed beautiful no longer she had always combed it lovingly it was her greatestindeed her onlyvanity now it was matted and unkempt and was bundled up coarsely above her neck so it would not get in the way of the rope i merely repeat what cola has already documented from my lips she did indeed dismiss the priest in a way which brought loud applause from the crowd said her own prayers and then made a brief speech which while she confessed to sins did not confess to the one sin for which she was about to die there was no ringing heroism or defiance or appeal for the crowds sympathy such as would be appropriate for a man in similar circumstances her common sense i am sure told her that it would be unseemly from her lips and win her no admiration rather the way to the mobs heart lay through courage and submission and as these two greatest of human qualities were in natural conformity to her nature she won their applause merely by being herselfand to be that in such an extremity is to my mind the greatest of achievements once all was over she mounted the ladder after the hangman and then waited patiently as he fumbled around her with the rope i do not know why hangings have to be so coarse and crude the last moments should be more dignified not this welter of legs and arms up a rickety ladder propped uncertainly against a tree trunk and to submit without exciting laughter is rare but the crowd was in no mood for laughter that morning her youth her frailty and her calm stilled any ribaldry and they watched with greater quiet and respect than i have ever seen at such an event then the drums sounded only two drummers both boys aged about twelve whom i had seen many times playing in the street the days when a proper troop would perform the ceremony were gone now and the magistrate had decided there was no need of soldiers that morning he did not anticipate any trouble from the crowd as might have been the case if a popular figure in the town or a highwayman of standing or a man with a family was being hanged nor was there the crowd fell absolutely silent the drums followed suit and the hangmanwith a movement of the most surprising delicacypushed sarah off the ladder god have mercy this was her cry and the last was lost as the rope pulled tight under her weight and ended in a strangled sob that brought a sigh of sympathy from the crowd and then she swung there her face turning purple and her limbs twitching and the stench spreading as the telltale stains on her shift showed that the noose was having its usual foul effect i will not continue there can be few who have not seen such a sight and even now the memory pains me beyond belief although i recall that i watched it all with the most remarkable calm despite the sudden and terrifying clap of thunder and darkening of the skies which broke from heaven as she fell i prayed for her soul and for my own once again and lowered my eyes that i should not see the end i had reckoned without lower and his determination to beat the regius professor to the body he had of course bribed the hangman in advance this accounted for the nods and winks that passed between them and the fact that he was suffered to be so close to the tree i did not realize he had purchased sarahs permission with a promise of treatment for her mother nor indeed that the mother at that very moment lay breathing her last only a few hundred yards away from the castle sarah had only just stopped twitching and convulsing when lower cried in a loud voice to his little army right lads and surged forward giving a sign to the hangman who straightaway pulled a large knife from his belt and sliced through the rope sarahs body fell the three feet to the ground with a heavy thump accompanied by the first muttering of disapproval from the crowd and lower bent down to see if she still breathed dead he shouted after a proper examination so that all might hear and signed for his comrades to come forward the porter from christ church picked up the body and threw it over his shoulder and before anyone could react at all began to head off almost breaking into a run as the protests from the crowd grew two others in his party stood back to head off the regius professors men should they try to intercept and lower looked around once before following his prize right across that open patch of land our eyes met and in mine he can have seen nothing but disgust he gave a little shrug then cast his eyes down and would look at me no more then he too turned and ran off into the rain which was already falling heavily and with appalling ferocity i hesitated for only a brief moment before leaving myself but unlike the crowd who attempted a pursuit and became blocked in the narrow gateway by all trying to run out at the same moment i left by the other entrance for i knew where lower was going and did not need to keep him in my sight in order to catch up with him and his gruesome prize he must have moved quickly and knew that the faster he went the better for the crowd was now in an unforgiving mood they accepted the hanging as gods will and the kings justice and went to see all the proprieties maintained what they did not acceptfor crowds have a fine sense of right and wrongwas any meanness of behavior the condemned must die but must be treated well lower had offended victim and town and i knew it would go hard with him should he be caught they did not however for he had planned well i only just caught up with him myself before he slipped in the back of boyles elaboratory and mounted the stairs i was still cold with shock at what he had done i knew all his arguments in advance had heard them all before and even agreed with most of them but this i could not countenance you may say that considering all i had done and not done i had long since resigned any right to make judgments i did so nonetheless and mounted the stairs so that if i could not ensure justice was done i could at least maintain appearances he had already posted guards on the stairs lest the crowd realize that he had come here rather than to christ church and was on the verge of bolting the doors so that no one could disturb him in his horrible labor i however managed to burst in by pushing all my weight against the door before the bolts were shot lower i cried when i stopped and briefly took in the hellish scene in front of me this must stop locke was there already to assist as well as a barber to attend on the more mechanical aspects of the dissection sarah had already been stripped naked and that beautiful body which i had held so often lay on the table as the barber roughly washed it down and prepared it for the knife that she was dead no one could doubt for a moment her poor broken body was as drained as a corpse is and only the thick red weal around the neck and strangled expression of anguish on her face destroying all beauty showed all too well what had become of her dont be absurd wood he said wearily shes dead the soul has gone i can do nothing to hurt her further you know that as well as i i know you were fond of her but it is too late for that he looked at me kindly and patted me on the back look my friend he said you will not like this i dont blame you it takes a strong stomach you should not stay here to watch take my advice and go away old fellow it will be better believe me i was too mad to listen but angrily flung off his kindly touch and retreated daring him to act in the bestial way he intended in my eyesight thinking perhaps foolishly that my presence would make him see the evil he did and desist he looked at me for several moments uncertain about how to proceed until locke coughed in the background we have little time you know he said the magistrate gave us an hour only and time is going quite apart from what will happen if the crowd finds out where we are make up your mind with difficulty lower did and turned away from me and back to the table signing for all others to leave the room i sank down on my knees begging the lord anyone to do something and stop this nightmare even though it had served no purpose the night before i went over all my prayers and my promises oh lord god incarnate for our sins have mercy on this poor innocent if not on me then lower picked up his knife and placed it on her breast ready he asked locke nodded and with a swift sure movement he began to make his incision i shut my eyes locke i heard him call through my darkness suddenly angry what on earth do you think youre doing let go of my hand is everyone gone mad here stop a moment and locke whom i had never liked pulled the knife away from the body and bent over the corpse then with a puzzled look on his face he repeated the movement so that his cheek rested on her mouth shes breathing i could scarcely restrain my tears at those few simple words which said so much lower gave his own explanations later how she must have been cut down too early in his efforts to get hold of the corpse first and how rather than life itself merely the appearance of it had been extinguished how the fall had merely strangled and brought temporary oblivion only i know all this he told me his reasons time and again but i knew differently and never bothered to contradict him he believed one thing i knew another i knew that i had witnessed the greatest miracle of history i had seen resurrection for the spirit of god moved in that room and the soft wings of the dove that attended her conception returned to beat on sarahs soul it is not given to man and certainly not to physicians to restore life when it is extinguished lower would argue this proves she was never dead but he had pronounced her so himself and he had studied the question more carefully than anyone people say the age of miracles is past and i believed that myself but it is not so they do occur only we are getting better at explaining them away so what do we do now i heard lower say a tone of the greatest bafflement and surprise in his voice should we kill her do you think what she is meant to be dead not to kill her would merely postpone the inevitable and ensure i lost her well i could not believe my ears surely after witnessing such a marvel my friend could not be serious he could not go against the manifest will of god and commit murder i wanted to stand up and remonstrate with him but found that i could not i could not stand i could not open my mouth all i could do was sit there and listen for i think the lord had still more purpose that day as well he wanted lower to redeem himself as well if only he would take the opportunity id hit her on the head he said except that would damage the brain and he stood awhile in thought before scratching his chin nervously ill have to cut her throat he went on its the only solution and again he picked up his knife and again he hesitated before quietly laying it down again i cant do this he said locke advise me what should i do i seem to remember locke said that we physicians are meant protect life and are never meant to kill is that not the case but legally lower replied she is already dead i am merely doing properly what should already have been done are you a hangman then she was condemned to die was she you know very well she was i remember locke said that she was sentenced to be hanged by the neck she has been so there was no mention of her being hanged by the neck until dead i admit this is normally understood and stated but as it was not in this case it cannot be counted a necessary part of the punishment she has also been condemned to burn lower said and the hanging was merely a way of sparing her pain are you telling me we should now hand her over to the pyre and let her burn alive then his attention was brought to sarah herself who issued a soft low moan as she lay all unattended while they conducted their dispute bring me a bandage he said the physician once more and let me bind up this cut i made in her for the next five minutes or so he worked steadily on the wound fortunately only small before he and locke used all their strength to raise her up into a sitting position resting her back against their shoulders and swinging her legs down off the table finally while locke instructed her on deep breathing so that her head might steady itself lower fetched a cloak and with the utmost gentleness covered her up a living sitting woman is more difficult to contemplate killing than a corpse flat out on a table and by the time the movement was finished lowers attitude had entirely changed his natural kindness kept at bay on many occasions by his ambition swept all before it and whatever he thought he should do he began to treat the girl as his patient almost without being aware of it and he was always ferocious in the defense of those whom he considered to be under his protection but what do we do now he said and all of us in that room were aware that while this had been continuing the noise from the street outside had insensibly grown so that now there was the roar of a substantial number of people outside locke poked his head out of the window it is the crowd i told you they wouldnt like this he said just as well it is raining so hard it keeps most of them away he peered up into the sky have you ever seen rain like this before another groan from sarah who bent her head down and was violently sick heaving and retching distracted their attention once again lower brought some spirits and patted her on the head as he forced her to drink some although it only made her retch the more if you tell them this they will only say it was a sign of disfavor at what you intended they will take her away and put her on the pyre then stand guard to make sure you get nowhere near are you saying we shouldnt hand her over through all this i had said not a word but merely stood in the corner and watched now i found my voice was given back to me i could make a difference in this balance for it was clear that all must agree to whatever action was taken you must not i said she has done no wrong she is entirely innocent i know it if you hand her over you will not only abandon a patient you will abandon an innocent whom god has favored and you are sure of this locke said turning and apparently noticing me for the first time i am tried to tell the court but was hooted down will not ask you how you know he said softly and his penetrating look made me realize for the first and only time how it was that he subsequently achieved such a place in the world for he saw more than other people and guessed more still i was grateful to him for his silence and have been ever since very well he continued the only problem is that we may take her place on the gallows i am a generous man i think but even i have limits to what i will do for a patient lower meanwhile had been pacing up and down in the greatest agitation occasionally sneaking a glimpse out of the window then looking in turn at sarah then locke then me when locke and i had finished our exchange he spokesarah he said softly and repeated it until she lifted up her head and looked at him her eyes were bloodshot and ill for the little vessels within them had ruptured and gave her the air of a very devil and the whiteness of her complexion made this seem even more frightening can you hear me can you speak after a long pause she nodded you must answer me a question he said coming and kneeling on one knee before her so that she could see him clear whatever you have said in the past you must say the truth now for our lives and souls depend on it as well as yours did you kill dr grove even though i knew the truth i did not know the answer she would give and she did not give one for some time but eventually she shook her head your confession was false a little nod you swear this by all you hold dear she nodded lower stood up and heaved a heavy sigh mr wood he said take this girl upstairs to boyles chamber he will be indignant if he discovers so try not to make a mess dress her as best you can and cut off her hair i stared uncomprehending and lower frowned now mr wood if you please you must never query a physician while he is trying to save a life and i led sarah out by the hand hearing lower murmurin the next room locke it is a long shot but it may serve although there seemed little wrong with her sarah was still unable to speak or do anything except sit staring into space as i followed my instructions it is hard cutting off hair without a scissor and the result would have done no credit to a woman of fashion that however was not lowers intention whatever else he had in mind and within a short while i had done as i was told then tried my best to clear up the mess then i sat down beside her and took her hand there were no words i could say that would have answered my need so i said none but i squeezed lightly and eventually felt the very slightest of squeezes back it was enough i broke down in the most complete of sobs bending my head down across her breast while she sat there immobile did you really think i would leave you she said in a voice so soft and weak i could barely hear her i could hardly hope for anything better i know i did not deserve as much who am i it was the most glorious moment of my life everything before built to that question everything after the years of life which i have had since and still hope to have are the merest coda to it for the first and the last time i had no doubts and had no need of thought or calculation i did not need to consider or assess evidence nor yet to use any of the skills of interpretation needed for lesser matters all i had to do was state the manifest truth without fear and in perfect confidence some things indeed are so obvious that examination is redundant and logic contemptible the truth was there to be believed the most perfect gift because so undeserved i knew that was all you are my savior the living god born of the spirit persecuted insulted and abused known to the magi who died for our sins and is resurrected as happened before and will happen again in every generation of man anyone who heard me would have thought me mad and in that sentence i stepped forever out of the full society of my fellow men and into a peace of my own tell no one of this she said softly and i am afraid i cannot bear to lose you i added ashamed of my own selfishness sarah seemed scarcely to pay any attention but eventually leaned forward and kissed me on the forehead you should not be afraid and should never be afraid you are my love my dove my dearest and i am your friend i will not forsake you nor ever neglect you they were the last words she spoke to me the last i ever heard from her lips and i sat by her side holding her hand and staring in awe at her until a noise from below roused me once more then i rose from the bed where she sat staring blankly across the room and went back down to lower sarah now seemed completely unaware of my existence the carnage in that room downstairs was truly diabolical and even i who knew the truth was appalled by it how much greater must colas shock have been when he forced his way in and saw what he thought to be sarahs body for lower had taken the corpse he had acquired in aylesbury and roughly hacked it into unrecognizable fragments so brutalizing the head that it was scarcely recognizable as human he himself was covered in blood from a dog locke had slaughtered to complete the illusion and the stench of the alcohol in the room was unbearable even though the window was wide open to allow the winds into the room well wood he said turning to me with a grim expression locke i saw had resumed his languid absent pose and was standing idly by at the door will anybody spot our imposition do you think and with a knife he levered an eyeball out of the skull on the table so that it hung by a thread from its socket i have cut her hair but the experience has so affected her she is hardly capable of moving i think what do you suggest we do with her now boyles servant has some clothes in the cupboard next the chamber he said at least he normally keeps them there i think we must borrow them dress her up and get her out of the building so no one will recognize her meantime keep her upstairs and quiet no one must see her or even suspect there is anyone there again i mounted the stairs found the clothes and began the lengthy process of getting sarah into them she spoke not a word during the whole operation and when i was finished i left her and went out by mr crosses back door and followed a little lane down to merton street and my house first however i called into the feathers as i needed a few moments to steady my nerves and collect my thoughts and was approached by cola looking tired and worn out himself who wanted news of the execution i told him the entire truth except for the one detail of importance and he poor man took it as confirmation of his theory about blood transfusion that the death of the spirit in the donor must inevitably cause the death of the recipient as well i could not for obvious reasons illuminate him on this point and demonstrate that his theory had a fatal evidential flaw he also told me of the death of the mother which grieved me greatly for it was yet another burden for sarah to bear but i forced myself to put it aside as cola went to remonstrate with lower and i went myself to my house to discover my mother in the kitchen she had been greatly affected by sarahs fall and had taken to sitting quietly by the fire when she was not praying for the girl this morning as i arrivedfor despite everything it was still scarcely eightshe sat all alone in the chair no one else was allowed to occupy and i saw to my astonishment that she had been crying when no one was there to see her but she pretended not to do so and i pretended not to notice as i had no wish to humiliate her even then i think i wondered how something of normal life could continue despite the wonders i had just witnessed and could not understand how no one had noticed anything except myself and it is done after a fashion i replied mother i must ask you something in all seriousness what would you have done to help her had it been in your power anything she said firmly you know that anything if she had escaped would you have assisted her even though it meant breaking the law yourself not given her up of course she said the law is nothing when it is wrong and deserves to be disregarded i looked at her for the words sounded strange on her lips until i realized it was something i had once heard sarah say herself would you help her now she is beyond my help i think no she said nothing so i continued my words blurting out once i had gone too far to retract she died and is alive again she is in mr boyles apartment she is still alive mother and no one knows of it nor will they ever unless you say something as we have all decided to try and help her away this time even my presence did not provide enough incentive to spare her dignity and she rocked back and forth in her chair clutching her hands together and muttering thank god thanks to god all praise to god with the tears welling up in her eyes and rolling down her cheeks until i took her by the hand and got her attention once more she needs hiding until we can get her out of the town do i have your permission to bring her here if i hide her in my study you will not betray her of course she gave her absolute promise and i knew it was better than any i might make so i kissed her on the cheek and told her i would be back after nightfall i last saw her bustling about the kitchen dragging out vegetables and our last winter ham for a celebratory feast when sarah should come again it continued a strange day that one for after all the frenzied activity of the first few hours all of uslower locke and myselffound ourselves with time on our hands and little to do until night came lower realized that the events at least had made up his mind about journeying to london for his reputation amongst the townsfolk would never be the same again such was the disapproval of his supposed activities he now had no choice but to risk all and begin the long task of establishing himself elsewhere the remains of the girl he had bought in aylesbury were taken off to the castle and burned on the pyrelowers humor returned sufficiently for him to remark that she had been pickled in so much alcohol it would be fortunate if she did not blow up the entire buildingand i had been given money by cola to ensure the decent burial of mrs blundy organizing the burial was a simple if painful process there were plenty of people who were now prepared to do something so great was the revulsion felt for the fate of the girl that they were happy to make some amends by treating the mother as well as possible especially as they were to be paid for their kindness i had the priest at st thomass undertake to perform the rites and set them for that evening and he also sent his men round to collect the body and prepare it it was not either the priest or the church the woman would have chosen for herself but i had no clear idea who should do it and as asking anybody but an established minister would create untold difficulties i decided it was best to avoid unnecessary complications the service was set for eight oclock that evening and as i left the priest was already shouting at the sexton telling him to dig a grave in the poorer more neglected part of the churchyard so that a more valuable plot such as is occupied by gentlemen was not used by accident i had entirely put out of my mind the unwelcome task of telling sarah what had occurred it would have to be done of course and i knew i would have to do it but i simply postponed it as long as possible lower had already been told by cola and looked greatly upset by the news i cannot understand it he said she was not well and was very weak but when saw her she was not dying when did she die i do not know mr cola told me of it he was with her i think lowers face darkened that man he said im sure he killed her lower that is a terrible thing to say i dont mean deliberately but his grasp of theory is better than his practice he sighed heavily and looked mightily concerned i feel bad about this wood i really do i should have attended the woman myself you know cola planned to give her more blood no he did i could not stop him of course as she was his patient but i refused to have anything to do with it it was the wrong treatment not necessarily but we had a falling out and i did not wish to be associated with him i told you that wallis said he has in the past stolen other mens ideas many times i said so so lower repeated greatly affronted is there anything worse he might have been a scheming jesuit here in secret to rekindle civil strife and subvert the kingdom i suggested that might be accounted worse not by me and the remark broke the tension which had been building up all day and all of a sudden both lower and i found ourselves collapsing in gales of laughter roaring until the tears rolled down our cheeks gripping each other tightly as our bodies shook with the most strange merriment we ended on the floor lower flat on his back still heaving i with my head between my knees as the laughter made my head spin and my jaw ache i loved lower dearly then and knew that whatever our differences and whatever gruffness of character he might have i would always love him for he was a truly good man when we recovered and wiped the tears from our eyes it was lower who brought up the topic of what to do with sarah no laughing matter that she must obviously leave oxford immediately i said she cannot stay in my chamber forever and even with her hair cut she is easily recognizable but where she should go and what she should do i am at a loss to suggest how much ready money do you have about four pounds i said much of which is the money due to you and cola for her mothers treatment he waved that aside another patient defaults not the first and not the last ill be bound for my part i have two pounds and in a fortnight i am due my annuity from my family out of that i can afford another two if you make it up to four i will repay you the difference when my own quarterly comes in he nodded ten pounds then not a lot even for a girl of her condition i wonder hmm you know my younger brother is a quaker he said it quite naturally and without evident shame although i knew it was a topic he touched on with only the greatest reluctance indeed there were many who knew him well who were entirely unaware that lower even had a brother so greatly did he fear being damaged by the association i met this man once and did not dislike him just as his face was like lowers without the same expression so his character was like that of his brother without the merriment and easy laughter for laughter i am told is forbidden among them as a sin i nodded he is in business with a group of likeminded people who wish to go to places where they will not come under attack the countries of massachusetts and suchlike i could write to him and ask him to get sarah blundy sent there she could leave as a servant or as someones relative and would then have to make her own way when she arrives it is a harsh punishment for one who has done no wrong few who go there of their own volition have done anything wrong yet they go nonetheless she will be in good company and will find more people there of her like than she will ever do here after all that had happened the thought of her leaving of never seeing her again tore at my heart and i know that i argued against the plan for selfish reasons but lower was right if she stayed in england then sooner or later she would be discovered someonean old comrade of her father or a traveling man from oxford or an old studentwould see her and recognize her her life would be in the balance every day and so would ours be i had no idea what technically the law said about what we had done but i knew that few judges looked kindly on anyone who presumed to interfere with their prerogatives she had been condemned to death and was alive all of lockes cleverness in argument would have a hard time explaining that one away and so we agreed or at least we agreed that it should be put to sarah as the scheme was impossible if she would not give her consent lower undertook to suggest the plan as it was his idea and he would have to do all the arranging with the dissidents i took myself back to st thomass to ensure that the preparations for the funeral were going well and fully expected that i would be the only person there at the service itself sarah was not content because she did not wish to leave her mother and it was only lower informing her that the woman was dead which brought her to sense all her own trials she had borne with fortitude the loss of this woman brought out all her weakness i will say no more except that lower was not the best of people to deliver comfort he was kind and desired the best for all but he did have a tendency to become gruff and unsympathetic when confronted with a misery he could do nothing to alleviate i have little doubt that his tonematteroffact to the point of being brutalonly made matters worse sarah insisted on coming to the funeral even though lower remonstrated with her forcefully about the foolishness of such a desire but she insisted and was quite impossible to divert the fact that my mother backed her up and said she would bring the girl to the church whatever dr richard lower said decided the matter i was distressed when all three of them arrived lower looking anxious my mother grim and sarah blank as though some vitality had left her body never to return they had done their best to disguise her appearance and had dressed her as a boy covering her head with a cap pulled down low in front of her eyes but i was terrified that at any moment the priest would look up from his book and stare goggleeyed before rushing off to call the watch but he did nothing of the sort merely droned through the service faster than was seemly refusing to make the slightest effort for the soul of a woman who was not a lady not a rich parishioner nor indeed anyone who should attract the condescension of someone as grand as he i felt i must say like slapping him and telling him to do his job properly so ashamed i was with priests like that no wonder so many people turn elsewhere when he was over he snapped the book shut nodded at us held out his hand for his fee then stalked off he would not he said finish the rest of the ceremony at the graveside as the woman was all but a heathen he had done his legal requirement and he would do no more lower i think was even more furious than i at this callousness although i like to believe the man would have been more considerate had he known that a member of the womans family was present but he did not so made no effort and the result was one of the most painful events i have ever witnessed and for sarah it must have been many times more anguishing i did my best to comfort her she will be sent on her way by her daughter who loved her and her friends who tried to help her i said that is far better and more appropriate she would not have liked to be intoned over at the graveside by a man like that in any case so lower and i picked up the bier ourselves and carried it out of the church stumbling across the yard in the dark with only one taper to guide us a more different occasion than the one which attended the burial of dr grove could not be imagined but we were at least all at one now the minister was gone it fell to me to make the speech for lower did not know her well and sarah seemed unable to speak i had no idea what was appropriate but simply spoke the first thoughts that came into my head i said that i had known her only in the last few years that we were not of the same faith she and i and could not be further apart in matters of politics yet i honored her as a good woman and a courageous one who did right as she saw it and was also a seeker after the truths she wished to know i would not say she was the most obedient of wives for she would have scorned to be described in such a way yet she was the greatest support for her husband and both loved and helped him in all the ways he wanted and expected she fought herself for what he also believed and brought up a daughter who was courageous true gentle and good better than anyone could conceive in this best of fashions she honored her creator and was blessed for it i believed she had no faith in the afterlife for she distrusted anything that came from the mouths of priests yet i knew she was wrong and that she would be welcomed into gods embrace it was an inarticulate mishmash that speech of mine delivered rather to give such comfort as i could to sarah than to paint a true portrait of the dead woman yet i believed it all then and believe it still i know it is inconceivable that a woman like her of her religion and her opinions of her status and her deeds could ever be accounted worthy or noble or virtuous in any form but she was all of these and i do not trouble any more about reconciling my beliefs with those of other men when i had done there was an awkward pause before my mother led sarah up to the body and pulled back the cloth so that the face was exposed it was raining heavily and inexpressibly miserable as little spots of mud were thrown up by the rain spattering on the dead woman as she lay there on the damp cold ground sarah knelt down and we all stood back while she muttered a prayer of her own she finished by leaning over and kissing her mothers forehead then gently tidied away a wisp of hair that had come loose from the old womans best bonnet she stood up once more lower tugged me by the arm and together we lowered the corpse into the ground as gently and decorously as we could manage before sarah performed her final duty as a daughter and scattered the earth over the grave opening we all followed suit and finally lower and i wielded the shovels ourselves filling up that hole as swiftly as we could when it was all completed and we were all thoroughly drenched and muddy and cold we simply turned and walked away there was nothing else to be done except attend once more to the living lower as usual had been busier and more effective than i he had taken it upon himself to borrow boyles coachreasoning correctly that the vehicle of such a man would not be stopped or even examined by the watch however late it was to be found on the roadand hired two horses to pull it he proposed to take sarah himself to reading sufficiently far from oxford to be safe especially as relations between the two towns were bad enough to ensure that there was at present little communication between them there he would lodge sarah with associates of his brother a family of dissenters whom he could guarantee would guard her secret or what little they were to be told of it when his brother returned and passed through the town on his way back to dorset he would be informed of events and would certainly take the girl under his wing putting her on the first ship available taking dissenters away from england so it was agreed by all of us i cannot bring myself to write of my final parting from her my final look at her face and will not do so sarah left ten days later in the company of his brother made her way under his guidance to plymouth and there took passage it was the last anyone ever heard of her she never arrived in america and it was assumed she had fallen overboard but the boat was becalmed at the time and was in any case so crowded it was difficult to imagine anyone coming to grief without being noticed yet she simply disappeared one day in full sunlight and without any sound as though she had been taken up bodily into the heavens there the story such as i know it of sarah blundy comes to its end and i can say no morethose who wish to disbelieve me can do so it remains now for me to recount the last portion of the story and show what the italian had as his business in england i confess i do not find it important for in comparison to what i had witnessed the errors of men who squabble in such ignorance of the truth cannot but excite the most complete disdain yet as it is both part of these events and a cause of them so i should set all down that i might complete my labors and rest i traveled to london the day after sarah left oxford still very much in a mood of most profound dismay and reverie it was lowers idea to go and he recommended it forcefully as a treatment for melancholy and brooding a change of scenery different company and a bit of entertainment he insisted would help shake off the sadness that had settled over me i took his advice because my lassitude was such it was easier to do so than to resist lower packed my bag for me walked me to carfax and put me on the coach and enjoy yourself he said you must admit everything has turned out better than you could possibly have expected it is time to put it behind you naturally i could not do so quite so easily but i tried to follow his advice as much as possible and spent time forcing myself to visit people with whom i had corresponded over the years trying hard to be interested in what they said i did not succeed very well as my mind kept drifting off to more important matters and i fear i may have aroused some resentment among my colleagues because of a distance which they surely took as disdain and arrogance matters which ordinarily would have produced the liveliest fascination could generate no interest at all i was told of the discovery of huge bones turned to stone in a quarry in hertfordshire proving that the bible spoke true when it said that once giants walked the earth and i was less than fascinated i was given hospitality by john aubrey at that time my good friend but could display no enthusiasm for his ingenuity in discovering the purpose and nature of stonehenge and avebury and other such sites i was invited to attend a meeting of the royal society but turned this great honor down with ease and never cared that i was not invited again and one evening after i had been there but two days i found myself walking past an inn in cheapside called the bells and remembered i had seen the name in colas chest and felt the need to go in search of someone who had also known sarah and seen something of what i had seen and i had this great urge to know the answers to many questions to understand the apparent chain of human events which had brought her end he was easily found even though the innkeeperwhom i later knew to be a papistdid not know the name all i had to do was ask for the italian gentleman and i was immediately shown to the grand roomoccupied by himself alonewhere he had lodged himself since his arrival his astonishment at seeing me was very great but no more so than when i began to talk to him good evening father i said he could not deny it could not bluster or protest or insist for priests cannot do so instead he stared at me in terror thinking that i was sent to trap him and that armed men would soon be pounding up the stairs to take him to his martyrdom but there was no sound no noise of boots or shouts of urgent command just the silence in the room as he stood by the window in shock why do you call me father because that is what you are i did not say who else would go around with holy oil and holy water and a sacred relic hidden away in his belongings who else but a priest bound to celibacy would react in such horror when he realized the strengths of his carnal desires who else would secretly and in goodness give extreme unction to a woman he thought was dying to intercede for her soul despite herself cola sat down cautiously on his cot and looked at me carefully and with much thought almost as if he was still expecting me to launch some surprise assault on him why have you come here not to do you harm then why i wish to talk i felt sorry for putting him into such a dangerous situation and did my best to assure him that i intended him no ill i believe it was my face rather than my words which convinced him of my sincerity both can lie but not in my case for i have said already that the merest simpleton can see straight through me had i been lying cola would have known it and yet he saw nothing of the sort on my face so after a long and very tense wait he sighed and bowed to the inevitable and asked me to sit is your name really marco da cola i feel i should know whom i am addressing is there any such person i asked he smiled gently there was he said he was my brother my name is andrea was he is dead he died in my arms on his return from crete i grieve greatly for him still why are you here like you i can say i wish no harm on any man not that many would believe me hence my subterfuge your government does not greatly approve of foreign priests certainly not jesuits he said it deliberately eyes on my face all the while to see my reaction to his admission i nodded you have not answered my question mr wood he continued you are the only person to have divined who i am and you are the only man of your faith i have encountered who does not react as if i were the devil himself why is this are you perhaps drawn to the true church in your heart let no man say that his is the best and only road for they say so out of ignorance alone i said and the words were out of my mouth before ever i remembered where i had heard them cola looked disturbed at thisa generous though erroneous sentiment he replied and i hoped he would not query me too much on it for i knew i could neither defend it nor even explain it either the bread turns to flesh and the wine to blood or it does not it cannot do so in rome but not in canterbury either christ made peter and his successors the foundation stone of faith conferring on them all authority in matters spiritual or he did not our lord did not tell peter he would have authority over all the world except for those parts of europe which think differently but cola said no more on this subject glad only that he had the fortune to have been discovered by perhaps the one person in the whole country who felt no need to betray him to the authorities nor was my mind in the spirit for theological debate even had i a chance of winning it such discussions had always given me great delight but i was overburdened with the knowledge i carried within me and in no mood any more for what i could now only consider trivial instead he asked with exquisite kindness about the funeral of anne blundy and i told him as much as was seemly he seemed satisfied that his money was well spent and expressed sorrow that lower had behaved so ill you seem to have recovered from your distress at the girls death he said with a penetrating look in my direction i am glad of that it is not easy i know it is hard to lose someone who is important in your life as she was in yours and my brother was in mine and we talked of such matters father andrea with such sense and kindness that even though he knew little of what had occurred he soothed my loss and did something to reconcile me to the loneliness i already knew would be my fate he was a good man and a good priest though a papist and i was lucky to find him for such people are rarely encountered it is hard to be a physician of the body and even though many try few have the skills or the sympathy for success how much more difficult it is to give physick to the soul to guide a man in sorrow to calmness and acceptance yet father andrea was one who could when we had finished and i had no more to ask him and he had no more comfort to offer i told him of my appreciation and decided to give him something in return by way of recompense i know why you came to oxford i said and he spun round quickly to stare me in the face you were in correspondence with sir james prestcott and those letters were lost when he died they would greatly damage the cause of your religion in this country and you wished to recover them so that they might not become generally known that is why you searched the blundys cottage his eyes narrowed you know of this you know where they are i know you need have no fear about them i give you my word no one will ever see them and they will be destroyed he was in two minds about trusting me i could see but knew he had no choice and that he was profoundly fortunate after a while he nodded that is all i ask and you will be given it now i must go he descended the stairs with me resuming his disguise with each step and while he had blessed me as a priest upstairs he bowed to me as a gentleman in the street before we went our separate ways i suspect you will never come to rome mr wood he said with a smile you are not a man for traveling it is a pity for you would find it the most extraordinary of places and there are many fine historians and antiquarians there who would delight in your company as much as you would delight in theirs but should the urge to travel ever come upon you then you must write to me and i will ensure you the finest of welcomes i thanked him we bowed to each other one last time and i walked off never to see him again but i did hear of him for i had gone no more than a few yards when i encountered my friend john aubrey again a man whose abilities as a gossip were as great as my reputation for such nonsense is undeserved who is that man he asked curiously peering over my shoulder at cola as he walked away are you not going to introduce us he is a physician i said or at least a gentleman interested in physick why do you ask you talk as though you have seen him before indeed i have he said still peering even though cola by now had disappeared around the corner i saw him in whitehall yesterday evening a man may walk without arousing interest i expect in the palace itself not easily and not when you are being accompanied by sir henry bennet to the kings bedchamber what you seem excessively surprised by this might i ask why no reason i replied hastily i did not know he had such illustrious connections in this country i am afraid that in oxford we have all been patronizing him mightily as an impoverished foreigner down on his luck what is more he never sought to enlighten us we must have come across as very dismal people but tell me exactly when did you see him and where it was late well after dusk possibly as late as eight oclock i had the great boon of being invited to a suppervery private and informalwith my lord sandwich and his lady and a cousin of his who receives his patronage a bumptious man who works in the navy office forever discoursing on subjects he knows nothing about but very enthusiastic and quite likeable in his simplicity his name as i recall is i do not wish to know his name mr aubrey or what you ate or the details of my lord sandwichs table i wish to know about my acquaintance you may tell me of your good fortune later if you wish left his lodgings you see and walked back to my small abode and when i was almost there i remembered i had forgotten a box of manuscripts that the chancellor had said i could look at for my work as i was not tired and had scarce drunk a quart of wine i thought i would read them before sleeping so i went back and rather than walking across whitehall to the office i went via st stephens yard there is a corridor there and at the end it turns right and leads into offices that contain my papers while a left turn leads to a back entrance to the kings apartments i will show you later on today if you wish i nodded impatient for him to continue i got the papers i wanted and tucked them under my cloak then walked back and coming toward me down the corridor was sir henry bennetdid you know he is now lord arlingtonand this man whom i had never seen before you are sure it is the same man absolutely he was dressed in exactly the same fashion the thing which attracted my attention as i bowed to let them pass before me was that he was carrying what looked like a lovely book i am sure i had seen something like it before venetian work very old indeed in gold on a calfskin base how do you know it was the king he was seeing nearly everyone else is away the duke of york keeps separate apartments and in any case is at st jamess with the kings mother the queen is at windsor with all her attendants his majesty is still there until he leaves in a few days so unless bennet was bringing this man late at night to visit a footman and that tantalizingly was all i ever discovered for certain of the last few days that this venetian spent in london before he took ship for the continent once again i cannot work it all out precisely but it must have been a few days later that again leaving by the same route he was seen by drwallis and arrested and all the while sir henry bennet was organizing the search for him and concealing the fact that he had himself taken him to visit the king in the greatest secrecy clearly there were murky affairs of state involved and i knew that the innocent never emerges with credit if he involves himself in such matters without good reason the less i knew the safer i would be and although it was hard for once to rein in my curiosity i nonetheless left london on the university coach that evening and was glad to be away i say discovered for certain because i do know what happened with as near to certainty as is possible without having been present at that most secret of interviews now that i have read the manuscripts by cola prestcott and wallis as well i take great pleasure in them for the reasons behind colas decision to write is plain and clear all the purpose lies in the intent to sow uncertainty and the dispute with lowerreal though it was to himis presented simply to deflect attention from those matters he wishes to remain in the dark the manuscript was produced to establish the continued existence of marco da cola who has been dead now for so many years and prove that he a soldier and a layman came to england and was seen in whitehall that day because if marco da cola was in england the jesuit andrea da cola was not therefore what i believe took place at whitehall could not have occurred because it could only have happened if a priest a catholic priest saw the king that day and at a time when hatred of papists is greater than ever and any man tainted with the merest hint of popery is at risk that is of the utmost importance dr wallis came very close to seeing the truth indeed he had it in his hands but threw it away as incidental i refer you to his manuscript wherein he quotes his traveling picture dealer in venice that marco da cola had no reputation for learning or diligence in study at that time yet the man i met was learned in medicine with a fine knowledge of many of the best authors and an ability to discourse interestingly on the philosophies of the ancients and the moderns add to this the account of the merchant wallis interviewed who described marco da cola as gaunt and thin gloomy of attitude and contrast that with the stout cheerful man who came to oxford add to it colas refusal to discuss soldiering in crete when at sir william comptons then tell me what soldier you have ever met who would not talk endlessly about his heroism and actions think of those articles i found in his chest and consider their meaning think again of his reaction when confronted with the power of his lust at sarah blundys that night and say how many soldiers you know who are so delicate truly the man was like one of those puzzles so difficult to comprehend yet so simple when the truth is finally known i knew by then that the book in my possession was one of the copies of livy that wallis and cola both sought and that it was the key to at least some of the letters that jack prestcott had handed over to me reading those scripts however was no simple matter by recounting my ultimate success i do not desire to undermine or in any way denigrate the achievements of dr wallis at first i hesitated and not only because i was certain that any knowledge thus won would do me no good the events of those days still bore so heavily on my mind that i lost myself in lassitude for months as is my habit i consoled myself among my books and my papers reading and annotating with a fury i could scarcely contain the activities of the longsince dead became the greatest consolation and i became almost a hermit noting with only passing interest that my reputation for strangeness grew to the point that it became unshakeable i am i think held to be a queer unmannerly sort of fellow illhumored irascible and of a sour disposition and i think this character grew in those days without my even noticing and it is true nowi am dead to the world and delight to converse more with the dead than the living being so ill at ease with my own times i seek refuge in the past for only there can i show the affection i am unable to give to my contemporaries who do not know what i know and could not see what i saw a few things only kept me from my books and so careless was i of human society that i hardly noticed how my acquaintanceship was diminishing lower slowly transferred himself to london and was so successful that favored by the patronage of clarendon and the death of many serious rivals he soon became the most successful physician in the country was given a place at court and took to having not only a fine house but even a coach with his family crest on the doorfor which he was criticized greatly by those who thought it a presumptuous display it did him no harm however for the wealthy and wellborn like to be treated by those they consider of proper background on top of all this he even paid his sisters dowries and reestablished his family in dorset for which he was greatly admired but while he published his great work on the brain he never did any serious investigation again all that he considered truly noble the pursuit of knowledge through experiment he abandoned in search of worldly gain i alone i think understood the sorrow of this that what the world considered success was in lowers mind waste and a failure as for mr boyle he also went to london and i think came to oxford only twice more in his life a greater loss to the town could not be imagined for even though he was never of the university yet his presence illuminated it and brought it renown that fame he took with him when he left and in london he built on it incessantly with a neverending stream of ingenuity which has guaranteed that his name will live forever locke also left once he found himself a suitable sinecure and he too abandoned experiment for the world although in his case he became so involved in the most dangerous form of politics that his position is forever shaky he may one day achieve fame through his writings but he may equally become so swept up in events that he ends on the gallows if he dares return to these shores from his exile that remains to be seen mr ken as was inevitable gained the living that would have been dr groves had that man lived and thus was perhaps the only man to benefit from the tragedies i relate he became a good man of moderate religion and noted for his charity all this came as something of a surprise to me but occasionally i feel people rise up to match the dignity of their office rather than dragging its honor down to their own level it happens only rarely but often enough for reassurance and for the general good of all mankind he gave up playing the viol through being too busy with his duties and we must all thank those who gave him a bishopric for visiting this kindness on gods creation thurloe died a few years after and took his secrets to the graveexcept for those which i believe are among the papers he hid somewhere when he first felt illness coming upon him he was the strangest of men and i regret very much not knowing him i am convinced that he not only knew all the secrets of which i talk he was instrumental in guiding many of the governments actions in those days this may seem remarkable considering his devotion to cromwell but he served that great man because he brought order to our poor country and he worshiped order and civilized quiet far more than he reverenced men king or commoner dr wallis changed little but became ever more irascible and violent as his eyesight deteriorated apart from myself he is the only one i think who is still living the same life now as then publicationson english grammar on how to teach the mute to talk on the most obscure and incomprehensible forms of mathematics which no one but he and a halfdozen others in the world can understandflow from his pen and from his mouth comes a matching stream of criticism and abuse of those colleagues that he always believes to be his worthless rivals he has many admirers and no friends i have no doubt he continues his work for the government for his skills in decipherment are as great as ever now thurloe is dead and bennet has faded from power as all men of politics are bound to do only the old king knows the true secret of how wallis was deceived lied to and made a fool and myself for on my own and unaided i deciphered that letter which wallis intercepted on its way to cola in the low countries and laid bare the entire secret it contained it was not easy as i say i avoided even looking at it for a long time and did not seriously engage myself until well after the plague and the fire of london which filled oxford once again with poor frightened people trying to escape destruction i was frightened myself and it was only when i was certain from long inactivity that the matter was forgotten by all concerned that i removed the papers from my secret hiding place underneath the floorboards in my room and began to examine them that was only the start of course what dr wallis could have done in a few hours took me many weeks as i had to search out books in many places before i understood the principles involved the simple explanation which wallis gives in his manuscript would have saved me much pain and labor had i possessed it then but he was the one person i could not ask nonetheless i eventually grasped what was required through my own efforts the letter starting the code every twentyfive characters was not the next letter in the text nor the first letter of the next word but the next letter which had been underlined it sounds simple and thus explained it is soso simple a soldier on campaign could write it up in an instant given the right book that was the point of it and so once this marvelous discovery had come to my mind the whole secret of those letters was revealed to me after a mornings labor and it took many months more before i could believe what i had read i have destroyed everything as i promised only one copy of the translation i made is in existence and i will destroy that along with this manuscript of mine when i know my last illness is upon me i have asked mr tanner a young librarian and scholar of my acquaintance to arrange my estate on my death and this will be part of his duties he is a good and honest man who will keep his word let it not be said that i have broken faith with anyone or revealed anything which should be kept in the dark the letter written in code to andrea da cola by henry bennet secretary of state and the greatest joke of all employer of dr wallis read as follows after the usual introductory remarks the matter discussed in our recent correspondence is now come to fruition and his majesty has indicated his desire to be received as soon as possible into the church of rome this being in full conformity with his true faith and belief i am instructed that a priest who can be relied on be sent in the most total secrecy to fulfill his wishes and i very much hope you will take this task on yourself since you are already well known to us and trusted it will be understood that the greatest disaster would result should any of this become known rather a steady policy to loosen me ties which bind catholics will be adopted and hatred insensibly reduced over a period of years before any public acknowledgment can be made at present all that can be done will be done as a gesture of intent the king will try to persuade parliament to allow greater toleration of catholics and is confident that this first step will lead to many others before the reunification of the churches can proceed an emissary mr boulton will travel to rome once the reception is accomplished to discuss the manner and style which will be needed as for yourself dear father you may travel in peace to this land although no official protection can be offered you for obvious reasons we will endeavor to ensure your safekeeping and make sure your identity does not become known the king of england the supreme governor of the protestant church of england is and has been since a professed catholic acknowledged in secret and taking the rites of the catholic church his chief minister mr bennet was also a catholic and had as his secret policy the destruction of that national church he was sworn to protect far from a failed assassination attempt cola came to england to receive the king into the church of rome and i believe did so when he went to whitehall that evening with his holy oil and his crucifix and his relic and all along wallis had his obsessions and henry bennet listened and encouraged him so that not only did the story never emerge into the light of day it would be more obscured than ever i am sure but have no proof that it was bennet who ordered the destruction of walliss servant matthew to ensure the secret was guarded for i do not believe that cola could have done such a thinghe was not a man of violence while the cutting of throats had all the hallmarks of the man john cooth whom wallis himself employed on occasion if i published this letter or even delivered it in secret to someone like dr wallis the monarchy of this country would come to an end within a week consumed by civil war so great is the present public detestation of all things roman walliss wrath at the humiliation he suffered would be so great he would whip up a campaign of such vitriol that the protestants of england would soon be on the march baying for the blood of another king if i went to the king himself i could become a wealthy man living in comfort for the rest of my days for the value of this paperor its continued obscurityis beyond price i will not do so for how paltry all this is to a man who has seen such marvels and felt such grace as i have seen and felt i do believe and know that i have seen and heard and touched the incarnate god quietly out of sight of mankind divine forgiveness descends again and we are so blind we do not even realize what inexhaustible patience and love is ours thus it happened and has happened in every generation and will happen again in every generation to come that a beggar a cripple a child a madman a criminal or a woman is born lord of us all in entire obscurity and is spurned and ignored and killed by us to expiate our sins and i am commanded to tell no one and i will keep that one commandment this is the truth the one and only truth manifest complete and perfect beside it what importance have the dogma of priests the strength of kings the rigor of scholars or the ingenuity of our men of science mr tanner sorted all the papers some of which mr wood laid by in order to be burnt when he himself should give the sign when he himself found himself ready to leave this world he gave the sign and mr tanner burnt those papers which were put by for that intent thomas hearne account of anthony a wood in athenae oxoniensis rd
