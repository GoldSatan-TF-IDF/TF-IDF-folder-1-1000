harry turtledove owls to athens h n turteltaub is a pen name of harry turtledove a note on weights measures and money i have as best i could used in this novel the weights measures and coinages my characters would have used and encountered in their journey here are some approximate equivalents precise values would have varied from city to city further complicating things digit inch digits palm palms cubit cubit feet plethron feet stadion feet khalkoi obolos oboloi drakhma drakhmai mina about pound of silver minai talent as noted these are all approximate as a measure of how widely they could vary the talent in athens was about pounds while that of aigina less than thirty miles away was about pounds from the mens roomthe andronmenedemos son of philodemos watched the rain patter down in the courtyard of his fathers house it dripped from the red roofing tiles at the edge of the eaves the drips had scored little grooves in the dirt this was as heavy a rain as rhodes ever saw and heavier than usual for so late in winter springsailing seasonwould be here soon but the skies didnt seem to know it as if he were a caged animal menedemos rocked back and forth on his stool i want to be away he said to his cousin i want to be out and doing things he was a handsome man in his late twenties muscular and well built though a little below average height his face cleanshaven in the style alexander the great had set his cousin dipped his head in agreement though alexander was sixteen years dead sostratos son of lysistratos wore a full rather shaggy beard he was a few months older than menedemos and taller by a palm and a couple of digits sostratos didnt carry his height well though and thanks to his diffident manner usually followed menedemos lead menedemos could be a great many things but hardly ever diffident i wish it would clear out too sostratos said if we get to athens early enough we can see the plays at the greater dionysia like menedemos hed grown up speaking greek with the doric drawl of rhodes but hed studied philosophy at the lykeion in athens like those of many educated hellenes his accent these days had a heavy attic overlay tragedies satyr plays comedies he sighed longingly comedies nowadays are thinblooded things menedemos said give me aristophanes any time sostratos tugged at the front of his chiton as if wagging the enormous phallos a comic actor wore a lot of those jokes have got tired in the hundred years since aristophanes told them he said then why cant the new poets come up with anything better menedemos retorted this was an old argument between them i think they can sostratos said menandros for instance is a match for your precious aristophanes any day oh nonsense menedemos declared the old plays are the best ones maybe menandros will put on a new one at the dionysia sostratos said then youll see see what menedemos father asked coming up behind them hail uncle philodemos sostratos said how are you today not too bad thanks philodemos answered he was nearer sixty than fifty his beard and hair silver but he still held himself erect exercise at the gymnasion had helped there and hed kept most of his teeth which let him sound like a younger man if we get to athens in time for the greater dionysia menedemos may see what a fine comedian menandros is sostratos said ah philodemos voice encompassed the gray sky and the wet courtyard nobodys going anywhere as long as the weather stays like this put to sea with clouds and fogs and who knows what and youre asking to wreck your ship it should clear out soon father menedemos said i doubt it philodemos replied menedemos sighed had he said he expected bad weather to last he was sure his father would have contradicted him there too they never had got on well menedemos thought his father was a stubborn old stickinthemud for his part philodemos was convinced menedemos was a wild youth who had no respect for anything sometimes each seemed determined to prove the other right philodemos also had another excellent reason for not getting along with menedemos fortunately he didnt know he had it menedemos was determined that he never find out sostratos said regardless of whether we get to athens in time for the dionysia that is where we ought to take the aphroditethis year oh yes i agree philodemos said thats where youll get the best prices for the goods you brought back from phoenicia last season oh yes i agree the words echoed sourly inside menedemos head his father never would have been so quick to agree with him or to admit it if he did but philodemos gave his nephew the approval he withheld from his son of the two young men sostratos was usually the one who was cautious and sensible the one whos boring menedemos thought that wasnt wholly fair he knew as much the thought formed all the same voice sly he said youre as eager to go back to athens for the sake of your philosophical friends as you are for trade his cousin didnt even try to deny it which spoiled the jab sostratos just dipped his head in agreement and said of course i am and what about you why are you so eager to go to athens menedemos father asked him he answered his own question youre eager on account of all the loose women there thats whyall the bored faithless wives who dont care about their husbands or about doing whats proper youd sooner hunt piggies than hares any day with sardonic relish he used the slang for a female crotch singed free of hair menedemos gave back a bland smile spearing them is more fun that was slang too of an obvious sort sostratos snorted philodemos rolled his eyes he said joke all you want about adultery now but its landed you in more trouble than anybody since paris ran off with helen that wasnt fair menedemos father undoubtedly knew it wasnt fair but it held enough truth to make it sting menedemos did make a hobby of seducing other mens wives and he had found himself in trouble because of it trying to forestall any more of philodemos wit he said well we wont stop in halikarnassos on the way to athens there was a husband in halikarnassos who would kill him on sightwho almost had killed him a few years before menedemos hoped the fellow had perished when ptolemaios laid siege to the city a couple of years before he wished it had fallen and been sacked but no such luck antigonos older son demetrios had quickmarched an army up from the southeast and relieved it philodemos surely would have brought up halikarnassos if he hadnt even though he had his father leaped on it a terrible thing when our firm cant do business in a polis because you outraged the wife of one of the leading citizens she wasnt outraged by zeus menedemos said she loved every minute of it her husband on the other hand no point in quarreling about it now sostratos did his best to make peace we cant change it its over its done no man can step into the same river twice that was a philosophical tagline menedemos knew as much even if hed had less education than his cousin if philodemos knew he didnt care i want to keep him from jumping into this river of adultery again he said then he pointed at sostratos and you too as a matter of fact sostratos winced in ioudaia the summer before hed bedded an innkeepers wife now he was tarred with the same brush as menedemosand menedemos father wasnt shy about using that brush to paint him black sir thats over and done too sostratos said which means what philodemos asked that you wont do it anymore i hope thats what it means by the gods i hope it does too sostratos said hed enjoyed his little foray into adultery much less than menedemos enjoyed his affairs i hope so but who can know for certain the futures a book that hasnt yet been unrolled philodemos bristled he wanted promises not hesitation before he could say anything though someone knocked on the door a house slave hurried over to see who it was a moment later the man came back to the andron and spoke to philodemos its your friend xanthos master sostratos leaped off the stool where hed been sitting well id better be getting back to my fathers house he said xanthos was honest and sincere and friendlyand deadly dull never a man to use a word when an oration would do bring him in bryaxis philodemos said bring him in out of the rain and fetch him some wine youll stay and talk with him wont you son he turned to menedemos with appeal in his eyes stay and listen to him you mean menedemos said as the slave and sostratosheaded for the door now he had his chance to take revenge on his father for giving him a hard time about his habitshad it and used it no thank you sir i have some things i need to do upstairs and im afraid they wont keep im sure xanthos will have a great manya very great manyinteresting things to say farewell he left the mens chamber as bryaxis brought xanthos toward it the other merchant plump and grayhaired waved to him he waved backand kept walking to the wooden stairway that would let him escape behind him he heard xanthos drone out a greeting to his father and philodemos valiantly polite reply chuckling menedemos went on up the stairs behind the closed doors of the womens quarters his fathers second wife and a slave woman were making cloth from wool the frame of the loom creaked and rattled as baukis worked menedemos had always found it impossible to think of her as his stepmother how could he when she was ten or eleven years younger than he was she said something to the slave who answered the closed door muffled sounds so that menedemos could hear voices but not words both women laughed menedemos wondered what sort of womens gossip had amused them he went on to his own room it held a bed a stool and a chest of drawers at the moment with the shutters closed against the rain it was dark and gloomy and dull menedemos didnt care anything including a dull gloomy roomwas better than staying in the andron and listening to xanthos rehearse a speech he was going to give in the assembly or worse yet repeat a speech hed already given there after a while the rising and falling cadences of xanthos rather froggy baritone came from downstairs menedemos smiled to himself sure enough his fathers friend was in full rhetorical flight menedemos wondered how long his father would have to endure the drivel xanthos could go on for a couple of hours without noticing he was making people around him wish they were dead or he was dead or everyone was dead instead of dying menedemos fell asleep when he woke up xanthos was still going on menedemos yawned stretched and chuckled softly philodemos couldnt match him there no matter how much he might want to if he started to snore and fell off his stool down there in the andron xanthos might notice on the other hand he might be so carried away with his own eloquence that he didnt still it was a chance a polite man wouldnt take and philodemos was polite especially to everyone but his son menedemos chuckled again now his father was paying the price for his good manners when sostratos got out of bed and opened the shutters he blinked in delighted surprise yesterdays rain clouds had blown away the sky was a brilliant velvety dark blue shading toward pink in the east something flew by overhead by its skittering path through the air probably a bat returning to wherever it would hide during daylight hours sostratos went back to his bed and pulled the chamber pot out from under it after hed used the pot he dumped it out the window into the street below this early in the day he didnt have to worry about splashing passersby with its contents he stuck the pot under the bed once more put on his chiton and went downstairs for breakfast his father was already sitting out in the courtyard with a chunk of bread a plate of olive oil into which to dip the bread and a cup of unwatered wine hail son lysistratos said he was philodemos younger brother and a good deal more easygoing than menedemos father how are you today not bad thanks sostratos answered yourself tolerable tolerable his father said my bones ache when i get up in the morning but that comes of living as long as i have he smiled if i werent alive i dont suppose id ache at all well no sostratos said he went into the kitchen and came out with a breakfast identical to his fathers he was just sitting down beside lysistratos when a slave girl emerged yawning from her little room hail threissa hail young master she replied in accented greek as her name suggested she came from thrace she was redhaired and snubnosed a few years younger than sostratos himself she yawned again then went to get her own breakfast lysistratos wasnt a slaveowner who measured out his slaves rations to the last grain of barley threissa would eat about what he and his son had had sostratos and lysistratos both followed her with their eyes lysistratos always contented himself with watching her a man who slept with a slave girl in his own house was asking for trouble with his wife sostratos took her up to his room every now and again had she shown any sign of enjoying his attentions rather than simply enduring them as a slave had to do he would have made love to her more often the first rays of the sun touched the roof tiles a few birds began to sing more would come to rhodes later as they returned from the south lysistratos said i wonder how long this weather will hold if it stays good youll be able to put to sea before long i hope so sostratos exclaimed the thought of sailing for athens so excited him he hardly noticed threissa coming out of the kitchen with bread and wine his father chuckled athens is your beloved sure enough ive never said otherwise sostratos replied he laughed mostly at himself i couldnt very well could inot if i wanted to tell the truth anyhow i was sorry to have to bring you home from the lykeion as soon as i did lysistratos said we needed a good toikharkhos though and youre the one in the family with far and away the best head for figures no thats menedemosor arent you talking about women sostratos asked innocently his father rolled his eyes you know im not and you know im right too with a sigh sostratos dipped his head he was the one best suited to keeping track of the cargo a ship carried and of how much money to the obolos every item brought he did know as much he was a good bargainer too though his cousin might have been even better all the same he sighed again all the same he wished he could have gone right on studying in athens some men were lucky enough and rich enoughto be able to pursue the love of wisdom their whole lives long he wasnt hed had to come back to rhodes to help his family and make his own way in the world though five years had passed since that sorry day he still felt as if hed torn his heart out and left it behind when he sailed away from peiraieus most of him still longed to return the rest for the rest it was too late hed quoted herakleitos the day before at uncle philodemos house the ionian philosopher had surely been right you couldnt step into the same river twice when you went back in it wasnt the same river any more and im not the same any more either sostratos thought knowledge for its own sake did still matter to him it mattered very much he hoped it would for the rest of his life one day he wanted to write a history of his times to rival those of herodotos and thoukydides but he was more practical more hardheaded than the weeping gangling young man whod so unwillingly come back to rhodes when lysistratos summoned him hed been dealing with trade goods and money these past few years and theyd inevitably left their mark on the way his mind worked he said do you know father theres a bit of me that dreads going back to athens i never would have imagined that i can see why lysistratos answered if youre very much in love with a hetaira when youre a young man do you really want to see her again twenty years later do you want to find out shes got fat and gone gray and lost a front tooth wouldnt you rather recall the beauty you knew once upon a time thats it sostratos agreed thats exactly it how can athens live up to the way i remember her she probably wont his father said but it isnt the citys fault cities dont usually change that much not in a few years people are the ones who change yes i was thinking the same thing sostratos didnt think the changes hed seen in himself were necessarily for the better but saw no point in mentioning that to lysistratos he feared his father wouldnt have agreed with him a sparrow fluttered down into the courtyard sostratos tossed it a scrap of bread the little bird hopped over cocked its head to one side as it examined the morsel and then pecked at it satisfied it snapped it up and flew away you should have put some wine out for it too lysistratos said amusement in his voice put some wine out for what sostratos mother asked as she came out into the courtyard oh good day timokrate lysistratos said sostratos gave a sparrow some crumbs for breakfast and i was saying it should have had wine too it probably wouldnt have been able to fly straight if it had timokrate said she was in her early forties gray beginning to streak her brown hair smiling at sostratos she said you always did like to feed the birds well why not mother no reason at all she said walking toward the kitchen its just funny how you havent changed much through the years oh that made sostratos scratch his head here hed been thinking he was a different man from the one whod left athens and his mother still saw him as the same little boy whod played in this courtyard back when alexander the great was alive which of them was right timokrate came out with bread and wine too smiling at her son and her husband she took her breakfast back upstairs to eat in the womens quarters erinna sostratos younger sister had always chafed under the restrictions hellenic custom placed on respectable women she wanted to be out and doing things not shut away inside a house his mother seemed perfectly content to stay indoors most of the time people are different sostratos thought with profound unoriginality erinna had lived with her second husband damonax for the past year her first had died after theyd been married only three years she wouldnt be going out of his house for a while anyhow their little boy polydoros was just over a month old sostratos said im glad erinna had a boy so am i lysistratos dipped his head both because its better to have a boy and because his voice trailed away sostratos finished the thought because damonax might have exposed it if it were a girl yes his father dipped his head again whether or not to rear a baby is a husbands privilege i know but erinna would have been very unhappy if damonax had decided not to raise it sostratos said when his sister came back to live at the family home after losing her first husband shed fretted that she would never remarry and never have the chance to bear children to have a child and then lose it at a husbands whim that would have been cruelly hard on the whole your brotherinlaw seems a pretty reasonable fellow lysistratos said on the whole yes sostratos said when it comes to olive oil no how many times do we have to tell him were not going to fill the aphroditeto the gunwales with the stuff and haul it to athens i thought you and uncle philodemos had made him understand why we cant do it oh we did his father answered but he cant be reasonableor what we think of as reasonableabout that hes got his own familys interests to worry about too you know they still arent all the way out of debt and olive oil is what theyve got to sell and so he sighed and shrugged its good oil ive never said its not good oil but its not the right cargo for a merchant galley not with the overhead costs weve got because of all the rowers we need sostratos sighed too i almost wish we hadnt done so well with it last sailing season then damonax could really see why we dont want anything more to do with it especially not going to athens lysistratos said especially not going to athens sostratos agreed i cant imagine a worse place in the world to try to bring in olive oil they stopped growing grain there a couple of hundred years ago by the gods so they could plant more olive trees they export oil they dont import it zeus on olympos father at the panathenaic games they give the winners amphorai of olive oiltheir own olive oil we both know that his father began damonax knows it too sostratos said he studied at the lykeion in athens before i got there how can he help knowing it lysistratos let out a sad little chuckle well son when someone marries into the family you dont just get the good you get all the problems he brings with him too and damonax and his family probably think of us as a bunch of stingy whoresons sostratos dipped his head thats true but theres a difference were right he knew he was being silly so did his father they both laughed but it wasnt as if he didnt mean it too two days of bright sunshine in a row made menedemos want to rush down to the great harbor to make sure the aphroditewas fully laden and ready to put to sea his father said you dont want to go out too early you know better to wait a few extra days than to get caught by the last big blow of winter but others will be setting sail now menedemos protested i dont want them to get the jump on me some skippers always set sail sooner than they should philodemos said a lot of the time they end up paying for it menedemos fumed watching him fume his father smiled a thin smile and added im going down to the agora to find out what the news is i expect you to be here when i get back why dont you just hire a pedagogue to take me here and there the way you did when i was seven years old menedemos said bitterly his father took no notice of that he hadnt really expected that philodemos would but the look of smug satisfaction on his fathers face when he left for the market square stung like sweat dripping onto a raw sore fuming still menedemos went into the kitchen sikon the cook would listen to him grumble or give him something tasty to make him forget about grumbling but sikon wasnt there hed probably gone to the agora too or to the harborside fish markets to see what he could bring home for the evenings supper barley porridge still simmered above a low fire menedemos had eaten some for breakfast hed hoped for something better now tunny or octopus perhaps those failing he dipped out another bowl of porridge his father would have complained about his eating at midmorning too but fathers not here he thought and ate the porridge bland stuff tasted better for being illicit splashes that had nothing to do with rain greeted his ears when he went back out into the courtyard at the direction of philodemos second wife a slave poured water from a hydria onto the flowers and herbs in the garden there careful now baukis told him dont miss the marjoram i wont mistress the slave turned the stream from the big heavy water jug where she pointed thats better she said and dipped her head when she looked up again she saw menedemos she smiled hail hail he answered gravely how are you well enough glad of this sunshine baukis said it is nice isnt it menedemos agreed nothings commonplaces but he could look at her while they talked here inside her own household she went unveiled of course she was no great beauty but except for front teeth that stuck out pretty enoughand at seventeen any woman seemed fresh and glowing and ripe her figure had certainly ripened these past few years when shed wed philodemos shed been hardly more than a girl with hardly more than a girls shape no more will you be sailing soon she asked before long anyhow menedemos said sostratos wants to get to athens as fast as he can and i dont blame him well put to sea as soon as father decides the weathers likely to hold i hope you have good fortune baukis watched his face as he watched hersas was only polite when two people talked if her gaze traveled the length of him as his now and then paused at her rounded bosom or at the sweet flare of her hips if her gaze swung so it was only in the most casual way a way on which for instance the patient slave with the hydria could not remark thanks menedemos replied his glances were every bit as circumspect philodemos raved because he made adultery a game but he knew adultery with his fathers young wife would be could be no game hed realized he might want her not long after his father wed her only since the autumn before had he known she might want him too theyd kissed only once theyd never done more than kiss whatever else baukis wanted she also wanted to make menedemos father a good wife lying with menedemos might not merely cause scandal it might cause murder since she couldnt speak of love she spoke of travel athens must be a wonderful place sostratos knows it better than i do its his second home menedemos said the hydria gurgled dry the slave sent baukis a look of appeal she tossed her head and tapped her sandaled foot on the ground go fill it again lydos she said you can see some of the plants here still need more water with the rains lately the cisterns nice and full with the rains lately the plants shouldnt need all that much water lydos said theyll dry up if you dont keep them moist baukis said sharply and if you dont dry up ill find something for you to do that youll like a lot less than watering the garden muttering to himself in a language that wasnt greek the slave shouldered the hydria and carried it back toward the cistern had it been late summer with the cistern dry baukis would have sent a slave woman to the well a few blocks away menedemos laughed to himself who could guess when the woman would have come back from the well men talked in the market square women gossiped around the wellhead for that matter who could guess when lydos would come back from the cisternand it was only at the rear of the house by the way he dragged his feet going there he was in no hurry to get on with his work but then what slave ever was in a hurry except maybe to go out and get drunk on a festival day menedemos wasnt about to rush him either now he could gaze his fill at baukis provided he didnt do it too openly they still werent alone as if to prove that sikon the cook came into the house his face a thundercloudshopping for fish must not have gone well he stormed into the kitchen and made a racket as he started on the days baking maybe he was working out his anger maybe he thought that the noisier he was the busier everybody would think he was that was another slave trick old as time the doorman was puttering around too and the slave women upstairs in a household full of slaves you could never count on being alone for very long baukis took not quite half a step toward menedemos then she stopped a ruefuland more than a little frightenedsmile on her face she knew the risks of living in a house full of slaves as well as he did they were lucky they hadnt been found out the one time their lips did touch we cant she mouthed silently theyd been saying that to each other ever since discovering they both wanted to iknow menedemos mouthed back theyd been saying that too each trying to convince the other both trying to convince themselves the past two springs when menedemos had known he longed for baukis but hadnt known they shared a longing hed wanted to flee rhodes as soon as he could now now at least part of him wished he could stay and wait for a chance that might never come a chance he might not take even if it did come hellenes agreed love was a mad dangerous passion what to do if one fell into it anyhow on that there was no agreement he started to mouth i love you but he couldnt even do that here came lydos back with the water jug he was still grumbling baukis had had her problems with the house slaves and especially with the cook but she was wise enough to affect not to notice this all she said was oh goodthat didnt take too long and showed him the plants that still needed watering as he bent to moisten the dirt around them baukis shot menedemos another glance full of harried amusement and menedemos could only dip his head had he fallen in love with any other wife in all of rhodes for a long time hed tried to make himself believe this hadnt happened life would have been much easiermuch safer tooif it hadnt but the world was what it was not what he wished it would be lydos second jar of water ran dry he looked up at baukis in mute appeal the garden was almost done she knew exactly what he was thinking go get enough water to finish the job she said oh by the gods lydos turned to menedemos in appeal young master menedemos tossed his head i can see the corner thats still dry he said before lydos could go any further my fathers wife is right if youre going to do something do it properly thats a lesson you learn at seaor if you dont you pay for it lydos let out a theatrical groan as if menedemos had just ordered him sold to the mines when that failed to soften either menedemos heart or baukis he carried the hydria away again moving like an old old man whose joints pained him baukis snorted it must be terrible for a man to be made into a slave yes it is menedemos looked right at her as if to say she had made him into hers she spent a lot of time indoors which kept her skin fair he watched enchanted the flush that rose from her neck to her cheeks to her forehead stop that she mouthed she was right of course the more such foolish things he did the likelier someone would notice his father which would be the worst disaster of all or a slave who might tell his father or extort who could guess what by threatening to tell or even sostratos whod puzzled over why menedemos had been so eager to get away from rhodes the past couple of sailing seasons as baukis had menedemos snorted his cousin sometimes thought too much for his own good a more perceptive man one who felt more and perhaps thought a little less might well have realized what was wrong with menedemos or maybe sostratos needed to fall in love himself before he could recognize the symptoms in others they werentor menedemos hoped they werentsomething that could be known by reason alone he stole another glance at baukis and caught her stealing a glance at him their eyes met for a heartbeat then jerked away hers went to the stairway leading up to the second story his to the stone bench in the courtyard he pointed looktheres a wall lizard soaking up the sun he thinks spring is here the motion of his arm made the grayishbrown lizard dash to the edge of the bench leap off and disappear amongst the plants in the garden baukis said im glad to see it they eat insects have you ever seen one with a grasshopper in its mouth oh yes menedemos dipped his head talk of lizards was safe enough when lydos returned with the hydria he couldnt have noticed anything the least improper a sour expression on his face the slave emptied the jar not far from where the little animal had taken shelter it fled again this time across the courtyard it vanished into a crack in the mudbrick inner wall of the house menedemos laughed poor thing must have thought deukalions flood was sweeping down on it yes baukis gave lydos a severe look you dont need to drown the plants you know sorry he sounded anything but be more careful next time baukis told him his nod was so impatient so perfunctory that menedemos would have called him on it if baukis hadnt but she did be more careful lydos or you will be sorry that got through yes mistress ill remember the slave said and this time menedemos believed him see that you do because ill remember too baukis said now go on lydos hurried away carrying the hydria you handled that very well menedemos said oh slaves arent so hard i was dealing with slaves before i was married too you know baukis said but then she checked herself most slaves arent so hard on the other hand theres sikon yes for a moment menedemos left it at that baukis and sikon had feuded ever since she came to philodemos house she wanted to be a good household manager and was convinced he was trying to bankrupt the place with the fancy fish he bought he wanted to turn out the best suppers he could and was convinced she wanted everyone in the house to live on barley porridge beans and salt fish the truth as usual lay somewhere in betweenor so menedemos thought anyhow he said cooks are a law unto themselves you know really i never would have noticed baukis said tartly but then she relented i suppose it is better not to be quarreling with him all the time theyd come to a tentative truce the autumn before it had already held longer than menedemos had expected he said im glad youre not squabbling anymore that gave him another excuse to smile at baukis it gave her another excuse to smile back and no one who saw them or listened to them could have noted anything out of the ordinary sostratos held his nephew with exaggerated care as if afraid polydoros were about to leap from his arms and precipitate himself headfirst onto the dirt of the courtyard at damonaxs house for all his care both erinna and a wet nurse hovered close by ready to snatch the baby out of his inexperienced hands trying to reassure them that he had some idea what he was doing he said he sure looks a lot better than he did right after he was born his sister scowled what was wrong with him right after he was born she demanded in irate tones he looked just fine ill have you know the wet nurse added all right all right fine i didnt mean anything by it sostratos said hastily the women relaxed sostratos looked down at polydoros the baby was a healthy pink now not the reddishpurple color hed been his head had been almost coneshaped it was much rounder now and getting more so each time sostratos saw him even his expression seemed more alert less confused than it had when he first came into the world some things hadnt changed though sostratos suddenly realized the cloths around the babys middle were moist he thrust polydoros at the wet nurse and wiped his hands on his chiton there there the woman told the baby well take care of that dont you worry about a thing she carried him away when she came back she sat down on a bench slipped her chiton down from one shoulder and gave polydoros her breast sostratos watched the baby suck as interested in the process as he was in the bare breast he also listened to his nephew nursing he hadnt realized it could be so noisy he could hear every gulp polydoros took then the baby swallowed wrong and choked the wet nurse took him away from the breast and held him up against her shoulder patting him on the back till he belched a surprisingly large surprisingly deep sound then she brought him down and let him nurse some more youll be sailing soon wont you erinna asked what when sostratos concentrated on something he did so to the exclusion of everything else around him he had to pause and make himself remember what his sister had said before he could dip his head and answer yes very soon especially if the weather stays fine like this athens he couldnt hold the excitement from his voice athens erinna sounded resignedor was it merely wistful for her leaving her husbands house was an adventure sailing off to another city when shed come back to lysistratos household after losing her first husband shed listened with endless fascination as sostratos told her stories of the distant places hed seen with the circumscribed lives respectable women led among the hellenes listening was all she could do she would never see distant places herself sostratos eyed her with some concern like him shed always been on the lean side now though she still kept the flesh shed put on while carrying polydoros to his eye it didnt suit her frame it seemed added on not a natural part of her how are you my dear he asked hoping his worry didnt show tired she answered at once after you have a baby you feel as though someones dropped a wall on you i dont think you can help it oh yes the wet nurse dipped her head thats true by the gods what what is it like having a baby i mean sostratos asked hesitantly as they often did curiosity and decorum warred within him this time curiosity won not that it got him much erinna only laughed its not like anything she said its the hardest thing ive ever done i think its the hardest thing anyone can do oh yes the wet nurse said again and then softly whats it like men she didnt have to worry about keeping sostratos sweet i cant very well know unless i ask can i he said stung by the scorn in her voice if he thought his question would get him less he rapidly found himself wrong men the wet nurse said again this time not bothering to hold her voice down what you dont understand is you cant know even if you do ask gorgias right im afraid erinna sounded sad she knew of sostratos unrelenting itch to find out whatever he could sad or not though she tossed her head here unless you had a baby yourself you couldnt know what it was like youre not equipped for it that made the wet nursegorgiagiggle it made sostratos angry at least for a moment but he began then he spread his hands in defeat no i suppose not any more than you can understand what growing a beard is like he scratched his own hairy chin most hellenes of his generation menedemos among them shaved their faces as alexander had done sostratos thought his beard made him look like a philosopher maybe he was right someone rapped on the front door erinna said thats damonaxi know his knock by the way one of the house slaves hurried to the entrance he recognized his masters knock too the door scraped as it turned on pivots set into the floor and the lintel above the house slave spoke to damonax in a voice too low for sostratos to make out what he said he didnt need to have studied logic to figure out what it must have been though for damonax replied he is well good ive been meaning to talk with him for the past few days anyhow erinnas husband strode into the courtyard he was a handsome man of above average height though not so tall as sostratos unlike his brotherinlaw he bore himself with the air of a man who knew he was somebody his chiton was of fine soft white wool a gold ring on the index finger of his right hand flashed in the sun sostratos smiled to himself damonax looked and acted like a rich man as befitted one whose wealth lay in land but sostratos knew whose family was really better off hail damonax said with a smile that showed off the teeth he took fastidious pains to keep white how are you today fine thanks sostratos held out his hand and you couldnt be better damonax clasped it a firm manly grip like sostratos hed studied at the lykeion also like sostratos he flavored the doric dialect of rhodes with a strong attic accent what do you think of your nephew these days thats obvious o best one sostratos answered looking toward polydoros whod fallen asleep in gorgias arms hell have the strength and beauty of divine akhilleus and the wit of resourceful odysseus erinna sent sostratos a sharp glance she knew irony when she heard it damonax didnt or didnt always he complacently dipped his head and said yes i think so too he looked around havent they given you any wine no olives or figs to munch on what is this place coming to not wanting either his sister or damonaxs slaves to get in trouble sostratos spoke quickly ive been so busy admiring your son and talking with erinna i didnt even notice kind of you to say such a thing best one but really there are standards damonax said come into the andron with me why dont you and well set you to rights sostratos would rather have gone on talking with erinna of whom he was fond than gone with his brotherinlaw he had a pretty good idea why damonax wanted to talk with him and didnt anticipate a happy result but he couldnt very well say no not without a shocking breach of manners swallowing a sigh he said lead on and ill follow at damonaxs heels he stepped up into the mens chamber as in most houses it was raised a step above the level of the courtyard and the other groundfloor rooms no sooner had he perched on a stool than the slave whod let damonax into the house brought wine and olives damonax and sostratos both poured a little wine on the floor as an offering to dionysos when sostratos drank he raised an eyebrow my dear fellow this cant be mixed any weaker than one to one thats potent even at a symposion but in the morning do you want your slaves to have to carry me home what would people say one cup wont send you raging through the streets looking for women to ravish like a satyr damonax said easily arent you thinking of menedemos but though that got to the tip of sostratos tongue he didnt say it he had more reasons to be loyal to his cousin than to his brotherinlaw he took a cautious sip from the cupa big deep piece of earthenware in the spartan style not one of the shallow graceful twohandled kylikes that didnt hold nearly so much the wine is very nice he admitted wheres it from damonaxs chuckle was selfdeprecating just a local vintage im afraid rhodes made good wine good enough to export but no one would confuse even her best with what the vintners of khios or lesbos or thasos turned out that damonax served a rhodian wine said his familys fortunes had declined that he served a good rhodian wine said either that they hadnt declined too far or that he still had good taste even if he needed to be more careful about indulging it these days sostratos ate an olive spitting the pit onto the floor of the andron he said these are tasty too glad you like them my dear damonax replied theyre from the family farm oh a pestilence sostratos thought ive given him an opening but damonax didnt charge right into the breach like a soldier entering a besieged city instead with another of his charming smiles he asked have you ever been out to the farm why no o best one i never have sostratos said you must visit one day damonax said do you good to see theres life on the land as well as here in the bustling polis its in the western part of the island you know between ialysos and kameiros not far from the valley of the butterflies ah sostratos pricked up his ears now that i would like to see one of these days farm life interested him very little for better or worse he was a creature of the polis of the agora he was sure he would go mad in short order with only the same handful of faces to see and to talk to month after month year after year with news filtering in long after it was fresh if it ever came at all an interesting natural phenomenon on the other hand damonax smiled and dipped his head its quite something myriad upon myriad of butterflies perching in the valley through the heat of summer they cover the rocks especially by the waterfall like one of those carpets the persians lay on the floor the summer sostratos sighed its also the sailing season you know im likely to be away from rhodes they dont disperse over the island till the fall rains start and youre usually home by then damonax said why dont you pay me a call when you get back from athens that should be just about oliveharvest time too the oil from the first ones picked is always the best you know and if youre there to dip a barley roll into it when it comes out of the last settling pit he smiled again a voluptuarys smile you tempt me sostratos said good i mean to damonax answered the invitation is open believe me and when you see the oil pressed from the olives when you taste it before it even goes into the amphora till then you dont know what oil can be rhodian wine may not be of the very finest but rhodian oil is by the gods and we make some of the best of any farm on the island now we come down to it sostratos thought unhappily no one has ever said you didnt o marvelous one he said his brotherinlaw gave him a sour look as any educated man would have done sokrates had been fond of using that salutation when he felt sarcastic so that marvelous meant something like marvelously foolish damonax went on your family has been most unreasonable about taking some of my olive oil aboard the aphrodite this sailing season sostratos didnt like quarrels he especially didnt like quarrels with people with whom he had marriage ties but he also didnt like problems with trade and trade came first sighing he said weve been over this ground before you knowmore than once in factand you can pour lots of strong wine down my throat but you still wont seduce me if youd only be reasonable damonax said no sostratos tossed his head im afraid youre the one whos being unreasonable not me or my father or uncle or cousin you do know where the akatos is going this spring athens of course damonax replied thats right now sostratos dipped his head in agreement and since you studied there the same as i did youll have heard the phrase owls to athens too wont you he waited when damonax didnt answer right away his voice got sharper wont you well yes damonax said and youll also know what it means isnt that so his brotherinlaw flushed angrily dont play the game of elenkhos with me youre not sokrates by the dog of egypt all right my dear fine if you want me to spell it out for you i will alphabetagamma sostratos let out an angry exhalation of his own owls to athens means taking something someplace where they dont need it athens doesnt need owls because she already stamps them on her coins and athens doesnt need imported olive oil because attica already makes more of it than any other district in hellas athens imports grain so she can grow more olives you know that too you know it but you dont want to think about it what a lover of wisdom that makes you my family needs the silver the oil would bring damonax said its very fine oilyou know that i also know i havent a chance of selling it in athens no matter how fine it is theyre glutted with what they make themselves sostratos snapped and i know its not a proper cargo for a merchant galley anyhownot enough profit even if it does sell he held up a hand dont tell me about last season either yes we made money but we would have made more with other cargo we couldnt carry because of your big bulky amphorai full of oil what am i supposed to do then damonax demanded what weve been telling you all along put it in a round ship where the crew is small and the overhead is low sell it someplace where they dont grow so much on their ownkos maybe or khios or the cities up along the thracian coast where the weathers cooler and they dont always get good crops his brotherinlaw pooched out his lower lip and looked sullen you have no family feeling whatsoever on the contrary sostratos tossed his head my first loyalty is to my father my next loyalty is to uncle philodemos and menedemos if the only way i can help you is by hurting themand incidentally myselfwhat would you have me do go to the crows damonax said sostratos got to his feet good day he said and strode out of the andron erinna knew something was wrong where are you going she called to sostratos as he stalked across the courtyard home he pushed past a startled slave and out the front door to damonaxs house menedemos no doubt would have slammed it in his wake instead sostratos closed it as quietly as he could as far as he was concerned damonax was the one in the wrong and he wanted to do nothing to put himself there with his brotherinlawor his sister that didnt keep him from seething as he stormed away oh no on the contrary menedemos spent as much time as he could outside his fathers house for one thing that kept him and philodemos from locking horns for another it eliminated temptation or at least the chance to do anything about temptation and for a third he was a man who liked crowds and noise and excitement going to the agora was a lot more fun than sitting around watching flowers begin to bloom potters and woodcarvers and leatherworkers cried their wares from stalls that had sometimes been in their families for generations jewelers showed off brass bracelets that gleamed like gold beadwork necklaces and silver rings farmers in from the countryside offered up grain and olive oil olives in brine and vinegar cabbages and lettuces beets and mushrooms eggs from ducks and hens a dentist reached into a mans mouth with iron forceps to pull a rotted tooth while a crowd gathered round to watch and point and call advice hearing the victim groan menedemos thanked the gods his own teeth were sound a mountebank strolled through the crowd juggling a stream of cups and balls and knives every so often someone would throw him an obolos he caught the little silver coins without losing control of everything he kept in the air a grotesquely overmuscled strong man lifted a fellow of ordinary size over his head and tossed him about as if he weighed nothing at all an artist of sorts perched on a stool in front of a patch of smoothraked sand for an obolos he would use a long stylus to sketch a mans portrait in the sand menedemos watched him work his strokes were quick and sure he caught a mans essence with a minimum of wasted motion each portrait remained to be admired till the next customer gave him some silver here menedemos took an obolos out of his mouth and handed it to the artist do me certainly o best one after popping the coin into his own mouth the man smoothed the sand once more the fellow whose portrait had been there muttered under his breath his picture hadnt lasted long a few lines delineated menedemos sharp chin his straight nose and strong cheekbones the eyebrows that were almost too bushy and the hairline that had retreated perhaps a digits width at each temple after a couple of minutes the sketch artist looked up here you are my friend you looks like me agreed menedemos who had often seen his image in a mirror of polished bronze a poor man from the countryside though might have no true idea what he looked like till this fellow showed him as menedemos turned away someone just coming up peered at his portrait and said theres a goodlooking fellow he preened even though he was no longer a youth for suitors to pursue he never got tired of praise not far away half a dozen men were arguing about what this years campaigning season would likely bring in the wars among alexander s marshals mark my words someone will triumph over all the rest a grayhaired man declared i dont know about that a younger fellow said as soon as one of those polluted macedonians looks like hes getting on top the others gang up on him and pull him back down again that sort of thing can go on for a long time menedemos walked over to join them saying its already gone on for a long time alexander s been deadwhatsixteen years now the men who were talking shifted a little to give him room if a man couldnt hash things out with his fellow citizens in the agora he couldnt do it anywhere a stocky fellow of about menedemos age whose scars said hed fought as a mercenary dipped his head thats right he said sixteen years and weve still got antigonos and ptolemaios and lysimakhos and kassandros in the field against each other he sounded cheerfulas long as the marshals brawled mercenaries would never lack for work and seleukos somebody else said dont forget seleukos way off in the east antigonos tried to squash him a couple of years ago but he couldnt do it youre right menedemos said hes like a reveler who hears a symposion and invites himself in i think the other four will have to keep an eye on him now that hes inside the andron or hell walk off with the furniture anybody old oneeye cant beat is someone to keep an eye on sure enough said the man who looked like a mercenary alexander showed the world one man could lead the hellenes and the macedonians too the grayhaired fellow said now that hes proved it can be done the marshals will keep banging away till only ones left standing the way pankratiasts do at the olympic games theyll trythats certain enough menedemos said but they dont fight the way pankratiasts do its not one against one they make treaties with one anotherthey make em and then they break em for one man to win hed have to defeat all the others at once and nobodys managed it yet which probably means it cant be done said the younger man whod first disagreed with the older one dont you see that xenomenes no the man with gray hair tossed his head fifty years ago you would have told me nobody could ever rule all the hellenes then philip of macedon went and did it and alexander held on to them afterwards so i dont see why the same shouldnt hold true here that produced a thoughtful silence menedemos wondered what sostratos would have had to say about it his cousin was fond of such arguments too but he stubbornly stuck to his own view maybe it can happen but that doesnt mean its likely to ha xenomenes said tell it to antigonos not me hes the one the rest worry about the mostand they need to ptolemaios stung him a couple of years ago taking away the southern coast of anatolia the man who looked like a mercenary said but hes still got phoenicia and a lot of the hellenic cities along the west coast of anatolia menedemos said that means he can still build up his navyand he hires pirates the same as he hires men to fight on land all the rhodians muttered at that their polis lived by trade they hated pirates and used their navy to try to keep them down menedemos had fought them on each of his last two voyages he had no use for a man who abetted them neither did any of the others one of them said if he hires pirates hes liable to hire them against us one fine day unless we do just what he tells us menedemos pulled at the neckline of his tunic and spat into his bosom to turn aside the evil omen three other rhodians did the same thing mournfully xenomenes said all we want to do is stay free and autonomouswell really free and autonomous a lot of poleis that called themselves by those two proud names were free to do whatever the marshal controlling them said and autonomous of the rest of the marshals such was the level to which hellenic independence had sunk in the past generation even rhodes had briefly had a macedonian garrison but had expelled it after alexander died now she truly was free and autonomous able to do business with ptolemaios and antigonos alikeand with the other more distant marshals as well xenomenes went on how can we hope to keep our freedom though if one of the macedonians triumphs over the rest hed swallow us up the same as hed swallow everything and everybody else but youre still assuming something you havent shown that one marshal could beat all the rest menedemos said until you show that its like worrying about what would happen if an elephant fell out of the sky without showing how an elephant could fly in the first place the older man gave him a nasty look several of the other rhodians laughed which only made xenomenes more irate they argued about the marshals and whatever else came to mind for the next couple of hours every now and then someone new would join the circle as menedemos had or one of the men already there would wander off to do something else menedemos couldnt think of a better way to pass the timeunless it was keeping company with a woman of course when he finally went back to his house his father was waiting in the andron menedemos politely dipped his head and walked toward the stairs he didnt feel like another argument now but when philodemos waved in a peremptory way he had no choice but to stop and go over and ask what is it father how soon can the aphroditesail philodemos rapped out menedemos dug a finger into his ear wondering if hed heard straight how soon can she sail he echoed half in disbelief thats what i said isnt it his father replied irritably yes sir menedemos frowned in thought loading her and rounding up a crew wont take more than a day or two wouldnt even be that long if we didnt need so many rowers but most of them will be men whove pulled an oar in her before go ahead and get ready then philodemos said the sooner the better cant be too soon by poseidon s beard wait menedemos held up a hand just a couple of days ago you were complaining i wanted to go out too early to suit you why have you changed your mind all of a sudden before philodemos could answer a slave brought him a cup of wine he poured out a small libation then drained the cup ahh he said wiping his mouth on his arm and then ill tell you what made me change my mind i just had another session with your cousins brotherinlaw thats what zeus on olympos by the way he looked around he wished he had more wine papai menedemos exclaimed i thought youd persuaded him we werent going to load the aphroditeup with his olive oil and that was the end of it i thought the same thing his father said i thought so but i was wrong the only way to persuade damonax of anything is to clout him in the head with a rock even then you have to keep clouting him because the first wallop doesnt get through why cant he understand we wont make enough money with his oil for it to be worth our while weve told him often enough menedemos said i think he does understand philodemos answered peering down into his winecup as if hoping it held more i dont think he cares which isnt the same thing hes convinced we owe him a living regardless of what that does to our prospects well furies take him then menedemos said thats just what i told him when i saw i couldnt get through to him any other way his father said good for you menedemos dipped his head in complete agreement he and his father mightdidquarrel about a great many things neither of them though suffered fools gladly and so you see thats why i want you to sail philodemos said now if youre gone damonax cant possibly nag me about loading oil onto the merchant galleyat least not till next sailing season rolls around ill take care of it you know ive been eager to go for a while now menedemos said that was true he couldnt squabble with his father if a couple of thousand stadia separated them he couldnt make love to his fathers wife if a couple of thousand stadia separated them either part of him regretted that the more sensible partand the larger part as wellknew nothing but relief a slow smile stole over his face ill make love to other mens wives instead he thought i know what youre thinking his father growled and pointed an accusing finger at him youre thinking about adultery with all those loose athenian women again thats what i can tell menedemos hoped his father didnt see him wince i dont know what youre talking about he said with such dignity as he could muster a pestilence take me if you dont philodemos said menedemos did his best to look innocent he was guilty of what his father had accused him of yes next to what his father didnt know though that was as nothing the sooner he sailed for athens the better oimoi sostratos said in dismay and then switched from greek to slow halting angry aramaic my master you are a thief himilkon the phoenician looked aggrieved your servant cannot imagine why you would say such a thing he replied in his own language and then clutched his long robe with both hands as if to rend the garment in dismay sostratos went back to greek why ill tell you why youve been quietly buying up papyrus all winter long thats why and the price you want for it is outrageous if you do not care for that price buy somewhere else himilkons greek though gutturally accented was better than sostratos aramaic in fact hed taught sostratos what aramaic he knew i dont seem to be able to buy anywhere else sostratos said if i could i would believe me but no one else has any so i have to come to you he glowered at the merchant from byblos you knew the aphroditewould go to athens this season you didnt keep it a secret most noble one himilkon replied as soon as you came back from phoenicia last fall you started talking about how you planned to go to athens and sell some of the goods youd got and even if you hadnt how smart would i have to be to figure out that you would want to go west instead of east this time every word of that was nothing but truth and common sense none of it made sostratos any happier if anything he got more upset saying you have no right to hold us for ransom like a pirate for ransom no indeed himilkon shook his head i do not want to kill you if you do not pay i do not want to burn down your house all i want to do is what any merchant wants i want to make a profit you know athens uses more papyrus than any other place in the world except maybe alexandriaand they grow the stuff in egypt sostratos said you want me to pay you your ridiculous price for it so the aphroditecan sell it in the athenian agora the phoenician gave him a sly smile you can raise the price you charge for it too not that far sostratos said we wont be the only ones selling it you know if we have to ask twice as much as anybody else just to get our silver back we wont do a whole lot of business there it wont be so bad himilkon said remember most papyrus comes through rhodes and if it came through rhodes lately i bought it youll have less competition than you think but papyrus is always a luxury item people dont have to have it sostratos said of course but thats true of anything youd carry on an akatos wouldnt you say himilkon tugged on the gold hoop he wore in his left ear as if settling it more comfortably he scratched at his curly black beard i fear the reason you are most upset with me o best one is that have the advantage in this dicker sostratos feared he was right the rhodian wasnt about to admit it no indeed he said weve made plenty of bargains where you had the advantage remember the peafowl a few years ago oh yes i remember them very well himilkon replied and when you sailed to great hellas with them how much of a profit did you squeeze out of the italiote hellenes peafowl were unique though papyrus is anything but sostratos insisted himilkons only response was a shrug if you dont care for the price i set my master you are welcome to sail for athens without papyrus all right sostratos got to his feet he automatically ducked his head as he rose from his stool himilkons ramshackle harborside warehouse had shelves that stuck out at odd angles and a low ceiling on the shelves lay packets and bales and jars of goods from all around the inner sea and from lands far to the east and north the phoenician dealt in many things besides papyrus sostratos at the moment didnt care he said always a pleasure talking with you o marvelous one farewell he turned to go sometimes the best bargains were ones you didnt make hed taken several steps toward the door before himilkon in a voice full of pain called wait why sostratos asked what more do we have to talk about hed hoped the phoenician would stop him but he hadnt counted on it sometimes the only way to keep a dicker alive was to show you werent afraid to kill it too sometimes judging when judging when was what made a merchant if youre going to be difficult i suppose i can get by with less than three drakhmai three oboloi for a roll of twenty sheets himilkon said a little less mind you i should hope so sostratos said one drakhma two oboloi is a more usual pricethats only a bit more than a third of what you were trying to squeeze out of me thats the price when everyone is bringing lots of papyrus into athens himilkon said since most egyptian shipping comes through rhodes and since ive been buying up the stock since last fall it isnt likely to be so cheap this season so you say now sostratos said but all we need to worry about is one round ship from alexandria sailing straight for athens their main cargo is always grain but their captains carry other things too to make extra on the side and papyrus is something that always brings them a nice profit it could bring you a nice profit too himilkon said doing his best to make the idea sound tempting sostratos refused to show he was tempted it could he said pointedly if you gave me room to move on the price otherwise he tossed his head the phoenician clapped both hands to his face in melodramatic dismay and you called me a thief i suppose you expect me to lose all the profit i expected to make from getting the papyrus in the first place you wont get any if you make it too expensive to be worth my while sostratos said and you have to leave me room to push up the price and make my own profit in athens if i cant charge a halfway decent price for it nobody will buy any from me i might as well not bring it if i cant sell it himilkon said something pungent in aramaic sostratos said something else just as pungent in the same language to remind himilkon he understood they yelled at each other in greek himilkon edged his price down by a couple of oboloi sostratos laughed scornfully the phoenician looking harassed came down again that made sostratos come upby an obolos a roll himilkon bawled as if a branding iron were searing his flesh sostratos ignored the theatrics which only made himilkon more theatrical you want my wife and my children to starve he shouted you want me to starve sostratos retorted himilkon came down againand then again he was discovering the papyrus hed bought did him less good than hed expected if he didnt sell it to sostratos to whom would he sell it rhodes boasted only two or three scribes who among them wouldnt use in five years what hed accumulated as long as sostratos made it plain he would go to athens without papyrus if the phoenician didnt meet his price he had a good chance of getting it and he did in the end himilkon sold him the writing material for one drakhma four oboloi the roll less than half of what hed first proposed sostratos knew he would still have to hope papyrus was in short supply in athens that would let him bump up his selling price to the point where he made decent money if it wasnt if its not he thought the aphrodite might as well be carrying damonaxs olive oil for all the profit well show on papyrus but then he tossed his head olive oil was heavy and bulky and took up lots of room papyrus wasnt and didnt and id sooner haggle with scribes and writers than with oil merchants any day bright morning sun sparkled off seawater in the great harbor at rhodes menedemos stood at the stern of the aphrodite steeringoar tillers in his hands he was ready to leave on the instant even if the akatos remained tied up at the quay weve got all our cargo dont we he asked sostratos for the third time since theyd come to the merchant galley at dawn yes were fully laden his cousin answered that is unless damonaxs slaves come rushing up with a couple of hundred amphorai of olive oil at the last instant theyd better not by the dog menedemos said your precious brotherinlaw doesnt think were sailing till day after tomorrow does he let his slaves bring the oil thenand let em lug it back when they find out were gone that will be a good jokethen sostratos said well hear about it when we get home our fathers will hear about it right away im sure he sighed family by the way he said it he meant it for a curse up on the quay menedemos father said looks like your crew is still a couple of men light family menedemos thought in much the same way as sostratos had said it aloud he replied only yes father turning to his keleustes he said they should be here any moment now shouldnt they diokles they should have been here already skipper the oarmaster answered unhappily diokles was sunbrowned in his midforties with the broad shoulders and callused hands of a man whod spent a lot of years pulling an oar i told em to show up early if theyre having a last carouse and holding us up ill make em pay once they do come aboard you see if i dont menedemos wouldnt have wanted diokles angry at him yes he was somewhere between fifteen and twenty years younger than the oarmaster but diokles had courage to spare and a formidable physique his loincloth displayed to good advantage most of the time diokles was as goodnatured as any man could be when he wasnt though ahoy the aphrodite the hail came from the base of the pier a barefoot man also wearing only a loinclothsurely a sailorhurried up toward the merchant galley ahoy he called again looking for another rower hail teleutas now menedemos sounded unhappy in a low voice he asked diokles hes not one of the men youre waiting on is he he sure isnt diokles answered at once he always shows up at the last minute looking for whatever he can get do we want him aboard sostratos said he is a thief even if he hasnt stolen from his crew and hes no braver than he has to be i know i know menedemos said he works as little as he can get away with too but hes here and the other fellows arent sostratos gnawed his lower lip diokles looked as if hed bitten into bad fish menedemos felt the same way but neither his cousin nor the keleustes said no with a sigh menedemos waved teleutas on the sailor grinned and came down the gangplank and onto the aphrodite he had his own pillow to protect his backside from the hard rowers bench where hed soon perch a quarter of an hour later one of diokles chosen men wove his way up to the akatos watching him menedemos hoped he wouldnt fall off the pier and into the sea he made it down the gangplank and aboard the aphrodite though sostratos had to grab him to keep him from falling flat on his face on the poop deck up on the wharf lysistratos laughed hed seen plenty of sailors board their ships in that condition so had philodemos but menedemos father looked disgusted not amused the glance he shot his son said he thought menedemos made a habit of getting that drunk as soon as he put rhodes under the horizon that wasnt fair or true but menedemos knew his father wouldnt listen if he said so he turned his attention to the sailor instead hail nikodromos he said his voice as sweet as unmixed ariousian from khios take your place my dearwere going to sweat the wine out of you whatever you want skipper nikodromos said grandly he found an empty rowers bench and sat downalmost fell down again maybe we ought to wait for one more man sostratos said the shape hes in hell foul the stroke till noon well survive it and so will he menedemos answered hell sober up faster by working than any other way his chuckle was thoroughly nasty and hell be sorrier about it than he would be any other way too we wont make much of a show leaving the harbor if hes too sozzled to keep time sostratos said menedemos gnawed on the inside of his lower lip that got home he liked to leave rhodes with every bench manned and with the oars rising and falling as smoothly as if the aphroditewere a five in the rhodian navy most of the sailors had pulled oars in a navy five or a smaller trireme at one time or another so the hope was by no means forlorn with nikodromos drunk though he wouldnt be able to look like a warship today he was still wondering whether to change his mind when somebody elsenot a sailor but one of the harborside loungers who might be found in any port around the inner searan along the pier calling i thought you were already loaded here but theres a troop of slaves carrying amphorai headed this way menedemos and sostratos exchanged glances of consternation damonax they said together so did their fathers up on the quay menedemos realized hed just had his mind made up for him cast off he called and the linen ropes that bound the aphroditeto the wharf came in at bow and stern he dipped his head to diokles lets get moving best one right you are skipper the oarmaster held up a small bronze square on a chain and a little mallet with which to strike it he raised his voice till it carried all the way to the bow you ready boys the rowers set themselves at their oars staring back at him and waiting for the word of command he smote the square at the same time calling out rhyppapai the rowers all pulled even nikodromos diokles clanged the square again and also used his voice to give the stroke rhyppapai at the last syllable the men pulled rhyppapai the aphroditeslid forward a little farther a little faster this time as she began to gain momentum rhyppapai rhyppapai farewell safe voyage lysistratos called from the end of the quay menedemos father didnt say anything but he did wave menedemos lifted one hand from the steeringoar tillers to wave back sostratos peered over the aphrodites stern back toward the quay shed just left oh my he said a couple of minutes later here come those slavesand to the crows with me if damonax isnt with em tell me whats going on menedemos said i cant look over my shoulder right now the merchant galley shared the calm but crowded waters of the great harbor with several fishing boats and a couple of round ships menedemos chuckled wouldnt do to take my eye off where im going and ram somebody when i wasnt looking eh i should hope not sostratos said the damages a jury would vote if you did something like that he shivered at the idea i dont even want to think about it well neither do i menedemos said steering toward the narrow outlet at the north end of the harbor and we wont have toif you do your job and tell me whats happening back there all right but then maddeningly his cousin paused again sorry sostratos said after a moment a round ship just passed between us and the quay so i couldnt see now i can the slaves have set down their amphorai and damonax is saying something to our fathers whatever it is hes upsethes pounding his fist into the palm of his other hand a teacher of rhetoric couldnt do it any better wont make an obolos worth of difference with my father menedemos predicted looks as if youre right sostratos said uncle philodemos is just standing there tossing his head again and again whats that line in the iliad where akhilleus has been praying to zeus that patroklos should drive hektor away from the ships of the akhaioi and come back safe himself zeus hears but the father granted him the one prayer but tossed his head at the other menedemos quoted at once he knew homer well thank you my dear thats just the line i wanted sostratos said the only difference is your fathers not granting any of damonaxs prayers and damonax is getting madder and madder too now hes cupping his hands in front of his mouthhes going to try to shout to us thin and faint across the widening stretch of water menedemos heard ahoy the aphrodite come back and pick up some cargo shall i answer him sostratos asked i could yell back to the pier i think not a word menedemos said put a hand behind your ear and pretend you cant make out what hes saying sostratos did he wasnt the greatest actor but across four or five plethra of seawater he didnt have to be damonax yelled again this time menedemos really did have trouble making out what he was saying sostratos kept that hand behind his ear he started to laugh so did several of the rowers who also looked back at where theyd been dont foul up the stroke you whipworthy rascals diokles shouted at them poseidon s prick youre clumsy enough already whats so funny menedemos asked my brotherinlaws jumping up and down on the wharf like a threeyearold when you tell him he cant have another piece of honey cake sostratos answered somebody ought to give him a good thrashing the way you do with a threeyearold who has a fit when you tell him he cant have another piece of honey cake menedemos said that would be nice his cousin agreed hes right by the edge of the pier now maybe hell fall in maybe your fatheror minewill help him fall in menedemos waited in eager anticipation but then sostratos tossed his head disappointment in his voice he went on no such luck the slaves are picking up the jars of oil and taking them away and damonax is going with them too bad menedemos said id have loved it if he went into the drink instead i just hope he doesnt take it out on erinna thats all sostratos sighed family family menedemos echoed and gave all his attention back to the aphrodite a big beamy round ship was bearing down on her great square sail full of the breeze from out of the north hold full of grain or wine orironyolive oil the round ship was about as maneuverable as an avalanche like the aphrodite like any ship around the inner sea she had eyes painted at her bow but how much good did they do when she couldnt get out of her own way and menedemos would have bet the round ships gooseheaded sternpost had more brains than the man handling her steering oars menedemos pulled the portside steeringoar tiller toward him and pushed the starboard tiller as far away from him graceful as a dancer the aphroditeswung to port and slipped past the lumbering round ship sailors on the round ships deck waved as the merchant galley glided by most of the aphrodites crew were too busy to wave back long fortified moles to the east and north protected the great harbor of rhodes from storms the opening between them was only a couple of plethra wide side by side with a little fishing boat from whose crew sikon might buy the evenings opson menedemos steered the akatos out of the harbor and onto the open sea as sostratos did every sailing season he discovered how much the aphrodites motion changed when she left the calm waters of the harbor and braved the inner sea before all hed noticed was the forward thrust each time her oars bit into the water now the light chop made her pitch up and down as her bow rode over the waves and down into the troughs between them sostratos stomach felt as if it were lurching in the same way as the akatos gulping he hoped the barley porridge hed had for breakfast would stay down he looked forward from the poop deck a few sailors were similarly greenish but only a few that was how things usually went sostratos gulped again use the rail if youve got to give it back boys menedemos said on the whole in a kindly way the bilges get foul enough without adding puke to the mix he lowered his voice to ask are you all right sostratos ill be all right in a few days sostratos answered i wish this didnt happen every sailing season but it does i need a few days to get my sea legs thats all you look a little paler than usual menedemos said ill be fine in sostratos stopped gulped once more clapped a hand to his mouth and took two quick steps over to the rail breakfast did not stay down but he put it neatly in the sea a pestilence he wheezed when he could speak again been a long time since ive actually gone and heaved happens to a lot of people his cousin said with the ease of one whom seasickness didnt bother maybe now youre over it the way some pregnant women are when they throw up in the morning i hope so sostratos spat to get the vile taste out of his mouth spitting didnt do much good he dipped some wine from an amphora carried for the crew rinsing his mouth with that helped more he spat out one mouthful then swallowed another his stomach didnt rise in immediate rebellion which he took as a good sign once the aphroditewas well out of the great harbor menedemos took half the men off the oars letting them row from every other bench hed started out with all forty benches filled for the sake of swank out on the open sea he usually used eight or ten men on a side and rotated the crew every couple of hours that way he could have fresh men rowing when he really needed them escaping or fighting pirates pushing forward against a headwind or clawing away from the shore in case of storm the merchant galley rounded the northernmost tip of the polis and the islandof rhodes sostratos pointed to the marble temple of demeter whose gleaming white bulk stood out from the swarm of red tile roofs our houses are somewhere not far from there he said i wish i could pick out mine but its just another roof from here im not sorry to be gone menedemos said i suppose i even owe your brotherinlaw a vote of thanks for what sostratos said and then oh you mean for nagging our fathers i sure do if he hadnt got my father good and mad wed still be stuck in rhodes playing knucklebones and twiddling our thumbs the biggest reason we got to sail so soon is that our fathers wanted him to shut up and go away i know sostratos said and ill give you another reason to be grateful to good old thickheaded damonax without him we wouldnt have had a chance to get up to athens soon enough to catch the greater dionysia and now we do i tell you my dear you havent lived till youve seen the theater in athens theres nothing like it in any other polis in the world im looking forward to it menedemos said that is one of the reasons i wanted to sailnot the only reason mind you but one of them the tragedies will probably be revivals sostratos said but i keep telling you there are some good comic poets still writing as usual his cousin said give me aristophanes any day ill believe anybody can match him when i see it and not till then that could have started another argument had sostratos let it instead he only smiled and shrugged menedemos was loyal to aristophanes as he was loyal to homer argument wouldnt change that in both poetry and drama sostratos had more modern tastes argument wasnt likely to change that either once well clear of the northern tip of rhodes menedemos swung the aphroditeto port so that she headed west sostratos peered north toward the hazeshrouded karian coast as with rhodes the rains of fall and winter had left it bright with greenery when the merchant galley came back at the end of summer the sun would have baked it sere and brown minor islandssyme khalke teloslay ahead they too looked green and inviting sostratos had trouble imagining duller places to live though think this breeze will hold diokles menedemos asked reckon it ought to skipper for a while anyway the oarmaster replied well lets get some use out of the sail then menedemos raised his voice to call out to the crew lower the sail from the yard the men hurried to obey using the brailslines that ran from the top of the merchant galleys square sail to the bottomthey quickly spread it then swung the yard from the starboard bow back to the stern at the port side to take best advantage of the wind the sail sewn together from small pieces of linen filled with air the mast creaked a little as it took the force of the wind the aphrodites bronze ram greened from all its time in the sea dug deeper into the water seeing all the squares the brails and the seams make on the sail always makes me think of geometry lessons sostratos said what can we prove from the figure before us what is the area of this rectangle or that one geometry lessons menedemos shuddered all i remember when i think of them is the schoolmaster with his stick he drew blood sometimes the polluted rogue i didnt get hit all that often sostratos said noyou were the one who always had his lessons straight menedemos said the other boys in the class didnt love you for it i know sostratos sighed ive never had any trouble understanding being disliked for doing things wrong who wants a bungler around but having people hate you for doing whats right doing what youre supposed tothat always seemed unfair to me you made the rest of us look bad his cousin said you should have paid attention too then sostratos said those lessons werent that hard not to you maybe menedemos said as far as i was concerned the master might have been speaking aramaic perimeter and hypotenuse and isosceles and i dont know what all else he took a hand off the tiller and held it up and dont you start explaining them to me either i dont have to worry about them anymore sostratos ears burned he had been on the point of launching into a geometry lesson like most of what hed studied mathematics had come easy for him that it hadnt for menedemos and the other boys still perplexed him but if it wasnt a matter of their not studying not paying attention what was it hed hardly posed the question in his own mind before menedemos said some of us are good at some things others at others you soaked up lessons the way a soft cloth soaks up water but you wont claim youre better than i am at figuring out how people work i hope oh i might claim it but it wouldnt be true sostratos said you have the edge on me there he plucked at his beard i wonder why that should be people would be boring if everybody were just like everybody else menedemos said wed all go around like thishe looked very severe and stiffened his body till he almost seemed cast from bronzeas if we were so many spartan hoplites all in a line in the phalanx laughing sostratos said why couldnt you make us all into pretty girls but if we were all pretty girls what would be the point of chasing one theres always a point to chasing pretty girls menedemos spoke with great conviction but even joking with sostratos hadnt made him stop paying attention to the aphroditeand the breeze swing the yard forward a little more he called to the sailors as the men made the adjustment and the stays creaked sostratos asked do you think we can go all the way to knidos today his cousin looked ahead knidos lay at the end of a long spit of land jutting west into the sea from the coast of karia at last regretfully menedemos tossed his head if wed put to sea earlier in the day i do believe id try it and sail on by the stars if we werent there by sunset as things are though its too much to ask of the sailors on their first day out well put in at syme all right sostratos would have done the same himself sometimes though menedemos liked to push things sostratos pointed to the little island ahead will you use that bay in the south where we put in a few years ago no i was thinking of anchoring at the town on the north coast menedemos answered its not much of a town i know but in a way thats all the better the men can go into a tavern without being tempted to run off and desert gods know thats true sostratos agreed nobody in his right mind would want to desert at syme no matter what you were trying to escape what could be worse than staying there the rest of your days menedemos considered that he didnt need long to shudder nothing i can think of he replied little fishing boats coming back from their days work bobbed around the aphrodite as her bow anchors went into the sea in front of the town of syme the town lay on a sheltered bay of the island with which it shared a name most of the fishing boats beached themselves the men aboard them hauling them farther out of the water than oars could drive them menedemos had beached the merchant galley in the sheltered bay of which sostratos had spoken he didnt feel like doing it here if trouble came he wanted to be able to get away in a hurry he couldnt very well do that with a beached ship these folks are probably all right diokles said bearing down just a little on the word probably i know menedemos said if two or three other ships were here with us i think id run her up onto the sand this way no when fall came and we didnt get back to rhodes somebody could come after us and they might say the aphrodite oh no she didnt put in here she must have come to grief somewhere else who could give em the lie i dont think theyd do that mind you but why tempt em you get no arguments from me skipper the keleustes said why tempt em is just right far as im concerned up and down the length of the aphrodite sailors stretched and twisted working kinks out of muscles they hadnt used all winter some of them rubbed olive oil onto their blisters teleutas who happened to be back by the poop deck rubbed something else on them instead from a small flask hed stuck under his bench menedemos sniffed isnt that turpentine he asked his eyebrows leaping in surprise thats right the sailor said doesnt it burn like fire menedemos said its not so bad teleutas answered it hardens the flesh instead of making it soft the way oil does i was talking with an epeirote sailor in a tavern he said they use it up there and i thought id give it a try better you than me menedemos said another rower a former sponge diver named moskhion asked can we take the boat and go ashore skipper we can buy ourselves some wine and some better grub than weve got on the ship here maybe theres a brothel in town too i dont know about that menedemos said this isnt what youd call a big place and ships dont put in here all that often but yes you can go find out if you have a mind to the merchant galley towed her boat behind her on a line tied to the sternpost the boat was new shed lost the old one the sailing season before on the way back to rhodes from phoenicia when two pirate ships attacked off the lykian coast a sailor had cut the old boat loose to help the aphroditefight them off and so she hadbut she hadnt been able to go back and recover the boat soldiers pulled the new boat alongside the akatos and clambered down into her she carried half a dozen oarssmall ones compared to the ninecubit sweeps that propelled the aphrodite and could hold a dozen men the sailors briefly argued over who would row her back to the ship for the next group then set off for the town of syme are you going ashore sostratos asked menedemos tossed his head and mimed an enormous yawn not likely my dear i might never wake up again what about you im tempted his cousin answered after all symes less than a days sail from rhodes you can see this place any time you look west even so ive never been into the town yes and we both know why too its not worth going into menedemos said too true sostratos thought for a moment then shrugged i live in rhodes ive stayed in athens ive visited taras and syracuse poleis that are poleis if you know what i mean im sorry but i cant get excited about syme this is one step up from a villageand a small step too thats the way i feel about it menedemos said well if were going to stay aboard ship shall we have supper what syracusan wouldnt be jealous of our feast sostratos laughed syracuse was famous for its fancy cooking some cooks from the sicilian city had even written books of their favorite recipes for opson recipes full of rare expensive fish spices from all around the inner sea and beyond and rich cheeses the aphroditecarried coarse hard barley rolls for sitos and olives and onions and hard crumbly salty cheese for opson to go with it if the crew wanted fish as a relish they had to put lines over the side and catch it themselves the rough red wine in the amphorai was a suitable match for the rest of the meal menedemos could think of no worse condemnation this stuff almost makes you want to drink water he said drinking water isnt healthy sostratos said you think this wine is menedemos returned you can taste more of the pitch on the inside of the jar than you can of the grapes he sipped again and pulled a face of course considering what the grapes do taste like maybe thats just as well its not supposed to be anything special its just supposed to be wine his cousin said and even if it isnt the best stuff dionysos ever made it wont give you a flux of the bowels the way water would well thats true menedemos flipped a couple of more drops of wine onto the poop deck my thanks great dionysos for arranging that we dont get the galloping shits from winefor wed surely drink it even if we did thats peculiar praise for the god sostratos said smiling but then dionysos is a peculiar sort of god how do you mean menedemos asked just for instance homer doesnt say much about him sostratos answered he talks much more about the other olympianseven hephaistos has a couple of scenes where hes the center of attention but dionysos doesnt thats true menedemos said thoughtfully there is that passage in the sixth book of the iliad though you know the one i mean i would not fight with the gods who dwell in the heavens for not even the son of dryas mighty lykourgos could stay at strife for long with the gods who dwell in the heavens he once drove off the attendants of madnessbringing dionysos near sacred nyseion they all let their mystical gear fall to the ground dionysos afraid plunged into the salt sea and thetis received him into her bosom while he feared for the man put him in great terror through his shout yes thats probably the place where the poet talks most about him sostratos said but isnt it strange to have a god whos a coward dionysos did have his revenge later menedemos said but that was later sostratos reminded him can you imagine any of the other olympians even aphrodite leaping into the sea on account of a mortal mans shout well no menedemos admitted and herodotos says dionysos came from egypt and euripides says he came out of india and just about everyone says he came from thrace sostratos said none of the rest of the olympians is foreign and some of dionysos rites he shivered though the evening was fine and mild give me a god like phoibos apollo any day dionysos rites on rhodes arent so bad menedemos said no not on rhodes his cousin agreed but rhodes is a tidy modern civilized place even back on rhodes though they get wilder if you leave our polis and the other towns and go out into the countryside and in some of the backwoods places on the mainland of hellas my dear fellow euripides knew what he was talking about when he wrote the rending scenes in the bakkhai thats a play ive only heard about menedemos said ive never seen it performed and ive never read it oh you must best one sostratos exclaimed if were lucky maybe theyll revive it in athens while were there its quite something i dont think theres ever been another play that shows the power of a god so strongly if a freethinker like you says that i suppose i have to take it seriously menedemos said its a marvelous play sostratos said earnestly and the poetry in the choruses is almost unearthly its so beautiful no one else ever wrote anything like itand euripides never wrote anything else like it either menedemos respected his cousins judgment even if he didnt always agree with it if i ever get the chance ill see it he said you should sostratos said in fact you ought to find someone who has a copy and read it there are bound to be a few in a polis the size of rhodes and of course therell be more than a few in athens if i ever get the chance menedemos repeated he spat an olive pit into the bay from the shore came the noise of raucous song he grinned sounds like the men are having a good time i hope symes still standing in the morning what there is of it it should be sostratos said they were in rhodes yesterday and they only just put to sea they shouldnt have that urge to tear places to piecesits too early in the voyage the crash that followed on the heels of his words could only have been an amphora shattering menedemos sighed and said lets hope nobody broke that over anybodys head he got out his himation sailors prided themselves in going about in nothing but a chiton regardless of the weather but a mantle also made a good blanket he wrapped himself in the rectangle of thick woolen cloth and lay down on the poop deck sostratos did the same as he twisted and turned trying to get comfortable he said weve been sleeping in beds all winter long bare planks arent so comfortable any more its not too bad menedemos said cradling his head in his arms if it were raining now he yawned he wasnt really that sleepy he was trying to convince himself as well as sostratos it must have worked for the next thing he knew the eastern horizon glowed pink and gold he yawned and stretched something in his back crackled he got to his feet sostratos still lay there snoring given the chance he usually slept later than menedemos he didnt get the chance todaymenedemos stirred him with his foot sostratos eyes flew open what was that for he asked blurrily time to get up time to get going menedemos answered when he was awake he was awake weve got a full days sailing ahead of us sostratos groaned and pulled the himation up over his head menedemos stirred him again less gently this time he drew another groan from his cousin who emerged from the mantle like a tortoise poking its nose out of its shell come on my dear menedemos said cheerfully like it or not rosyfingered dawn has found us like an old old man sostratos stood up i dont like it he said watered wine and barley rolls dipped in olive oil helped reconcile sostratos to being awake at diokles command the rowers backed oars they pulled hard as if eager to get the aphroditeaway from syme as soon as they could none of them had a bandaged head so sostratos supposed that amphora the evening before hadnt fractured a skull lets get in a little practice menedemos said at the oarmasters commandstarboard oars hold the backstroke port oars forward port oars forward diokles bawled the rowers obeyed quite smoothly the aphroditespun turning almost in her own length when her bow pointed north out to sea the keleustes called both sides forward the akatos sped away sostratos spent the first couple of hours of the days sailing arguing with menedemos why do you want to stop at knidos he asked uh to trade when menedemos sounded most reasonable he also sounded most annoying so it seemed to sostratos anyhow very well o best one to trade and what will they have in knidos to trade sostratos never stopped to wonder if when he sounded most like sokrates he also sounded most annoying well the usual run of things they have there menedemos replied exactlythe usual run of things sostratos agreed if we were going somewhere besides athens that might be good enough but since we are bound for athens why waste the time at knidos why not head straight for kos koan silk is special enough to do well anywhere the rich athenians will like it and so will the macedonian officers in kassandros garrison koan silk isnt so special as we thought it was menedemos said that stuff i got in sidon last summer that stuff from out of the east puts it in the shade i didnt think even the gods could weave cloth like that neither did i sostratos admitted but the trader had only that little bit of it and we got a good price for it from ptolemaios brother menelaos as far as the athenians are concerned koan silk is the best there is and so we ought to stop at kos why not knidos and kos menedemos asked because we probably wont find anything in knidos thats worth taking to athens and because if we stop at every ordinary polis between here and athens well never get there in time for the greater dionysia his cousin took his right hand off the steeringoar tiller and wagged a finger at him thats the real reason you want to hurry you hardly care about trade at all what kind of merchant does that make you one who likes drama sostratos said dont you of course i do but i like profit more menedemos said so do i sostratos said and im telling you theres not enough profit in knidos to make stopping there worth our while im the captain by the dog of egypt menedemos said if i want to stop at knidos i cursed well will im the toikharkhos sostratos retorted if you wont listen to me when it comes to cargo and money why bring me along they went round and round and back and forth they did it in a low voice neither showing too much excitement for neither wanted the crew to know how seriously they disagreed every so often menedemos would break off to steer the ship or call an order to the men handling the sail then he would turn back to sostratos and start up again when he said im the captain for the fourth time sostratos really did lose his temper yes youre the captain euge for you he said but whats the rest of the crew supposed to do when the captain is an idiot dont tell me how to sail the ship menedemos snapped im not im trying to tell you where to sail her which is a different matter altogether where has to do with what we buy and sell and thats my business let me ask it another way can we make kos by sundown if this wind holds menedemos looked as if he wanted to say no he wanted to but he couldnt sostratos would know he was lying they could make kos even if the wind died but that would strain the rowers sostratos could see why menedemos wouldnt want to make them work too hard on the second day out from rhodes perhaps youd sooner go to halikarnassosthe strait between kos and mainland isnt even close to a hundred stadia wide sostratos said sweetly his cousin gave him a harried look and muttered oh shut up thanks to his affair with that prominent citizens wife he couldnt set foot in halikarnassos without the riskthe likelihoodof getting killed after a moment though he glared at sostratos maybe the fellow got killed in ptolemaios siege summer before last yes o marvelous one maybe he did sostratos said on the other hand maybe he didnt do you care to take the chance for a moment he wondered if hed made a mistake menedemos took an appalling number of chances and enjoyed doing it here though he tossed his head which only proved how serious the prominent halikarnassian had been about sending him across the styx he glanced longingly in the direction of knidos which lay dead ahead but then pulled the steeringoar tiller in his left hand a little toward him and pushed the steeringoar tiller in his right away from him the aphroditeswung slightly to port so she would skirt the peninsula at whose tip knidos sat well go to kos menedemos said are you happy now will you quit nagging me if i had a wife and she pestered me like that id make her sorry for it i think its a good business decision sostratos said i know you do menedemos answered im not nearly sure i agree with you but you win this time youre stubborn as a donkey do you know that he looked sostratos up and down the resemblance doesnt end there either thank you so much my dear sostratos said his cousin took no notice of him but concentratedmost ostentatiously concentrated on steering the ship stung sostratos made his way past the grunting sweating rowers and the rest of the aphrodites crew to the merchant galleys tiny foredeck whenever he stood up there he thought of the peafowl the aphroditehad carried west to great hellas three years before theyd made good money on the birds from rich italiote hellenes and from a richer samnite visiting taras whod bought the peacock theyd made good money yes but sostratos hoped he never saw another peafowl as long as he lived he also thought of aristeidas whod spent so much time up here doing lookout duty but the sharpeyed sailors bones lay in ioudaia sostratos pounded a fist down on the rail the robbers there could easily have killed him too like most of the cities of southwestern anatolia knidos was nominally free and autonomous also like most of them it held a garrison of antigonos soldiers a couple of war galleysbig beamy fives full of rowers and marinespatrolled in front of the harbor sostratos wondered if one of them would come rushing out to investigate the aphrodite he wouldnt have been surprised antigonos men were no less arrogant than those who followed ptolemaios or kassandros or lysimakhos or he supposed seleukos the macedonian marshals ruled the civilized world poleis like rhodes poleis that really were free and autonomous were few and far between nowadays to sostratos relief the fives kept prowling back and forth back and forth he didnt think one of their skippers would have been highhanded enough to plunder the aphrodite that would have offended rhodes he didnt think so but he was just as well pleased not to have to find out also to his relief the wind blew more from the east than from the north as the merchant galley made her way up through the channel between the mainland and the little island of nisyros to the west menedemos kept eight men on each side at the oars to help the sail propel the ship through the water had the wind turned against the aphrodite he would have had to raise the sail to the yard and put more men on the oars to make any decent headway either that or tack like a round ship and almost as slowly as a round ship would have i wish there were a way to get closer to the wind than a square sail can sostratos thought after a moment though he shrugged hed sailed from sicily to phoenicia and hed never seen any other kind of rig that was all too likely to mean no other kind was practical he tried to imagine a different way to mount a sail tried and felt himself failing kos climbed up out of the sea ahead menedemos pointed to some tumbledown ruins on the southwestern coast i wish astypalaia were still the koans main town he said wed be almost there already i wouldnt want to live in what was left of a polis after a spartan sack and an earthquake sostratos said the town they have now is better situated all the way aroundit looks right across the channel to halikarnassos and its laid out in a sensible grid like rhodes so a stranger has some chance of finding his way around the streets in the old city were probably tracks that wandered wherever they wanted every word you say is true my dear menedemos replied but astypalaias right here in front of our noses and weve still got some traveling to do before we get to the polis of kos ptolemaios galleys prowled in front of kos antigonos warships patrolled in front of halikarnassos sostratos supposed they clashed every so often at the moment they were leaving one another alone for which he was duly grateful the sun was just setting as the aphroditecame to the harbor before the akatos could enter one of ptolemaios fives hurried up to look her over the war galleys banners displayed the eagle of the lord of egypt heave to an officer at the bow shouted oop diokles called to the rowers and they rested at their oars what ship are you the officer demanded where are you from what are you carrying and where are you bound were the aphrodite out of rhodes and bound for athens sostratos answered the war galleys flank loomed up out of the water like a wooden wall she had twice the freeboard of the akatos her deck stood six or seven cubits above the surface of the sea a ripe stench wafted out of her oarports she had two rowers on each thranite and zygite oar a single man on each bottommost or thalamite oar all the rowers were enclosed under the decking that held marines and kept missiles from striking home it had to be like an oven in there sostratos wondered how often they swabbed out the bilges not often enough by the stink a rhodian eh the officer said what firm that of philodemos and lysistratos sostratos said the officer turned his head and spoke to some of the men behind him one of them must have vouched for the firms existence for he grunted and asked whats your cargo crimson dye ink and papyrus beeswax embroidered linen rhodian rose perfume sostratos replied thinking and no olive oil gods be praised all right pass on rhodian the officer on the war galley said you know you look like a pirate at first glance really sostratos raised an astonished eyebrow no ones ever told me that before behind him half a dozen sailors snickered and snorted ptolemaios officer scratched his head as if wondering whether the rhodian was making sport of him too late sostratos realized he should have swallowed his sarcasm diokles smote the bronze square the rowers bent their backs the aphroditeslid toward the harbor after a long worrying moment of sitting quiet in the water the war galley resumed its patrol come back here a moment o best one if youd be so kind menedemos called from the poop deck sostratos came he came with all the eagerness of a small boy summoned to a whipping by his father and for the same reason but all menedemos said was youd do better not to crack wise when that fellows ship could sink us without even noticing shed done it yes my dear sostratos said meekly still he couldnt help adding im not the only one whos ever done such a thing you know are you talking about me menedemos demanded in disbelieving tones that was too much yes by the dog i am talking about you sostratos said menedemos reached out and poked him in the ribs he jumped and squawked menedemos laughed got you he said got you twice in fact i know ive let my tongue run freer than it might have every now and again that still doesnt mean its a good idea whether i do it or you do by the dog sostratos said again this time in an altogether different tone of voice maybe youre growing up his cousin looked aggrieved is that a nice thing to tell someone some people would think so sostratos answered but then theyd already be grown up so i wouldnt need to say it to them this time his cousin looked genuinely affronted which made him feel a little better when menedemos woke up in a bed he needed a moment to remember where he was hearing sostratos snore coming from another bed no more than a cubit away reminded him the two of them had taken a room at an inn not far from the harbor at kos menedemos yawned scratched and sat up then he scratched again more earnestly he hoped he hadnt shared the bed with little guests who hadnt paid for it sunlight slid through the shutters over a narrow windowand poured through a couple of broken slats menedemos stood up and used the chamber pot under the bed sostratos twisted so that one of those sunbeams fell across his face he threw up a hand which sufficed to wake him good day he said around a yawn of his own and a good day to you menedemos held out the pot here i was going to boot you out of bed anyhow as soon as i finished using this thanks im so sorry to disappoint you sostratos used the chamber pot then carried it over to the window coming out he called as he opened the shutters he poured the slops into the street below an irate yelp said somebody might not have moved fast enough at his warning he turned back to menedemos do you suppose the innkeeper will have bread for breakfast menedemos shrugged if he doesnt we can stop at a bakery or buy something from someone on the street and thenon to pixodaros pity he couldnt have seen that silk we sold to menelaos sostratos said i wonder what he would have made of it he would have made money thats what menedemos said but he couldnt have matched that silk none of the koan weavers can if it ever starts coming out of the east regularly theyll have to find another line of work because what they make doesnt come close you get no arguments from me i wouldnt have believed it if i hadnt seen it with my own eyes but i did sostratos headed for the door now the question is will i see breakfast with my own eyes the innkeeper was munching on a barley roll when the two rhodians walked into the main room no i dont sell breakfast he said when sostratos asked you can buy some wine from me though menedemos tossed his head why do that now and then something to eat later on he said come on sostratoswell get em both in the same place his cousin didnt disagree the innkeepers glare burned into their backs as they walked out onto the street pixodaros house was only a few blocks away across the street from a brothel full of pretty boys the slave who opened the door at the silk dealers exclaimed in surprise the rhodians he bowed very low then went on in accented greek you not come back last year master think something bad happen no were fine menedemos answered we sailed east last year instead of west thats all not much point coming to kos when youre bound for sidon is there the slave shook his head no sir none at all you come in you both come in my master he be glad to see you he stood aside to let them through the doorway then hurried past them into the house calling master master the rhodians is here are they menedemos heard pixodaros say he had an accent too just enough to make someone notice he hadnt been born a hellene well thats very good news indeed fetch them some wine and something to go with it ibanollis ibanollis sostratos murmured fixing the name in his memory ibanollis ibanollis menedemos knew his cousin had it now he relied on sostratos memory more than he cared to admit even to himself out came pixodaros a plump prosperouslooking karian with a luxuriant black beard just beginning to show streaks of gray hail rhodians he said bowing to menedemos and sostratos before stepping forward to clasp their hands very good to see you again i feared for your safety going out on the winedark sea is a risky business menedemos smiled pixodaros surely used the homeric epithet to show that even though he came from barbarian stock hed been grafted on to the tree of hellenic culture were well as i told your slave he replied he wouldnt try to pronounce ibanollis name we sailed east last year thats all you seem to be doing splendidly for yourself im lucky pixodaros said with unhellenic modesty but it was true he went on if my master had had children who lived he shrugged broad shoulders old xenophanes had died childless and left his business to the slavea freedman nowwhod been his righthand man had the hellene had a sonor even a daughter with a husband pixodaros would have stayed a slave himself instead of owning slaves come he waved the rhodians toward the andron drink wine with me eat olives and cheese and bread so you went east did you yes to sidon and i went down into ioudaia from there sostratos said well well you hellenes have always had itchy feet havent you pixodaros said me im here and i like being here just fine ibanollis came in with a wooden tray with wine and snacks on it he poured wine for his master and for the rhodians pixodaros spat an olive pit onto the ground then asked tell me o most noble ones did you see any unusual silk while you were in phoenicia menedemos and sostratos looked at each other you know of the silk that comes out of the east then menedemos said i have heard of it i have not seen it the karian answered i have heard it is finer than any we make on kos is this true it is im afraid menedemos said its so fine and thin and smooth it might almost be another fabric do you know zakerbaal son of tenes the sidonian cloth merchant i have heard his name but i have never done business with him pixodaros replied he is the man who had this eastern silk thats right menedemos dipped his head i bought twelve bolts from him paying more than two and a half times their weight in koan silk and i sold all twelve bolts to ptolemaios brother menelaos at cypriot salamis for a hundred and eight minai of silver had pixodaros been ignorant of zakerbaal he would have been tempted to say hed given the phoenician merchant even more but the truth might get back here and that truth was impressive enough by itself it certainly impressed pixodaros by zeus labraundeus he muttered zeus of the doubleheaded axe with his cult center at labraunda was a leading karian god the silk merchant gathered himself i find that hard to believe my cousin speaks the truth sostratos said give us any oath you please and we will swear it you know us well enough to know we dont swear lightly either by pixodaros expression he did know that and didnt like it his next question was one that had also occurred to menedemos how much of this new eastern silk will come to the lands around the inner sea i dont think anyone can say yet menedemos answered till i got to sidon i hadnt even heard of it i suppose that since you sell silk yourself word would have come to you sooner than to most people yes i would think so the karian emptied his cup then filled it again a sigh made his wide shoulders sag all i can do is keep selling what i make no matter how fine this other stuff may be i know mine is good too anyone who wants it will still have to pay the proper price he looked a challenge at the two rhodians well best one when we were here two years ago we worked out a bargain for silk and dye and perfume menedemos said that suited us well enough how did your side of it work out not bad pixodaros said will you expect the same rates again certainly sostratos said why shouldnt we menedemos added because if you went to phoenicia you got the crimson dye yourselves pixodaros answered you paid less for it than you would have if youd bought it in rhodes but we had the cost of bringing it back ourselves menedemos countered that isnt cheap not with the aphrodite and we got attacked by pirates off the lykian coast sostratos said the dye almost didnt get here we almost didnt get here oimoi pixodaros exclaimed tell me your story menedemos and sostratos told it together as usual menedemos did most of the talking he couldnt be quite so dramatic as he would have liked for he knew his cousin would add a dry correction or two if he strayed too far from the facts even without embellishment the story was a good one when the rhodians finished pixodaros clapped his hands and said euge i am glad to see both of you here and safe believe me were glad to be here and safe sostratos said but now you see why we charge what we charge for the crimson dye although menedemos dipped his head in agreement he sent sostratos an annoyed look this wasnt the time to start banging away at business again sostratos should have smiled and told another story or a joke or something of the sort menedemos reached for the oinokhoe and poured his winecup and his cousins full again dickers had a rhythm to them no less than tunes on the kithara make one go too fast and it would come out wrong just as a tune would sostratos didnt always have a feel for that to make sure this bargain went as it should menedemos asked has any news from athens reached kos this sailing season pixodaros hesitated for a fraction of a heartbeat before tossing his head menedemos had seen that response before from barbarians who wanted to seem as hellenic as they could their first impulse was to shake the head as most foreign folk did and they needed that tiny moment to catch themselves and remember hellenes did things differently the karian answered no not yet ships are only beginning to put to sea this spring and none from athens has come here yet sostratos asked has any ship bound for athens been here to buy silk that was a legitimate question menedemos would have asked it if sostratos hadnt beaten him to it this time pixodaros tossed his head without hesitation no you are the first he replied and smiled a sly smile maybe i should charge you more because i know youll make more there sostratos jumped as if stung by a wasp thats not just he exclaimed hes joking my dear menedemos said he wanted to startle you and he did pixodaros smile got wider showing strong white teethhe didnt look as if he were one whod suffer miseries on that account as he got older i know it is not just my friends and i would not do it but startling a friend every now and againyou should have seen the look on your face he laughed out loud oh sostratos looked foolish but then he managed a small selfdeprecating laugh he didnt get angry or at least didnt show anger for which menedemos was glad in his own way sostratos was a good bargainer but he could forget himself not here though shall we see some silk now menedemos asked his voice casual if its up to your usual standardand im sure it will beshall we forge the same sort of bargain as we did two years ago i think so the karian freedman replied i made money on it and i gather you gentlemen did too he raised his voice ibanollis the rhodians are ready to look at the silk now bring the best we have i do ibanollis said you wait one little bit the silk was very good some of the finest and most transparent koan weavers made but it could not match the eastern cloth menedemos had got from zakerbaal the sidonian merchants always looked disappointed at the quality of goods they were offered that was part of the role they played here though menedemos and sostratos had no trouble seeming unimpressed and menedemos knew they would have had a hard time acting blase about this silk if they hadnt seen the other pixodaros sensed they werent putting on their indifference too he said you remind me of men going home to ugly wives from the house of a beautiful hetaira is this eastern silk really that splendid im afraid it is o best one menedemos said soberly for its kind though what you have here is excellent he felt like a man praising an ugly wife for the way she managed a home with a sigh pixodaros said well i can hope the eastern silk stays in the east for the rest of my life he suddenly looked anxious you do still want to make this bargain dont you we wouldnt have come here if we didnt sostratos reassured him for now koan silk is the finest cloth we can get and it will have a ready market in athens for now the karian muttered under his breath menedemos wished his cousin hadnt tacked that on even if it was trueperhaps especially because it was true pixodaros made himself straighten his shoulders as a hellene might have done i do still have the finest silk made around the inner sea he spoke as if reminding himself as well as the rhodians of course you do menedemos said soothingly were always pleased to do business with you sostratos said itthats why were here pixodaros smiled even so he had to be wondering how long he and his could stay prosperous through his sons lifetime through his own or only another year or two menedemos thought it would be longer than that but he didnt know he wouldnt have wanted to do business with that kind of risk hanging over him by all the signs neither did pixodaros but he didnt have that worry and the freedman did when they left pixodaros house maybe that sense of relief was part of what made menedemos look across the street you know what im going to do he said im going to have a go at the boy brothel there want to come along no thanks sostratos said i dont much fancy boys neither do i usually menedemos said i feel like it today though have fun ill see you back at the inn then sostratos said the brothelkeeper was a fat phoenician with a curled beard his greek held a guttural accent at your service my master he said take your pick he waved at the youths in the main room had they been women they would have been spinning to earn him extra money some of them wore silk tunics as women might have menedemos wondered if it was pixodaros silk others were naked menedemos pointed to a youth of about fifteen with less paint on his face than most of the boys wore him i think hearkening and obedience the whoremaster said with a bow sadyattes go with the man a lydian menedemos thought as the slave got to his feet come with me the boy said sounding more resigned than alluring the room to which he led the rhodian was small and gloomy with no furniture but a bed a stool with a small jar on it and a chamber pot it smelled of sweat sadyattes pulled his chiton off over his head he was a little pudgier and a little hairier than menedemos had expected perfection is for the gods menedemos thought hell do still sounding resigned sadyattes asked what do you want nothing fancyjust the usual menedemos said all right instead of bending over straightaway the slave reached for the jar will you use some olive oil first its easier that way menedemos pulled off his own chiton well why not he answered go aheadput some on me the brothel boy obeyed gently pushing back his foreskin as he rose sadyattes fingers were skilled and knowing now turn around menedemos said after a little while the boy did menedemos took his pleasure sadyattes gave no sign of taking any of his own but boys seldom did menedemos patted him on the backside then gave him an obolos here you dont need to tell that fellow with the fancy beard you got this i thank you most noble one the slave put the little silver coin in his mouth whistling menedemos left the boy brothel which was more than sadyattes could do when he got back to the inn sostratos asked how was it he thought a moment then shrugged nothing fancy he said just the usual rhyppapai diokles called rhyppapai rhyppapai the rowers bent their backs some of them grunted with effort at each stroke sostratos looked toward the anatolian mainland which slowly crawled past to starboard then deliberately he looked to port again a smooth horizon seemed to rise and fall less than a corrugated one as if to show how much he approved of that he said i dont like the ikarian sea no eh menedemos grinned at him why am i not surprised because its got some of the roughest water anywhere in the inner sea sostratos suggested he gulped and silently told his stomach to stay where it belonged for the moment it seemed willing to listen to him his cousin chuckled and all the time i thought it was because you sympathized with ikaros who came crashing down somewhere around here as a matter of fact i do sympathize with ikaros sostratos said i sympathize with daidalos who after all made his sons wings even more whats wrong with pursuing knowledge id like to know people ought to pursue good sense first menedemos said really sostratos raised an eyebrow and how can a man have any idea of what good sense is without knowledge suppose you tell me that oh no you dont menedemos tossed his head youre trying to lure me into a philosophical discussion no thanks my dear i dont want to play not even when you started it sostratos made a reproachful clucking noise for shame you remind me of a man who starts arguments in taverns and then ducks out before the fists fly id rather talk about where we put in next menedemos said that has money attached to it so it does sostratos pointed north were bound for samos and then i thought for khios with the fine wine they make there as a matter of fact i was thinking of passing up khios altogether and going straight on to lesbos menedemos said you were sostratos gaped that came like a thunderbolt from a clear sky by the dog of egypt why we can bring ariousian from khios to athens and make a splendid profit theres no better wine in the world than ariousian yes and dont the khians know it menedemos replied with what they charge we have to bump up our prices so high hardly anyone can afford to buy from us thats the point of having an akatos sostratos said for bulk goods we could take out a round ship and not have to pay all our rowers lesbos makes good wines too his cousin said not quite up to ariousian i admit but plenty good enough for the aphroditeto carry and lesbos has something khios doesnt what sostratos demanded he couldnt think of anything but menedemos could truffles they grow close by mytilene and theyre always best in the springtime tell me the rich athenians and the macedonian officers in the garrison wont want truffles sostratos couldnt and he knew it truffles he murmured intrigued in spite of himself isnt that interesting i have to hand it to you my dearthey never would have occurred to me still i hate to spend the extra time on the way on account of the greater dionysia menedemos asked and sostratos dipped his head menedemos took a hand off the steeringoar tiller to shake a reproachful finger profit first best one profit first drama second normally thats a good rule sostratos said but the greater dionysia is special ill tell you whats special menedemos said the clink of the owls the atheniansll lay down for truffles and good lesbian wine is special thats what i know we have to make money sostratos said it with more than a little shame in his voice a kalos kagathos a proper hellenic gentleman lived off the land he owned and looked down his nose at trade damonax professed being that kind of gentleman as sostratos had seen though his brotherinlaw didnt despise the money from trade especially when his family needed itwhich they did a lot of the time well then act like you enjoy it menedemos didnt mind being a merchantor if he did he hid it well perhaps even from himself if it werent for people like us all the kaloi kagathoi would be sitting around on bare floors scratching themselves because whod sell em all the things that make life worth living nobody thats who getting the chance to see strange places is part of what makes being a merchant worthwhile sostratos admitted and ive never been to mytilene sohe dipped his headall right if thats what you want to do well do it you know that polis wouldnt be here today if the athenians hadnt changed their minds during the peloponnesian war when did the athenians ever do anything but change their minds menedemos asked more than a little scornfully they would have massacred the city after it rose up against them and they sent off a trireme with orders to do just that sostratos said but then they had second thoughts and they sent another ship after the first the rowers on the first ship dawdled they didnt like what they were doing the other ship hurried even though it started a day behind it got there just in time to stop the slaughter mytilenes worth seeing just on account of that menedemos laughed if thats what interests you all right the other thing that makes me want to go to lesbos is the word of mouth he leered diokles chuckled sostratos said is it true what they say about lesbian women did they really invent that particular vice there from what ive heard of sappho s poetry she doesnt talk about it with that funny aiolic dialect they speak there half the time its hard to tell what theyre talking about menedemos answered but if you mean did they invent sucking a mans prong well aristophanes sure thinks so that doesnt mean its true sostratos said aristophanes says all sorts of things that arent so his cousin ignored him menedemos seldom wasted a chance to quote from the comic poet and proved no exception now you seem to me to be the lambda among the lesbians he says and theres that modern poet whatshisnametheopompos thats ittoo not to mention this old method repeated through our mouths which the children of the lesbians found thats not proofits only assertion sostratos said you want proof find a friendly girl on mytilene menedemos answered shell measure the hypotenuse on your triangle see i remember some geometry after all he and diokles both found the joke very funny for some reason sostratos couldnt fathom he did too he tried to think rationally about a pretty girl from a brothel drawing triangles in the sand and talking in learned tones about the theory the godlike pythagoras had provedand the harder he tried the harder he laughed youre absurd he told his cousin thank you menedemos answered which for some reason made them both laugh more than ever at last menedemos said on to lesbos then on to lesbos sostratos agreed after a while he asked what are truffles supposed to cost have you got any idea menedemos tossed his head whatever we have to pay we charge more in athens thats all so far as i know they dont grow truffles there so theyll pay well yes certainly sostratos said but ive never traded for them before id like to have some idea of how to tell good ones from bad and how much i ought to pay for each grade the more i know beforehand the better the bargains i can hope to make ask at some of our stops on the way up to mytilene menedemos suggested the closer we get to lesbos the more likely the merchants in the market squares are to have dealt in em that makes good sense sostratos said yes that makes very good sense how did you come up with it talent menedemos said airily pure talent few things irked sostratos more than having his cousin refuse to rise to one of his gibes there must be a rational explanation instead he said menedemos blew him a kiss youre so sweet he purred sweet as vinegar oh lesbiaze sostratos said the verb derived from the alleged proclivity of lesbian women for such things set him and menedemos and diokles and some of the rowers toolaughing all over again menedemos steered the aphrodite toward the harbor at mytilene part of the polis sat on a little island in the middle of the harbor the rest lay on lesbos proper to the north of the islet a modern wall of gray stone protected the portion of mytilene on the lesbian mainland like rhodes that part of the city was built on a grid a glance told menedemos the streets on the little island the older part of mytilene ran every which way i keep waiting for a war galley to come boiling out and ask what were doing here sostratos said that happened at samos but not at khios menedemos said my guess is were far enough inside antigonos dominions that people dont worry so much about a lone galley people in antigonos dominions dont worry so much about whether were pirates either sostratos said they might want to hire us if we turn out to be raiders but they dont care about sinking us from everything ive seen and heard old oneeye cares about himself first last and always and to the crows with everything else menedemos said if he can get some use out of pirates hes all for them if he cant he doesnt worry one way or the other diokles pointed to a quay not far from the bridge joining the old part of mytilene to the new theres a good place to tie up skipper he said yes i see it menedemos agreed and swung the merchant galley slightly to port he eased her up alongside the jutting pier then dipped his head to the oarmaster back oars diokles called a couple of strokes killed the bit of forward momentum the aphroditehad left the keleustes grunted in satisfaction oцp he said and the rowers rested ship oars he added as they obeyed sailors tossed lines to waiting longshoremen who made the akatos fast to the pier what vessel what cargo asked one of the men on the quay in aiolic fashion he put the accent on each word as far forward as it could possibly go were the aphrodite out of rhodes menedemos answered his doric drawl seemed even more foreign here than it did in the ionicspeaking towns the merchant galley had visited on her way north weve got rhodian perfume papyrus and ink koan silk crimson dye and beeswax and balsam and embroidered linen from phoenicia things of that sort and what are you looking for here the local asked wine of course menedemos said and the fellow dipped his head sostratos added and truffles can you give us the names of a couple of dealers the mytilenean looked elaborately blank by the gods hellenes are a greedy folk sostratos muttered he took an obolos out of his mouth and tossed it to the longshoreman as soon as the fellow caught it his manner changed i can give you one sip right now he said a sip menedemos wondered and then remembered that aiolic used s instead of t in front of i the longshoreman went on and thats steer clear of apollonides he adulterates what he sells thanks friend sostratos said knowing whom to stay away from is as important as knowing whom to go to try onetor the local suggested and after him neon onetors brother onesimos sells wine neon and onetor are both honest more or less but onetor is more likely to have the best truffles than neon is now menedemos gave him an obolos the longshoreman was effusive in his thanks in a low voice sostratos said well do some more checking before we deal this fellow may not know what hes talking about or else he may be onetors cousin or neons and get a cut of whatever business he brings in i know that menedemos answered also quietly well ask around in the agora still weve got a place to start like sparrows scattering when a jay fluttered down to peck at seeds the longshoremen drew back as a swaggering soldier in a swirling red cape strode up the quay toward the aphrodite he was wide through the shoulders at least as tall as sostratos and looked taller because of the crested and brightly polished bronze helm he wore his eyes were gray his closecut beard had big red streaks in it when he spoke the macedonian that poured from his lips made aiolic dialect seem straightforward by comparison menedemos stood there dumbfounded wondering how to tell him he was speaking gibberish sostratos undertook the job im very sorry o best one and i do not mean to offend you but i cannot follow what you say he made his own speech as attic as he could that was the dialect people who learned greek were most likely to follow and to use after an incomprehensible macedonian oath the soldier tried again this time he managed intelligible greek asking what ship be ye here where be ye from what might ye carry menedemos told him he followed doric greek about as well as sostratos almostattic and asked another question whither be ye bound athens sostratos spoke before menedemos could by the way his tongue caressed the citys name he longed for it as menedemos might have longed for one of the women who lived there athens eh the macedonian dipped his head smiling a little and said something more in his native speech he turned and marched down the pier his rawhide boots thudding on the sunbaked birdsplashed planks what was that last bit menedemos asked sostratos it sounded like maybe ill see you there his cousin answered it sounded like that to me too but thats not likely is it menedemos said hes antigonos man and athens belongs to kassandros they dont love each other sostratos agreed we probably heard it wrong menedemos said id almost rather listen to a thracian than a macedonian at least thracians a real foreign language and you know ahead of time it wont make any sense to you when you hear macedonians talking you pick up a word now and then and you hear other bits that sound like they ought to make sense but then you listen a little longer and you realize you dont know what in tartaros theyre talking about usually its something like surrender right now give me your silver sostratos said macedonians arent very complicated people as unobtrusively as he could menedemos kicked him in the ankle saying youre pretty simple yourself to scoff at them where the lesbians might hear you and blab we want to do business here not get in trouble youre right my dear im sorry ill be more careful sostratos was much more ready than most hellenes to apologize when in the wrong that made menedemos have a hard time staying angry at him but also roused faint contempt did his cousin have no selfrespect diokles asked are you young gentlemen going to an inn tonight or will you sleep aboard ship good question menedemos turned to sostratos how about it do you feel like a bed tonight with maybe a slave girl in it to show us what women in lesbos are famous for wed probably get better lodgings at the house of the rhodian proxenos here sostratos eyed the setting sun too late to send anybody to his house this evening tomorrow would do better for that and so id just as soon sleep here tonight after a moments thought menedemos dipped his head you make good sense he said all things considered you usually do thanksi think sostratos said i am fairly good at being right one of the things ive found though is that its much less useful than people think thats a whatdoyoucallita paradox menedemos said whats wrong with being right for one thing a good many questions arent important so whether youre right or not really doesnt matter very much sostratos said seriously for another being right annoys people a lot of the time they think you think youre better than they are when all you truly think is that youre more accurate menedemos had watched sostratos look down his nose at him and at other people too many times to be altogether convinced by that saying so though would have sparked a quarrel instead he got himself a couple of barley rolls some olives and some dried fish why dont you pour us some wine he said this wont be much of a supper but itll keep us going his cousin got out their cups well eat better at the proxenos house than we would at an inn he said the only thing innkeepers know how to do is to fry whatever you bring them in hot oil sostratos dipped wine from an amphora of the rough red the crew drank then diluted it with water from another jar youre bound to be right about that menedemos said as sostratos gave him his cup ive had some ghastly suppers in inns who hasnt only men who never travel sostratos said and this is another one of those places where even if i am right so what he took a sip of wine then fixed a supper for himself you see my being right didnt even get you to bring out any food for me though i poured your wine well now youve embarrassed me menedemos said which was true he knew he should have taken sitos and opson for sostratos as well as himself im just lazy and useless thats all he hung his head if you were on the stage theyd throw cucumbers and squishy apples at you the way you overact sostratos said menedemos snorted though sostratos was probably right again when sostratos woke up on the aphrodites poop deck he needed a moment to remember in which citys harbor the ship lay kos samos khios no this was mytilene on lesbos the wind blew from the north and carried the city stink of dung and smoke and sweat and garbage from the part of the polis on lesbos proper straight into the harbor when sostratos was inside a city he stopped noticing the smell after a while going out to sea though reminded him of it whenever he came back to port he sat up rubbing his eyes the eastern sky the sky above the anatolian mainland was gray with advancing dawn menedemos still snored beside him that seldom happened more often than not menedemos woke before him and diokles still slept sitting up on a rowers bench leaning against the planks of the ships side sostratos rubbed his eyes again wondering whether to believe themhe couldnt remember the last time hed got up ahead of the keleustes he got to his feet and walked naked to the rail to ease himself even one man moving about gave the merchant galley a small but perceptible motion enough to rouse both menedemos and diokles hail menedemos said not such a sleepyhead as usual eh oh go howl sostratos said sleeping later than you do doesnt make me a lazy wretch no eh since when menedemos got out from under his himation he too didnt bother with clothes while sleeping he used his waddedup chiton for a cushion he came over and stood beside sostratos diokles stood up and stretched sostratos said i still think youd be more comfortable if you lay down when you slept the oarmaster tossed his head that may be fine for other people but not for me i got used to sleeping sitting up when i pulled an oar and nothing else has felt right since i have no quarrel with what anybody else does and i dont see why anyone else should have a quarrel with what i do i have no quarrel with it sostratos said it just seems strange menedemos grinned impishly and when you have a girl diokles do you sit up and put her on your lap sometimes diokles replied unruffled its as good that way as any other dont you think its pretty good any which way menedemos turned to sostratos now that would be something useful for philosophers to do my dear figure out which way its best i mean its as pindaros sayscustom is king of all sostratos answered besides what one man likes most another likes least so who can say what best is if you go to a brothel the girls charge you most for riding you like a racehorse diokles said they must think thats the best not necessarily sostratos said they might charge more because they have to do the most work that way if they just bend forward the man behind them is thrusting home with his spear and they dont need to do much at all menedemos laughed well this is an interesting way to start the morning more fun than breakfast i will say from gray the eastern sky went to pink and then to gold the sailors whod spent the night on the aphroditeinstead of going into mytilene to drink and wench got up one by one before long they were arguing about the best way to do it they got no answer that would have satisfied a scholar at the lykeion but they had fun too after a barley roll dipped in olive oil and a cup of watered wine sostratos said shall we find the agora and see what we can learn about wine merchants and truffle sellers sounds good to me menedemos tilted his head back and emptied his cup he wiped his mouth on the back of his hand lets go they walked up the gangplank and down the quay as they passed a longshoreman sostratos asked him where the market square was the mytilenean might have been stricken with an advanced case of idiocy he scratched his head pulled at his lower lip frowned and generally gave the impression of a man who had a hard time remembering his own name let alone anything harder sostratos didnt need to have read hippokrates to know how to cure that malady as he had with the other longshoreman he gave the man an obolos sure enough silver proved the proper drug intelligence blossomed on the mytileneans face he pointed north into the part of the polis on lesbos and gave quick confident directions finishing you cant miss it i hope not sostratos muttered as they crossed the bridge up this street here did he say menedemos asked thats right sostratos answered he could see the grid of the city in his head and see which way they should go hed needed years to realize most people couldnt do that the wind blew strongly out of the north menedemos said a good thing were not coming up to lesbos today we wouldnt get anywhere fast no we wouldnt sostratos stopped and rubbed at his eyes the breeze had blown a speck of dust into them more dust swirled past heres a town where the hippodamian grid isnt everything you wish it were he said rubbing again they shouldnt have made the streets all run northsouth and eastwest the north wind just races down these long straight avenues if youre going to have a grid menedemos began sostratos tossed his head no no if theyd rotated it through half a right angle then it would be fine the wind would be blocked the way things are though its unpleasant it sure is now his cousin paused to rub at his face and get some grit out of his eye miserable wind im glad we dont live here all year around i wouldnt want to live anywhere but rhodes sostratos said counting street corners so hed know when to turn not even athens menedemos asked slyly sostratos had to think about that he had to think so hard he almost lost track of the corners at last though he tossed his head no my dear not even athens its a wonderful place to study and the theater is the finest in the world but its not what it was in the time of perikles and sokrates and platon the people have lost too many wars and they know it they still call themselves free and autonomous the way so many poleis do these days but its nothing a rhodian would recognize as freedom and what they call democracy he tossed his head again demetrios of phaleron runs things for kassandros and theres a macedonian garrison to make sure nothing unfortunate happens and if anyone says anything demetrios doesnt like he disappears menedemos asked sometimesnot always i admit sostratos replied demetrios studied philosophy himself and he makes a mild tyranta tolerable tyrant if you dont mind the contradiction things could be worse there but they could be a lot better too and we turn here i think this must be the temple to hera that fellow in the harbor was talking about he swung to the left id say so menedemos agreed and followed him he pointed down the long straight street and id say thats the agora ahead looks like it sounds like it too sostratos couldnt help smiling all over hellas market squares were the same even if they looked different the agora was the beating heart of a polis not just the place where men bought and sold things but also where they gathered to gossip and trade news sidon and jerusalem werent like this i dont know about jerusalemi wasnt therebut sidon certainly wasnt and not just because i didnt speak the language menedemos said the phoenicians didnt care about gathering and talking things over the way we do neither did the ioudaioi sostratos ran his fingers through his hair and flicked at his beard to get rid of any crumbs that might have clung there but now were among hellenes you bet we are menedemos threw back his shoulders and strutted into the agora as if all the mytileneansnone of whom had ever seen him beforeshould have known exactly who he was hurrying along behind him sostratos couldnt help laughing softly his cousin always made a procession even if it was a procession of one this will be a procession of two sostratos thought and also put his best foot forward and people did look up from their buying and selling and arguing when the two rhodians walked into the market square hail friends menedemos said loudly his doric accent helping him stand out when most other men spoke sibilant oddly stressed aiolic were off the aphrodite the akatos from rhodes that came in yesterday were bound for athens and were looking for fine wine and truffles and whatever else we can find that the rich athenians might like half a dozen hands shot up here come see what ive got merchants called as sostratos and menedemos made their way through the crowd towards a winesellers stall a fellow whose main stock in trade seemed to be linen goods thrust something at them and said what do you think of this a rock sostratos said at the same time menedemos said a chunk of wood that made them both stop and take a closer look sostratos took the chunkit was a little smaller than a mans fistfrom the linenseller and hefted it it is stone he said but youre right menedemosit looks like wood chuckling menedemos said well that gryphons skull we found a couple of years ago was bone that seemed turned to stone maybe this is what it ate sostratos didnt laugh now he dipped his head maybe it is he turned to the mytilenean whod shown it to them this came from the western part of your island isnt that so why yes best one the local said in surprise but how did you know that theophrastos with whom i studied in athens comes from lesbos he talks about this wood turned to stone though ive never seen it before hes even written a book called on petrifaction by the dog menedemos said ive heard of books about some odd things but that may be the strangest one yet would you like to buy this chunk of ah petrified wood the linenseller asked five drakhmai doesnt seem like much does it for a rock sostratos said youre joking o marvelous one thinking of the gryphons skull pained him as it always did but it wasnt the sort of pain a rock that looked likeor perhaps wasa chunk of wood could assuage sensing as much the mytilenean looked disappointed the way you were throwing those big words around i figured youd think five drakhmai was cheap well friend youd better try some new figuring sostratos said i might buy it if you name me a halfway reasonable price on the other hand i might not too a lump of woody rock isnt something you have to have unless youre planning on bashing in a rascally linensellers brains ha menedemos said i like that by the way the local chuckled he thought it was funny too youre a clever fellow athenian what do you say to three drakhmai then i say two things sostratos answered the first is im no athenian you talk like one the linenseller said i studied there but im from rhodes sostratos was more pleased than not that his accent could be taken for attic he wasnt pleased enough to pay three drakhmai the other thing i say is farewell he and menedemos started on their way wait the linenseller said what would you pay i might give you three oboloi if i happened to feel generous sostratos said i certainly wouldnt give you any more than that three oboloi the mytilenean looked as if hed just taken a big swig of vinegar thinking it wine sullenly he thrust the lump of wood that was also a lump of stone toward sostratos take it then if you want it have a good sime sostratos wondered if he ought to take it at any price but it left him too curious to walk away he gave the linenseller three little silver coins and took the wood made stone from him the mytilenean looked much less dour with money in his hands what will you do with that menedemos asked as they went through the agora i dont know ill probably take it back to rhodes and keep it as a curiosity sostratos answered not much point showing it off in athensas i said theophrastos and the other natural philosophers already know about this kind of thing he plucked at his beard considering that means ill put the three oboloi on my own personal account not the firms i wasnt worrying about that menedemos said nobodyll get excited about half a drakhma oh i know but its only fair sostratos said if you bent a woman forward for three oboloi you wouldnt charge that to the firm youd better not anyhow i might if i didnt have somebody like you watching me menedemos said better i should catch you than your father sostratos said at which his cousin looked as sour as the linenseller had a little while before he went on lets see if we can find out about wine merchants and people who sell truffles shall we thats why were here after all they had to spend a drakhma and a half an obolos at a time to find out what they needed to know that bothered sostratos less than it might have for hed expected nothing different they also spent a few oboloi for fried octopus a fellow with a brazier emitting an irresistible smell strolled through the agora collecting names wasnt hard two sostratos heard often were those of onesimos and his brother onetor from that he concluded the longshoreman at the quay probably had been doing his best to talk about men who might actually help that left him relieved and a little surprised hed spent far more than two oboloi other places and achieved far less the rhodians also got one more name that of phainias son of poseides the rhodian proxenos at mytilene sostratos gave a youth an obolos to go tell phainias they would like to call on him and to bring back his reply a quarter of an hour later the youngster found him and menedemos in the agora panting a little he said best ones he already knew your ship was here he invites you to supper this evening and says you may sleep at his home if you care to beaming sostratos gave him another coin beaming the youth ran off beaming menedemos said he knows how to sound like a proxenos by zeus now well see what sort of table he sets when one of his house slaves led menedemos and sostratos into his courtyard phainias bowed himself almost double welcome welcome three simes welcome most noble ones he exclaimed he was about forty his hair thinning at the temples though his smoothshaved face helped him look younger hed probably been a striking youth now a double chin and the beginnings of a pot belly said he didnt get to the gymnasion often enough bowing again he went on youre intrepid the two of you i didnt expect to see rhodians so early in the sailing season if we go out first were more likely to reap the profit menedemos said politely he added is there anything of yours we can take on to athens phainias tossed his head thank you thats most kindly meant but no i deal in olive oil after all and theres not much point shipping that there menedemos shot sostratos a glance that said this fellow can see that why cant your polluted brotherinlaw by sostratos expression he was thinking the same thing menedemos looked around the courtyard handsome place you have here he said bees buzzed above flowers and herbs in the garden a fountain splashed gently a bronze artemis half life size stood on a column drawing a bow youre too kind best one phainias said as he spoke a slave woman came out of the kitchen and picked some chervil from the garden menedemos smiled at her maybe phainias would tell her to keep his bed warm tonight sostratos didnt seem to notice the woman his mind still on business he said another reason were out early is to get to athens before the greater dionysia ah you want to go to the theater do you phainias smiled i dont blame you a bit as long as youre bound for athens you may as well have a good sime as sostratos spoke a doric flavored with attic so phainias aiolic dialect had the same overlay he was plainly an educated man every so often though his own speech pattern showed through he went on ill do everything i can to send you on your way quickly youre a prince of proxenoi o best one menedemos said flattery yes but flattery with a lot of truth in it like any proxenos phainias represented and helped another polis citizens in his native city that could entail considerable effort and expense some men took on the job for the sake of its prestige and then scanted it phainias looked to want to do it right he bowed again at menedemos compliment youre very kind most noble one as i told you a moment ago come into the andron if you please well have some wine some supper some more winenot a real symposion mind you but you can go to bed happy if thats what youre looking for does it please you it pleases very much menedemos answered quickly before sostratos could his cousins shoulders went up and down in a tiny shrug sostratos seldom cared to go to bed happy with wine well too bad menedemos thought i feel like it and he can go along this is a very fine andron sostratos said when they stepped up into itlike most it was raised half a cubit or so above the level of the courtyard and the other rooms slaves were taking away stools and setting out couches for a more formal supper a mosaic of colored pebbles decorated the floor the walls were painted red up to the height of a mans shoulder and ocher above that several lampssome pottery others bronzehung from bronze chains fixed to the beams of the ceiling menedemos didnt think hed seen anything fancier this side of taras and the italiote hellenes indulged themselves far more extravagantly than did their cousins who lived round the aegean stretch out relax make yourselves at home phainias said and leaned on his left elbow on one of the couches again menedemos and sostratos exchanged glances at home they almost always ate sitting on stools so did most hellenes so did phainias himself or he wouldnt have had to move couches into the andron for the supposed pleasure of the rhodians the wicker frame of menedemos couch creaked under his weight as he settled himself on it for a moment he thought he would go right through it and end up on the floor with a bump that would have been a lovely way to ingratiate himself with his host but the couch held he smiled at the rhodian proxenos very nice very nice indeed sostratos echoed he sounded a little too hearty like a usually prim man paying inexpert court to a hetaira as he leaned on his elbow he looked out of place too two slaves brought in wine water a mixing bowl and cups phainias asked well gentlemen does one of wine to two of water suit you or would you like some other mix thats fine menedemos said sostratos dipped his head menedemos added we thank you again for your kindness one of wine to two of water was a little on the strong side but only a little not even sostratos could possibly object to it as he might have if phainias had proposed a onetoone mixture phainias and the two rhodians poured out small libations before drinking sostratos raised his cup in salute to our host he said and drank so did menedemos sostratos took another more thoughtful sip this is very fine is it lesbian it is indeed phainias answered youre in the market for wine arent you we sure are menedemos said from whom did you get it why from onesimos son of diothemis the proxenos said he lives two doors down from me hes the onesimos whose brother sells truffles menedemos asked and phainias dipped his head the rhodian asked does onetor also live close by here on the next street north phainias said would it put you to too much trouble to invite them here so we could get to meet them menedemos asked if it would be difficult best one just tell me no i dont want to impose on your kind hospitality no bother to me phainias said i like onesimos fine i dont know onetor so well but he seems a good enough fellow let me go ask my cook if he can add a couple of guests at the last minute you know how it is im sure the man who runs the kitchen thinks he runs the house too oh yes menedemos dipped his head thinking of sikon so did sostratos though his familys cook wasnt such a domineering tyrant the proxenos got to his feet and left the andron a moment later a shriek came from the direction of the kitchen menedemos and sostratos grinned at each other phainias returned a couple of minutes later looking somewhat the worse for wear its all settled he declared ive sent slaves out to invite the two brothers he dipped a fresh cup of wine from the mixing bowl now what will happen is neither of them will be able to come on such short nosice and kandaules will brain me for making him cook too much my experience is theres no such thing as too much opson menedemos said sostratos looked alarmed at that forthright announcement of gluttony but phainias only smiled yes ive seen that myself he said here would you like some more wine thanks best one menedemos held out his cup so did sostratos phainias was dipping wine out of the bowl for him when a slave hurried to the front door master onesimos is here he called good good phainias said bring two more couches into the andronquick quick quick his brothers coming too or i hope he is onesimos son of diothemis was a tall dour man of middle years with a long face a big nose one front tooth that had gone black and some of the hairiest ears menedemos had ever seen good to meet you both he told the rhodians his voice a rumbling bass if i remember right i did business with your fathers ten or twelve years ago i wouldnt be surprised most noble one menedemos said lesbian wine is famous and our firm has always liked to carry the best a pair of harassedlooking slaves brought in couches onesimos had just reclined on one when somebody rapped loudly on the front door onetor son of diothemis came in a minute later he was a couple of digits shorter than his brother and shiny bald where onesimos irongray hair like phainias was only just beginning to recede at the temples but for that they looked much alike menedemos wouldnt have cared to guess which was the elder nice to meet you rhodians onetor said his voice was deep too but not quite so deep as onesimos he dipped his head to phainias and very nice of you to invite me we should get to know each other better just what i was thinking phainias replied and supper and wine and maybe some business thrown in make a pleasant excuse for doing exactly that we might do business ourselves you know you and i onetor said truffles can give olive oil their flavor if they soak in it thats an interessing thought phainias said that is an interesting thought menedemos and sostratos spoke together menedemos wondered how much rich jaded athenians might pay for oil with such an exotic flavoring sostratos must have been thinking the same thing for he said we might do business with you too phainias id like that best oneas long as you dont haggle too hard the proxenos chuckled the slave woman at whom menedemos had smiled brought in a tray with loaves of wheat bread on it he smiled again she gave him a quick smile in return as she set a loaf on the low table in front of his couch phainias said that can wait though for now we should enjoy our supper without worrying about such things another slave set bowls of oil on the table to go with the sitos like any hellene with manners menedemos and sostratos ate bread with their left hands sostratos said good oil most noble oneand i know a little about what makes good oil for my sisters husband exports it from rhodes but not this year not with us menedemos thought i wouldnt give guests anything but my best phainias said very good oil onetor agreed if you were to steep truffles in an amphora or two of this oil you could pour it into little lekythoi afterwards and sell each one for a nice price so you could menedemos gave the mytilenean a thoughtful nod meeting you may be a profitable pleasure for all of us you certainly know the right words to say onetor seemed less intense than onesimos who concentrated on his food to the exclusion of everything else kaloi kagathoi look down their noses at profit but the world would grind to a halt without it and soon too my cousin and i were saying the same thing not long ago sostratos said just because youve got a fancy pedigree that doesnt mean youre not a fool onetor said here comes the opson phainias said if anything could distract from talk of profit that was likely to do the trick as a slave brought in a big tray the proxenos went on kandaules has baked bellypieces from a lovely great tunny he bought at the fish market this afternoon oh demeter onesimos could speak after alland reverently too i wish i were like that fellow from kythera menedemos said whats his name sostratos you know the one i meanthe chap who used to stick his hand in boiling water and drink hot things all the time so he could snatch opson from the platter and eat it when it was still too hot for anybody else to touch philoxenos sostratos said philoxenos thats who he was all right menedemos said you must be doing well for yourself phainiastheres some poet or other who says bellypieces from a fat tunny are something a poor man never sees thats eriphos i think sostratos came up with the name even when menedemos hadnt asked for it phainias said i am doing pretty well for myself thanks good of you to nosice few hellenes who were doing well hid it or failed to boast of it the only reason menedemos could see for modesty was fooling a taxcollector savory steam rose from the tunny menedemos didntquite burn his hand when he took a piece from the platter he didnt quiteburn his mouth when he tasted it when he said mm thats good he did talk with his mouth full all the other compliments that rose were similarly muffled so he knew not the least embarrassment the only complaint he might have made was that he got a little less tunny than he would have liked but he understood that too kandaules suddenly had to feed more guests than hed expected but then a slave came in with a bowl of stewed eels wrapped in beet leaves and he stopped worrying about getting enough opson sostratos said surely rhodes has no finer proxenos in any polis around the inner sea he was talking with his mouth full again but nobody seemed to mind a honey cake sprinkled with walnuts finished the supper onetor said youre a prince of hospitality phainias you can put me in a cart and roll me home because ive eaten too much to walk glad you enjoyed it my friends phainias said as the slaves cleared away what little hadnt been eaten they brought in wine and water and the mixing bowl once more did you get that jar from me onesimos asked of course best one phainias said would i serve anything else before supper the rhodians and i were drinking onetotwo does that please you onesimos dipped his head onetor said anything stronger and rolling me home wouldnt do youd have to carry me instead since it wasnt a formal symposion they didnt bother with the small taste of neat wine first or the prayer to dionysos that went with it there were no flutegirls or other entertainers the rhodians and mytileneans just drank and talked and drank and talked phainias slaves poured wine for them kept the mixing bowl full and added oil to the lamps much of the talk not surprisingly revolved around politics phainias and onetor admired antigonos whose garrison held lesbos onesimos by his occasional comments despised all the macedonian marshals unfortunately they wont go away sostratos said maybe theyll all kill each other off with not one of them left alive onesimos said gods grant it be so even if it is some cousin or lieutenant general will rally their armies and the wheel will start to turn again sostratos predicted such things will go on as long as there are men and battles that made onesimos look more dour than ever it didnt make menedemos particularly happy either but he thought his cousin was right he said i wish i could like antigonos more than i do hes the best of the macedonians far and away phainias said it could be most noble one and i would not quarrel with my host even if his kindness were far less than youve shown sostratos and me menedemos said still id be lying if i said i was altogether happy with old oneeye hes too friendly with pirates to let a seaman be comfortable praising him they dont trouble us onetor said that was the answer right there in a nutshell menedemos knew as much the mytileneans overlooked evil that didnt touch them but then he realized he and sostratos did the same thing he hadnt worried much about brigands on land till his cousin had to cross phoenicia and ioudaia to get to engedi by the lake of asphalt thinking about troubles that didnt usually touch one was more trouble than it was worth for most people after a while onesimos got to his feet saying pleasure to make your acquaintance rhodians i hope we can do some business id better head on home now gait a little unsteady he made his way toward the front door as soon as he was out of earshot phainias spoke in a low voice his wife nags him if he stays out too late onetor chuckled my brothers wife nags him even if he doesnt stay out too late from what he says thats all she ever does i wonder what she would say sostratos remarked who cares onetor said shes only a woman after all he drained his cup id better go home too though while i sill remember the way shall i send a slave along with a torch phainias asked not when im just going around the block thanks for the kind offer though best one and thanks for invising me over onetor said you and the rhodians should think about truffleflavored oil we will phainias said and menedemos and sostratos both dipped their heads once onetor had left menedemos told phainias i dont think well last much longer either sostratos yawn showed he agreed hereweve got beds waising for you most noble ones the rhodian proxenos said come with me and ill show you he took a lamp off its chain to light his way to the back part of the house menedemos and sostratos followed menedemos planted his feet with care not wanting to step in a hole he didnt see and fall down phainias pointed ahead these two rooms here menedemos suspected theyd been storerooms till the mytileneans slaves brought in the beds that didnt bother him phainias was doing the rhodians a favor by putting them up at all he wasnt an innkeeper he didnt have guests often enough to keep rooms permanently ready for them now lamplight spilled out from under the doors phainias said the nights a little on the chilly side my friends so i hope you sleep warm ill see you in the morning he headed for the stairs which room do you want menedemos asked sostratos ill take the one on the left his cousin answered and went in when menedemos opened the other door he wasnt surprised to find a slave woman sitting on the bed he did grin to find hed ended up with the woman hed noticed before hail sweetheart he said are you supposed to help me sleep warm thats right sir she answered her aiolic accent flavored with something elseshe wasnt a hellene by birth whats your name menedemos asked people here call me kleis she said it will do im used to it they cant say the one i was born with she would have come from somewhere on the anatolian mainland menedemos guessed she had a round face a strong nose very black hair and eyes a bit of dark down on her upper lip he thought she was two or three years older than hejust on the other side of thirty well kleis menedemos said is it all right some slave women hated giving themselves to men menedemos knew a few men who enjoyed taking them all the more because they hated it to him they were more trouble than they were worth but kleis noddedanother proof she was no hellene yes its all right she said what else have i got to do for fun she stood up and pulled her long chiton off over her head her breasts were full and heavy with big dark nipples menedemos took off his tunic and bent his head to themfirst one then the other she made a small wordless noise down in her throat smiling menedemos straightened i hope itll be fun he slid an arm around her waist which was surprisingly slim lets find out they lay down on the bed together sostratos dreamt something had fallen on him so that he couldnt move his legs had he been in an earthquake had sacks of grain piled high waiting to go aboard a round ship toppled and pinned him down he didnt know he couldnt remember he only knew he was trapped he opened his eyesand stared into the face of a sleeping woman only a palm or so from his own her bare thigh warm and soft was draped over his no wonder he couldnt movebut he hadnt been dreaming about such a pleasant trap her eyes opened too they were greenish blue the hair that framed her freckled face foxy red like threissa back on rhodes she came from the lands north of the aegean good day gongyla sostratos said did i make a noise and wake you i was having a strange dream she shook her head no sir i dont think so she sounded like threissa too though she was several years older i just woke up i think all right sostratos shifted on the narrow bed gongyla took her leg off his his hand brushed her breast he let it rest there and idly hardly even noticing what he was doing began to tease her nipple with thumb and forefinger so early she said frowning a little he hadnt really been thinking about having her but he was still on the randy side of thirty her question decided him yes why not he said a slave woman never had an answer to that sostratos did his best to warm her up he wasnt sure his best did the job as he had been the night before she still sulked even after he gave her a couple of oboloi menedemos would either have ignored that or jollied her into a better mood sostratos not callous enough for the one tried the other saying you have a pretty name not mine gongyla said you hellenes took mine gave me this one by the way she scowled at sostratos he might have done it personally but its a famous name among us he said famous how her eyes called him a liar gongylathe first gongyla i know ofwas a friend of the great poet sappho here on lesbos perhaps three hundred years ago sostratos wasnt sure exactly when sappho had lived but this gongyla wouldnt know either who remembers so long how the slave woman asked people wrote down sapphos poems sostratos answered thats how they remember themand the people in them squiggles marks gongyla couldnt read sostratos would have been astonished had she proved literate even among hellenes few women were she brushed back a lock of coppery hair that had fallen down onto her nose not least for its strangeness red hair fascinated and attracted sostratos gongyla frowned in thought but these squiggles these marks they make this name remembered thats right sostratos dipped his head maybe something to wrising after all the thracian woman said her greek had an aiolic accent too i just thought it was for keeping track of oil and money and things like that she hesitated then asked is kleis in this sappho s poems too yesshe was the poets daughter a woman poet gongyla noticed the feminine endings thats right sostratos said again how funny gongyla got out of bed pulled the chamber pot out from under it squatted over the pot and then put on her chiton sostratos also pissed into the pot then he got dressed too he noticed gongyla eyeing him as he might have examined some bird hed never seen before that chanced to perch in the aphrodites rigging you know strange things many strange things she remarked yes thats true sostratos agreed most people noticed not many noticed it as soon as gongyla had someone knocked on the door you in there my dear menedemos called you doing anything you dont want to stop just now no weve taken care of that sostratos replied have you how efficient menedemos said well in that case come out and have some breakfast all right sostratos stomach growled waking up in bed with a woman had kept him from noticing how hungry he was appetites and appetites he thought he opened the door when menedemos got a look at gongyla he started to laugh now i understand he said youve got a weakness for redheads i saw as much with that keltic girl of yours back in taras a few years ago i wouldnt call it a weakness sostratos said with dignity more of a taste he waited for his cousin to make an aristophanic pun on that but menedemos just said come on have some porridge and some wine then we can go talk to onesimos and onetor do you want to go together to each of them in turn or shall we beard them separately id just as soon do them separately if its all the same to you sostratos answered as they walked toward the andron well save time that way you can haggle over wine as well as i can and ill dicker with the truffleseller menedemos chuckled i might have known youd want to split things like that dont spend so much time asking onetor questions about truffles that you forget to buy any phainias was already eating breakfast in the mens chamber when sostratos and menedemos walked in hail best ones the proxenos said good day to you both he used the dual number in talking about the two rhodians it seemed natural in his speech but would have been hopelessly oldfashioned on rhodes i hope you passed pleasant nights i bent kleis like a lioness on a cheese grater menedemos said phainias laughed sostratos wondered where his cousin had come up with that figure of speech then realized it probably came from aristophanes he said i enjoyed myself with gongyla too do you name all your slave women after people from sappho s poems youre clever for spotting that phainias said not everyone does i didnt menedemos said but youre right most noble onehe is a clever fellow the rhodian proxenos went on as a matter of fact i do makes it easier for me to remember what to call them i dont think im the only one on mytilene who does the same thing either its efficient sostratos said borrowing menedemos word makes perfectly good sense to me a male slave came in with porridge for him and menedemos salt fish and bits of chopped olive livened up what would otherwise have been a bland bowl of barley mush sostratos dug in with a horn spoon between bites he asked you said onetors house was around the block from you thats right phainias answered go one street north then turn left onetor lives in the third house on the lefthand side of the street one street north left third house on the left sostratos dipped his head thanks ill remember that he will too menedemos said and if we come back here next year hell still remember it then he sounded half proud half wary about sostratos memory im not a trained monkey sostratos said you dont need to show me off nothing wrong with keeping track of things in your head phainias said i only wish i were better at it once sostratos had finished breakfast he said im going to head over to onetors were up and the suns up so he ought to be up too when he went north from phainias house the breeze blew straight down the street and straight into his face he was glad he had to walk only one block before turning then the houses on the north side of the eastwest street shielded him from the worst of the wind he ran his fingers through his hair trying to look as neat as he could at the third house on the left he knocked on the door whos there someone called from within is this the house of onetor son of diothemis thats right who are you im sostratos son of lysistratos one of the rhodians onetor dined with last night id like to talk business with him wait a minute the door soon opened a redheaded thracian slavea manstood aside to let sostratos in my master is finishing breakfast in the andron he asks if youve eaten yes thanks sostratos replied the thracian led him through the entry hall and into the courtyard onetor put down a winecup to wave to him he waved back saying hail most noble one hail onetor raised the cup to his lips once more ive got a headache from last night he said a little more wine will take the edge off it are you hungry we have plenty i ate with phainias sostratos said i hope im not too early for you oh no dont be silly best one onetor tossed his head the suns in the sky so anybody whos not ready for business has only himself to blame im no pampered persian slugabed to crawl out from under my blanket at noon my wife was working in the garden sill you knocked im sure shes finding something to do upstairs now good thats all right then oh thank you a slave came into the andron with a cup of watered wine for sostratos he took a sip then went on tell me about truffles if youd be so kind what do you want to know grades prices that sort of thing not yet i was hoping youd just tell me about them they dont grow on rhodes and id like to know as much as i can both so i can tell my customers more and because im a curious sort myself yes i nosiced that at phainias last night onetor said youve got that attic way of talking did you study at the academy no at the lykeion under theophrastos sostratos answered thats another reason im interested theophrastos makes a specialty of plants so i always like it when i get the chance to add to what he taught me well all right onetor answered sostratos would have been surprised if hed refused few people could resist talking about what they did for a living the truffleseller continued you may or may not have heard they grow underground yes i did know that sostratos said ive also heard they grow best after rainy seasons where theres plenty of thunder ive heard that too but i dont believe it onetor replied ive never seen it make one bit of difference if there isnt much rain in a rainy season thats another story they dont do so well then but what crop does fair enough sostratos said that certainly stands to reason what sort of soil do they prefer sandy usuallyyou often find them close by the seashore how do you find them sostratos asked you cant just dig at random on a beach onetor hesitated then seemed to decide it was safe to answer if there were truffles on rhodes i dont think id tell you he said you might turn into a compesitor but ive never heard of them there either so i suppose i can say something about that anyhow for one thing theres a certain kind of grasswe call it truffleleafthat grows above them that gives me a clue where to look what does this grass look like sostratos asked onetor smiled and didnt say a thing all right all rightforget i wanted to know sostratos told him you said that was one thing whats another when im out hunsing truffles i have help onetor said what kind of help again onetor didnt answer sostratos realized hed learned about as much as he was going to a dog wandered into the andron a flopeared mutt with its tongue lolling out onetor scratched it under the chin and behind those floppy ears its tail wagged frantically friendly beast sostratos remarked porpax yes id say so onetor scratched the dog again it tried to jump up into his lap careful you silly thing he said fending it off youll make me spill wine on myself you named him after the handle of a shield sostratos said it was a fairly common name for a dog does he shield your house from burglars he makes a good enough watchdog yes onetor said as if to prove it porpax barked though he didnt seem to want to go after sostratos the rhodian in fact wondered if he was too friendly to make a proper watchdog if he wouldnt fawn on the thieves when he was supposed to bite onetor said he has other uses too such as sostratos didnt mean anything by the question he was just making conversation but once more onetor declined to answer the smug way he didnt answer made sostratos wonder if porpax was somehow connected to the truffle trade that struck him as unlikely though why would a dog want anything to do with fungi porpax ran off yapping the slave came back this time with a bowl of barley porridge and a spoon sostratos tossed his head no thanks he said as i told your master i had breakfast before i came here but onetor said try this anyhow most noble one it has some shaved truffles in it to give you a notion of the flavor in that case i will sostratos said the first thing he noticed was the rich almost meaty aroma rising from the porridge when he tasted it his eyebrows flew upwards he knew he shouldnt show how impressed he was sometimes though a man simply couldnt help himself if hed said he didnt care for the flavor onetor would have known he was lying thats very fine he managed at last and ate up the porridge as fast as he could glad you like it onetor said i wouldnt want you to buy without knowing what youre gessing i can see why sostratos said a little ruefully or maybe more than a little hed known truffles were expensive now he understood the reason he wondered just how much onetor would try to squeeze out of him do you think youd be interested in taking my goods to athens the truffleseller asked im sure id be interested sostratos answered whether i can afford them is likely to be a different question onetor grinned at him he could grin he wasnt nearly so gloomy as onesimos he said for top grade i charge three simes the truffles weight in silver i dont haggle if you want them thats what youll pay you wont find anybody cheaper in mytilene and you wont find anybody with better goods any trader could say that from the frequency with which onetors name had come up in the agora he was the leading truffle dealer in town sostratos supposed he could charge six or eight drakhmai in athens for each drakhmas weight of truffles but there might be a better way do you have to have silver he asked or can we trade goods for goods and both resell at a profit that depends onetor said what have you got papyrus and ink from egypt sostratos began onetor tossed his head sostratos said i did expect those would do better in athens ive also got koan silk which is worth its weight in silver too its pretty stuff but im not interested in it the truffleseller said kos isnt that far from here silks fairly common on lesbos all right best one sostratos said i have fine beeswax from ioudaia anyone can find beeswax onetor broke in all you have to do is know how not to get stung the aphrodite carries fine wine from byblos with a bouquet as sweet as ariousians sostratos said im not making that up we carried ariousian to great hellas a few years ago and this wine has a nose to match it let everything be as you say most noble one and it sill wouldnt matter much to me onetor replied onesimos is the wine merchant in the family he might be interested in this vintage from far away but im not except maybe to taste a cup what else have you got on that akatos embroidered linen cloth from mesopotamia sostratos said fine perfume from rhodes the island of roses and genuine balsam from engedi on the lake of asphalt in ioudaia the finest balsam in the world balsam eh onetor scowled what do you want for that its something i might be able to get rid of here on lesbos they sell it in ioudaia for twice its weight in silver sostratos answered somesimes they sell it here in hellas for twice its weight in silver too onetor said pointedly not always sostratos said just as pointedly and if i paid twice its weight and i did im not going to let it go for no profit if you buy it from me you wont sell it at your buying price either all that may be trueif you paid what you say you paid but who knows about that onetor sent sostratos a sour stare merchants are born liars no doubt you would know being one yourself sostratos said onetors expression got blacker sostratos gave him a polite seated bow we can go on insulting each other best one or we can do business which would you rather now the mytilenean frankly stared youre a cool customer arent you i try to stay cool and i would like to be a customer sostratos replied shall we talk about balsam and truffles or shall we go on and on about what a thief each of us thinks the other one is to his surprise onetor started to laugh you are a cool customer furies take me if youre not all right my dear lets talk about trading truffles for balsam and just how much balsam youll give for a drakhmas weight of my fungi maybe perfume too now that i think of it sostratos hadnt expected anyone to be interested in balsam till he got to athens but he had a good notion of the most he could hope to get for it there that clearly was less than he could get for truffles because onetor had annoyed him he named an outrageous price to open the dicker as hed hoped the truffleseller bawled like a castrated colt sostratos came down but because hed started so high he came down to a price he still liked onetor had made a mistake setting the value of his truffles so firmly as the dicker started hed made it plain he wouldnt come down but he couldnt very well go up from the three drakhmai of silver for each drakhmas weight of truffles either sostratos was more flexible and took advantage of that when haggling over both the balsam and the perfume at last he and the mytilenean settled on prices that left neither of them too dissatisfied while were talking here my cousin is dickering with your brother sostratos remarked i hope onesimos comes out of the deal with all his fingers and toes onetor said if menedemos is anywhere near as sharp as you are best one hes too good for us poor fellows who stay in one polis all our days you give me too much credit most noble one sostratos murmured not at all displeased at onetors flattery and he went on truthfully you dont give yourself enough i think this is a bargain where well both end up showing a nice profit i wouldnt mind onetor said for a while there i thought you were going to talk me out of my skin and sell it in the athenian agora whos your prettiest hetaira here id get a better price for hers sostratos said onetor laughed the rhodian asked can you have your truffles ready this afternoon ill have sailors bring the balsam and perfume here then if that pleases you it pleases me fine and if youre going to get an amphora or two of phainias oil and flavor it with truffles you might also want to arrange to buy lekythoi here in mytilene so you can sell the oil from the small jars kallikrates son of kalligenes can probably sell you enough of them to do the job without making you wait sostratos wondered if this kallikrates would give onetor a kickback but getting away in a hurry did matter ill talk with him he said wheres his pottery not far from here phainias can give you directions he buys all his amphorai from kallikrates onetor said that made sostratos feel better if the rhodian proxenos bought from kallikrates the man was likelier to be reputable when he and menedemos met at phainias house he found his cousin jubilant well take lesbian to athens along with the byblian menedemos said do you know what i did do you know he was almost beside himself with glee no sostratos replied but i suspect youre going to tell me i traded him ten jars of byblian for thirty of his best menedemos said ten for thirty can you believe it euge sostratos and phainias both spoke together the proxenos went on how did you pry such a bargain out of onesimos hes one of the singiest men i know you wont tell him menedemos asked by zeus best one i wont phainias promised it would go against my duty as proxenosand besides onesimos should deal in vinegar hes so sour well i thought so too menedemos said we were talking about wine and i made sure we tried his lesbian before he sent a slave down to the harbor to bring back my sailors with a jar of byblian for him to sample wed had quite a bit of his wine before then in fact he thought he was getting me drunk and pliable i had something else in mind though i think i know what sostratos said you are a sly rascal why thank you my dear beaming menedemos turned back to phainias when the slave and the sailors got back with the byblian we broached the amphora what you need to know about byblian is it has the most wonderful bouquet in the world maybe ariousian is as nice on the nose coming out of the jar but i cant think of any other wine that is he sniffed and smiled and went on when onetor got a whiff of it he was so excited he almost looked happy he must have been excited phainias said oh he was all right he was practically panting to make the deal as a matter of fact and then we tasted the byblian and that didnt queer things the way i feared it might the rhodian proxenos still wore a puzzled expression sostratos explained byblian is a funny wine its much nicer to the nose than it is to the palate but if onesimos had drunk a lot of his own lesbian beforehand thats right thats exactly right menedemos broke in once youve had a few cups of wine it all tastes pretty much the same unless its real donkey piss and byblians not that bad it just doesnt have a flavor to match its bouquet so when i sipped and praised it to the skies onesimos couldnt tell i was giving it more than it deserved he usually deals in local wines not ones from as far away as byblos so he wouldnt know that about your vintage phainias said which is what i was hoping for and which is what happened menedemos said happily he knows plenty about his own little corner of the business and so he thought he knew everything about all of it sostratos said when sokrates was defending himself before the athenians that was his complaint about artisans generally since his jury was probably full of them he was foolish to complain about them to their faces menedemos said before sostratos could rise to that his cousin continued me i dont want to get tangled up with the law in athens any which way things are more complicated there than anywhere else in hellas i think its a big polis far bigger even than rhodes sostratos said its no wonder everythings more complicated there having said that he couldnt very well go back and start a quarrel over menedemos gibe about sokrates menedemos grinned at him he pretended not to notice which only made menedemos grin more phainias said you people who do business in so many poleis are a wonder to me how do you keep everything straight i dont even try menedemos said i just count on sostratos he knows what all the various laws and customs are who coins heavy drakhmai and who light whats good in each town and whats not worth having and so on i already said he was a clever fellow the proxenos replied i would say youre not bad yourself and i would be right about that too menedemos is so clever he even thinks he can talk me into doing his share of the work sostratos said but im clever enough to see that and not to let him get away with it too often too bad menedemos said with great feeling go howl sostratos replied he and his cousin and phainias all smiled after a good day of trading why not come on you lugs diokles called as the aphrodite slid away from its mooring at mytilene put your backs into it its not like youre going to get heatstroke today youre right about that menedemos said from his station at the steering oars the day was cool and overcast the sky so gray he couldnt find the faintest trace of the sun it was in fact the sort of weather his father had warned him about while arguing against putting to sea too soon once more he reminded himself he owed sostratos nuisance of a brotherinlaw thanks for getting his father to change his mind that wasnt something menedemos himself had ever had much luck doing sostratos said if it stays like this were liable to have an interesting time navigating today sailing from here to athens well be crossing one of the wider landless stretches of the aegean it wont be that bad menedemos said hoping he was right well have psyra west of khios to sight on as we go west and skyros and euboia should be coming up over the horizon by the time psyra drops out of sight astern trueas long as the weather doesnt get any worse than this sostratos said if it starts raining though or if a fog rolls in menedemos spat into the bosom of his tunic to avert the omen after a moment his cousin did the same bad weather was the main reason ships seldom put to sea from the middle of autumn to the beginning of spring storms were the most dramatic worry but fog and mist might have been more dangerous not being able to tell where you were or to recognize landmarks till too late what could be more terrifying diokles said even in the fog weve got wind and wave and casting the line to keep us safe between knowing how deep the sea is and seeing what sort of stuff the lead brings up when it does touch bottom we ought to have a pretty fair notion of where we are thats right menedemos said loudly aiming his words not only at sostratos but at the crew as well he didnt want the men worrying hed end up in byzantion when he was aiming for athens he also didnt want them worrying hed tear the belly out of the akatos on a rock he didnt see soon enough he didnt want to worry about that himself though he knew it could happen if he wasnt careful maybe sostratos didnt want to worry about that either he changed the subject saying in a sly voice are you slipping best one you havent said a word about either phainias wife or onesimos i never saw phainias menedemos answered and he gave us girls so going after her wouldnt have been sporting of me would it that hasnt always stopped you sostratos observed he was right not caring to admit it menedemos said i did get a look at onesimos as a matter of fact she was about this tallhe held the palm of one hand flat against his chest just below the level of his nipplesand about this widehe took both hands off the tillers to stretch his arms wideso as far as im concerned onesimos is welcome to her the listening sailors laughed sostratos said shed be not far from our age wouldnt she do you suppose she was that fat when he wed her i wouldnt know and i dont much care to find out menedemos answered more women are like that than youd think they cant get out to the gymnasion to exercise the way men do they just stay inside the womens quarters and nibble all day long some men like them that way too for all i know onesimos is happy with her but she wasnt what i wanted a line of pelicans flew by not far from the ship menedemos admired their great white wings he wondered if one of them would glide down to the water and scoop out a fish with its long pouched beak but none did sostratos also followed them with his eyes he remarked they really do have heads shaped like axes dont they so they do menedemos said in greek the two words were very close in sound i never thought of that before he thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand wondering why not sostratos said i can imagine the first couple of hellenes who ever saw pelicans one of them turns to the other and says whats that and the second fellow goes i dont know but its got a head like an axe and the name would have stuck do you suppose thats how it happened menedemos asked intrigued i dont know i cant prove it but i wouldnt be surprised his cousin answered things like that must happen when people run into beasts theyve never seen before they have to call them something and they try to find a name that fits ill bet thats how those big beasts that live in the nile got called riverhorses hippopotamoi menedemos said thoughtfully and dipped his head ill bet youre right diokles spoke up sometimes people will make a joke of things too after all what do we hellenes call those big birds that live in the egyptian desert the ones that run faster than horses and kick like mules strouthoi menedemos and sostratos replied together they both started to laugh for in hellas the more common meaning for the word that also meant ostrich was sparrow menedemos said i can just see the first fellow who went down to egypt and got a good look at one of them hed turn to his friend and hed say by herakles thats the biggest sparrow i ever saw i think egypt did that to the first hellenes who went there sostratos said we made up names that kept us from showing how impressed we were why else would we have called those tall stone monuments obeliskoi well they do look like skewers dont they menedemos said we could have called them phalloi instead easy enough youre right sostratos said i hadnt thought of that his grin was lopsided and wry maybe its just as well they have the name they do the sun didnt come out the clouds didnt go away every so often the aphrodite made her way through mist or drizzle even when menedemos wasnt trying to peer through the spatters of moisture visibility stayed bad he sent a lookout to the foredeck doing all he could do avoid unpleasant surprises i wish we still had aristeidas sostratos said so do i menedemos said its not your fault we dont you know whom would you blame then his cousin asked how about the polluted ioudaioi who tried to rob you menedemos suggested i didnt shoot enough of them sostratos said morosely my dear you couldnt have shot more than you did not unless you were twinsand maybe not then if you hadnt shot as many of them as you did you and moskhion and teleutas would have got killed too would that have made you happier i didnt shoot enough of them sostratos said again and then very low teleutas he looked disgusted menedemos suspected his cousin wouldnt have been nearly so upset if teleutas hadnt come back from the trip to ioudaia hed liked aristeidas much better than the other sailor himself too he couldnt hash that out with his cousin now not with teleutas pulling an oar less than ten cubits away what he did say was you did the best you could you did the best anyone could you have no bloodguilt on your head you committed no sin you werent oidipous slaying his father at a crossroads you should stop tormenting yourself about it sostratos started to answer then checked himself at last after a long pause he said that makes good logical sense i try to be a logical man therefore it should make me feel better somehow though it doesnt or not very much you mind if i say something young sir diokles asked not missing a beat as he gave out the stroke please sostratos said im no philosopher so maybe ive got it all wrong the oarmaster said if i do i expect youll tell me but it seems to me this logic stuff is only good for what youve got in your head if you know what i mean when it comes to whats in your heart and your belly and your balls logic goes out the window like a full pisspot much truth in that menedemos said some truth in it certainlybut only some i think sostratos said if we dont use reason to rule our passions though what are we but so many wild beasts he didnt add or so many adulterers as he probably would have before meeting that ioudaian innkeepers wife thats something menedemos thought no doubt youre right diokles said but i dont reckon we can rule everything all the time we wouldnt be people if we could we should be able to sostratos said stubbornly thats not what diokles said and you know it menedemos said his cousin sighed so it isnt sostratos looked out to sea as if hed had enough of the argument menedemos looked out to sea too for different reasons with the overcast and the spatters of rain all he had to gauge direction were the waves and the breeze he couldnt find the sun and neither lesbos nor psyra rose above his contracted horizon he hated sailing under conditions like these navigation was somewhere between a guess and a bad joke if the sea had been calm he could have sailed in circles and never known it he wasnt doing that nowhe was pretty sure he wasnt anyhowbut he hoped he wasnt veering too far to the west or south the one would only take him out of his way the other might cause a meeting he didnt want with psyra or even khios what do you think of our course he asked diokles the oarmaster checked the breeze with a spitwet finger then looked over the sidethe sea reflecting the gray of the sky was anything but winedark todayto eye the waves feels about right to me skipper he replied at last cant say much more than that not with the weather the way it is soon as it clears out or soon as we get close to land well know where were at thats true menedemos said what i dont want is to get too close to land too soon if you follow me oh yes diokles dipped his head grounding a galley to dry out her timbers is all very well if shes not too heavily laden to get her afloat again afterwards but going aground when you dont want to or ripping out her belly on a rock you never sawthats a whole different business yes menedemos wondered what his father would say if he wrecked the aphrodite actually he didnt wonderhe knew at least in broad outline in something like that the small details were unlikely to matter he tried to look every which way at once dead ahead to port and to starboard astern past the boat which bobbed in the chop behind the akatos no suddenly looming land no piratical pentekonter driving out of the mist and straight toward the aphrodite no trouble anywhere he worried all the same when he said that out loud diokles dipped his head again a good thing you do too youre the skipper worryings your job gods protect me from a captain who doesnt sostratos spent a lot of time doing lookout duty up on the aphrodites cramped foredeck part of that was expiation for aristeidas the best lookout hed ever known part of it was a sensible desire to keep the merchant galley safe combined with the knowledge that a toikharkhos was just cargoor more likely ballastas long as she sailed on the open sea and part of it was the chance to watch birds and fish and other creatures at the same time as he was doing something useful flying fishes leaped from the water and glided through the air before returning to their proper element a blackcapped tern folded its wings dove into the aegean and came out with a silvery fish writhing in its beak the flying fishes had most likely gone from water to air to keep from becoming prey the tern had gone from air to water to turn fish into prey it didnt get to enjoy its catch a gull chased it and made it drop the sprat before it could gulp it down moskhion had come up to the foredeck to check the forestay he pointed at the gull which grabbed the stunned fish from the surface of the sea and greedily gobbled it up might as well be a macedonian why sostratos said because hed sooner live off the work of others than work himself me i was thinking of him as a pirate six oboloi to the drakhma either way young sir moskhion answered dolphins leaped from the water and then dove back in with hardly a splash the former sponge divers face showed unalloyed pleasure as he pointed to them i love dolphins i think theyre the most beautiful fish there are i love dolphins too what seafaring man doesnt sostratos said and they are beautiful no doubt about it but theyre not fish what moskhion scratched his head what are they then cabbages he laughed at his own wit smiling sostratos said theyre no more cabbages than they are fish the sailor started to laugh again but the mirth faded from his face as he studied sostratos moskhion frowned some men when they heard an opinion theyd never met before wanted nothing more than to wipe it from the face of the earth so the athenians served sokrates sostratos thought moskhion wasnt of that schoolnot quite but he wasnt far removed from it either he said why what else can dolphins be but fish they live in the sea dont they they havent got any legs do they if that doesnt make em fish what does being like other fish would make them fish sostratos said but as my teachers teacher a lover of wisdom named aristoteles pointed out they arent like other fish that means they have to be some different kind of creature what do you mean they arent moskhion demanded i just showed you how they were didnt i seaweed lives in the sea and hasnt got any legs sostratos said does that make it a fish seaweed as if humoring a madman moskhion said seaweed doesnt look like a fish young sir dolphins do a statue may look like a man but is a statue a man if you ask a statue to lend you a drakhma will it no but half the men i know wont either moskhion retorted and sostratos had to laugh the sailor went on how is a dolphin different than a fish just tell me that if you please i can think of two important ways sostratos answered you must know that if you keep a dolphin in the sea and dont let it come up for air it will drown any fisherman whos caught one in a net will tell you that and dolphins bring forth their young alive the way goats and horses do they dont lay eggs like fish moskhion pursed his lips and scratched at the corner of his jaw theyre funny fish then youre right about that much i expect but theyre still fish he went down from the foredeck into the waist of the ship sostratos stared after him the sailor had asked for reasons why dolphins werent like fish hed given them what had it got him nothingnot a single solitary thing funny fish he muttered sokrates had crossed his mind a little while before now the athenian sage did again sostratos thought if he had to deal with people like that no wonder he drank hemlock it must have seemed a relief moskhion hadnt been rude or abusive hed even gone through the forms of reasoned argument hed gone through them and then ignored them when they produced a result he didnt like as far as sostratos was concerned that was worse than refusing to argue at all from his station at the stern menedemos called if youre going to be a lookout my dear kindly look ahead not toward me sorry sostratos said reddening he gave his attention back to the sea he wondered whether a moment later he would have to scream out rock and give his cousin just enough time to steer the merchant galley out of harms way if he were telling the story in a tavernand especially if menedemos were telling it in a tavernit would go that way but he saw no rocks he saw little of anything only gray sky above and gray sea below he wished he could see farther out to sea but unless menedemos navigation was far worse than he feared it mattered much less on this broad reach of the aegean than it would say down in the kyklades in those crowded waters you could spit over the side and hit an island no matter where you were darkness fell with no special drama light oozed out of the sky at diokles command the rowers shipped their oars men who werent rowing brailed up the sail anchors splashed into the sea menedemos ordered lamps lit and hung from the stempost and sternpost he said if some idiots sailing on through the night we ought to give him at least a chance to see us did i argue sostratos replied not about that menedemos paused to dip up a cup of the rough red wine the crew drank aboard ship but moskhions been going on about how you tried to tell him dolphins arent fish by poseidons prick they arent sostratos yelped ask any man whos studied the issue and hell tell you the same thing maybe so o best one but any sailor it seems will tell you youre out of your mind menedemos replied its the apology of sokrates all over again men who know one thing well think they know all things well because of their little piece of knowledge more than a few of our sailors have been fishermen too menedemos said if they dont know fish what do they know not much in my opinion but sostratos spoke in a voice not much above a whisper he did remember he wouldnt be wise to anger the men with an odd mix of amusement and annoyance he watched his cousins relief that he remembered he too drank wine and ate an uninspiring shipboard supper he almost thought of it as a spartan supper then he remembered the horrid black broth served in the lakedaimonians messes contemplating that nasty stuff made an opson of olives and cheese and an onion seem far more palatable the clouds and mist remained after full night came too bad sostratos said wrapping himself in his himation i always like looking at the stars before i go to sleep not tonight menedemos was also making himself as comfortable as he could on the poop deck i wonder what they really are and why a few of them wander while the rest stand still sostratos said those are questions for gods not men his cousin replied why shouldnt i ask them sostratos said men should ask questions and look for answers to them go ahead and ask all you like menedemos said getting answers to those questions is a different story though sostratos wished he could have quarreled with that instead he sighed and dipped his head saying im afraid youre right until we find some way to reach out and touch the stars well never be able to find out what they are or why they shine well my dear you dont think smalli will say that menedemos replied with a laugh how do you propose to touch the stars i havent the faintest idea i wish i did sostratos yawned i havent the faintest idea how im going to stay awake any more either the next thing he knew he wasnt when he woke the sky was getting light it wasnt the rosyfingered dawn of which the poets wrote though no pink and gold eastern sky no sunbeams darting up from the sea only a sullen gray like that of the day before made night withdraw menedemos was already up good day my dear he said here youve gone and taken away the fun of giving you a good kick the way i was about to so sorry to deprive you of your simple pleasures sostratos got to his feet and stretched to work the kinks out of his back rubbing his eyes he added im feeling pretty simple myself right now up and down the length of the aphrodite sailors were rousing diokles had already got up from the rowers bench where hed spent the night he seemed as well rested as if hed slept in the bedchamber of the great king of persia good day young sirs he called to sostratos and menedemos good day sostratos said we should pass through the strait between euboia and andros before sunset shouldnt we i hope so the oarmaster said if were anywhere near where we ought to be and if our navigation todays halfway decent we ought to manage that and if we dont everyone will blame me menedemos made a joke of it where a lot of captains would have been deadly serious pointing up toward the clueobscuring sky he said i do have an excuse for not guiding us to within a digits breadth of our perfect path no arguments skipper diokles said i expect youll get us where were going if i didnt think so id be a right idiot to sail with you wouldnt i after barley rolls dipped in oil and washed down with watered wine sailors slowly spun the capstans and brought up the anchors as soon as they were stowed the sail came down from the yard it billowed and flapped and then filled with wind menedemos steered the ship westsouthwest i hope its westsouthwest anyhow he said with a wry grin its my best guess warmer than yesterday i think sostratos said maybe the clouds and mist will burn off as the sun gets higher little by little they did the sun came out first through clouds still thick enough to let a man look without pain at its disk and then more strongly the sky went from gray to a hazy blue still not quite the weather for which sostratos would have hoped but definitely better the horizon stretched as the mist faded land ho a rower called land to port and astern thats psyra i think sostratos said shading his eyes to peer east menedemos laughed it had better be otherwise were really lost not too much later sostratos spotted skyros off the starboard bow he felt proud of himself his eyes were no better than anyone elses indeed he knew they were worse than those of several sailors but knowing where psyra was let him do a geometry problem in his head and figure out about where skyros ought to be and then as the day continued to clear and the horizon to extend several sailors pointed dead ahead at almost exactly the same time theres euboia they called good menedemos said were about where were supposed to be if anything were a little farther west than i thought we were we will get through the strait between euboia and andros today and then its on to athens on to athens sostratos couldnt have been happier if his cousin had said he thought about that then grinned he couldnt have been happier if menedemos had said anything else as the strait neared menedemos ordered weapons and helmets served out to the crew the men set bronze helms most of them uncrested on their heads the sailors not at the oars hefted spears and swords and belaying pins the rowers stashed their weapons under their benches where they could grab them in a hurry i hope this is all a waste of time menedemos said but a lot of you men were along a couple of years ago when that pirate tried to board us we fought off the polluted son of a whore if we have to we can do it again i hope we can do it again he thought he glanced over to sostratos waiting for his cousin to start mourning the gryphons skull the pirates had carried away with them but sostratos didnt say a thing maybe hed learned to accept the loss more likely hed learned menedemos would come down like a rockslide if he started complaining about the gryphons skull fishing boats fled the aphrodite with even more alacrity than usual teleutas laughed and said with all the ironware and bronze were showing theyre sure were pirates now his helmet jammed down low on his forehead and a fierce grin on his narrow homely face made him look like a man who would sooner steal than work i know he steals menedemos reminded himself sostratos caught him at it in loudaia if he ever steals on the aphrodite hes gone but teleutas had never got caught doing that no one on the merchant galley had complained of a thief maybe he had too much sense to steal from his fellow hellenes for his sake menedemos hoped so the channel between the islands was less than sixty stadia wide menedemos sailed the aphrodite right down the middle of it he was close enough to land to see sheep kicking up dust in the hills above the beach on euboia and to see one of those little fishing boats go aground at the mouth of a stream on andros he and the whole crew kept close watch on inlets and rocky outcropsthose were pirates favorite hiding places today though everything seemed as peaceful as if no one had ever thought of taking robbery to sea when menedemos said that out loud sostratos tossed his head dont believe it for a moment my dear he said somewhere up in those hillsprobably more than one place up in those hillsa pirate lookout is watching us and thinking no more trouble than theyre worth and thats all thats keeping us safe menedemos didnt need long to decide his cousin was right he said well i wish the lookout who loosed that last pirate ship against us in these waters would have thought the same thing so do i sostratos said menedemos cocked his head to one side waiting for him to say more sostratos caught him waiting and laughed ive said everything i can about the gryphons skull till the next time you do menedemos gibed sostratos laughed again on a different note maybe youre right i hope not but maybe i think we are going to make it out of this channel its not very long menedemos said we only seem to take forever going through it oh good sostratos said i thought i was the only one who felt that way no indeed best one and im not ashamed to admit it menedemos said after all were passing through a place where weve already had trouble if you think im not nervous about the passage youre daft i dont like fighting off pirates any better than you do you do it well sostratos said if you didnt wed be slaves now or dead for which i thank you menedemos said but ive already had more practice than i ever wanted he turned his head from one side to the other now the coastline of andros was swiftly falling off to the southeast that of euboia to the northwest were through it now for sure anyone who wants to come after us will have a long chase and were not that much slower than a pirate ship sostratos pointed west theres the headland of laureion with helens island in front of it attica yes attica menedemos agreed dryly we limped into sounion at the cape there a couple of years ago too if youll remember to bury our dead after the fight his cousin flushed so we did but were not limping now and we havent been robbed of what was our main reason for coming to athens he pointed a thumb at himself before menedemos could speak yes i know i just mentioned the skullbut it was in the context of what we were talking about context menedemos rolled his eyes and addressed some invisible audience he takes one look at attic soil and starts babbling about context whatll he be like when we actually set foot in athens odds are no one will be able to understand his greek at all oh go howl sostratos pointed back toward the southeast not at andros but up into the heavens what would you say the phase of the moon is menedemos looked over his shoulder to see the moon white and pale in the lateafternoon sky first quarterperhaps a day after thats what i thought too sostratos beamed that means its the seventh or eighth of elaphebolion the greater dionysia starts on the tenth were going to make the festival good menedemos said i like the theater as well as the next fellowunless the next fellow happens to be you maybebut i also know we have to do business i keep hoping youll remember that too how could i possibly forget having you to remind me sostratos spoke with such surpassing sweetness anyone who didnt know him would have been sure he meant every word and was grateful menedemos who knew sostratos as well as any man alive was sure his cousin meant every word and wanted to push him over the rail with a sweet smile of his own he said all right then as long as we understand each other we usually do again sostratos sounded altogether acquiescent again menedemos was not deceived but then his cousin grew serious do you think we can round cape sounion today perhaps go all the way to anaphlystos harbor after studying the sun menedemos tossed his head what i think is well be lucky to get to sounion more likely well lie up in one of the little bays on helens island sostratos looked as if menedemos had just kicked a puppy relenting a little menedemos added even so we should have no trouble reaching peiraieus tomorrow sostratos brightened menedemos had known his cousin would he could have said the ship would spend the night in persiaor for that matter in tartarosas long as he also said it would get to the harbor of athens the next day sostratos said i wonder why helen is tied to so many islands theres another one to the west thats supposed to be where she first slept with paris on the way to troy that i dont know menedemos said to tell you the truth i havent worried about it much either when i think about helen id rather think about why paris wanted her than why they remember her on islands but everyone knows why paris wanted her sostratos said the other questions much more interesting because it doesnt have an obvious answer that makes it more interesting menedemos said sostratos dipped his head they stared at each other in perfect mutual incomprehension the aphrodite reached an inlet at the north end of helens island as the sun slid behind the highland of cape sounion the island ran from north to south and was much longer than it was wide no polis stood anywhere on it nor even a village sheep and goats wandered the low rolling ground cropping grass and bushes as darkness spread over sea and land herdsmens campfires glowed like golden stars off in the distance no one came up to the ship to ask for news or give any of his own that saddened menedemos the shepherds think well grab em and sell em into slavery he said we wouldnt sostratos said no of course not couldnt very well sell em in athens even if we did grab em menedemos said i wouldnt care to enslave free hellenes anywayif the herders are free hellenes and not already enslaved like eumaios the swineherd in the odyssey they dont know where were from or where were bound sostratos said for all they can tell we might be tyrrhenians whod sell them in the slave markets at carthage i know thats what bothers me menedemos said even so close to athens people worry about pirates and raiders these are sorry times when men think of themselves first and everything else only afterwards sostratos said but after a moment he ruefully tossed his head when didnt men think of themselves first after the peloponnesian war the thirty tyrants made themselves hateful and before that themistokles had to trick most of the hellenes into fighting xerxes by salamis athenians both times menedemos remarked oh yes his cousin said athens has shown the world more of man at his best and worst than any other polis in athens but thinking of yourself first goes back to long before athens was such a great city look at akhilleus in the iliad how many stronggreaved akhaioi died because he stayed in his tent after his quarrel with agamemnon well but agamemnon was in the wrong too for taking briseis away from akhilleus menedemos held up a hand before his cousin could speak i know what youre going to say next youll say that was agamemnon putting what he wanted ahead of what the akhaioi needed and he did sostratos looked disappointed at not having an argument on his hands he glanced up at the moon so did menedemos it seemed brighter and more golden now that the sun had left the sky sostratos said in the city theyre getting ready for the festival and tomorrow well be there i dont know how im going to sleep tonight he managed menedemos had to wake him in the morning but sostratos didnt complain not when menedemos said rise and shine my dear today were going to athens athenaze sostratos echoed dreamily then he said it once more as if for good measure to athens цp diokles called and the aphrodites rowers rested at their oars sailors tossed lines to longshoremen in loincloths who made the akatos fast to the quay just hearing the harbor workers brought sostratos a thrill what educated man didnt want to sound as if he came from athens and here were these probably illiterate laborers using the dialect of plato and euripides they were speaking commonplaces but they sounded good doing it or so sostratos thought anyway in the broad doric of rhodes one of the sailors said who do those fellows think they are anyhow slaves could do their jobs but they talk like a bunch of toffs menedemos pointed up one of the long straight streets of peiraieus at least this town is laid out sensibly he said this is one of the first places hippodamos of miletos designed sostratos answered perikles had him do it that would have been thirty years or so before he laid out the polis of rhodes did he do anything with athens proper menedemos asked peering toward the great buildings of the athenian akropolis thirtyfive or forty stadia inland im afraid not sostratos said i wish he would have the streets there are the wildest tangle anybodys ever seen the athenians take pride in being able to find their way aroundexcept when they get lost too his cousin pointed to the base of the pier here comes an officer to question us indeed the fellow looked splendid in crested helm and crimson cloak thrown back over his shouldersas splendid as antigonos man almost identically dressed had at mytilene menedemos went on now for half a drakhma is he a macedonian or an athenian sostratos looked the man over he was of average height on the lean side with dark hair an olive complexion a thin face and ironic eyebrows more than anything else those eyebrows decided sostratos athenian well know in a moment menedemos said wait till he opens his mouth if we dont have any trouble understanding him you win if he starts spewing macedonian at us i do what ship are you and where are you from the officer asked the usual questions in perfectly intelligible attic greek menedemos grimaced sostratos hid a smile were the aphrodite out of rhodes he answered as he seemed to do whenever the akatos pulled into a new port ah rhodians the officer brightened youll be friendly to ptolemaios then kassandros whod ruled athens for the past decade through demetrios of phaleron was friendly to ptolemaios sostratos dipped his head not wanting to disagree openly we try to be he answered but then were neutral so we try to be friendly to everybody i see the athenian looked less happy where did you stop on your way here kos sostratos said which pleased the fellowkos belonged to ptolemaiosand then and samos and khios both briefly and then lesbos we have lesbian wine for sale and lesbian truffles too i see the officers pinched face was made for frowning the last three islands belonged to antigonos with whom kassandros was anything but friendly after a moments sour thought the man decided to make the best of it asking whats the old cyclops up to did you see anything interesting along the way i didnt sostratos turned to his cousin did you menedemos cant say that i did menedemos answered he has war galleys in the harbors and on patrol but then he would especially after ptolemaios took so much of the southern coast of anatolia away from him a couple of years ago ptolemaios laid siege to halikarnassos too remember but it didnt fall he sounded disappointed sostratos knew why the officer didnt he said yes i do recall that it was antigonos son philippos who relieved the town wasnt it no the other son the older onehes named demetrios too sostratos said that got a grunt from the athenian he served demetrios of phaleron maybe he didnt love him after the grunt he asked the next inevitable question what are you carrying besides wine and truffles koan silk sostratos said the officer approved of kos rhodian perfume menedemos added that was safe too papyrus and ink sostratos said papyrus came from egypt while the ink was rhodian beeswax menedemos said beeswax could come from anywhere under the sun embroidered cloth and crimson dye from sidon sidon belonged to antigonos but he didnt say the aphrodite had been there he let the officer assume the rhodians had got it in their home polis rather than going to phoenicia themselveswhich in connection with their stops at other places belonging to antigonos might have made the fellow more suspicious as things were the officer said all right i hope you have a profitable time trading here you do know youll have to change your silver for athenian owls yes best one sostratos said at the same time as menedemos was saying yes most noble one neither of them looked at the other moneychangers charged a fat commission for their services they kept some for themselves the polis got the rest both rhodians intended to evade athenian law as much as they could plenty of people in any polis worried more about the weight of the silver they got than whether it bore the athenian owl or the rose of rhodes as the officer turned to go back down the pier sostratos said excuse me best one but is iphikrates son of leon still the rhodian proxenos here the athenian tossed his head no he died two maybe three years ago protomakhos son of alypetos represents your polis here these days not a name i know sostratos said menedemos dipped his head in agreement sostratos went on is his house here in peiraieus or does he live up in athens hes in athens not far from the theater the officer replied which made sostratos heart leap with joy and by menedemos expression made his cousin fight back laughter the athenian added he deals in marble and other stone himself he has a good name in the city glad to hear that sostratos said as the soldier did leave the quay menedemos swallowed snickers broke free the proxenos has a house by the theater he said im sure your hearts breaking because well have to walk all the way into athens to meet this protomakhos a pig dreams of swill a sheep dreams of clover and youyou dream of a house by the theater in athens and now your dreams come true sostratos wanted to tell him he was talking nonsensewanted to but knew he couldnt he gave back a rather sickly smile we really ought to go meet the fellow dont you think i dont know menedemos sounded both judicious and dubious i was thinking of selling our goods at the marketplace right here in peiraieus and so we wont what sostratos yelped are you out of your mind they sell timber and oil and wheat here not the kind of he fumbled to a stop when his cousin started laughing again this time harder than ever sostratos sent him an aggrieved stare oh youre having me on ha ha ha ha ha ha that wasnt laughter he repeated the empty syllables to show how funny he thought the joke was menedemos set a hand on his shoulder im sorry my dear i truly am i just couldnt resist the look on your face couldnt resist sostratos said you didnt even try well maybe not menedemos gauged the sun do you think weve got time to go into town today and find this protomakhos or would we do better waiting till tomorrow sostratos looked at the sinking sun too looked at it and let out a long mournful sigh tomorrow would be better he said and you have no idea how much i wish i could tell you otherwise and then suddenly he snapped his fingers no i take it backwed better go now and how have you talked yourself into that menedemos asked amused simple tomorrows either the ninth or the tenth of elaphebolion his gaze swung to the ripening moon which announced the date i think itll be the tenth if it is its the first day of the dionysia therell be a big parade and all sorts of other things going on and nobody will want to do any business thats why we ought to meet protomakhos today his cousin thought it over well when youre right youre right wed better go diokles keep enough men on board and sober tonight to make sure none of these clever lightfingered athenians walks off with the akatos ill take care of it skipper the oarmaster promised you can count on me i know i do menedemos said and now id better get moving look at sostratos there shifting from foot to foot like a comic actor about to shit himself i am not sostratos said indignantly and made sure he did not rise up onto the toes of his left foot im just eager thats what boys say when they shoot too soon the first time they visit a brothel menedemos retorted sostratos yelped again even more indignantly than before his cousin laughed and clapped him on the shoulder lets go then even setting foot in peiraieus was enough to excite sostratos he made himself hurry past the long colonnade that housed the harborside market most of the port wasnt worth looking at nondescript houses and shops mudbrick with red tile roofs some of them were whitewashed rather more werent the goods on display were of the cheap flashy sort he might have seen in any goodsized polis around the inner sea but the people were speaking attic greek even the barbarians in business in peiraieus of whom there were a good many spoke attic flavored by their foreign accents hearing it made sostratos smile menedemos pointed whats that temple it sure stands out amongst all this boring stuff thats the sacred enclosure of athena and zeus sostratos answered both deities are portrayed in bronze athenas holding a spear zeus has a rod in one hand and a victory in the other theres also a fine painting of leosthenes and his family by arkesilaos thats new the statues arent leosthenes menedemos frowned i cant place the name the athenian general who fought the macedonians right after alexander died when we were just going from boys to youths sostratos said he beat them a couple of times up in boiotia but they won the war all right i remember that menedemos said i couldnt have come up with his name if youd handed me to a persian torturer though he pointed off to the right toward the east and whats that big thing thats the fortress at mounykhia the harbor next door sostratos told him its full of kassandros macedonians it would be wouldnt it menedemos said what you dont suppose the athenians would line up with kassandros if he didnt hold them down sostratos did his best to sound artfully shocked his cousin chuckled he went on if there werent any macedonians around athensand all the other poleis in hellas would go back to squabbling amongst themselves the way they did before philip put his foot on them not all the other poleis what do you mean thebes isnt there anymore alexander destroyed it thats true sostratos said ive heard people are starting to live on the site though one of these days itll be a city again i suppose so his cousin said they walked on through peiraieus and up toward athens through the long walls joining the port to the great city menedemos nodded to the soldiers on the walls theyd be more macedonians wouldnt they sostratos eyed the men probably theyre bigger and fairer than most athenians anyhow but demetrios of phaleron is the glove to kassandros hand what kassandros wants done demetrios does so they may be athenians doing the macedonians bidding i thought these walls would be more impressive menedemos said they arent that tall and they arent that strong they were first built in perikles day and generals then knew less about besieging cities than they do now so the works didnt have to be that strong to serve sostratos answered they were strong enough to keep the spartans out athens wasnt stormed at the end of the peloponnesian war the spartans starved her into surrender and then made the athenians pull down a stretch of the walls afterwards menedemos looked around built up again he observed oh yes sostratos said the athenians did that as soon as they thought they could get away with it his gaze went this way and that too the road up from athens wasnt much to look at only a dirt track with grass and bushes on either side even so walking this road menedemos walking this road is special perikles traveled on this road so did aiskhylos and sophokles and euripides so did thoukydidesand herodotos too though he wasnt born here sokrates walked this road and platon and aristoteles and now sostratos and menedemos menedemos went off behind a bush to ease himself when he came back he said aristophanes might have pissed on that very same bush what an honor he batted his eyes like a youth playing coy to the crows with you sostratos said i try to talk about what coming to athens means to me and what do i get filthy jokes aristophanes lived here too and the other comic poets though you didnt bother mentioning them menedemos said are you going to tell me comedy isnt part of what athens stands for theres a time and place for everything sostratos replied a weaker comeback than hed thought he might give reluctantly he dipped his head to his cousin all right you have a pointof sorts thank you thank you so much menedemos cried enough sostratos said his cousin only laughed at him he clicked his tongue between his teeth he might have known that would happen but menedemos wasnt a complete scoffer pointing up to the akropolis he said thats the temple to athena the maiden isnt it yes thats the parthenon sure enough sostratos answered the sinking sun shone brilliantly on the white marble and on the painted blues and reds and yellows of the panathenaic frieze ive seen a lot of temples in my time menedemos said but that ones as fine as any sostratos dipped his head i think so too well have to make a trip up there so you can see the cult statue its all gold and ivory five or six times as tall as a man theres nothing like it except the great zeus at olympiaand pheidias made that image too all gold and ivory for a moment menedemos sounded as piratical as any lykian then his thoughts turned to those a trader might have i wonder how much of the gold stuck to pheidias fingers perikles enemies charged pheidias with that and with putting his own face on one of the details of the ornamentation of the statue of athena and all manner of other things for perikles of course was his patron and by striking at pheidias they could embarrass the man through whom he did what he did sostratos said well what happened menedemos sounded interested in spite of himself he didnt steal any of the gold perikles had warned him he might be challenged so he made the gold plates for the statue easy to remove when the athenians took them down and weighed them they found that none of the metal entrusted to him was missing but then they started shouting impiety when they found out hed put his portrait on one of the warriors on athenas shieldthats what i was talking about before men do that sort of thing all the time nowadays menedemos remarked i know but this was more than a hundred twenty years ago and they didnt then sostratos said and some say perikles face was there with his some say pheidias had to leave athens others say he was made to drink hemlock like sokrates later he shuddered so did menedemos theyd watched a man die of hemlock it wasnt so neat and tidy as platon made it out to be sostratos went on i dont think they killed him but i cant prove it too long ago nowno one who knew the truth is left alive the walls of the polis of athens loomed ahead they were taller and more formidable than the long walls all the traffic coming up from peiraieus and going down to the port funneled through a single gate a man leading a donkey with half a dozen amphorai lashed to its back came out of athens toward sostratos and menedemos an old man leaning on a stick went into the city ahead of the rhodians guards asked him a question or two then waved him forward one of the guards held up a hand sostratos and menedemos dutifully stopped in purest attic the guard said who are you whats your business here were merchants from rhodes sostratos answered we hope to do business in athens right now were looking for our polis proxenos pass on the gate guard stood aside this isnt quite the city proper sostratos said pointing ahead after they went through the gate theres another wall up there perhaps ten or twelve plethra farther along yes i see it over the roofs of the houses and shops menedemos said we have two choices for a gate there one will bring us into the city north of the pnyx the other to the south sostratos said whats the pnyx his cousin asked is it worth seeing its where the assembly meetsor rather where it did meet till a few years ago sostratos replied these days the people come together at the theater he didnt point outno telling who might be listeningthat the assemblys meetings were much less important than they had been during the great days of athens these days demetrios of phaleron or kassandros officers or the macedonian marshal himself decided what went on here the peoples voice was stifled doesnt sound that interesting not to look at menedemos said lets use the south entrancethats the shorter way to the akropolis and the theater isnt it sostratos dipped his head thats right you do remember your way around some menedemos said its been four or five yearsthat trading run where i met the charming lady in halikarnassos remember im not likely to forget sostratos said it wasnt the lady who was so memorable it was to me menedemos broke in sostratos overrode him it was her husband i dont know whether she will or not but hell never forget you im probably not the only one hes got to worry about menedemos stepped up the pace come on theres the gate i can see it hurry up wont you we do want to find the proxenos house before the sun goes down you do want to change the subject sostratos thought you dont like getting reminded about outraged husbands you didnt even mention himonly his wife whose wife will you go after here that was one question whose answer he hoped he wouldnt learn he caught up with his cousin they reached the gate side by side a yawning guard waved them through without a word on they went into athens menedemos did his best not to stare like a backcountry farmer coming for the very first time into a town big enough to boast a wall it wasnt easy on his last visit to attica hed spent most of his time in peiraieus hed been determined not to seem impressed there too sostratos had almost had to drag him up to athens to look around the first thing that struck him was how big a polis it was rhodes was a goodsized city in its own right but it didnt come close to this one syracuse in sicily was supposed to have been a match for athens years before but endless civil strife had taken its toll there these days only alexandria deserved mention in the same breathand alexandria drew its wealth from all of egypt while athens relied on attica alone attica and the wits of its citizens and large as it was athens seemed even grander and more impressive menedemos eyes kept rising to the akropolis they put everything they had into this didnt they he murmured thats what thoukydides says sostratos answered plainly quoting he went on for if the city of the lakedaimonians were deserted but the temples and the foundations of the buildings were left after a long time had gone by there would be great disbelief at their power then he says but if this same thing happened to the athenians their power would likely be reckoned twice what it is from the visible appearance of their city well ive got to hand it to the old boy menedemos said he hit that one square in the middle of the target this place ishe looked around again trying to come up with a phrase that fita possession for all time sostratos smiled at that whats the matter now menedemos asked indignantly did i say something funny i didnt mean to not funny o best onejust fitting his cousin replied thats what thoukydides intended his history to be a ktema es aei he said the words for possession for all time in a very oldfashioned way menedemos supposed that was how thoukydides had written them sostratos added his history is a hundred years old now so it looks as if hes getting what he wanted thats true menedemos said heres hoping somebody remembers us after were a hundred years gone yes heres hoping sostratos voice had an edge to it menedemos wondered what hed done to irk his cousin he didnt want to offend sostratos without meaning to that took the fun out of it then he remembered sostratos aspired to write history too clapping him on the shoulder menedemos said dont worry about it my dear a hundred years from now theyll be talking about sostratos and thoukydides not the other way round youre a splendid flatterer i hope i have wisdom enough to know when im being flattered though sostratos said i dont know what youre talking about menedemos said sostratos snorted menedemos turned serious again when should we start asking athenians where the proxenos house is not yet by the dog sostratos replied wait till we get to the theater then we have some chance of getting a straight answer if we ask now most of these abandoned rogues will take our oboloi spin us a pretty set of directions that lead nowhere and go their way laughing at how they suckered the hicks from out of town charming people menedemos said in many ways they are his cousin said in many ways mind you but not all theyre out for themselves first last and always so are most hellenes of course i was just going to say that menedemos put in yes but you wouldnt tell a stranger fancy lies for the sake of an obolos and a laugh sostratos said a lot of them would they take being out for themselves further than most hellenes do they take almost everything further than most hellenes do for good and for ill you dont have to be fast to live in athens but it helps how did you manage then menedemos asked his cousin was a great many things but never fast not the way hed meant for one thing i learned to talk more like an athenian sostratos answered for another i kept company with lovers of wisdom who aremostlya different breed oh menedemos said that made a certain amount of sense but only a certain amount why are the philosophers different have they figured out how to live without money some of them have by choosing not to care about a lot of the things most men go after money to buy sostratos said menedemos tossed his head that way wasnt for him he liked his comforts too well sostratos continued but a lot of men who can study philosophy and history their whole lives long are the ones who can afford to do that from the start they dont need to worry about an obolos here and an obolos there because they come from rich families theyve got more silver than they can spend if they live to be ninety that edge returned to his voice menedemos remembered how bitter hed been when his father called him home from athens well my dear if we get rich enough you can walk away from the trading business and spend all your time at the lykeion again he said too late for me his cousin said ive been out in the world too long i could never be indifferent to moneyor take it for granted the way a lot of philosophers do and do you know what really irks me tell me menedemos urged every so often sostratos had to let out what ate at him or go wild they dont know how lucky they are he said now remember i told you i met that hekataios of abdera in jerusalem when we were in the east last year he was writing a history in alexandria and he found out the ioudaioi had a role to play in it so what did he do he headed for jerusalem to see what he could find out about them he didnt worry about the moneyhe just did it i was so jealous i wanted to wring his scrawny neck there i was worrying about what i could sell and what i might buy and he took his own sweet time wandering around asking questionswhen he found someone who spoke greek to answer them that is youre the one who learned aramaic menedemos said sostratos answered in that language something so harsh and guttural and evilsounding that three or four passersby spun around to stare at him menedemos didnt think sostratos noticed returning to greek he went on yes im the one who learned aramaic and i probably learned more about the ioudaioi than hekataios did too and much good it did me because hes the one who gets to write the book and be remembered slyly menedemos said youre the one who laid the innkeepers wife his cousin gave him a bleak laugh so i am that didnt work out either afterwards we both ended up unhappier than we would have if wed never gone to bed together yes i know thats too bad its not supposed to work that way the only times menedemos hadnt enjoyed adultery were the ones when the womans husband had found out sostratos didnt answer him now they walked on through the narrow winding smelly streets of athens when menedemos couldnt see the magnificent buildings of the akropolis or those at the edges of the agora off to the northwest the city seemed just another polis an oversized one but nothing out of the ordinary in the way most of its people lived after doubling back from yet another dead end he wished it like peiraieus boasted a neat hippodamian grid of streets no such luck though he and sostratos had to scramble out of the way when a woman called coming out from a secondfloor window and emptied a chamber pot into the dirt street below flies started buzzing around the stinking puddle a man wearing a himation in front of the rhodians shouted curses at the woman for the slops had splashed him when she ignored the hard words he flung a rock at the window it rattled off a wooden shutter breaking two of the slats he went on his way contented from the safety of the upstairs room the woman screeched her own curses at him now he ignored her welcome to life in the big city sostratos said with a wry chuckle although a scene like that could have happened in any hellenic polis regardless of size it missed us and we didnt walk in it afterwards menedemos said past that who cares they walked on for a little while then turned onto a wider street that went more directly east menedemos pointed ahead those curved rows of seats aheadthat has to be the theater yes thats right sostratos dipped his head and do you see the big stretch of tile roof beyond them not very well youre taller than i am menedemos jumped in the air which made a couple of athenians goggle all rightyes its there what is it thats the odeion his cousin answered perikles had it built to house the musical contests at the panathenaic games its so big it has ninety pillars inside holding up the roof people say its modeled after the tent xerxes lived in when he invaded hellas but i dont know if thats true or just a story if its not true its a good story menedemos said cant ask for more than that i can ask for the truth sostratos said a little stiffly whether i can find it after more than a hundred years is liable to be another matter i didnt mean anything by it menedemos said his cousin walked on without answering ive gone and put his back up menedemos thought unhappily sostratos got much too touchy much too fast when it came to historical questions though in other areas he would put up with more than most hellenes did instead of trying to jolly him along menedemos waved to a passing athenian oк you there what do you want the fellow asked can you tell us how to get to the house of protomakhos the marble merchant hes not far from the theater is he yes i know where his house is the athenian said and said no more menedemos had expected nothing else he gave the man an obolos popping the coin into this mouth the athenian continued its close by the temple of dionysos at the southwestern corner of the theater precinct its on the left side of the street as you go south i forget whether its the second or third house there but you can knock on doors and find out thanks menedemos said any time buddy the athenian stuck his tongue in his cheek as if to say any time you pay me he might have been going after the obolos hed just got can we find it with those directions menedemos asked as the local went on his way we can find the right street i think or at least narrow it down to two or three sostratos answered and somebody on one of those streets ought to know where to find protomakhos house we might not even have to spend any more silver ha ill believe that when i see it menedemos said a gray stone wall around the holy precinct kept him from getting more than a glimpse of the roof of the temple of dionysos that roof was of red tiles like those of most of the nearby houses these though were faded by the sun and cracked and weathered by who could say how many freezes and rainstorms the temple had stood there a very long time menedemos pointed to a street that headed south just beyond the temple shall we try this one why not sostratos replied if were wrong we cant be far wrong the athenian said second or third house down didnt he thats right menedemos said when they came to the second house he knocked on the door several dogs inside the house started howling not little yapping lapdogs but kastorian hunting hounds with big deep voices menedemos found himself hoping whoever was in there wouldnt open the door he let out a sigh of relief when all he got was a hoarse shout whos there what do you want is this the house of protomakhos son of uh alypetos sostratos supplied no the voice said over the baying of the hounds he lives next door one house down artemis be praised for that menedemos muttered as they went on to the next house if theyd opened the door to that last place those dogs might have eaten us alive we wouldnt have been alive for long sostratos said relentlessly accurate and how would you like to live next door to that racket all the time i like my peace and quiet if it were me id be tempted to throw some poisoned meat over the wall and get rid of a few of those beasts its not just the racket either menedemos held his nose i know cities cant help being smelly places but i dont fancy dog shit in my nostrils all day long therell be more flies too especially when the weather warms up would you rather stay at an inn then sostratos asked menedemos sighed and tossed his head no were here he knocked on the door again someone on the inside asked who he was he gave his name and sostratos adding this is the house of the rhodian proxenos isnt it the door opened the man standing there had to be protomakhos himself he was about fifty broadshouldered a little thick in the belly but still vigorous with a face that would have been strikingly handsome but for a nose that had met a mishap somewhere and bent to the left come in friends he said use my house as your own for as long as youre in athens ive heard of your fathers if you match them you wont be doing bad try to ignore the smell from next door demotimos raises hunting dogs thank you very much menedemos and sostratos said together protomakhos stood aside to let them in a beginning menedemos thought in he went sostratos at his heels we thank you again for your generous hospitality sostratos told protomakhos over breakfast the next morning menedemos who was also spooning up barley porridge and sipping watered wine in the andron dipped his head in agreement my pleasure best ones protomakhos took a swig from his cup the wine he served was no ariousian but it would do it was a good deal better than what the aphroditecarried for sailors to drink the rhodian proxenos went on i dont know how much youll get done for the next seven days or so what with the greater dionysia starting today youll be paying your rowers for getting drunk in the gods name menedemos stirred at that as if he hadnt thought of it till now maybe he hadnt sostratos had it distressed his thrifty soul but the alternative was missing the festivaland missing the plays that went with it well just have to make the best of it most noble one he said im not sorry your house is so close to the theater his cousin almost choked on his wine protomakhos chuckled aha so you did come for the plays i wondered but coming right out and asking is rude yes this isnt a bad place to start from if you fancy drama i hope menandros offers a comedy this year sostratos said hes supposed to be working on one protomakhos said i dont know if hes finished it oh i hope so sostratos said im trying to convince menedemos that comedy doesnt start and stop with aristophanes i laugh at menandros plays protomakhos said i dont see how you can help it not unless youre dead sostratos glanced at menedemos to see how his cousin would take that menedemos was too polite to come right out and disagree with his host instead he changed the subject ill enjoy the plays im sure ill also enjoy the rest of the festival for the gods sake nothing wrong with plenty of wine or with women who have license to be loose for a few days theres some of that at this festival but less than at dionysiai in other places the rhodian proxenos warned in fact theres less of it than there was at the smaller festivity last month i dont want you fellows to have the wrong idea and get in trouble because of it i already knew as much having spent some time here sostratos said we do appreciate your care for us menedemos didnt look as if he appreciated it at all but sostratos didnt remark on that protomakhos said if you want to watch the parade into town from the academy youd do well to head for the agora now it fills up fast with slaves as well as citizens if you care to try your luck with women thatll be your best chanceunless you feel like going out at night that is shall we menedemos asked why not sostratos said if were going to give ourselves to the god we should do it in fullness thats the spirit protomakhos said will you come too best one sostratos asked him he tossed his head ill wait till the procession gets to the temple of dionysos here to pay my respects to the god im an athenian you know and not a young one ive seen the dionysia well a good many times by now this part is always the same all right sostratos nudged menedemos come on hurry up we dont want to get there and find out were too far away from the street of the panathenaia to see anything im coming im coming menedemos turned to protomakhos im usually the one who has to hustle him along you know but he wants to see this and so he made as if to pour himself another cup of wine when sostratos rolled his eyes and let out an exasperated sigh his cousin laughed and got to his feet people were already out in the streets when they left the rhodian proxenos house a lot of the women looked like respectable wives and matrons they werent all slaves and poor folk by any means now sostratos was the one who laughed whats so funny menedemos asked you sostratos told him youre so busy turning and looking at them all you can hardly walk and you havent got any idea which ones to smile at first i dont get to see a crowd of them like this very often menedemos answered most honest women who can afford it spend most of their time indoors so im enjoying the the variety if you stare any harder the athenians will decide youre a bumpkin from akharnai whos never come into the big city before sostratos said menedemos made a face at himaristophanes had written a comedy about akharnaiansbut kept on looking around at all the pretty fairly pretty and even not so pretty women whod come out to celebrate the festival people were already passing cups of wine back and forth sostratos drank when somebody thrust one at him the wine was neat and not very good he took a small sip then passed it to menedemos after drinking menedemos gave a woman the cup her smile showed two black front teeth menedemos didnt speak to her after that he hurried on with sostratos toward the agora phalloi decorated the streets some of clay some of wickerwork some with clothcovered wicker frames decorated with ribbons athens great market square lay on the flat ground northwest of the akropolis the street of the panathenaia a rutted dirt track ran through it from northwest to southeast athens public buildings bounded the southern and western sides the mint and a couple of fountains on the south along with a covered colonnade that was not only full of people but had them clambering up to the roof like monkeys on the west stood the generals headquarters the round tholos which housed the rotating executive committee of the council of elders the bouleuterion where the whole council met and the royal stoa which also had people climbing its columns and up onto the roof the agora itself was filling rapidly skythian constables shouting in bad greek fought to keep the crowd from packing the street of the panathenaia and blocking the procession everyone struggled to get as close as he could sostratos was an uncommonly large man menedemos wasnt but he was an uncommonly good wrestler they got closer than most sostratos pointed northwest toward the dipylon gate and the academy beyond the wall the gods boat will come from that direction he said menedemos dug a finger in his ear the gods what the noise is dreadful isnt it i thought you said boat i did youll see sostratos said someone trod on his toe oimoi he exclaimed like any sailor he always went barefoot that had disadvantages in a crowd sorry pal said the fellow whod stepped on him youre lucky hes not like some of those harlots menedemos said you know the kind i mean the ones who have follow me or something like that written backwards on the bottom of their sandals in metal so they leave the words in the dust of the street as they walk along no fun at all if that comes down on your foot no it wouldnt be sostratos agreed thoughtfully he went on i imagine the trade theyd bring in would vary from polis to polis depending on how many men in each place can read theyd do better here or in rhodes than up in macedoniaim sure of that only you menedemos said and then had to stop for he was laughing too hard to go on he needed some little while before he could continue only you my dear could think of a whore and think of how much money she might make and why and not of how she makes her money i know how they make their money sostratos said the other is something i hadnt thought about before he started to say that made it more interesting but checked himself it did to him but menedemos had already shown he would make him sorry if he said anything like that flutes and drums and other instruments resounded out beyond the northern edge of the agora heads swung in that direction an athenian stepped out into the street of the panathenaia to get a better look one of the skythian slave constables shoved him back into the crowd shouting what you tink you does how selfis is you like a lot of barbarians he couldnt pronounce some of the sounds of greek having tried to learn how to say the gutturals of aramaic sostratos had more sympathy for him than he would have before unlike the athenian sostratos was not only close to the street of the panathenaia but also tall enough to see over the crowd beside him menedemos twisted to look past the few people in front of him and now and then jumped in the air to get briefly above them once he too came down on sostratos toes papai sostratos said in pain and annoyance have you got follow me on the bottoms of your polluted feet sorry his cousin didnt sound sorry at all he jumped up again this time he missed sostratos when he landed here they come the words raced through the crowd some of the dancers at the head of the procession were dressed as satyrs with tightfitting goatskin costumes horsetails erect phalloi as long as a mans forearm and snubnosed masks that put sostratos in mind of the way sokrates was said to have looked they shouted lewd suggestions at the pretty women they saw sometimes aiming their phalloi at them like spears some of the women shouted lewd suggestions of their own the dionysia even in the toneddown version of it celebrated at athens was a time when restraint went out the window behind the satyrs came maenads in torn ragged tunics that suggested theyd been running wild on the mountainsides some of them carried thyrsoi the ivytipped wands of dionysos others bore smoky crackling torches still others had tambourines to the accompaniment of that jingling music they called euoiii euoiiithe cry of the gods followers menedemos nudged sostratos by the god of wine whats that i told you sostratos answered thats the boat of dionysos the ancient wooden image of the god slightly above life size was indeed pulled down the street of the panathenaia in a boat by a team of captering satyrs the planking almost concealed the four large wheels on which the landboat rolled except for those wheels it seemed perfect in every respect from painted eyes and ram at the bow to gooseheaded sternpost two more satyrs these playing flutes shared the boat with the image of dionysos a wreath of leaves crowned the gods head as if he were enjoying a symposion his right hand held more greenery symbolic of fertility and renewal thats very strange to see menedemos said as the boat drew near whats the point to this parade anyway you mean besides just celebrating the god sostratos asked and his cousin dipped his head sostratos said back about two hundred fifty years ago the little town of eleutherai up on the border with boiotia became part of attica to symbolize the joining they paraded this very statue from eleutherai to the temple at the foot of the athenian akropolisit has to be more than two hundred stadia from eleutherai down to here now they just take the image out of the temple and up to the academy a little outside the walls the day before the dionysia and then have this procession bringing it back on the day the festival starts rattling and creaking the boat went by the image of dionysos smiled its secret smile sostratos had seen that expression on old statues of youths here in athens and elsewhere around the inner sea the smile seemed particularly fitting for a god whose rituals were so wrapped in mystery behind the boat came a chorus of boys singing dionysos praises their leader walked backwards in front of them directing the hymns hed come all the way from the academy like that sostratos wouldnt have wanted to try it he feared he would have fallen on his fundament probably right about here where the most people could see him do it and laugh that thought had hardly crossed his mind before one of the boys a very handsome one coughed loudly from the dust the boat of dionysos kicked up he went scarlet to the roots of his hair the leader of the chorus pulled a horrible face which could only have made the boy feel worse people would remember a public mistake like that for years poor fellow menedemos murmured i wouldnt mind consoling him ill bet you wouldnt and i know just how sostratos said menedemos laughed the festival of dionysos is for things like that he looked around id rather do it with a woman though i expect youll have your chance sostratos said youll have your chance to gorge on meat today too here come the sacrificial animals guided along by herdsmen cattle and sheep shambled down the street of the panathenaia sheep bleated cattle lowed and swung their heads from side to side uneasy in the presence of so many people once dionysos image returned to its temple the god would get the beasts fatwrapped thighbones while the spectators shared the rest of the meat more big phalloi ended the procession as the men who carried them went by the skythian constables stopped holding back the crowd men and women streamed down the street of the panathenaia after the parade some of them waved jars of wine and passed them back and forth others sang snatches of dionysiac hymns come on sostratos said lets head for the temple we can get our share of beef or mutton and take it back to protomakhos house or even piggy menedemos said and sostratos made a face at him for the vulgarity one constable after another stood aside the whole packed agora tried to funnel itself into the street of the panathenaia the result of course was that nobody moved very fast sostratos said well menedemos we wont get to the temple in a hurry menedemos he looked around that might have been his cousin kissing a woman ten or twelve cubits behind him on the other hand it might not quite a few couples were embracing in the crowd and those ten or twelve cubits were so packed with humanity that he got only a very partial glimpse of that one he shrugged and took a few steps south and east toward dionysos temple sooner or later hed get there as for menedemoshe could celebrate the dionysia any way he chose a fairly pretty woman breathed wine fumes up into sostratos face as she tilted her head back to get a good look at him are you really as tall as that she asked and hiccuped of course not he answered gravely im standing on stilts i always do she looked down at his feet to see if he was joking how much wine has she had he wondered a couple of beats slower than she should have she laughed youre a funny fellow she said and youre tall she might have noticed it for the first time sending him a look intended for alluring but in fact more bleary she added i like tall if he wanted his own dionysiac adventure he suspected he could find it he didnt or not with her he said look at that big handsome macedonian over there hes got his eye on you when the woman turned her head sostratos pushed his way through the crowd as far from her as he could go by the time she looked back he wasnt there anymore he feared she would come after him if she did though she never caught up a step here three there half a dozen there he made his way back into the builtup part of athens a young man whod already poured down too much wine leaned over a low wall puking it up again a man and a womanno they werent menedemos and anyone sostratos noted with reliefducked into a house or perhaps an inn a woman whirled through the crowd dancing and clicking castanets she stood on tiptoe to kiss sostratos on the cheek then spun away before he could put his arms around her even before he got to the temple sostratos heard the frightened lowing and bleats from the animals as they smelled the blood of those already sacrificed soon he could smell it himself a heavy rusty odor that penetrated all the other stinks of the city more slave constables kept things orderly in the temple precinct as people queued up to get their gobbets of meat the butchery was crude the only requirement was for all the pieces to be of about the same size so that one person in line didnt take away more than another some people got a fine chunk some a piece full of gristle and fat that was just luck luck and where one happened to stand in line flies buzzed all around more of them every minute as the stream of sacrifices yielded ever more offal and blood if theyd lit only on refuse it wouldnt have been so bad but of course they came to rest wherever they pleased one landed on the soft flesh between sostratos left eyebrow and eyelid he tossed his head like a spooked horse the fly hummed away he swatted at it with the palm of his hand but missed a moment later another bit him on the back of the calf he slapped his leg the fly squashed under his fingers he wiped his hand on his chiton and took a step toward the temple feeling a little better for having killed one bug ancient gnarled olive trees gave shade from the warm spring sun as the queue snaked forward the trees were surely at least as old as the temple itselfand it was in such bad repair a new building would have been needed to do dionysos justice a northerly breeze rustled through the graygreen leaves overhead peeping birds hopped and fluttered from branch to branch sostratos hoped they were eating some of the flies in the name of the god here is meat from the sacrifice a priest said and handed a piece to the woman in front of sostratos in the name of the god i thank you for it she replied and carried it away sostratos took her place the priest gave him a piece of about the same size in the name of the god here is meat from the sacrifice he sounded bored how many times had he said the same thing today in the name of the god i thank you for it sostratos said how many times had the priest heard that as many as hed spoken his own ritual phrase surely as sostratos took his chunk of meat away the priest turned to the next man in the name of the god sostratos did a little surreptitious poking and prodding at the meat it seemed a pretty good piece he took it back to protomakhos house on the way he heard a scuffle an angry shout and then the rapidly fading sound of running feet someone probably wouldnt get to eat the sacrificial portion for which hed stood in line so long the proxenos cook was a lydian named myrsos he too poked at the meat more assuredly than sostratos had done this is a good piece most noble one he said in almost unaccented greek it is better i think than the one my master brought home will yourcousin is italso bring me a chunk my cousin yes i dont know we got separated in the crowd sostratos answered if menedemos had found a woman who pleased him he might not come back for some little while to put that thought out of his mind sostratos asked what will you do with the meat you have that he seldom ate meat made him more curious i shall make a kandaulos a lydian dish myrsos told him the ingredients are boiled meat bread crumbs phrygian cheese anise and a fatty broth in which to simmer them all it is a famous delicacy among my people and you hellenes have come to relish it too ive heard of it sostratos said doesnt menandros mention it in the cook how does it go rich fool of an ionian making his thick soups kandaulos food that rouses lust it is a thick soup yes sir myrsos answered i hadnt heard those verses before and i dont think it rouses lust if menedemos thought it did hed bring you back a whole cow sostratos said the lydian smiled hes a young gentlemanand so are you his own hair held more than a little gray he went on whether it rouses lust or not it is tasty and after i serve the master and you rhodians ill be going out into town myself tonight to see if i can find a friendly lady id do the same thing even if i werent eating kandaulos too yes anything can happen on the first night of the dionysia cant it even if the festival wasnt so wild here as elsewhere sostratos had some warm memories of his own earlier stay in athens he said not a word about myrsos supper plans cooks always ate as well as the people for whom they worked menedemos came back to protomakhos house late that afternoon he did contribute a piece of meat to the kandaulos he smelled of wine and looked pleased with the world protomakhos can say what he wants its a dionysia all right he declared splashing water from the fountain in the courtyard on his face and over his head if you cant find a woman today youre not trying very hard i wonder how many babies born this winter wont look like their mothers husbands sometimes its better not to ask a question sostratos observed you say that you menedemos gave him an owlish halfsozzled stare the fellow who never once leaves off asking things i say it yes some questions should be left quiet if you dont believe me think about oidipous lord of thebes his flaw was following the truth too far its possible its not common but its possible all right my dear im not going to argue with you now thats for sure im in no shape for it youd tear me limb from limb menedemos belched softly was that you i saw kissing a woman in the agora just after the parade went by sostratos asked the crowd had already swept us apart so i wasnt sure if it was you didnt waste any time at all yes that was me menedemos answered we found someplace quietwell out of the way anyhowand had a good time and then i met a slave girl with hair as yellow as a golden orioles feathers you probably would have liked her sostratos you seem to fancy barbarians who look out of the ordinary i do like redhaired women sostratos admitted i gather you liked this blonde pretty well about this well menedemos held his hands a couple of palms apart sostratos snorted his cousin went on and i had a bit of wine well maybe more than a bitso i thought id come back here lie up for a while have some supper and then go see what things are like tonight theyll be wilder or i miss my guess probably sostratos said do remember though the theater opens tomorrow morning as soon as its light three days of tragedies then one of comedies yes yes menedemos mimed an enormous yawn ill probably have to use twigs to prop my eyelids open but so it goes he paused to sniff mmthat must be the kandaulos id rather smell it cooking than the dogs next door by zeus and i wonder if sikon knows how to do up a kandaulos with meat from a sacrifice that would be a fancy dish he could fix without making my fathers wife yell at him because the ingredients are so expensive they do quarrel dont they sostratos said its better than it used to be but even so menedemos rolled his eyes the yawn that followed looked genuine i am going to sleep have one of protomakhos slaves bang on the door before supper will you without waiting for an answer he headed off toward the room the rhodian proxenos had given him he automatically thinks ill do what he tells me sostratos kicked at a pebble in the courtyard menedemos had always thought that ever since the two of them were children most of the time hed been right that gift for getting other people to do what he wanted made him a good skipper it could also make him very annoying sostratos did tell a slave to wake his cousin before supper then he went to the kitchen and dipped out a cup of wine maybe drinking it would soothe his feeling of being used he was sitting on an olivewood bench in the courtyard when protomakhos came downstairs the rhodian proxenos looked smug and happy were you celebrating the dionysia with your wife sostratos wondered that wasnt the sort of license the festival ordained but it somehow seemed more satisfying hail protomakhos said as menedemos had he sniffed ah kandaulos smells good doesnt it it certainly does sostratos said they ate supper just before sundown with lamps brightening protomakhos andron to sostratos disappointment menedemos had emerged before the slave came to rouse him sostratos wouldnt have minded his cousin getting bounced out of bed menedemos looked toward the kitchen if that lydian soup tastes as good as it smells he said it did if anything it tasted even better than it smelled sostratos couldnt remember the last time hed eaten anything so rich and filling if we had meat all the time wed get too fat to show ourselves in the gymnasion he said but oh wouldnt we be happy nothing satisfies like it menedemos agreed well nothing you can eat anyhow myrsos brought out a honeycake full of layers of flaky dough for a sweet it too was very fine as he set the cake before the men in the andron he said im off to join the festival master he wasnt asking permission he was telling protomakhos what he intended to do enjoy yourself ill see you in the morning protomakhos replied a man who tried to keep his slaves at work all the time and didnt let them make merry now and again would have trouble with them in short order the rhodian proxenos plainly knew as much menedemos got to his feet after finishing a piece of cake im going to see whats out there in the night too he said how about you sostratos never know what sort of girl you might run into on a festival night i know every other comedy it seems uses that in the plot these days sostratos said a young man meets a girl when shes out of the house for a festival when else is he likely to meet her protomakhos said when else is she likely to be out of the house true enough o best one but its done so often its getting trite sostratos said either he meets her when shes out or he gets her alone and has his way with her without even realizing shes the girl he loves or the rhodian proxenos broke in again these things do happen that happened with a cousin of mine as a matter of fact and menandros and the other comedians didnt dream of half the mess it caused between his family and the girls oh yes certainly sostratos said if it didnt happen you couldnt write plays about it and expect anyone to take you seriously but doing the same thing over and over again shows a lack of imagination thats what i think anyhow what i think is you still havent said whether youre coming out with me menedemos said not right now anyhow sostratos answered maybe ill go out into the streets later on maybe ill go to bed too you snoozed this afternoon i didnt i intend to go to bed protomakhos said ive got too many years on me to head out after wild revels menedemos raised eyebrow said sostratos was a young man behaving like an old one sostratos raised eyebrow said he didnt care what his cousin thought he waited to see whether menedemos would mock him out loud and start a quarrel menedemos didnt he only shrugged and started out of the andron shall i have a slave get you up in time to go to the theater tomorrow protomakhos called after him after a long pause in the doorway for thought menedemos reluctantly dipped his head yes most noble one please do he said and then left protomakhos did go off to bed a little later sostratos sat by himself in the andron now and then sipping wine and listening to athens enjoy itself around him off in the distance several women called out euoiii euoiii and then burst into drunken laughterplaying at being maenads much closer a man and a woman moaned and then gasped by the soft thumps accompanying those sounds they were probably making love up against a wall i wish i could go out and have a good time like menedemos without second thoughts instead of staying off to one side and observing sostratos picked up his cup once more only to find it empty sometimes i canevery once in a while why not now he shrugged the only answer he could find was he didnt feel like it if i dont feel like doing it i wouldnt be having a good time if i did a woman giggled right outside the house come on sweetheart a man said we can lie here on my himation she giggled again why not why not sostratos could almost always find reasons why not finding reasons why came harder for him he couldnt find one now and so he stayed where he was listening to songs and laughter and revelry and the dogs next door howlingas athens celebrated the dionysia at last with a shrug he went back to the little room protomakhos had given him with the door closed not much of the noise outside came in drifting toward slumber sostratos thought no wonder i want to write a history one day what else am i but a dispassionate observer watching from the edge of the action herodotos had been like that with a passion only for indulging his curiosity thoukydides and xenophon on the other hand had made history as well as writing it maybe i will too one of these days with that hope filling his mind he fell asleep it was still dark when a slave pounded on the door the next morning the racket made sostratos spring out of bed his heart thuttering afraid hed been caught in the middle of an earthquake still naked hed taken two steps toward the door before reason routed blind panic im awake he called and the pounding stopped he went back to the bed to put on his chiton the pounding started again this time one door over sostratos smiled his cousin would like it no betterindeed would probably like it lessthan he had he opened the door and walked to the andron where protomakhos was breakfasting on bread and oil and watered wine good day the proxenos said have something to eat and then well go over to the theater well get there before sunup which ought to mean choice seats that seems good to me sostratos said a slave moving with the slow quiet care of a man with a hangover brought him bread and oil and wine too menedemos came into the andron a couple of minutes later he moved much as the slave had good day he said softly as if the sound of his own voice might pain him good day sostratos and protomakhos said together sostratos asked and how was your night of roistering enjoyablethen im paying for it now menedemos answered when the slave brought him breakfast he picked at the bread but gulped down the wine after a little while he dipped his head thats better by the dog of egypt takes the edge off the headache protomakhos rose from his stool good lets head for the theater then sostratos followed eagerly menedemos followed too but with a small groan they picked their way through the morning twilight the entrance lay only a few blocks north and east of protomakhos house people streamed towards it from all over the city even this early accents far from attic said more than a few of them had come a long way to see the days plays when they got to the theater protomakhos handed the attendant a drakhma saying this is for the three of us certainly best one the man said and stood aside to let them by you didnt need to do that sostratos protested we wanted to buy your seat to show in a small way how grateful we are for your kindness dont worry about it protomakhos replied what is a proxenos for but to show his guests the sights of his own polis thank you very much sostratos said menedemos dipped his head as if afraid it would fall off if he werent careful he hadnt said more than two or three words since leaving the proxenos house he did look better than he had when he first came into the andron along with the wine the cool crisp air of early morning was helping revive him the two rhodians and protomakhos made their way down toward the orkhestra the outthrust semicircular area where the chorus danced and sang the narrow stone aisle had transverse grooves cut in it to help keep feet from slipping the slope was one in eight steep enough to make falls a danger this should do pretty well protomakhos said and stepped off the aisle to sit down on a stone bench sostratos and menedemos followed the benches were all the same with a raised portion for spectators backsides and a lower part behind it where the people in the next row back could rest their feet women had their own section in the theater off to the left by the odeion that area had been added on after the odeion was built for it fit around the corner of perikles great structure looking toward the women seemed to make menedemos recover better than wine or fresh air had done even though many of them wore veils against the prying eyes of men protomakhos looked that way too in my greatgrandfathers day this was a place for men only he remarked i like it better this way yes menedemos was coming back to life sostratos asked do you know best one just when they did begin to admit women to the theater the proxenos tossed his head theyve been coming as long as i can remember thats all i can say for certain someone ought to know something like that sostratos clicked his tongue between his teeth i wonder who pointing to a stone chair in the center of the very first row protomakhos said thats where the priest of dionysos eleutherios sits if anyone could tell you when the custom changed hes probably the man sostratos started to get up and go down to him then and there but menedemos took hold of his arm saying he has other things to worry about right now my dear i suppose so sostratos admitted but im liable to forget if i dont ask when something first occurs to me you menedemos laughed you dont forget anything if you ever found out the name of perikles dog youd remember it till the end of time he was right but when sostratos said thats different he knew he too was right though he would have been hard pressed to explain the difference between the two kinds of memory but menedemos was also right in saying the priest had other things on his mind the graybearded gentleman kept bouncing out of his chair to talk with one or another of the magistrates sitting in the first row and with the highranking macedonian officers who also got some of those prime seatsa sure sign of how much or rather how little athenian freedom and autonomy were worth these days protomakhos said if youre interested theres demetrios of phaleron he pointed to one of the dignitaries in the front row the athenian who served as kassandros governor was younger than sostratos had thought him on his previous stay in athensabout fortyfive he was also strikingly handsome that sostratos had recalled accurately with a chuckle menedemos said even if were not interested hes still demetrios of phaleron protomakhos blinked sostratos groaned yes his cousin was starting to feel better and he half wished menedemos werent in came the chorus of boys singing the same hymns they had during the procession the day before following them this time on a small cart instead of the wheeled boat in which it had ridden down the street of the panathenaia was the ancient wooden statue of dionysos as he did every year the god would watch the plays put on in his honor a couple of dozen youths coming of age this year marched out into the orkhestra behind the chorus a magistrate presented each of them with a suit of hoplites armor they were the sons of athenians whod died in battle for their polis that custom went back a long way the youths got loud applause as they took their seats at the front of the theater most of their fathers would have fallen fighting the macedonians who dominated the polis now cheering them was one way to show what people felt about the occupiers look this time protomakhos pointed up at the great buildings of the akropolis behind them the sun has risen wont be long before its rays get down here too one more argument the world is round sostratos said to menedemos if it were flat the sun would rise at the same time everywhere but naturally a high spot on the sphere catches the light coming around the edge of the curve before a lower one can im sorry best one but thats much too much like thought for so early in the morning menedemos replied sostratos sniffed menedemos waved to a wineseller the fellow waited in the aisle till menedemos drained the little earthenware cup then refilled it from the jar he carried at his side like a sword other hucksters went up and down the aisles with raisins and dried figs and little honey cakes and sausages and onions and chunks of cheese sostratos said the worse the play is the better the business the men with the food will do seems only fair menedemos peered down toward the raised skene behind the orkhestra were close enough to the stage to hit the actors with onions if theyre very bad then he looked over his shoulder at all the thousands of people sitting behind him and were close enough to the skene for all of them back there to hit us with onions if the actors are very bad protomakhos laughed anyone would know youve gone to a few plays in your time most noble one even if youve never come to the theater at athens before are they going to put on revivals the first day sostratos asked thats how they did it when i was a student here the proxenos dipped his head yes thats right that custom hasnt changed theyre reaching back a long way this year too this is aiskhylos series of theban playssemele xantriai pentheus and the satyr play dionysos nurses sostratos whistled those must go back more than a hundred fifty yearsbefore perikles day the pentheus treats the same episode as euripides bakkhai doesnt it yes protomakhos dipped his head again euripides play has put all the others about dionysos in the shade but demetrios of phaleron is khoregos for these not only is he rich enough to do a firstclass job hes also an antiquarian so its no surprise that hed put on something nobodys seen for a long time this should be interesting sostratos leaned forward on the bench so did menedemos for a moment that surprised sostratos but his cousin after all was the one who didnt have modern tastes and aiskhylos with unhellenic modesty had called his own work crumbs from the banquet of homer out came the first actor to set the scene a messenger talking about the report that kadmos daughter semele was with childthe child who would be dionysos a townsman of thebes answered him they went back and forth only two actors menedemos whispered to sostratos yes thats right sostratos whispered back sophokles introduced the third speaking part aiskhylos they say introduced the second protomakhos put in before his time it was just one man going back and forth with the chorus sostratos dipped his head hypokrites the word that meant actor came from the verb meaning to answer a chorus of the women who would wash the newborn child after its birth danced out into the orkhestra singing the performers were of course male as was the actor who portrayed semele women did not take part in plays with masks and the actors remarkable control over their voices sostratos did not feel or even notice the lack he did notice how stiff and formal and oldfashioned the chorus steps and gestures were sure enough demetrios of phaleron was an antiquarian and was doing his best to stage the play as it might have appeared in aiskhylos day even the musical accompaniment seemed unusually slow and spare that fascinated sostratos and made him feel as if hed been swept back in time aiskhylos splendid poetry didnt hurt there either but not all the audience reacted the same way a shout rang out from the back of the theater come on you stupid geezers shake a leg protomakhos laughed everyones a critic or thinks he is the second choral interlude brought more catcalls apparently a good many people used to things as they were didnt care aboutor for things as they had been everything stays in the present in their minds sostratos thought sadly no wonder it took so long before herodotos came up with the idea of investigating the past in any systematic way semele ended with the death of dionysos mother under the thunderbolt of zeus and with the apparent death of the god too xantriai which followed took its name from the chorus of woolcarding women who defended semeles name against the gossip and slander about her union with zeus hera zeus consort appeared to stir up the thebans against zeus newest offspring and the infant gods mother heres something out of the ordinary sostratos murmured to menedemos an outraged wife his cousin made a face at him aiskhylos pentheus did cover the same ground as euripides bakkhai the return of the fullgrown god to thebes king pentheus attempt to suppress and arrest him and pentheus horrible deathhis rendingat the hands of dionysos maenads who included agaue the kings own mother sostratos thought euripides play which he knew well did more interesting and thoughtprovoking things with the old familiar story the bakkhai hadnt become famous for nothing but aiskhylos was a magnificent poet in his own right too like any satyr play dionysos nurses let the audience recover from the full force of the tragedies they had just watched it was loud and lewd and foolish with satyrs with jutting phalloi in pursuit of the women who had reared the infant dionysos comedy had sprung from the same roots but grown in a different direction satyr plays indeed had grown very little changing hardly at all from the days when drama was something new in hellas after the satyrs capered off the stage for the last time the actors in the company and in the chorus came out to take their bows the applause was loud and generous theyd delivered their lines and danced and sung as well as anyone could want then demetrios of phaleron stood up the production had been his he looked up and out at the vast crowd and bowed as the performers had done he also drew cheers from those who had liked the playsand louder ones here and there cheers sostratos suspected of coming from members of his claque but unlike the actors and chorus members he didnt come off unscathed dont serve us stale fish the next time shouted someone not far from the rhodians your plays were even more boring than you are on the stump another man yelled from far up in the theater he had lungs like a smiths goatskin bellows for sostratos heard him plainly some of the jeers that rained down on demetrios had nothing to do with the plays hed just presented how does it feel being kassandros catamite you widearsed effeminate an athenian shouted he wont answerits like farting at a deaf man somebody else said that jerked a startled laugh out of sostratos the usual phrase of course was shouting at a deaf man somehow though the theater precinct seemed to give license to everyone not just the performers to the crows with kassandros another man cried athens should be free those words brought shouts of agreement from the crowd here and there men shook their fists at demetrios he has nerve menedemos murmured sostratos dipped his head despite the insults raining down on him the lord of athens stood there smiling and waving and bowing to the crowd as if they were nothing but praise of course he also has the macedonian garrison behind him sostratos observed yes youre right protomakhos said weve already spent too many lives and too much treasure if we rose against demetrios of phaleron kassandros men would slaughter us and the truth is the macedonian could have a much nastier puppet so we yell but thats all were likely to do the rhodian proxenos was right after getting the abuse out of their systems the athenians filed from the theater peaceably enough the sun had traveled across the sky and was low in the west menedemos said my rear end is as petrified as that lump of wood turned to rock you bought in mytilene sostratos he rubbed at his haunches and he was far from the only man doing so sitting on a stone bench will make you feel it sostratos agreed he turned to protomakhos meaning no disrespect to your stockintrade o best one my bottoms sore too protomakhos said no such thing as soft stone will there be another trilogy tomorrow or will the modern tragedies be separate from one another menedemos asked almost certainly single plays sostratos answered he turned to protomakhos who was the last tragedian who tried a trilogy to the crows with me if i remember the proxenos said nobody writes them these days because all the tragedians know theyd never find a khoregos who could afford to produce a whole trilogy demetrios of phaleron can but you have to know hes spending his patrons silver not just his own finding a khoregos who can afford to put on even one tragedy is hard enough but three and a satyr play he tossed his head say what you will about demetrios but i enjoyed the plays sostratos said i enjoyed the staging too that has to be what it was like in the old days yes splendid and a little clumsy at the same time protomakhos said they knew they were splendid they didnt know they were clumsy didnt know and didnt care sostratos said but we know menedemos said that makes watching the plays different for us from what it would have been for them we know what they turned into by the dog we are what they turned into sostratos started to answer that but then checked himself after a few steps he started over youd better be careful my dear every once in a while you say something that shows youre much more clever than you usually let on who me menedemos was used to mockery from sostratos he didnt seem to know what to make of praise after a startled blink he turned it into a joke saying believe me ill try not to let it happen again protomakhos laughed anyone can see at a glance you two like each other pretty well that offended both sostratos and menedemos they both indignantly denied itso indignantly they started laughing too sostratos said oh yes we get on fine whenever i dont feel like strangling this thickskin which i do about half the time only half menedemos bowed to him i must be getting better and i havent said a word about how often i wish i could pitch you over the rail they came down the little street south of the temple of dionysos the one that opened onto the street where protomakhos lived a couple of women came up the street from the other side of the theater they had been chattering when they saw the rhodians and protomakhos they drew their veils up higher and fell silent one of them hurried past the men the other turned down the same street she walked on without a word in a low voice protomakhos murmured my wife oh sostratos discreetly didnt look at her he did glance at menedemos to his relief his cousin had developed an apparently absorbing interest in some swallows circling overhead chance meetings after festivals were the wine and opson of the plots of modern comedies in real life though they were liable to cause troubleespecially with menedemos taste for adultery protomakhos knocked at the door a slave opened it protomakhos wife went through first the men followed now menedemos couldnt look up at birds was he eyeing the womans hindquarters and the way she moved her hips when she walked or was he simply looking straight ahead as anyone might do sostratos would have believed that of anyone else put his cousin even accidentally around a married woman and who could say what might happen protomakhos wife behaved with perfect propriety she pretended the men with her husband didnt exist menedemos didnt watch her as she went over to the stairway and presumably up to the womens quarters sostratos was jumpy enough to mislike the way menedemos didnt watch her ill go see how myrsos is doing with supper protomakhos said and headed for the kitchen menedemos let out a small soft sigh sostratos felt ice run up his back he was as frightened as if hed heard an owl in daylight more so in fact he could if he worked at it dismiss his fear about the owl as superstition but he knew what that sigh meant out of the side of his mouth he hissed shes our hosts wife do try to remember that yes my dear menedemos said in a way that proved hed barely heard doesnt she have the most exciting walk you ever saw with a walk like that she must be a handful and a half in bed youre a handful and a half all the time sostratos replied in something not far from despair menedemos only smiled at him protomakhos came out with a smile on his face too oysters myrsos said the rhodian proxenos reported menedemos smile got wider now sostratos despair was unalloyed why had the cook chosen this of all nights to do up a supper widely thought to be aphrodisiac as dusk fell the sounds of revelry again floated over the walls and into protomakhos house the athenian scooped another oyster out of its shell i may go out myself see what kind of a good time i can find he said ive been sitting in the theater all day i dont want to sit all night too how about you boys us menedemos said were just a couple of stickinthemuds tonight im afraid well all go to the theater tomorrow though eh youre no stickinthemud sostratos thought you just dont feel like leaving the house to hunt protomakhos noticed nothing amiss yes the theater he said ill be the one with the thick head come morning i expect the proxenos left a hunters smile on his own face menedemos yawned i think ill go to bed he said do you sostratos said tonelessly yes im tired his cousin sounded perfectly innocent that only made sostratos more suspicious but what could he do except go to bed himself he intended to stay awake as long as he could to listen and make sure menedemos stayed in his own room sleep sneaked up on him though the next thing he knew a slave was pounding on the door time to get up for the theater sir the man said to the crows with but sostratos by then was resigned to being awake he got out of bed eased himself and went to the andron for breakfast protomakhos and menedemos were already there how are you today sostratos asked well thank you the proxenos replied just fine menedemos added with a smile that could mean anything or nothing sostratos devoutly hoped it meant nothing he perched on a stool the slave whod awakened him brought him barley porridge and watered wine eat up protomakhos said showing no ill effects from whatever carousing hed done the night before the sooner we get to the theater the better the seats well have sostratos watched his cousin as he spooned up the porridge menedemos showed nothing out of the ordinary had he gone upstairs and tried to seduce protomakhos wife if hed tried had he succeeded whatever had happened the woman hadnt gone to her husband with a tale of rape or attempted rape that was something but what had menedemos done were they in danger of being summarily evicted or worse menedemos bland expression was proof against sostratos curiosity as soon as protomakhos finished breakfast he got up so did menedemos sostratos joined them protomakhos said well now well see how our modern poets stack up against aiskhylos bet on aiskhylos menedemos said i like some of the modern work sostratos said protomakhos dipped his head menedemos said as far as im concerned youre both welcome to it most modern tragedians think they have to be different to be clever and most of the differences are no good thats how i see it anyhow some truth to that certainly protomakhos said only some though i think o best one some of the poetry thats written nowadays is very fine sostratos went into the theater prepared to agree with the proxenos this time despite protomakhos protests he and menedemos paid for their hosts seat protomakhos responded by chasing a honeycake seller up an aisle to buy some of his wares for the rhodians as soon as he was out of earshot sostratos said please tell me you didnt didnt what yes menedemos was too innocent by half you know what make a play for the proxenos wife you know you were eyeing her you admitted it her walk sostratos clapped a hand to his forehead all right ill tell you i didnt make a play for her menedemos leaned over and kissed him on the cheek but my dear am i telling you the truth before sostratos could find any answer for that protomakhos came back with the honey cakes sostratos sat there eating and licking his fingers and worrying he didnt stop worrying even when the plays started maybe his own glum mood made him less receptive to them than he would have been otherwiseor maybe menedemos had a point and they really werent very good over that day and the next about half the tragedies he saw imitated old models so closely he wondered why their poets had bothered setting pen to papyrus the others were definitely new which did not to his ear mean they improved on their predecessors one of those innovative plays a dolon by an athenian named diomedon that ran on the third day of the tragedies left menedemos furious that was an outrage he kept saying as sostratos and he and protomakhos left the theater nothing but an outrage how in the way the poet treated odysseus sostratos thought he knew what was bothering his cousin and he proved right menedemos dipped his head the way he mistreated odysseus you should say you know the story in the iliad i hope yes my dear sostratos said patiently i havent your passion for homer but i do know the poems odysseus and diomedes are out spying for the stronggreaved akhaioi and they run into dolon whos spying for the trojans they run him down he begs for his life but they kill him instead of holding him for ransom thats close but its not quite right and the differences are important menedemos was still fuming in the iliad dolon begs diomedes for his life and diomedes is the one who sends him down to the house of hades but what did this socalled tragedian do he made odysseus into the villain thats what he had him string dolon along swear a false oath to him that he wouldnt be hurt if he talked and then once he told all he knew what does the poet have odysseus do he makes him turn to diomedes and say truth is wasted on the foe and then diomedes kills dolon that isnt right protomakhos said best one poets have been showing odysseus as a treacherous conniver at least since the days of sophokles and you cant deny that thats part of his character in the epics i dont deny it menedemos said earnestly that is part of his character but its not the only part and the tragedians do him wrong by making it out to be all of what he is odysseus is sophron he gets the most out of the wits he has hes not so great a warrior as akhilleus but he has more sense in one toe than akhilleus does in his head that isnt saying much sostratos put in well no menedemos agreed odysseus though is the man who can do everything well he outwits polyphemos the cyclops he can build a boat or a bed he fights bravely whenever he has to he can plow a field and hes the one who at agamemnons assembly keeps the akhaioi from giving up and sailing home you admire him protomakhos said who wouldnt admire a man like that menedemos said except a tragedian who thinks he knows more about him than homer does i mean dont you think modern poets are entitled to take what they need from the iliad and odyssey sostratos asked wed be missing a lot of our tragedy if they didnt you know taking what they need is one thing of course they can do that menedemos replied deliberately twisting what they take though turning it into the opposite of what it was that goes too far and i think thats what this diomedon did you notice the judges didnt give him a prize maybe they felt the same way your cousin has strong views protomakhos said to sostratos hes a free hellene hes entitled to them sostratos replied we dont always agree but we have fun arguing what did you think of dolon the proxenos asked him id forgotten it was diomedes who killed him in the iliad sostratos confessed that being so i think this poet may have gone a bit too far myself ah well protomakhos said with a shrug you rhodians have been luckier in your government lately than we have i can see how an athenian might want to write a play about a clever devious politician who stops at nothing to get what he wants oh sostratos eyes widened youre telling me this isnt just about odysseus its about demet menedemos stepped on his foot if it is about demetrios of phaleron he hissed how big an idiot are you for shouting it to the housetops do you want macedonians breaking down protomakhos door in the middle of the night to haul you away and see how many interesting things they can do to youand to our hostand to me to him plainly the last was most important but he was just as plainly right sostratos admitted as much adding even so it does make me more inclined to forgive dolon well maybe menedemos said grudgingly i still dont care for what it did but our kind host has shown a reason why comedies tomorrow sostratos said you wont have to worry about ferreting out nasty political messages there i wouldnt have had to worry about ferreting them out in aristophanes day either menedemos said he came right out and shouted them in peoples faces we cant get away now with what he did then protomakhos said he couldnt get away with it either by the end of his career look at ploutos its about wealth but its not about or not very much about the people of the time it looks forward to the kinds of comedies poets write nowadays in fact the kinds of comedies people write nowadays menedemos muttered hes not much for them sostratos told protomakhos i told him to wait till hed heard one by menandros i certainly hope hes finished the piece you said he was working on i dont know one way or the other the rhodian proxenos replied well find out tomorrow so we will sostratos sounded cheerful so we will menedemos sounded anything but at supper that evening protomakhos made no remarks about going out to celebrate the dionysia menedemos didnt urge him to go out or ask questions about whether he would sostratos hoped that meant his cousin really hadnt seduced or tried to seduce the proxenos wife menedemos enjoyed making him nervous almost as much as he enjoyed adultery the next day dawned chilly with a nasty wind whipping down from the north protomakhos wrapped himself in a himation before heading for the theater it was cold enough to tempt sostratos to do the same but he didnt menedemos acted as if the weather had nothing to do with him arent you fellows going to freeze protomakhos said were sailors sostratos replied when was the last time you saw a seafaring man in anything but his chiton have it your way protomakhos said but if your teeth chatter too loud to let me hear the lines ill be annoyed at you they got splendid seats the cold weather kept lots of people indoors till after sunup sostratos teeth did chatter he clamped his jaw tight as he could to keep protomakhos from noticing out swaggered the actors for the first comedy they didnt wear big phalloi strapped to their waists as they would have done a couple of generations before their masks were more realistic less burlesqued than they would have been in earlier times too indeed little except the play itself distinguished them from tragic actors and some performers worked in both types of drama their play unfortunately did not distinguish itself the verse limpeda couple of times badly enough to make sostratos wince even by the loose standards of comedy the plot was stupid and the jokes fell flat as the dancers of the chorus twirled out to separate one act from anotherthey didnt also sing as they would have in aristophanes timemenedemos turned to sostratos and said how does a play this bad ever get produced i dont know sostratos answered but ill give you an even more frightening thought if you like whats that menedemos sounded as if he doubted sostratos could come up with one but sostratos did just remember only dionysos knows how many worse comedies were written comedies not even a maniac would want to bring to the stage his cousin shuddered youre right that is frightening as the play dragged on the audience grew more and more restless people shouted at the actors they threw onions and squash and cabbages one of the actors after nimbly dodging a squash turned to face the crowd in smoother verse than the comic poet had given him he said if you think these lines are hard to listen to rememberwe have to bring them out he got a bigger laugh for his own words than he had for the poets the vegetables stopped flying so much for this comic poets reputation sostratos murmured yes but the other question is how much has the actor hurt himself with his quick tongue protomakhos said some people wont want to hire him now afraid hell step out of character again at last mercifully the comedy ended the one that followed was betterbut then bad wine was better than vinegar menedemos said i dont think aristophanes has much to worry about this year sostratos would have liked to argue with him he knew he couldnt not by what theyd seen so far but then the herald announced the third and final comedy kolax by menandros now youll see something worth seeing sostratos said not a bad title the flatterer menedemos said but what will he do with it if he makes a hash of it the way these last two fellows did he leaned back and folded his arms across his chest as if challenging menandros to impress him to sostratos vast relief the poet did not disappoint his portrait of a flatterer was alarmingly realistic the strutting soldier against whom the title character played came from a breed all too common since alexanders time and his cook might have been sikon straight from menedemos household he certainly sounded as full of himself as sikon did a libation youthe one following megive me the sacrificers portion where are you looking a libation come along my slave sosias a libation good pour let us pray to the olympian gods and olympian goddesses to them all male and female take the tongue on account of this let them give salvation health enjoyment of our present good things and good fortune to us all let us pray for that everything ended happily as it was supposed to in comedy with the flatterer arranging for the soldier to share the girls favors with her neighbor the play got more applause than the other two put together turning to menedemos sostratos asked what did you think that wasnt bad menedemos sounded oddly reluctant as if he didnt want to admit it but couldnt help himself no that wasnt bad at all it wasnt aristophanes its not supposed to be aristophanes sostratos broke in i was going to say that very thing if youd given me the chance his cousin said with some irritation its not aristophanes but i enjoyed it you were right there are you happy now yes sostratos said which disarmed menedemos he went on i was pretty sure i would like itive always enjoyed menandros comedies but i could only hope you would im glad you do if it doesnt win the prize for comedy someones been spreading silver amongst the judges again protomakhos said weve had that happen a few times at rhodes too sostratos said menedemos made a nasty face to show what he thought of it sostratos asked how common is it here i remember rumors in my student days ive seen more really bad choices these past ten years than i can ever remember before the rhodian proxenos answered i suspect that has to do with he shrugged well you know what i mean sostratos didnt not at first but he also didnt need long to figure out what protomakhos meant lots of things for sale these days he asked casually not mentioning demetrios of phaleron by name hed learned his lesson protomakhos dipped his head you might say so yes you just might say so but then the head of the panel of judges cupped his hands in front of his mouth and called the winner of the prize for comedy this year is the flatterer by menandros people who hadnt left the theater cheered and clapped their hands a thin man of about thirtyfive sitting in the second row stood up waved rather sheepishly and then sat down again he can do better than that protomakhos said clucking in disapproval hes been winning prizes for ten years now he ought to show that he thinks he deserves them he shrugged well no help for it and well be going back to our regular lives in a couple of days the dionysia comes only once a year im glad we got here in time for it though sostratos said now menedemos and i can start thinking about making enough profit to cover all these idle days he looked north and west toward the agora well do it xenokleia clung to menedemos and wept in the darkness of her bedchamber what are we going to do she wailed but quietly so no sound seeped out through the door or the shutters the dionysia ends after tonight and ill never see you again kissing her he tasted the salt of her tears hed thought she would show better sense she had to be three or four years older than he was somewhere on the far side of thirty he tried to make light of things what do you mean youll never see me again sweetheart dont be silly all youll have to do is look down from that window into the courtyard and there ill be my cousin and i are going to stay in athens most of the summer she cried harder than ever thats even worse she said ill see you but i wont be able to talk to you wont be able to touch you she did very intimately you might as well let a starving man see a banquet but keep him from eating that was flattering and alarming at the same time hed thought hed found an affair with which to enjoy himself at the dionysia but xenokleia thought shed found what a lover to carry her away as paris had carried off helen if so she was due for disappointment and you may be due for trouble menedemos told himself theres something you need to do he said to her what this her hand closed on him again he felt himself starting to rise had he met her a few years earlier they would already have been coupling once more he needed a little longer between rounds than he had in his early twenties but despite the distraction he tossed his head no dear sometime soon you need to seduce your husband put on something saffron and make up your face when he takes you stretch your slippers up toward the roof he knew he was quoting from the oath in lysistrate but aristophanes had said it better than he could you tell me that now when were like this xenokleia seized his hand and set it on her bare breast though she and protomakhos had a married daughter and a young grandson her breasts were as firm and upstanding as a younger womansshe probably hadnt nursed her baby herself menedemos knew she was angry he also knew he had to risk that anger i do darling he said seriously if you happen to be with child hed better be able to think its his oh to his relief xenokleias anger evaporated she sighed after you hell be moldy saltfish after mullet youre sweet he said and poising himself above her stretched her feet up toward the roof though she wasnt wearing slippers afterwards she started to cry again dont do that he told her running a hand along the sweet curve of her hip it was fun we enjoyed it remember that forget the rest its over xenokleia wept harder than ever maybe well find another chance if your husband goes to a symposion or something menedemos said but it was goodfor what it waseven if we dont for what it was xenokleia plainly didnt like the sound of that i wanted it to be she sighed but thats not going to happen is it no menedemos was in his own way honest and even if it did after a while youd decide you would rather have kept this believe me my dearyou would you dont know how little this is xenokleia said to someone like menedemos who associated an attic accent with wisdom and authority her words carried extra weight because of the way she said them she said if i do take protomakhos to bed hes liable to fall over dead from surprise do it anyhow menedemos told her no matter how much weight her words held he remained sure of what this situation needed and besides lovewho knows if you make him happy maybe hell make you happy too xenokleias voice held only vinegar not likely all he cares for is his own pleasure thats why she didnt go on not with words but squeezed him tight you could teach him you know i think he can learn if you do hes not a stupid man friendly women taught me menedemos said protomakhos wife stared at him her eyes enormous in the darkness she laughed again this time on a different note funny that an adulterer should give me advice about how to get on better with my husband why menedemos asked stroking her hes going to be here im not you should have all the fun you can no matter where you get it you mean that xenokleia said wonderingly menedemos dipped his head yes of course i do of course she echoed and laughed once more no wonder you get so many womendont try to tell me this is the first time youve played this game because i know better youre too good at it much too good but you really do want everybody to have a good time dont you well yes menedemos said lifes a lot more enjoyable when you do and a lot of the time you can if only youll work at it a little dont you think so now he squeezed her and bent his head to tease her nipple with his tongue her breath sighed out if you keep doing that i wont ever want to let you go and i have to dont i im afraid so he kissed her one last time put on his chiton and slid downstairs without a sound the bedroom door closed softly behind him he peered out across the courtyard from the darkness at the bottom of the stairway no slaves stirring good he hurried over to the little chamber protomakhos had given him hed almost got there when a churring nightjar swooping low after a moth flew in front of his face and made him recoil in alarm stupid bird menedemos muttered here was the door he let out a sigh of relief hed made it he worked the latch opened the door stepped inside and closed and barred it behind him the room was inky black no lamp was lit but he needed none to find the bed hed taken one step toward it when a deep voice spoke from out of the gloom good evening son of philodemos menedemos froze ice climbed his spine faster than a squirrel racing up a tree if protomakhos had caught him sneaking back to his chamber that was almost as bad as catching him in bed with xenokleia i i can expl he began and then broke off as wit started to penetrate the first shock of terror furies take you sostratos he burst out his cousin laughed softly there in the darkness i just wanted you to think about a big radish up your arse or whatever else protomakhos might choose to do with you if he caught you with his wife think no menedemos tossed his head what you wanted me to do was fall over dead from fright and you almost got your wish his heart still thumped as if hed run from marathon to the city but that wasnt exertion he felt it was the dregs of panic had you done nothing wrong you wouldnt need to fear sostratos pointed out when i was a little boy my mother could talk to me that way menedemos said im not a little boy any more and my mothers dead and even if she were still alive you arent her someone needs to talk sense into you sostratos answered or scare it into you if talking doesnt work our own host now that the dionysias over his wife and i are probably done so stop fretting menedemos said if he didnt neglect her she wouldnt have looked at me would she he doesnt sostratos said and how do you know that menedemos jeered i know what xenokleia told me and i know what i saw the first day of the dionysia while you were still chasing other women through the city sostratos retorted what i saw was protomakhos coming downstairs from the womens quarters with the look of a man whos just enjoyed himself with a woman how much truth was his wife telling you do you suppose i dont know menedemos muttered to himself xenokleia had certainly sounded convincingbut then she would have wouldnt she he tried to rally for all you know protomakhos bedded a slave girl not his wifeif he bedded anybody at all the only married men who sleep with slaves in their own houses are fools sostratos said are you going to tell me protomakhos is that kind of fool you never can tell menedemos replied but he knew the response was weak as hed said to xenokleia he didnt think her husband was any kind of fool by all the signs the stone merchant was a very clever man that being so he went on i already told youwhatever happened between xenokleia and me which is none of your business it is if what you do lands us in trouble in athens sostratos broke in it wont because were through i told you that menedemos said now kindly get out of my room where you had no business coming in the first place as sostratos pushed past himalmost walked into himgoing to the door menedemos added and dont think ill forget this either because i wont i owe you one and we both know it i quiver i shudder i quake sostratos opened the door and closed it behind him he didnt slam it that would have drawn attention to them a moment later his own door opened and then closed the bar thudded into place menedemos barred his door again he lay down wondering if hed sleep after the fright sostratos had given him he also wondered how many lies hed heard from xenokleia hed told more than a few lies in his time to end up in bedor leaning against a wall or sitting on a stool or in any number of other postureswith a woman having a woman lie to him for the same reason washe thoughtsomething new why had she to get sympathy to make him angry at protomakhos he shrugged it wasnt likely to matter now it had better not he told himself the dionysia was over starting tomorrow he would get down to business and no matter how enjoyable xenokleia had been he looked forward to it he yawned wiggled stretched and slept when he woke the next morning rain was pattering down on protomakhos courtyard it was late in the season but not impossibly late he was glad the aphrodite already lay tied up at peiraieus sailing in the rain was asking for trouble menedemos and sostratos emerged from their rooms at the same time they both hurried to the andron the rhodian proxenos was eating bread and oil when they came in good day best ones he said after swallowing a bite the herbs and flowers will grow later than usual and better than usual this year and well get muddy menedemos said looking down at his feet they already had a slave brought breakfast for him and his cousin i thank you he murmured and began to eat fewer people will come to the agora on a day like today protomakhos said you might want to stay here and take it easy till the rain eases up though menedemos for several reasons wouldnt have minded at all sostratos spoke up before he could many thanks most noble one but wed better go down to the ship and bring up some of our goods if you could set aside a storeroom or two for them wed be in your debt even more than we are already much easier to do business out of athens than to have to go back and forth to the akatos youre diligent the proxenos said approvingly men who work even when they dont have to often go far let me talk to my steward and well see just which space we can set aside for you youll have all you need i promise you that as the two rhodians started down toward peiraieus in the rain menedemos said by the dog of egypt sostratos i wasnt going to sneak up to xenokleia with her husband in the house you didnt have to drag me away by the ear like that so you say now his cousin replied for one thing i didnt want to take the chance for another we do need to get to work while its raining menedemos skirted a puddle in which something nasty bobbed whats the easiest way to steal a victory sostratos answered his own question to move faster than your foe look at alexander time and again look at antigonos when he used a forced march to fall on eumenes before eumenes even knew he was anywhere close by im not planning on spearing any athenian merchants only prying silver out of them menedemos replied sostratos was in no mood to listen to banter more often than not menedemos could lead his cousin today he had to follow in sostratos muddy wake they left athens and made their way down to the great polis port between the long walls the soldiers on those walls wrapped themselves in cloaks and capes and himatia they still looked miserable up there menedemos felt pretty miserable himself he was mudsplashed almost to the knee so was sostratos but he ignored it when menedemos complained all his cousin said was weve both got hats back at the aphrodite theyll keep the rain out of our eyes when we go up to athens again hurrah menedemos said sourly ive never yet seen a hat that will keep my legs dry though almost makes me want to wear trousers like a kelt barbarous garments sostratos said which was certainly true and then besides do you want to have wet muddy wool flopping and flapping on your calves and thighs that was not only true but sensiblevery much like sostratos to manage both at once few people were on the road down to peiraieus or for that matter coming up from the port either without sostratos dragging him out of protomakhos house menedemos wouldnt have been on the road either he glumly squelched along to his relief and more than a little to his surprise sostratos didnt nag him about seducing xenokleia not that shed taken much seducing since it was also very much like his cousin to nag he wondered why sostratos was holding back now he didnt wonder enough to ask though that probably would have got sostratos going they were already in the port and close to the wharves when sostratos sighed and remarked i do sometimes wonder my dear if youll ever learn of course i learn i can talk women into bed who would have ignored me when my line was rougher a few years ago menedemos came within a digit of saying that out loud but it would have started the quarrel he didnt feel like having and so reluctantly he swallowed the words he gave back a soft answer instead look you can see the aphrodites mast and yard from here i hope everythings been all right while we were celebrating the dionysia diokles would have sent word up into athens if hed run into real trouble sostratos said he was right again he was also successfully distracted which made menedemos even happier menedemos waved to the aphrodite as he and sostratos came up the pier toward the merchant galley someone aboard the akatos waved back squinting through the rain menedemos called that you diokles its me all right the oarmaster answered i know the two of you well enough by your size next to each other menedemos was most of a head shorter than sostratos not caring to be reminded of it he glowered at his cousin as if it were sostratos fault the oblivious diokles went on everythings fine here young sirs thats good news menedemos and sostratos said together menedemos added nobody got in trouble celebrating the festival not so youd notice diokles replied somebodyi forget wholost a tooth in a tavern brawl a few more men got black eyes and such and weve been gobbling cabbage like you wouldnt believe to fight our hangovers ive never found it does much good menedemos said wellwatered wine the next morning works better weve done that too diokles said teleutas who wasas often happenedlounging around not doing much let out an indignant squawk diokles dipped his head oh yesteleutas says he had his pouch slit at a brothel only a couple of drakhmai lost though if he did hed just gone through most of his pay on wine before he got himself a woman the sailor squawked again what do you mean if it happened just like i said diokles shrugged i wasnt there menedemos and sostratos looked at each other they shrugged in unison teleutas was a less than reliable witness hed proved as much many times over smiling slightly sostratos muttered something under his breath menedemos couldnt make out what it was but had a pretty good idea amusement that an occasional thief should complain of theft were going to take some of our goods up to the proxenos house in athens proper menedemos said that way sostratos and i can do business without running back here whenever we sell something sostratos ducked under the poop deck emerging with the leather sacks that held beeswax papyrus embroidered cloth from the east and the truffles theyd got in mytilene these are all light he said i can take them myself i havent got a whole lot of sailors here skipper diokles said worriedly if you dont want to be going back and forth all day youll need to hire some of these harborside loungers and scroungers what do you think sostratos menedemos asked you handle the silver his cousin was a slow man with an obolos one of the things that made him a good toikharkhos he dipped his head now without the least hesitation yes wed better do it he said the point of bringing things up into athens is that we shouldnt be going back and forth all the time pay them three oboloi each four if they squawkthis isnt an allday job or one that takes any skill right menedemos said a drakhmasix oboloia day would keep a man fed and housed though not in fancy style the way prices kept rising nowadays though he wondered how much longer that would stay true but there was a worry for another time now he cupped his hands in front of his mouth and shouted hauling work half a days pay who wants to bring home some silver some of the layabouts wanted a drakhma even for a half days hauling work one of them said you dont know how expensive things are here stranger this is athens after all not some little polis where nothing ever happens were from rhodes menedemos snapped we know what a drakhmas worth by the dog of egyptand when things happen in our polis they happen because we choose them that got home to the toplofty athenian menedemos went on if you wont take four oboloihed quickly discovered he couldnt get anyone to take threewell hail friend will you or wont you i will the fellow said but that doesnt mean youre not a cheapskate menedemos batted his eyes as if he were a youth teasing a suitor you say the sweetest things my dear he murmuredhed had plenty of practice at that role in his younger days cisternarsed effeminate the athenian said under his breath a sneer right out of aristophanes it wasnt quite loud enough to make menedemos notice it and run the man out when they started back up towards athens he did set the fellow to hauling jars of wine on a carrying pole the heaviest work he had weve got quite a parade here menedemos remarked as they started away from the waterfront all we need is some rattling chains and we could be taking slaves to the market im glad were not in that businesstoo risky sostratos said selling a barbarian every now and again is all right i suppose but youre asking for trouble if you do it too often im not arguing menedemos said i never wanted to be a slave trader either oh maybe once in a while if the chance comes up but i wouldnt care to make a habit of it people look down their noses at men who buy and sell other men i do myself i dont quite know whywe couldnt very well live the lives of free hellenes if we didnt have plenty of slaves to labor for usbut people do most of the men who buy and sell slaves arent the sort the better classes care to deal withexcept when they need a new serving woman or workman or what have you sostratos said thats part of it i think and the other part is we all know what can happen to us if an enemy sacks our polis not all slaves are barbarians hellenes say they dont enslave their fellow hellenes but it happens look what alexander did to thebes look what happened to the athenians who went to sicily during the peloponnesian war a middleaged man carrying several lekythoi full of truffleflavored olive oil looked up at that my greatgrandfather went to sicily to fight against syracuse he said he never came home i dont think he was killed in battle so he likely died in the mines his wife was pregnant with my grandfather when he sailed away they almost exposed the baby if they had i wouldnt be here sostratos said disasters happen more and more often these days too generals are better at taking cities by storm than they used to bewe talked about that when we first came up between the long walls remember menedemos and the macedonian marshals are always at war with one another so poleis keep falling menedemos imagined rhodes falling to the forces of ptolemaios or antigonosmost likely the latter since his home polis got on well with the lord of egypt would slave dealers swarm to the city to batten on the disaster of course they would they always did imagining misfortune befalling his polis was as much as he could do he couldnt envision himself enslaved no he thought you didnt have any trouble those couple of times when pirates attacked the aphrodite you knew you were fighting for your life and for your freedom then once they got into athens again they couldnt move so fast that was only partly because the winding streets were full of athenians intent on their own business though they were but the real problem was the swarm of boys who had as much fun with the procession of men carrying trade goods as their parents had had with the dionysiac procession not long before in fact the boyssome in chitons others naked despite the chilly rainy weatherhad even more fun for they could dart out and disrupt this parade here you little wretch stop that menedemos hand smacked against the wet bare backside of a boy of perhaps eight whod almost tripped up two men carrying jars of expensive byblian because the backsideand the handwere wet the swat sounded amazingly loud the boy jumped and yelled and cursed menedemos with a fluency some of the aphrodites sailors couldnt have matched his own hand clapped to the afflicted part he scurried away agile as a lizard euge sostratos said maybe youll make some of the other scamps think twice by zeus i hope so menedemos said somebody needs to his cousin pointed ahead theres the theateryou can see the seats set into the side of the slope that leads up to the akropolis were getting close to protomakhos good menedemos said when we get there im going to have one of his slaves heat up some water in the kitchen and pour it into a basin then i can wash my feet and warm them up too thats a good idea sostratos said protomakhos had better have two basins if he doesnt menedemos said i go first he never noticed the look sostratos sent him he was used to going first he almost always had and he saw no reason at all why he shouldnt keep right on doing it sostratos and menedemos trudged up the long ramp toward the akropolis the sun shone down out of a bright blue skythe rain had blown out to sea the backs of sostratos calves twinged for the ramp was steep and he had scant occasion to climb slopes aboard ship especially carrying a lekythos of truffleflavored oil menedemos grumbled under his breath he was a far better athlete than sostratoshed almost gone to the olympic games a few years before as a sprinter but this told on him too why couldnt demetrios man have met us someplace where we didnt have to pretend we were mountain goats he muttered its all right sostratos said i would have brought you up here sooner or later so you could get a good look at the buildings and the paintings and the statues theres no other place like this in all the civilized world not even corinths akropolis comes close and besides were almost there by now and the way down will be easy ah thats true menedemos brightened the propylaia the gateway into the akropolis loomed in front of them half a dozen simple doric columns supported the entranceway the space between the two middle ones was wider than the other gaps people coming in and going out passed through that space to the right of the gateway stood the temple of athena of victory to the left the pinakotheke a dining hall with seventeen couches and some of the grandest paintings in athens they have a portrait of alkibiades in there sostratos said lots of other paintings too didnt alkibiades spend most of his time getting athens into trouble menedemos asked yes and the rest getting her out again sostratos replied past the propylaia stood a stone pillar with a phallos and a bearded face a herm like the ones at crossroads or in front of many houses this one was bigger than most but otherwise ordinary menedemos paid it no special notice sostratos hadnt thought his cousin would do you know who carved that herm he asked slyly menedemos looked it over no should i he said whoever he was he wasnt anything special for ive seen plenty of better work he wasnt anything special as a stonecarver no sostratos admitted but he was in other ways sokrates made that oh menedemos gave it a second look then shrugged well i can see why he never got rich scoffer come on were supposed to meet demetrios man by the parthenon they hurried along side by side sostratos had a horror of being late and offending demetrios servitor but he stubbed his toe on a stone stumbled and almost dropped the lekythos menedemos caught him by the elbow steady my dear you dont want to have to bring the fellow back here and say lick this patch of ground if you want the true flavor no point to being like euripides is there euripides what are you going on about now sostratos knew he sounded cross he hated being clumsy especially in front of his graceful cousin dont you know aristophanes frogs menedemos chuckled when dionysos goes down to the house of hades to bring back a good tragedian aiskhylos and euripides square off and aiskhylos sinks euripides like a round ship full of dear protomakhos marble for he shows you can fit he lost his little bottle of oil into the metre of any of euripides prologues oh id forgotten that one yes sostratos knew and liked euripides better than aristophanes he mentally started the prologue to iphigeneia in tauris sure enough the phrase fit right in meleagros yes again clever melanippe no doubt about it aristophanes knew his versifying all right sostratos decided to gibe at his cousin not the comic poet i thought you called protomakhos wife dear not the man himself menedemos just grinned and stuck out his tongue as if he were the gorgon on the bottom of a drinking cup heres the parthenon wheres this kleokritos were supposed to meet i cant pull him out from between my gum and my cheek like an obolos you know sostratos said now hell be the one whos late and hell have to do the apologizing to us instead of the other way round dont hold your breath menedemos said the next athenian or even slave in athensi hear saying hes sorry about anything will be the first these people are the rudest ive ever run across even as he spoke his head tipped back so he could get a better look at the frieze above the entrance to the temple he clicked his tongue between his teeth in reluctant approval rude or not though they knew what they were doing when they made this place yes sostratos dipped his head pheidias was in charge again though this was too much work for him to do by himself the reliefs freshly painted might have been carved yesterday not more than a century before flesh tones and robes of yellow and red stood out from the deep blue background horses seemed about to bound forward so did centaurs pointing to them menedemos said i used to think they were creatures out of myth so did i sostratos said now that ive seen a gryphons skull im not so sure as i used to be a bentbacked whitebearded man leaning on a stick came out of the parthenon and made his slow painful way past the rhodians menedemos said can we go inside youve talked about the statue of athena ever since we left rhodes why not we shouldnt stay long in case kleokritos comes but the image was made to be admired when they went inside and left the sunlight behind their vision needed a little while to adjust to the dimness a broad central aisle was separated from a narrow outer one at the sides and back of the sanctuary by columns set on two levels that interior colonnade led the eye to the great cult statue at the far end of the shrine sostratos had seen it before even so his breath came short beside him menedemos stopped in his tracks oh he said softly it wasnt really a word just an expression of amazement and awe one small step at a time he approached the statue of athena every so often he would say oh again sostratos didnt think he knew he was doing it the image of the goddess had to be twentyfive cubits tall or even a bit more say seven times as tall as a man everything that would have been flesh on a living woman was of ivory the pieces so cleverly joined that sostratos couldnt tell where one left off and the next started athenas robes her triplecrested helm and her hair were covered in thin sheets of glittering shimmering gold it shimmered all the more because a shallow pool of clear clean water in front of the statue reflected light from outside up onto it the slightest breath of airperhaps even the rhodians footfallsstirred the surface of the water and stirred the reflected light too athena held a winged victory in her right hand next to her might the victory seemed tiny sostratos had to remind himself it was several digits taller than he the goddess left hand rested on and supported a great shield somewhere on the shield were the portraits of perikles and pheidias that had landed the sculptor in so much trouble sostratos thought he might find perikles if he searched other images had given him a notion of what the great leader of athens looked like pheidias he tossed his head was a man truly immortal if no one recognized him between the shield and athenas left leg a great serpent coiled and reared the scales of its back were picked out in gold those of its belly in ivory sostratos and menedemos stood at the far edge of the reflecting pool staring up and up and up at the statue after a long long silence menedemos said well my dear you were right and im not ashamed to admit it we havent got anything like this at home im glad ive seen it if i hadnt well what point to coming to athens if i hadnt the core of the statue is of wood sostratos said all told a couple of hundred minai of gold cover itand the ivory of course it his cousin held up a hand never mind the details i dont want to know i see what it is and thats enough really sostratos said i think knowing how its put together makes it more marvelous not less you would menedemos said they might have squabbled then but someone called to them from the direction of the entrance are you fellows the rhodians im supposed to meet sostratos and menedemos both turned a man stood silhouetted in the bright doorway kleokritos sostratos asked thats me he answered sure enough he didnt say he was sorry for being late sostratos and menedemos walked away from the statue to greet him they both kept looking back over their shoulders at it kleokritos laughed under his breath he was about thirtyfive his cleanshaven face helped him seem younger he spoke a pure attic greek and looked like a hellene even so sostratos wondered whether he was freeman or slave few free hellenes would have subordinated themselves to another man as he had to demetrios of phaleron not my worry gods be praised sostratos thought after the introductions and small talk kleokritos went on so you fellows have something special to sell do you i should say so sostratos held up his little bottle of oiland made very sure he didnt lose it olive oil flavored with lesbian truffles is that so kleokritos had sharp foxy features he might have suddenly spied a duck swimming near the edge of a pond yes the boss might like something like that you realize youll have to give me a taste id look like a proper fool buying something like that without making sure it is what you say it is certainly o best one sostratos pulled the stopper from the jar he hid the nervousness he felt hed shaved the truffles hed got from onetor fine as he could to make them give up the most flavor but he hadnt tasted the oil since you should have you fool he wished it had had longer to sit if it were little more than ordinary olive oil to the tongue kleokritos plunged a forefinger into the jar then stuck the digit in his mouth when he assumed the expression of a fox that had just dragged a duck out of a pond sostratos knew the oil was all it should be well well kleokritos said and then again well well you see menedemos said yes i do kleokritos dipped his head may i have another taste sostratos held out the lekythos to him he smacked his lips thats quite something isnt it i dont suppose your price will be cheap either truffles cost several times their weight in silver sostratos pointed out oh yes i know demetrios has bought them now and again kleokritos licked his finger clean tidy as an egyptian cat he sighed suppose you tell me what you have in mind lets see how loud i scream a mina a jar sostratos never would have had the nerve to ask such an outrageous price if he hadnt seen demetrios production of aiskhylos plays just being able to present a trilogy and a satyr play bespoke extraordinary wealth putting them on so sumptuously bespoke not only wealth but a certain willingness to spend it freely a pound of silver you say kleokritos took sostratos and menedemos by the elbow come gentlemen he led them out of the parthenon into the sunshine once more then he screamed loud enough to make a couple of passersby whip their heads around in alarm there he said i didnt want to profane the shrine with that youre robbers not rhodians sorry you think so menedemos replied im sure kassandros top officers wouldntmacedonians are made of money near enough we wanted to give demetrios the first chance at our oil but he shrugged regretfully kleokritos flinched sostratos smiled to himself so there was friction between demetrios of phaleron and the macedonians for whom he ruled athens that didnt surprise sostratos he probably could have sold the news to antigonos or lysimakhos on the other hand maybe not who was to say they didnt already know best ones surely you see your price is beyond the moderate beyond what is reasonable kleokritos not only sounded like an athenian he sounded like one whod studied at the academy or the lykeion as smoothly as if they were performing in a play at the theater sostratos and menedemos tossed their heads together im sorry most noble one but that isnt how things look to us sostratos replied when you think about what we paid for the ingredients and the risks we took bringing them to athens oh come now kleokritos said this polis is safe and strong under the leadership of demetrios and the protection of kassandros so thats the formula they use is it when i write my history ill have to remember it sostratos thought aloud he said i have no quarrel no public quarrelwith what you say about the polis but sailing on the aegean is a risk and no small one my cousin and i were attacked by pirates less than two years ago between andros and euboia we were lucky enough to fight them off but they stole some of our most valuable cargo menedemos stirred at that it might not have been strictly true of the gryphons skull not in monetary terms sostratos didnt care who could set a true price on knowledge kleokritos sighed my principal will want this lovely oil i have no doubt of that but he does not care to be held for ransom ill give you sixty drakhmai the lekythos what do you say we say its time to talk to kassandros officers menedemos replied and sostratos dipped his head with a nasty smile menedemos added perhaps theyll invite demetrios to supper and let him have a taste you are a nasty wicked wretch kleokritos said menedemos bowed as at a compliment demetrios of phalerons man muttered under his breath at last he said exactly how many lekythoi of truffleflavored oil have you got menedemos looked to sostratos sostratos had known his cousin would seventyone he said as usual he had the number on the tip of his tongue after some muttering and counting on his fingers kleokritos said ill give you a talent for the lot of them sixty minai of silver eh you are talking of athenian weight sostratos asked and kleokritos impatiently dipped his head now sostratos murmured as he flicked beads on a mental countingboard in a low voice he told menedemos eightyfour drakhmai three oboloi the lekythos more or less what do you think it should do menedemos answered also softly unless you think we can squeeze himor maybe the macedoniansfor more no lets make the deal it gives us a better chance to work on selling other things to other people sostratos waited to see if menedemos would argue when menedemos didnt he turned to kleokritos we accept good thats settled then kleokritos said sostratos thought so too that talentless what the new ingredients had costwould pay the crew for three months no longer than that he realized he paid the sailors in rhodian coinage which was lighter than what the athenians minted kleokritos asked do you have all the oil at protomakhos house no not all sostratos answered we didnt know we would sell it all to the same man we can bring the rest up from peiraieus tomorrow and you can pick it up tomorrow afternoon or the next day does that seem good to you yes i expect i will come day after tomorrow kleokritos replied menedemos said at protomakhos house we also have wine from lesbos and wine from faroff byblos the lesbian i expect you will know of the byblian i will say only this its bouquet is a match for ariousians ask among people you know if you dont believe me theyll tell you i speak the truth they might also tell him the wines flavor didnt match its aroma but menedemos hadnt said anything about that kleokritos said i will ask and of course i will ask my principal if he wants to add to his cellars if he declinesdemetrios of phalerons man shrugged then i wish you good fortune selling your wine to someone else he let out a dry chuckle i doubt you will have too much trouble disposing of it good wine generally does find a home sostratos agreed kleokritos chuckled in any town with a macedonian garrison good wineor even bad winehas to work hard not to find a home he started back toward the ramp that led down into the main part of athens over his shoulder he added ill see you day after tomorrow best ones hail hail sostratos and menedemos said together once kleokritos was out of earshot menedemos went on hell buy wine too i dont know about day after tomorrow but he will he sounded confident as could be yes i think so sostratos replied hes plainly eager for fancy food and drinkhe may want some truffles too if his cook can do a kandaulos like myrsos think how fine it would be with truffles flavoring the broth makes my mouth water menedemos said part of me hopes we dont sell them all if we bring some home to sikon and your cook we can enjoy them ourselves sostratos thought about teasing him over putting personal pleasure before profit he couldnt not in good conscience not when he felt the same way himself he said i wish i could see demetrios having a use for beeswax are you worrying about that already menedemos asked a little sheepishly sostratos dipped his head his cousin made a face at him dont be foolish you havent even started talking to sculptors yet theres bound to be some vain athenian or swaggering macedonian who thinks this polis cant live without a bronze statue of him and thats what beeswax is for i know but i cant help fretting sostratos said menedemos laughed really my dear i never would have guessed youre probably fussing about the balm from engedi too even though the next physician you talk to will be your first with such dignity as he could muster sostratos replied i dont have to admit that and i dont intend to either you just did i think menedemos said and laughed harder than ever he went on you havent seen any scribes either but id bet youre worrying about our papyrus and ink no that not sostratos said i can always sell papyrus in athens this polis uses more of it than any other three in hellas and that includes rhodes and alexandria i am a little worried about the price ill have to charge because himilkon gouged meoutsmarted me really but gouged me too but i will be able to sell it and the ink will naturally go with it they strolled out through the propylaia and started down the ramp kleokritos was already near the bottom he didnt need to slow down to sightsee he could come up here whenever he liked menedemos looked back toward the parthenon if anyone were ever to sack this place bite your tongue sostratos exclaimed even the macedonians think pheidias image of athenas worth more as art than it would be as booty and theyre the greediest men in the world if they leave it alone anyone wouldi hope well so do i menedemos said whats that phrase your pet historian useda possession for all time it suits the statue too sostratos tried to imagine the austere thoukydides as hisor anyone elsespet he felt himself failing wanting to get in a jab of his own he said im sure you aim to be the one who sells our rose perfume to all the hetairai of athens somebodys got to do it menedemos said cheerfully they pay well make sure you get it in silver not in something i cant enter in the ledgers sostratos said his cousin leered enter indeed sostratos winced hed left himself open for that and menedemos had wasted no time taking advantage of it i know the difference between owls and piggies best one menedemos added if i get any of the other itll be along with the drakhmai not instead of them all right knowing you though i did think i ought to make sure sostratos said maybe he wasnt being fair menedemos did separate business and pleasure most of the time shading his eyes sostratos peered southwest you can see all the way down to the sea from here if my eyes were good enough i could pick out the aphrodite among all the other ships tied up in peiraieus a hawk couldnt do that not from here menedemos said and even if it could it wouldnt care sostratos agreed but we ought to be able to make our sight keener how i dont know i wish i did cupping a hand behind your ear makes you hear better cupping both hands in front of your mouth makes your voice louder we ought to be able to do something to help our eyes we ought to be able to do all sorts of things we cant menedemos said id like to be able to get it up ten times a day for instance if you could youd never do anything else sostratos said whod want to do anything else if he could do that instead you are a shameless wretch sostratos said menedemos grinned and dipped his head after an exasperated snort and how many exasperated snorts had menedemos forced from him sostratos went on the arts let us do things we could never do without them we can span rivers with bridges we can sail the seas we can make temples like the parthenon why shouldnt we be able to stretch our sight because we dont know how menedemos answered sostratos had built a beautiful flawlessly logical argumentbut one that broke to pieces like a cheap pot when menedemos dropped a hard sharpcornered fact on it we ought to be able to fly too birds can bats can and butterflies why not people ikaros and daidalos did if you believe the myth sostratos said menedemos was more inclined than sostratos to take myths and legends seriously but not this one its only a wish not a truth and you know it as well as i do he said every so often some poor fool who thinks its the truth makes himself a set of wings and goes up onto a roof or a cliff and jumps off if hes lucky he breaks his ankle if hes not he breaks his stupid neck or smashes himself flat as a flapjack am i right or am i wrong oh youre right best one no doubt about itfor now sostratos fell back on the only argument he could but we may learn things we dont know now the alphabet lets memory reach further than it could before iron was plainly a new thing in homers dayhe calls it difficultly wrought because its both hard and cheap we can do things with it we couldnt with bronze alone maybe some artisan will figure out how to stretch our sight or make us fly too well maybe menedemos said im not going to hold my breath though he made a little hop from the end of the ramp onto the dirt of the southeastern corner of the agora i am going to head back to protomakhos youre hoping hes not there sostratos said in dismay his cousin tossed his head not in broad daylight the slaves would notice and theyd likely blab tonight though well have to see what he does he hurried away as sostratos followed he wondered whether clouting menedemos over the head with the lekythos he carried would knock any sense into him off the evidence he had probably not too bad he thought how i wish it would menedemos bowed to kleokritos here is the oil most noble one he said pointing to the lekythoi lined up in protomakhos courtyard ten rows of seven jars plus one may demetrios and his friends enjoy them thats a finelooking phalanx demetrios of phalerons man said with a smile he gestured to a couple of the men who followed him most of them looked to be laborers hired for the day to carry the jars of oil these two were different both were better dressed and brighter looking than their comrades they carried nicesized leather sacks more of demetrios retainers menedemos judged kleokritos went on they have your silver for you good menedemos said as soon as i make sure its the proper amount you are more than welcome to the oil sostratos added kleokritos smile vanished youre not going to count out six thousand drakhmai he exclaimed wed be here all day you dont think id cheat you of course not o best one sostratos said suavely menedemos knew his cousin was lying kleokritos likely knew it too but sostratos gave him no excuse to protest continuing you have every right to count the jars of oiland to open and taste them too if that seems good to you and i dont need to count so many coins protomakhos may i borrow your scale certainly the rhodian proxenos replied at his order a slave brought out a huge balance another grunting carried a stone weight one talent protomakhos said being in the stonecutting business i find such large weights useful this one balances perfectly against the standard talent the officials in charge of weights and measures keep in the tholos if you want to go over there im sure the metronomoi will show you that never mind kleokritos said sourly to the obvious relief of the slave carrying the weight set it on one pan of the balance and ill set the silver on the other the slave put the weight on the pan the men with kleokritos who had the money set their sacks on the other pan the scales did not balance kleokritos turned a dull red he took a stout leather wallet from his felt and started feeding coins from it onto the scale a drakhma a tetradrakhmfour times as heavya didrakhm another fat tetradrakhm altogether he had to load on more than fifty drakhmai before the weight finally rose there he snarled are you happy now certainly most noble one menedemos said i know it must have been an accident this time he was the one doing the lying he didnt want to embarrass demetrios of phalerons man any more than he had to what a coincidence though he thought that kleokritos happened to have enough money with him to make good the error in case we challenged him without the scales he and sostratos never would have noticed the payments being light by less than one part in a hundred but half a mina of silver was a tidy sum of money by itself still we do want things to be right dont we right kleokritos said that wasnt agreement it was anger coming out in one word demetrios man said not a word about wine lesbian or byblian he barked at the athenians hed hired they hurried to pick up the lekythoi and left protomakhos courtyard not so much to escape it as to get away from kleokritos you boys have more nerve than i would protomakhos said once kleokritos was gone too i wouldnt risk offending demetrios of phaleron i like that sostratos voice cracked in indignation his man tries to cheat us but were the ones who have to worry about offending him wheres the justice in that hes not talking about justice my dear hes talking about power menedemos said in a polis like this they come from different places you ought to know thatyou lived here for a while its good to see one of you understands anyhow the proxenos said walk soft if you get in trouble with demetrios i wont be able to do much for you well be careful menedemos said thinking he doesnt know about xenokleia or he wouldnt want to warn me he knew which upstairs window looked out from her bedroom he carefully didnt glance that way no point making protomakhos suspicious when he wasnt already sostratos gaze held irony menedemos pretended not to notice youll probably get away with this without anyone saying a word protomakhos said because were right sostratos asked noi already told you thats got nothing to do with it protomakhos answered but youre rhodians ptolemaios doesnt want to offend rhodes kassandros doesnt want to offend ptolemaios and demetrios of phaleron wont do anything to offend kassandros if you came from samos or mytilene or some other place antigonos holds youd be wise to get out of athens before kleokritos and demetrios could take their revenge for they would power again sostratos murmured protomakhos dipped his head menedemos eyed sostratos with a mix of respect and pity his cousin could learn and learn quickly but he had to reason everything out one step at a time he seldom used his heart or his belly to gauge how things worked it had to be his mind or nothing tomorrow menedemos said tomorrow ill take a couple of jars of perfume into the agora and ill start shouting about how wonderful it is some of the better hetairai are bound to have slaves out shopping for them once a slave girl gets a sniff shell take word back to her mistress then ill see if i can do business with her the rhodian proxenos laughed what sort of business do you aim to do he gestured lewdly dont you start if you please menedemos said sostratos was giving me a hard time about taking it out in trade too i dont want you giving the hetairai a hard time sostratos said at least not in exchange for the firms merchandise if youre going to be firm do it on your own time and pay for it protomakhos winced though he was the one whod started the puns i wont have to pay for it if i do it with a wife and not a hetaira menedemos thought but with xenokleia the wife in question that was much better left unspoken turning to sostratos protomakhos asked and what will you be doing while your cousins out having a good time ive still got truffles to sell and ive got the byblian and lesbian sostratos answered i think the first thing to do is try to sell the wine to some of kassandros macedonian officers everybody knows how thirsty macedonians are and everybody knows how much money theyve got too the proxenos chuckled thats a good combination all right i wish you both good fortune and youhe pointed to menedemos can take that any way you please i know i can sell perfume menedemos said whether i get to do any buying he shrugged ill find out you two wont need the scales any more will you as protomakhos had a moment before he used the dual number in referring to menedemos and sostratos that grammatical form was common in homers greek much less so in modern attic by using it protomakhos implied the rhodians were a natural pair menedemos eyes flicked toward sostratos sostratos was looking his way too both of them evidently were trying to decide whether they wanted to be part of such a pair distracted menedemos had to make himself remember the question no o best one we do thank you for the use of them though i ought to charge you the extra you got from kleokritos as commission protomakhos smiled to show he didnt mean that seriously take it menedemos said at once youve shown us all sorts of kindnesses the least we can do is pay you back a little sostratos looked wounded but set his face to rights so quickly that menedemos didnt think the proxenos noticed menedemos knew his cousin had less simple generosity than he did himself one more thing that made sostratos a good toikharkhos protomakhos meanwhile tossed his head no no thats kind of you but i couldnt possibly im here to help you rhodians not to take your money menedemos didnt insist that might have offended the proxenos he resolved to do something nice for protomakhos before leaving athens after all his wife has done something nice for me now menedemos let his eyes slide across the windows of the upper story he didnt linger at the one belonging to xenokleias bedchamber he knew better than to do anything so foolish he hoped xenokleia knew how to keep her mouth shutand how to keep her demeanor from giving anything away too life would get more difficult if she didnt he tried not to contemplate how much more difficult it might get sostratos was also better than he at brooding over things that might go wrong no disaster had struck by the time the two rhodians set out the next morning have fun in the agora sostratos told menedemos people would talk if i did it there menedemos replied sostratos spluttered and choked spraying watered wine protomakhos laughed out loud when sostratos could speak again he said youre trying to sell to hetairai and i to macedonian officers i may make more money but youll have more fun you never can tell protomakhos said some of those macedonians are as widearsed as any athenian effeminate im sorry best one sostratos said no matter what a macedonian officers idea of fun may be no macedonian officer is mine menedemos made his way to the agora through morning twilight he didnt have a stall of course or even a tray slung around his neck to hold his goods he did have lots of little jars of perfume in a leather sack a brash manner and a loud voiceand he got there early enough to stake out a spot by the street of the panathenaia where lots of people would surely pass by the sun touched the buildings of the akropolisand to the north the top of the hill called lykabettos that one was sharp and conical and useless as a fortress or for anything else menedemos could see for that matter the akropolis itself couldnt come close to sheltering all the people of athens not any more in the old days he supposed it might have he reached into the sack and pulled out a jar fine perfume from rhodes he called selling this his doric drawl wouldnt hurt him sweetsmelling rose perfume from rhodes the island of roses a woman with the rough hands and bent back of a laundress said can i have a sniff he yanked out the stopper sniff she did and then smiled she asked how much do you want for a tiny little jar like that she knew how to hagglethe first thing she did was disparage menedemos goods he told her her jaw dropped after that moment of astonishment she got angry youre having me on she said and shook a fist in his face he wouldnt have wanted to brawl with her she looked formidable i dont make that much money in a month im sorry my dear but that is the price menedemos said then youre a polluted thief she exclaimed he tossed his head he didnt want her saying that no indeed he told her for this jarhe balanced it on the palm of his hand holds a lot of labor the roses have to be grown and picked the sweetsmelling petals plucked the lot of them boiled down into an essence and mixed with fine oili dont know all the details for the perfumers keep them secret but i do know that everyone who does that labor has to be paid too and thats what you see in the price i charge she didnt call him a liar she did say its a cursed shame when honest folk cant afford something nice ill tell you that whos going to buy at your price those bastards who run the polis and suck our blood thats who them and brothelkeepers and fancy whores furies take the lot of em and you too she flounced off without giving menedemos a chance to answer he didnt know what he could have said to her the people shed named were the ones who could afford what he was selling hetairai werent exactly whoresthey entertained the men they chose not the men who chose thembut their entertainment involved or could involve going to bed with their clients so they werent exactly not whores either oh rich merchants could buy perfume too on the one hand though how likely were they to be honest and on the other they were more likely to buy it for hetairai than for their wives wives would always be there a man had to work to make a hetaira want to stay with him he had to work and he had to spend silver perfume menedemos called again as the sun lit up the market square more and more people came in fine perfume from rhodes the island of roses sweet perfume no sweet woman should be without another woman whod plainly lived a hardscrabble lifeand after all what other sort would be out shopping for herselfasked him what he wanted for his wares he gave her the same answer hed given the laundress she squalled louder than if hed hiked up his chiton and waggled his private parts in her face there were men who did that sort of thing to amuse themselves menedemos thought it was in poor taste but what could you do yet another woman came up to him this one dressed in a long tunic of fine white wool hail she said may i smell your perfume her greek held a faint accent of course he answered politely she looked and sounded like the slave of someone prosperousexactly the sort of person he was looking for he pulled out the stopper and held the jar out to her she leaned forward her nostrils flared as she inhaled oh yes she said softly that is very fine what price do you ask when he told her she didnt flinch let me speak to my owner she may well buy stay here i will return who is your owner sweetheart menedemos asked her name is potheine rhodian the slave woman said if you came from athens you would know the rich and famous men who have had her as their companion companion was what hetaira had first meant the masculine form of the word hetairos still did mean that and nothing more in the feminine there were companions and then there were companions menedemos asked and who are you showing he cared about a slave might make her urge his case more strongly to her mistress me she seemed surprised at the question they call me threitta here that was attic for thracian she wasnt redheaded like the slave in sostratos household but with light brown hair and hazel eyes she was fairer than most hellenes well threitta i hope you hurry to your famous mistress for me menedemos said to make sure she did hurry he gave her three oboloi he asked for nothing in returnnot a kiss not a promise that the girl would urge the hetaira to buy the perfume hed found a free gift usually worked better than one where the dangling strings were obvious the slave girl took the little silver coins and hesitated waiting for him to tell her what he wanted when he said nothing more she stuck the coins in her mouth you have an interesting way of doing business she remarked thank you menedemos said though he wasnt sure that was praise threitta noddedwhich would have proved she wasnt a hellene born had he had any doubtsand vanished into the stillswelling crowd in the agora menedemos tried to keep track of her but it was like trying to keep track of one raindrop in a storm he blinked and then he couldnt find her any more he went back to calling about the perfume and its virtues threitta might not beprobably wasntthe only hetairas slave in the market square this morning menedemos didnt much care to whom he sold perfume he cared only about selling it and getting his price by the time threitta came back he had sold a jar to a plump man who insisted so loudly that he was buying it for his wife he convinced menedemos he was lying through his teeth some people never did figure out that the best way to lie was not to trumpet the untruth all over the landscape but to pass it off lightly or indeed to keep quiet about it why should i care who gets the perfume menedemos thought its not my business or it wouldnt have been unless that fool made it so when threitta returned to the agora menedemos didnt notice her till shed got within a few paces of him he had an excuse her companion drew all eyes his way the blond longmustached kelt was taller than sostratos handsome wideshouldered narrowwaisted he looked like a pankratiast or perhaps more like a demigod his eyes were the color of egyptian emeralds he stared through menedemos as if the rhodian didnt exist hail menedemos said to threitta whos your friend bolgios is potheines bodyservant she answered ill bet he is thats quite a body menedemos didnt say it though it quivered on the tip of his tongue i see was all that came out threitta went on he has the money for you my mistress wants five jars of perfume sure enough bolgios thrust out a fat leather sack that clinked when menedemos took it the kelts hand the back of it thatched with little hairs like wires of finest gold was as enormous as every other part of him it could have swallowed menedemos as a fathers swallows that of his toddler son when they go walking together no one would have dreamt of robbing such a brute let me count the silver menedemos said the bag felt as if it held about the right amount of silverjust under two minai bolgios eyes flashed green fire are you after calling my mistress a cheat now he asked a musically accented snarl menedemos quailed before few men if he said yes to that though he knew the barbarian would tear him limb from limb by no means he answered as politely as he could but anyone can make a mistake there might even be an owl or two too many in here i dont want anything that shouldnt be mine but i do want everything that should bolgios stood there considering at last grudgingly he nodded yes hed wanted to wreak a little havoc now he had to accept the idea that he wouldnt get the chance you speak as a proper man might he allowed count the silver menedemos did making piles of coins ten drakhmai to the pile it is as it should be he said at last and hoped he didnt sound too relieved he gets nothing above what he should bolgios asked threitta maybe the kelt didnt know how much potheine was supposed to pay maybe he just had trouble counting no the thracian woman shook her head alls well bolgios grunted that all was well plainly disappointed him here is the perfume menedemos handed threitta the little jars i hope your mistress has pleasure from them he smiled his most charming smile if i could i would like to meet her and thank her for her business she is not looking for clients now threitta said she has all she needs and she had bolgios when menedemos made his request the barbarian stiffened menedemos could almost see the hair rise at the back of his neck as it might have on a dog just before the beast bit was bolgios sleeping with potheine menedemos couldnt tell was he jealous of any other man who did of that the rhodian had not the slightest doubt he didnt try to sweeten threitta and get her to change her mind as he might have done if shed come back to the agora by herself she and the enormous kelt went off side by side thanks to bolgios height and bright blond head menedemos had no trouble tracking them as they wandered through the market square again he wasnt the only one following bolgios with his eyes an elephant parading through the agora might have drawn more attention then again it might not gathering himself menedemos took up his call again fine perfume from rhodes the island of roses perfume fit for athens finest hetairai he didnt know potheine was one of those but anybody whod been able to buy bolgios couldnt be poor he sold several more jars before the day was done maybe that extra line hed tacked on to the pitch helped sostratos had been to a fair number of symposia in his day nothing though prepared him for this one down in mounykhia hed heard things about the kinds of parties macedonians threw now he was seeing them at first hand if he wanted to sell wine to the men from the north who held athens for kassandros hed discovered he also had to drink wine with them if once he got back to protomakhos house he remembered a quarter of what was going on around him he would have stories to dine out on for years to come if i get back to protomakhos house he thought muzzily if i dont pass out here or maybe fall over dead here not least because macedonians were so powerful everyone accepted that they really were hellenes even if a proper hellene could make out only about one word in three of their dialect like the barbarians demosthenes had accused them of being a generation before though they drank their wine neat and so perforce did the people who drank with them the symposion wasnt in a proper andron but in a big chamber in one of the macedonians barracks halls inside their fortress at mounykhia sostratos couchmate was a tetrarkhosa man who commanded a quarter of a phalanx an important officernamed alketas a blackbearded rowdy of about forty he was the fellow whod been interested in buying byblian he gave sostratos a shot in the ribs with his elbow not a bad bash eh he bawledhe could speak perfectly good greek when he felt like it and when he wasnt too drunk to remember how well sostratos said and said no more he couldnt even tell alketas hed never seen anything like it because this wasnt the first macedonian carouse in the occupiers seaside fortress hed had to attend alketas looked at his cup but my dear youre not drinking he exclaimed he shouted for a slave how the poor slave heard anything through the din filling the room baffled sostratos but he did alketas pointed to the enormous mixing bowl in the middle of the floor why the macedonians bothered with a mixing bowl was also beyond sostratos since they didnt mix their wine with water the slave plied the dipper and filled the rhodians cup then brought it back to him even the bouquet of neat wine seemed plenty to make his head spin and under alketas watchful gaze he had to take a long pull at the cup the neat wine not anything hed sold the tetrarkhos was almost thick enough to chew and sweet as honey he could feel it snarl when it crashed down into his stomach he didnt want to get too drunk but around macedonians there often seemed little choice two couches over an officer between sostratos age and alketas had already drunk himself unconscious he sprawled on his back his arm like a corpses dangling down to the floor his cup sat forgotten on his belly the fellow who shared the couch with him grabbed for it but missedhe only knocked it over wine red as blood soaked the blinddrunk mans tunic as if he were dreadfully wounded he never stirred hell feel wounded come morning sostratos thought off in a corner a frightenedlooking flutegirl played she seemed to hope no one noticed her considering some of the things that might happen if the macedonians did sostratos couldnt blame her a scarred veteran whod surely marched with alexander his skin burnt almost ethiop black by years of sun was drumming with bare palms on the table by his couch his pounding rhythm had nothing to do with the love song the flutegirl was playing another percussive rhythm came from a few couches past the veteran two younger macedonians were sitting facetoface taking turns slapping each other whap ones head would jerk to the side as he was struck then he would slap the other fellow whap every once in a while they would pause for a bit and laughing uproariously drink more wine then they would start again whap whap do you macedonians often play that game sostratos asked alketas what the officer said sostratos pointed at the two men matching slap for slap alketas eyed them for a little while then said no ive never seen that before he watched a little longer looks like fun eh want to try it no by the dog sostratos exclaimed he was willing to do a lot of things to sell wine getting his brains rattled again and again though went too far suit yourself alketas said with a broadshouldered shrug i was just trying to liven things up pretty dull symposion so far isnt it thats not the word id use most noble one sostratos replied with neat wine buzzing through his veins he had trouble deciding which word he would use but dull definitely wasnt it a soldier had hiked up another flutegirls tunic and bent her forward onto the couch he stood behind her thrusting hard that sort of thing could happen at a lot of symposia sostratos wasnt shocked though hed never before heard a man shout out a war cry at the moment he spent himself four macedonians began singing a raucous song in their own dialect one by one most of the other men in the room joined them the swarthy veteran gave up his drumming the two men who were slapping each other didnt stop but they did sing between blows the din was indescribableand to sostratos incomprehensible alketas started howling at the top of his lungs he paused only once to nudge sostratos again with his elbow and shout sing how can i the rhodian answered i dont know the words i dont even understand them sing alketas said again and gave himself back to the song it seemed to go on forever from snatches sostratos picked up here and there he gathered it was a battle song that came from a macedonian civil war several generations earlier the irony made him want to laugh but he didnt the civil war the macedonians were fighting now spanned most of the civilized world the one they were singing about had been some tribal brawl as likely as not to have gone unnoticed by the true hellenes to the south of course it wasnt as if those true hellenes hadnt had plenty of faction fights of their own both between cities and within them sostratos sighed and sipped at his wine raising the cup gave him an excuse for not singing faction fights were the curse of hellas all the men all the groups all the poleis were so jealous of their rights and privileges they refused to acknowledge anyone elses he wondered what the answer was and whether there was an answer if so hellenes had never found it four more flutegirls swayed into the room they wore short chitonschitons that would have been short even on menof filmy koan silk the silk was thin enough to let sostratos see theyd singed off the hair between their legs alketas forgot his macedonian war song sostratos thought his eyes would bug out of his head the flutegirls stayed in the open space in the middle of the room where none of the symposiasts could grab them without leaping off his couch a moment later the din from the macedonians redoubled for a troupe of dancing girls followed the musicians and the dancers wore nothing at all their oiled skin gleamed in the light of lamps and torches now were getting somewhere alketas whooped he turned to sostratos things are finally picking up a little eh yes sostratos said politely yes if you like getting blind drunk and rumpling slave girls he added to himself by all the signs the macedonians liked nothing better one of the dancing girls did a series of flips an officer jumped up and caught her in midairnot the least impressive show of strength sostratos had ever seen as if theyd rehearsed it she wrapped her legs around his midsection to the cheers of his comrades he carried her back to his couch they went on from there a couple of other macedonians also grabbed girls for themselves dancing was all very well they seemed to say but other things were more fun that deprived the men who would have been content to watch the dancers for a while of some of their enjoyment but the macedonians wouldnt have been what they were if theyd spent much time worrying about other peoples feelings the two men whod got into the slapping match paid no attention to flutegirls naked dancing girls or anything else whap whap sostratos wondered how long theyd stay at it till one gave up in that case they might be here a long long time whap whap if theyd had any brains when they started they wouldnt by the time they were through come here sweetheart alketas beckoned to one of the dancers she came probably not least because the meaty hairy arm with which hed beckoned had on it a heavy golden armlet he shifted on the couch so his feet came down onto the floor and splayed his legs apart why dont you make me feel good thats what i am here for my master she said and dropped to her knees her head bobbed up and down sostratos wondered what she was thinking had she been born a slave and known no other life or had some misfortune brought this fate upon her she spoke greek like a hellene alketas put his hand on her head setting her rhythm her dark hair spilled out between his ringers he grunted she pulled away gulping and choking a little that was fine the macedonian said here he gave her a fat heavy tetradrakhm an enormous fee for what shed done thank you most noble one she said she had nowhere obvious to store the coin but it disappeared nonetheless alketas pointed to sostratos take care of my friend here too yes sir she dipped her head which probably meant she was a hellene looking at sostratos she asked what would you like what you did for him sostratos answered with dull embarrassment he didnt like performing in public but he also didnt want to take the girl outside into the darkness and have alketas laugh at him he was after all trying to sell the man more wine shift a little sir if you please the girl said sostratos did she knelt in front of him and began for a little while his embarrassment kept him from rising that would have made alketas laugh at him too the macedonians enjoyed sneering at effete hellenes but then the pleasure her mouth brought led him to forget embarrassment and everything else except what she was doing as the tetrarkhos had he pressed her head down on him and groaned when she brought him to the peak afterwards he gave her a didrakhm a compromise between the usual price of such things and his desire not to seem too stingy after the macedonians extravagant generosity again she made the coin vanish even though she was naked sostratos turned to alketas to talk about byblian before he could a brawl broke out this was no gamethe macedonians overturned couches as they pummeled each other one smashed a cup over the others head more men leaped into the fight not to break it up but to join it more crockery smashed howls of pain mingled with howls of glee alketas yelled something in macedonian he turned to sostratos and went back to intelligible greek now were getting somewhere are we sostratos said alketas didnt even bother answering he flung himself into the fray fists and feet flying a cup whizzed past sostratos head and shattered on the frame of the couch behind him he wished he were somewhere anywhere else wishing did as much good as it usually did good day best one menedemos said stepping into protomakhos andron the sun was just coming up the day promised to be warm and clear a roller a jackdawsized bird with a bluegreen head and breast and a chestnut back perched on the roof tiles across the courtyard its croaking call put menedemos in mind of a crows but no crow ever wore such gorgeous feathers and to you the rhodian proxenos replied he pointed to the mixing bowl have some wine a slave will bring you porridge in a moment thanks menedemos dipped out a cup for himself he raised it in salute health to you when he drank he raised an eyebrow this is a strong mix especially for the morning is there a reason protomakhos didnt seem the sort of man to start out the day by getting pieeyed but more than one cup of this wine would do the trick menedemos sipped cautiously as the proxenos had said a slave brought him breakfast i should say there is pride rang in protomakhos voice the pull he took at his cup wasnt cautious in the least im going to be a father congratulations best one thats very good news indeed may it be a son menedemos spoke as naturally as he could part of the good news he saw was that xenokleia must have slept with protomakhos recently enough for him to be sure he was going to be a father menedemos wasnt nearly so sure of that himself but protomakhos opinion was the one that mattered i hope so we had a son years ago but he died before his first birthday protomakhos smile faded so many children do you know youre taking a chance loving them but you really cant help it when they smile at you and then they sicken and he spread his hands after another sip of wine he went on we have our daughter too whos married and gone to her husbands household do you know i think ill rear this child even if it turns out to be a girl too good for you menedemos said not many families raise two daughters i know its seldom done protomakhos replied but with so many years between the two of them i can afford it he started to raise his cup once more then stared down into it a bemused expression on his face he seemed taken by surprise to find it empty even after he filled it though the bemusement remained women are funny he remarked apropos of nothing in particular oh yes menedemos said hed never thought much about the custom of exposing unwanted infants up till now it was just something people did when they needed to to put a baby that might be his out for the elements though he knew a startling amount of relief that protomakhos had said he wouldnt if the proxenos hadnt poured down that first cup of strong wine so early in the day he might not have gone on but he did for a while now my wife and i have done what we could to make sure she wouldnt conceive lately though she decided to try to have another child i was glad enough to go alongmore fun finishing inside than spilling seed on her belly more fun than her prokton too though i dont suppose everyone would go along with me there some men probably wouldnt menedemos said me i agree with you xenokleia hadnt had him take any of those precautions a good thing shed managed to get protomakhos to abandon them without rousing his suspicions a son the rhodian proxenos murmured im very fond of our grandsondont get me wrongbut a son is something else i hope i live to see him out of boyhood he shrugged thats in the hands of the gods though not in mine yes menedemos snapped his fingers do you know what best one your grandson will have an uncle or aunt whos younger than he is protomakhos stared then guffawed youre right by the dog i hadnt thought of that sostratos came into the andron yawning and looking redeyed and bleary hail menedemos said another long night with the macedonians my dear his cousin dipped his headcautiously as if it hurt afraid so this symposion wasnt quite so bad as the one a couple of weeks ago where it turned into a freeforall at the end but it was bad enough a slave poured him a cup of wine i thank you he said but he blinked when he raised the cup to his lips have we got swilling macedonians here today this cant be weaker than one to one and thats too potent for first thing in the morning i have my reasons for a strong mix protomakhos answered and explained what they were oh sostratos blinked again this time in surprise of a different sort to menedemos relief his cousin had the sense not to look at him sostratos went on thats splendid news congratulations for which i thank you the rhodian proxenos raised his cup in salute and on account of which i say drink up menedemos was happy enough to pour down the rest of his wine no matter what sostratos said about him he wasnt a man who usually started out the day drinking hard if he had been he would have worried more about it as things were he knew he could get away with it once in a while and sostratos also drained his cup he said maybe some more wine going down will ease the headache i have from what i drank last night by dionysos you drink more wine with macedonians than you can hope to sell them it feels like that anyhow he held his head in both hands theyre paying our prices menedemos said his cousin gingerlydipped his head menedemos went on and youve sold them some truffles too you cant eat those faster than they buy them i wish i could for theyre better than food has any business being sostratos said but i am glad ive made the sale demetrios of phaleron does seem to be annoyed enough at us not to want to buy any more of what weve got i told you that would happen protomakhos said its not demetrios menedemos said he probably wouldnt know our names if you gave him over to a persian torturer its that polluted kleokritoshes paying us back by not paying us anymore many goodbyes to him sostratos said a man who thinks hes been cheated because we caught him cheating us im just as happy not to deal with a man like that no one has challenged kleokritos in a long time protomakhos said hes not used to it demetrios of phaleron has held athens for kassandros for ten years now weve spoken of thishe hasnt been so harsh as he mightbut he might and no one wants to find out if he would i admire your courage for standing up to his man that didnt even occur to me sostratos said i just wanted things to be right too many cheats running around loose we fall foul of these petty chiselers every trading run it seems they try to gouge us out of a few drakhmai here and a few drakhmai there and then when we catch them at it they seem surprisedno not surprised angrywere making a fuss but if anybody tried to do them out of half an obolos theyd scream bloody murder menedemos rose from his stool and set a hand on his cousins shoulder well my dear we spoiled kleokritos fun and were unloading the things he might have bought on the macedonians id say thats a good revenge good enough sostratos agreed but id be happier if we didnt need to take revenge on him im going back to the storeroom and get myself some more perfume menedemos said then to the agora no drunken macedonians have been buying what i peddle you havent brought back any lewd tales for us protomakhos said not much luck with the hetairai with a shrug menedemos answered well best one theres luck and then again theres luck ive sold a lot of perfume and sold it at good prices but ive dealt with the women through their slaves and i havent lain with any of them who knows though i may yet he hurried off to get the perfume behind him sostratos voice floated out of the andron if menedemos sees a pile of horse turds hes sure hell find a team hitched to a chariot around the next corner just waiting for him to hop on and ride protomakhos laughed menedemos started to turn around and shout at sostratos for talking about him behind his back but then he checked himself what his cousin had said wasnt an insult and was true menedemos always did hope for the best why not some people expected the worst to shield themselves from disappointment as far as menedemos was concerned that wasnt living it was only existing and waiting to die he wanted to go through life aiming higher than that a slave barred protomakhos front door after he left by now he knew the way to the agora well enough not to need to look up at the great frowning bulk of the akropolis to get his bearings turn here turn there dont go down the street with the bakers shop at the corner because its a dead end and youll only have to turn around pick up a rock before you come by the shoemakers place so you can fling it at his polluted hound if the beast runs up snarling again the sun was already shining on the agora by the time menedemos got there hed put on his petasos the widebrimmed hat would help keep helios from cooking his brains inside his skull that wasnt why he grumbled showing up later than he had been doing meant other hucksters had already staked claims to the choicest spots well no help for it he found a place not far from the painted stoa on the north side of the agora fine perfume from rhodes he called holding up a jar sweet rose perfume from rhodes the island of roses even as he made his sales pitch though his eyes kept going to the paintings and other memorials in the shadows under the covered colonnade no one but people who couldnt afford it seemed interested in his perfume about halfway through the morning curiosity got the better of him its like the parthenon he told himself not much point coming to athens if i dont see this most famous of the paintings on wooden panels was the one of the battle of marathon by polygnotos there were the athenians and the boiotians from plataia driving back the persians toward their ships which were manned by bearded longrobed phoenicians other panels showed athenians fighting spartans theseus and more athenians fighting the barebreasted amazons in ancient days and the akhaioi just after the fall of troy with the trojan women kassandra among them captive before aias shields preserved against time and verdigris by a coat of pitch hung between the panelsthey came from the spartan citizens whod surrendered on the island of sphakteria when the peloponnesian war had been going well for athens after seeing what there was to see menedemos bought a little fried octopus and a cup of wine then he went back to crying the virtues of rhodian perfume he didnt sell any all that day somehow though he cared much less than hed thought he would seeing the painted stoa had given him a profit of a different sort sostratos winced when he left athens by the peoples gate and headed east toward the base of mount lykabettos up till now hed never gone back to visit a lover after leaving returning to the lykeion though felt exactly like that hed spent the happiest days of his young life there then hed had to go now he was coming back yes but he wasnt the same person as he had been when he reckoned the place the center of his life herakleitos had had it right you couldnt step into the same river twice the river wasnt the same the second time and you werent the same either as they had for at least three centuries youths learning the use of arms and armor paraded on the flat land of the lykeion between the olive groves some of them probably were young men whod received their panoplies in the theater at the dionysia now recently past a drillmasters voice pursued the epheboi left left no you clumsy fool thats not your left left sostratos smiled those same irate shouts had been part of the background while he studied here after a moment his smile faded would the athenian phalanx ever amount to anything again or would athens be nothing more than a counter kassandros and the rest of the macedonians shoved back and forth across their gaming board things werent as they had been a hundred years before when this polis came close to becoming the lord of hellasand when macedonia was full of backwoods bumpkins who battled among themselves and were hardly ever seen in hellas proper macedonia of course remained full of backwoods bumpkins who battled among themselves now though they did it over almost the entire reach of the civilized world from hellas east all the way to persia and beyond sostratos dimly remembered having a similar thought at one symposion or another was this an improvement he formed that question intending the answer to be certainly not but if the macedonians werent battling among themselves wouldnt hellenes be doing it in their place from everything the rhodian knew of his peoples history that seemed altogether too likely he got a glimpse of other men walking about too those under and among the olive trees rather than out in the open they werent marching under the direction of a drillmaster either obedient to a single will they all traveled together all searchingas free men shouldfor knowledge and truth peripatetics sostratos murmured that was what aristoteles had called the men who studied with and under him for they walked aboutperipateo was the verb in greekdiscussing one philosophical topic or another the name lived on under theophrastos aristoteles nephew and successor seeing the scholars sostratos suddenly wanted to turn and run back towards athens studied here he thought i studied here and now im coming back as a tradesman the leather sack of papyrus he carried in his left hand all at once seemed to weigh fifty talents theyll recognize me theyll remember wont they think of me as respectable women think of a widow whos had to turn to whoring to keep food on the table for herself and her children he made himself keep walking toward the graybranched paleleaved olive trees some of the athenian epheboi would have a harder time going into battle than he did going forward now the man doing most of the talking there under the trees was a dapper fellow in a fine chiton with a himation elegantly draped over one shoulder his hair and beard were white his back still straight and his eyes still sharp and keen even though he had to be well up into his sixties when sostratos saw him he almost fled again oh by the gods thats theophrastos himself too soon too soon i wasnt ready yet theophrastos was saying and speaking of the ridiculous there is the phrase a big fish is a poor nobody this is said to have first been used by the kitharist stratonikos against propis of rhodes who sang to the kithara propis was a large man but one without much talent it packs a lot of insult into a few words for it says that propis was large was no good was a nobody and had no more voice than a fish a couple of the younger men with theophrastos scribbled notes on waxed tablets stratonikos insults were famous wherever greek was spoken not so long before in cyprian salamis one of them had cost him his life we should however commonly distrust what people commonly say theophrastos went on i know for a fact that while the gibe did indeed originate with stratonikos it was in fact aimed at simykas the actor and taken from the old saw no rotten fish is large now one moment my friends if you please he turned to sostratos who was coming up through the olive trees yes my good fellow you wish i cant run away theyll all laugh at me if i do only that thought nerved sostratos to keep walking forward hail theophrastos wisest of men he said and knew some small pride that his voice wobbled only a little hail theophrastos cocked his head to one side ive heard your voice before friendto the crows with me if i havent and i do believe ive seen your gangling frame as well youre a rhodian you studied here you were interested in let me see history and natural philosophy as i recall youre sostratos son of he snapped his fingers in annoyance your pardon please ive had too many students over too many years i cant recall your fathers name its lysistratos sir sostratos answered some of the young men whod been with him at the lykeion were still here stilllearning how he envied them lysistratos yes theophrastos dipped his head i was sad when you had to leave us you had a good head on your shoulders sostratos blinked suddenly he felt as if he were walking on air theophrastos said that of him the older man went on do you now hope to return to your studies then you would be welcome thank you sostratos whispered thank you more than i can say most noble one but no that last word was one of the hardest hed ever had to say for all of him wanted to scream yes i have come to sell you several of theophrastos students giggled a couple of them laughed out loud sostratos cheeks felt afire of course these bright young men would mock anyone who had to make his living by trade their wealth let them spend all the time they wanted here without worrying about making a living unfortunately sostratos did need to worry about that let him finish please theophrastos said a man must live yes sostratos you are selling was that courtesy harder to bear than the students scorn sostratos didnt know but if the ground had opened beneath his feet and dropped him down to the house of hades he wouldnt have been sorry to escape the dreadful moment he had to force out the answer through lips that didnt want to say it papyrus o best one papyrus now theophrastos forgot all about the young men whod been strolling with him he hurried forward an eager smile on his face are you really by the dog of egypt thats wonderful news we were running low and i wondered when wed ever see any again you are a friend in need he stood on tiptoe and kissed sostratos on the cheek several of his students hurried up too all of them exclaiming about how much they needed papyrus have you got ink too one of them asked yes i do sostratos hoped he didnt sound too cold that young man had been one of those whod laughed hardest when he said hed come to the lykeion on business now that he turned out to have something this rich pampered fellow wanted he rated politenessat least till his back was turned i dont belong here anymore sostratos realized and the pain of that realization tore into him like knives like fire theyve gone their way ive gone mine and i can turn around go back and pick up where i left off if i write my historyno when i write my history it will have to be from the perspective of a man of affairs not from that of a lover of wisdom tears stung his eyes he turned away for a moment to keep theophrastos and the others from seeing them i could have done this even theophrastos thinks i might have done well if i had i could havebut i wont theophrastos tugged at his arm come back to the residence my dear he said i dont want to let you get away lets make this deal as quickly as we can so that if we find anything worth knowing we will be able to set it down for posterity he waved to his students we are done for the morning my friends we shall return to the nature of the ridiculous another time i was almost here a couple of years ago in a different capacity sostratos said and told theophrastos about the gryphons skull and its loss his old teacher seemed less impressed less interested than hed expected with a shrug theophrastos said these peculiar bones do turn up now and again i admit my own view of them though is that they are more the province of temples and priests than of students of philosophy why sostratos asked isnt learning that the gryphon was in fact a real beast and not something out of a legend a worthwhile addition to natural philosophy it would be yes if the bones demonstrated that beyond conceivable doubt theophrastos said dismissively but since they are so often ambiguousto say the leastand since we dont have them here before us this is surely but one of many possible interpretations wouldnt you agree he smiled as if sure sostratos couldnt do anything but agree without the gryphons skull in hand sostratos could only smile back had he had the skull theophrastos might have said the same thing what old bones meant didnt seem to interest him much if theophrastos had said the same thing sostratos would have been tempted to break the skull over his head as things were he had to get his revenge another way they walked back to a mediumsized house where the lykeion had its home it was not far from the house of the polemarkhos the athenian official in charge of military affairsa man whose job was much less important than it had been in days gone by a slave brought wine as they sat on a stone bench in the courtyard theophrastos said and what do you want for the papyrus you were kind enough to bring us hed already made the mistake of admitting the lykeion badly needed the writing material and hed made the mistake of putting sostratos back up the sympathy sostratos might have felthad feltfor the place where hed studied flickered and blew out when theophrastos showed no interest in even hearing much about his stolen gryphons skull and so he answered four drakhmai a roll most noble one what theophrastos yelped thats robbery a lot of the time it costs only a third of that im sorry best one sostratos replied i confess i was robbed by the supplier who sold it to mewhich was trueand i cant hope for a profit on lesswhich was less than true robbery theophrastos repeated im sorry you feel that way sostratos said i do have to live as you said yourself if you cant meet my price id better talk to the folk at the academy i wanted to come to you first out of the affection i felt for this place but he shrugged the academy theophrastos looked like a man smelling bad fish when he heard the name of athens other leading school you wouldnt deal with them nothing they turn out is worth writing down anyhow sostratos only shrugged theophrastos glowered at him well its plain to see you havent kept all the ideals we tried to inculcate in you sostratos shrugged again theophrastos turned red sostratos got his price protomakhos waved a farewell to his house slaves and to menedemos and sostratos hail all he said ill be back eventually with wreaths and ribbons on my head and a torchbearer lighting my way home my head will ache tomorrow morning but the time t have tonight should make it all worthwhile out the door he went one of his slaves said to another and hell wake everybody up when he gets home banging to be let in isnt that how it always goes the second slave replied they both used greek maybe theyd been born into slavery and knew no other tongue or maybe they came from different lands and had only greek in common menedemos didnt care how much noise protomakhos made when he came reeling home after a symposion he cared only that the rhodian proxenos was leaving the house and wouldnt be back for hours with any luck at all he could sneak up to xenokleias room dont be stupid sostratos whispered as they stood in the courtyard i wouldnt think of being stupid menedemos answered also in a low voice stupid people get caught what can you get from her that you cant get in a brothel sostratos asked enthusiasmand you know it menedemos replied his cousin turned away menedemos took that to mean that sostratos did indeed know it whether it might also mean that sostratos didnt approve regardless of whether he knew it or not menedemos didnt bother worrying about that he ran his hand along the side of his jaw hed shaved in the morning so his face was smooth that was good if he rubbed olive oil on his cheeks now and started scraping away the house slaves would be bound to wonder why protomakhos cook served the rhodians nice white barley rolls for sitos and some sort of fish baked in cheese for opson the cheese helped obscure what sort of fish it was which probably meant it wasnt anything fancy after supper menedemos said myrsos wouldnt have tried getting away with that if his master were here it wasnt bad sostratos said no it wasnt bad but it wasnt up to what weve been getting when protomakhos eats with us menedemos said the cook got to put a few oboloi into his own mouth or else dear protomakhos said im not going to be here tonight so dont bother spending much on supper he wouldnt do that sostratos exclaimed in dismay i dont think he would anyhow no he wouldntthe wine was the same as we always have here was it menedemos considered yes i suppose it was but if he had an open jar dipping some out is nothing their couches sat close together in the andron they could talk without fear of being overheard youre just looking for reasons to dislike him so youll feel better about sneaking upstairs to lie with his wife sostratos said now menedemos turned away that held more truth than he cared to admit he yawned and spoke in a loud voice one he wanted protomakhos slaves to hear im going to bed early tonight i had a busy day in the agora and im beat suit yourself sostratos said and then in lower tones shall i bar your doorfrom the outside funny very funny menedemos said sourly you should write comedies youd run your precious menandros straight out of business i have no more idea how to write a comedy than than i dont know what sostratos said what i dont want to have to do is figure out how to write a tragedy having got the last word he went to his own room he didnt slam the door behind him that might have shown the slaves he and menedemos had been quarreling menedemos knew his cousin wasnt showing restraint for his sake sostratos was showing it so they wouldnt get in trouble doing business in athens but the reason didnt matter much that sostratos was showing restraint did menedemos went to his own room and closed and barred the door he blew out the lamp no one outside could tell he wasnt going to bed he even lay down on the woolstuffed mattress the bedframe creaked taking up his weight he caught himself in a yawn if he really did fall asleep here sostratos would be delighted he thought but xenokleia wouldnt not wanting to give his cousin the chance to gloat would have been reason enough to stay awake even withoutthe other he waited and waited and waited he wishedmoonlight spilled under the door to help him gauge the passage of time but the room faced the wrong way and the moon hadnt risen anyhow and for this darkness was better when he judged enough time had gone by to leave him likely the only one awake down here he got out of bed and tiptoed to the door halfway there he paused to yawn everyone else might behad better beasleep and he was sleepy then why are you doing this he asked himself why dont you just lie down again and get up in the morning he stopped in the middle of the dark room hed never really wondered about why before that sort of question was much more likely to occur to sostratos than to him the answer that formed in his mind was because i can because i always have when i saw the chance was that reason enough sostratos surely would have said no but sostratos lay in the room next door he was probably tightlipped with disapproval even in his sleep menedemos thought of xenokleias waiting arms he hoped protomakhos wife wasnt asleep if she was if she is ill feel like a proper idiot when i sneak back down the stairs and oh how sostratos will laugh when he finds out in the morning menedemos silently slipped the bar from the brackets that held it in place he opened the door it scraped a little as it swung on the dowels that held it to the lintel and to a flat stone with a mounting hole set into the rammedearth floor beneath it menedemos stepped out into the courtyard closing the door behind him he looked around everything was quiet and still after the absolute darkness inside his bedchamber starlight seemed fullmoon bright heart thudding in the mix of anticipation and fear he always found so intoxicating he tiptoed toward the stairs up he went one two three four five the sixth step creaked hed almost frightened himself to death discovering that the first time he sneaked up to xenokleias bedroom now he took a long step up from the fifth stair to the seventh and went on his way silent as a lion stalking its prey no lions on rhodes of course but they still prowled the anatolian mainland not far away the upper landing to the right around the corner his heart pounded harder than ever if anyone discovered him here no excuse could be good enough his prokton puckered how big were those radishes with which athenians were allowed to punish adulterers but then he forgot about radishes forgot about fear forgot about everything for faint flickering yellow lamplight spilled out from under xenokleias door she had been waiting for him he hurried forward and tapped on the door ever so lightly with the nail of his forefinger footsteps inside xenokleia opened the door menedemos jaw dropped she stood there naked and smiling holding the lamp come in she whispered hurry as soon as he did she blew out the little flame darkness descended like a thick blanket i wanted to see more of you menedemos murmured too dangerous xenokleia answered he muttered but she was doubtless right she reached out found his hand and set it on the soft firm flesh of her breast here l am oh yes darling he squeezed she hissed and took an involuntary step back be careful she said theyre sore i remember they were the other times i got pregnant too sorry menedemos pulled his chiton off over his head ill be very careful i promise xenokleia laughed but only for two or three heartbeats then she said wed better hurry we cant know for sure when hell come home i know menedemos remembered jumping out a window in taras when a husband whod quarreled with his brother returned from a symposion hours before he should have the rhodian found the way to xenokleias bed even in the dark why not hed been there before he kissed her he caressed her he teased her breasts and didnt do much more than tease them his hand glided down between her legs when they joined she rode him like a racehorse that kept his weight from coming down where she was tender he went right on stroking her secret place after they joined some women found that too much others thought it was just enough by the way xenokleia arched her back and growled deep in her throat she was one of the latter her final moan of delight was almost loud enough to make menedemos clap a hand over her mouth he was glad hed roused her he didnt want her rousing the household slaves but then his own pleasure burst over him and he stopped worrying about that or anything else she sprawled down onto him careless of her sore breasts he ran a hand along the sweatslick curve of her back after a kiss he asked is the baby mine i dont know for certain xenokleia answered i did what you saidthat was clever and i cant say it wasnt so i cant knowbut i can tell you which way id bet ah so far as menedemos knew he hadnt left any cuckoos eggs in other nests before he still didnt know not for sure but if his seed wasnt stronger than that of a man more than twenty years older then it wasnt and protomakhos would have himself a legitimate child xenokleia kissed him again then she said youd better go downstairs what id rather do is she tossed her head that would take a while now and we may not have the time she was rightright that it would be risky and right that his lance would need a bit to stiffen from boiled asparagus to iron if wed met five years earlier but then how long did protomakhos need between rounds days certainly poor old fellow menedemos thought with a young mans heartlessness the rhodian found his chiton by the door and slipped it on he opened the door i hope we find more chances he whispered as he stepped out so do i xenokleia called after him he shut the door she barred it after him as he tiptoed downstairsagain skipping the creaky onehe thought good at least i kept her sweet she wont tell tales to her husband her being pregnant will help keep her quiet too she wont want him wondering whether the babys his he looked out across the courtyard from the darkness at the bottom of the stairs all quiet quick as a lizard he scurried to his room and closed the door behind him a long sigh of relief no sostratos here now no protomakhos lying in wait either i got away with it again he lay down on the bed he hadnt fallen asleep before someone no not someone protomakhospounded on the front door let me in let me in he shoutedno sang how drunk was he drunk enough evidently how lucky am i menedemos wondered lucky enough evidently and xenokleia had been righta second round would have been a disaster it would have been fun anyhow menedemos thought as a slave padded across the courtyard to open the door for protomakhos in came the proxenos still singing loudly if notvery well despite the racket menedemos yawned twisted stretched slept a cloth merchant tossed his head sorry friend he said and his regret seemed genuine thats very pretty work youve got there and very fine work too i dont say anything different so dont you get me wrong but to the crows with me if i know who would want it and i dont care to buy what im not sure i can sell i dont want to get stuck with it id have thrown my silver away thank you for looking at it sostratos said carefully refolding the embroidered linen hed bought on his way to jerusalem hed heard the same response from several other cloth dealers hed bought the linen because the embroidery worka hunting scene with hares crouching beneath thornbushes and redtongued hounds trying to get them outwas astonishingly vivid and colorful far better than anything of the sort hed seen in hellas the phoenician whod sold it to him told him it came from the east from mesopotamia because it was so beautiful he hadnt imagined he would have any trouble selling it but it was also unusual which made some people leery of it sostratos asked do you know of someone in your business who might be more inclined to take a chance sorry the cloth merchant repeated and tossed his head again you know what i would do if i were you though tell me id try to sell it to some rich man who likes hunting hed have the money to buy it and he might figure out something to do with it hang it on the wall of his andron maybe so his friends could admire it at his symposia that was a good ideaor it would have been a good idea for an athenian merchant a local man would have dealt here for years he would have customers in mind when he saw something like the cloth sostratos didnt he was a stranger here and the athenians were strangers to him strangers he murmured whats that the cloth merchant asked nothing o best one nothing really sostratos answered but i thank you very much for your suggestion i hope you can unload that its very pretty no doubt about it the athenian said but it wouldnt come cheap for me and i dont want to spend my owls on something where t might not get em back all right hail sostratos walked out of the fellows shop and into the brilliant sunlight of the very first days of summer it would have been even hotter in rhodes but it was plenty warm enough here sostratos shadow was a black puddle around his feet down in egypt hed heard shadows got shorter still at solstice time tillthey all but disappeared if you measured the difference in the angle of a noontime shadow on the same day here and at alexandria and if you knew exactly how far it was from here to there you could use geometry to figure out how big the world is you could if you knew but no one did not with the needed precision sostratos sighed so many things we dont know one of the things he still didnt know was where he would sell the embroidered cloth but now thanks to the dealer he had an idea he was glad hed put on his petasos before visiting this fellow otherwise he would have wanted to double back to protomakhos house to get one if he walked down to the seaside with his head uncovered his brains might cook before he got there he hadnt cared to go to peiraieus in the rain squelching through mud he didnt much care for a long walk in baking heat either he laughed at himself you want it to be sunny but mild all the time after a moments thought he dipped his head yes that is what i want nothing was wrong with wanting it as long as he understood that wanting it didnt mean hed get it he wasnt bound for peiraieus today but for mounykhia where the great fort housing kassandros men dominated the skyline what do you want demanded a guard with a long spear that was what sostratos thought he said anyhow he used macedonian dialect so broad as to be almost unintelligible to someone who spoke one of the more usual varieties of greek i want to see alketas the tetrarkhos if you please sostratos answered as dearly as he could and did his best to use atticthe guard would be more used to that and more likely to understand it than sostratos native doric and the fellow dipped his head to show he did follow who be you he asked sostratos son of lysistratos a rhodian ive sold alketas wine i have something else here he might care to see wait no go no come wait the macedonian tapped the ground with the ironshod butt of his spear to make sure sostratos got the message then he disappeared into the bowels of the fortress sostratos waited sweat dripped off him a bee buzzed close he took off his hat and whacked at it it flew away he put the hat back on first carefully checking to make sure the bee wasnt inside just as he was starting to grow impatient the sentry returned now you come he said he led sostratos past an exercise yard where soldiers were practicing under the watchful eye and iron lungs of an underofficer lowerspears the man bellowed down they came they were so long several ranks of spearheads projected out past the first rank of menone reason a phalanx was so hard to oppose how did a foe get through that hedgehog of spears to the soldiers behind itthe persians never had found an answer not from marathon all the way to alexanders time the closest theyd come was hiring hellenes to fight for them in the end that hadnt worked either the motion had looked smooth enough to sostratos but the underofficer flew into a rage screaming abuse at the men in greek and then going into macedonian when he ran out sostratos didnt get all of that but it certainly sounded inflammatory the soldiers looked hot and tired and resignedeven amusedabout the underofficers curses you come the guard said again he lowered his spear from vertical to horizontal so he could take it down a corridor a slave coming the other way yelped and flattened himself against the mudbrick wall to keep from getting spitted the macedonian laughed the corridor opened out onto another smaller yard the guard pointed there in the courtyard alketas stood talking with dionysiosthe commander of the fortressand two other officers he waved when he saw sostratos hail rhodian he boomed hail sostratos replied how are you today couldnt be better the macedonian replied what have you got today have you come up with more wine from interesting places in a way sostratos hated selling fine wine to someone like alketas like as not hed pour it down neat and get his tongue too numb to savor it after the first couple of gulps a man who drank to get drunk and not to enjoy what he was drinking deserved to swill something one step above vinegar selling him lesbian and byblian was almost like pouring them straight into a chamber pot on the other hand as sostratos couldnt ignore it was much more profitable today that issue didnt arise not wine sostratos answered ive got something to decorate your quarters if youre interested ohho alketas made curving motions with his hands is she a blonde the macedonians with him laughed sostratos gave back a dutiful smile something i said o best one not someone no what i have is this he unfolded the embroidered cloth and spread his arms to display it all four macedonians stared in admiration at the hunting scene dionysios said that comes out of mesopotamia doesnt it he was the oldest man there his hair thin on top and more gray than brown yes most noble it does i got it in ioudaia farther west sostratos replied how did you know i saw the like going through that country with the alexander dionysios said greek could show a mans special status by tacking the article on in front of his name and who better deserved special status than alexander if he were alive today he wouldnt even be fifty sostratos thought for a moment then dipped his head that was right even if it seemed unbelievable hed been thirtythree when he died and he was sixteen years dead this graying general certainly not a young man but still far from ancienthe was probably younger than sostratos fatherhad likely been older than the king of macedonia hed served that was a very curious thought what do you want for it dionysios asked now those things dont come cheap i knownot unless you steal em but thats a fine one and i wouldnt mind having it on my own wall he brought it for me alketas said indignantly macedonians stood on very little ceremony among themselves i wouldnt mind having it either said a third soldier a fellow with only three fingers on his left hand and the fourth officer a foxyfaced auburnhaired man who looked more thracian than macedonian also dipped his head ill give you fifty drakhmai for it dionysios said i know you wouldnt take less in fact sostratos would have been glad to get so much the phoenician trader had added the cloth to a lump of beeswax to get an extra bottle of rhodian perfume but the foxyfaced man waited only a heartbeat before saying ill give you sixty sixtyfive by zeus alketas exclaimed seventy said the officer with the missing fingers the macedonians glared at one another sostratos sostratos smiled the soldiers kept bidding up the price of the embroidered hunting scene in between the numbers they shouted they yelled abuse at each other first in greek and then as their tempers kindled in the broad macedonian dialect theyd grown up speaking as with the underofficer in the other courtyard sostratos understood little of that what he could make out seemed fouler than any insults in common use in greek in due course the officer with the missing fingers said one mina eighty drakhmai he waited sostratos waited the other macedonians glowered but none of them bid again the officer beamed he made a fist with his good hand and thumped his chest with it mine he might have been three years old sullenly alketas said i dont care how pretty it is nothings worth that kind of silver if it doesnt have a smooth little piggy to screw since his last offer had been only ten drakhmai lower that struck sostratos as a case of the foxs complaining the grapes were sour after he found he couldnt get them mine repeated the officer with the missing fingers he reached out to take the cloth from sostratos the rhodian didnt give it to him yours when i have my silver he said wait the fellow told him and hurried away he came back carrying a leather sack which he thrust at sostratos here go ahead and count them sostratos blinked he couldnt remember the last time a customer gave him that kind of invitation he hefted the sack it felt about right with a shrug he replied never mind most noble one i trust you the macedonian beamed sostratos gave him the square of embroidered linen his smile got wider he was happy sostratos was happy too the only unhappy people were the other three macedonians the ones the officer had outbid and they sostratos knew would get over it adrastos the dyer was a fat phrygian who wore a saffron chiton with a crimson border as if to show what he could do his shop was in peiraieusnot far from where the aphrodite was tied up in fact when he glowered at menedemos his bushy eyebrows came together to form a single black bar across his forehead you have crimson dye for sale he said suspiciously his attic greek good but flavored by the guttural accent of his anatolian homeland i have never seen anyone but phoenicians selling it up till nowunless you bought it from them and plan to gouge me to make up for what you paid not at all my good fellow menedemos answered doing his best not to wrinkle his nose against the stink of stale piss clinging to the dyeshop they all smelled that way no one knew a better bleach than urine menedemos went on i did buy my dye from a phoenician as a matter of fact ha i knew it adrastos said menedemos held up a hand please o best oneyou didnt let me finish i bought it from a phoenician dyemaker in sidon when i took my akatos east last year because of that i can charge what the phoenicians usually dono middlemans markup as you feared from sidon eh the dyer still sounded suspicious what dyemaker did you deal with there tenashtart son of metena menedemos answered do you know him i have never met him i have not traveled to phoenicia and i do not think he has ever come to athens though ive heard hes traveled to hellas adrastos said but i know of him and of his firm he tugged at his curly black beard if you had not dealt with him i do not think you would know of him here is a jar of dye i bought from him the rhodian set it on the counter between them i can sell you about as much as you want at prices as good as youll get from any man of sidon or byblos the phrygian picked up the jar holding it on one plump palm and slowly turning it with his other hand truly this is the very style of jar tenashtart uses he yanked out the stopper and sniffed the dye had a nasty reek from the shellfish of which it was made though menedemos marveled that adrastos could smell anything through the pungent odor of urine permeating his shop the dyer nodded and then as if to show he really had learned hellenic customs dipped his head too menedemos hid a smile hed seen other barbarians do the same adrastos said it does appear to be the true crimson dye may i test it with a scrap of cloth please do most noble one menedemos told him thats why i brought it adrastos poked the corner of a rag into the jar then pulled it out he studied the deep red color yes thats sidonian crimson sure enough its not as good as what tyre used to make before alexander sacked the town tyrian crimson was brighter and wouldnt fade no matter what such a color i was just a youth getting started in my fathers businessyou would have been a little boy then you dont see the like any more the men who knew how to make it are dead or else theyre slaves doing something thats got nothing to do with dye this isnt bad for what you can get nowadays but it doesnt come up to tyrian he sighed menedemos would have thought he was trying to beat the price down but other men who knew about the dyes the phoenicians made had told him the same thing is it good enough for you to want it he asked oh yes adrastos said as long as i can get a decent price that is he named one thats not decent thats indecent menedemos yelped you want me to give it away he named his own considerably higher price adrastos howled like a wolf any phoenician tried to charge me that id fling him into a vat of piss he sent menedemos a speculative look as if wondering how the rhodian would look all wet and dripping some people menedemos remarked think theyre the only ones who work a trade in a polis the size of athens i can always sell to someone else sell certainly steal from honest folk with your prices not likely adrastos said they traded more insults the phrygian came up a little menedemos went down a little they both knew ahead of time about where they would end up as they drew closer to that point they haggled harder finally menedemos said have we got a bargain yesrhodian i think we do the dyer stuck out his hand which was stained with crimson and saffron and woad and other dyes menedemos clasped it adrastos asked and how soon can i have the dye my ship is tied up here in peiraieus menedemos said let me walk over and ill get it for you youll have the silver waiting oh yes the world would squeak to a stop if not for silver adrastos answered i pay what i say ill pay you dont need to worry about that when some men told menedemos he didnt need to worry he worried harder than ever the phrygian didnt strike him as being one of that sort though yes adrastos dressed gaudily but how else was a dyer supposed to show off his skill the mans shop was neat and clean he couldnt help the way it smelled not in the business he was in and the owls he gave menedemos wouldnt stink with a smile at that conceit menedemos said all right o best one ill be back in a little while with the dye then he hurried toward the quays dodging past a fisherman carrying a basket of sprats some of them still wiggling a little another fisherman with a basket of eels for customers who could afford better than sprats a naked sponge diver his eyes bloodred from staying open in the sea a couple of sponges under his arms a grayhaired unveiled woman selling little cheese pies a shavenheaded egyptian sailor coming out of a brothel with a sated smirk on his face and a netseller or mender all draped with his wares flies buzzed sparrows hopped around pecking at this and that a dog with half its left ear missing gnawed a length of pig gut a sausageseller must have thrown away it growled when menedemos walked by he raised a leg to kick it if it tried to bite and it shrank back in fear as menedemos neared the pier to which the aphrodite was tied someone called his name he turned there was sostratos waving menedemos waved back and said hail what are you doing here i thought youd be up in the city i sold some ink to a fellow who thinks hes the next euripides and then found id got rid of all the jars wed brought up to protomakhos house sostratos looked disgusted with himself i hate making mistakes like that reminds me youre human menedemos said by his cousins expression sostratos didnt care to be reminded but he also recalled enough humanity to stay polite which he didnt always he asked how about you i just sold some crimson dye to a dyer whose shop cant be more than three or four plethra from the aphrodite menedemos said got a decent price for it too how much sostratos asked menedemos told him he dipped his head yes thats not bad he agreed nothing to make kroisos the lydian king jealous but not bad kroisos collected taxes and tribute menedemos said we have to earn our money so we sostratos broke off and pointed out to sea by the dog of egypt he whispered will you look at that menedemos looked there approaching the harbor was an immense fleet of war galleys and transports he started to count them but rapidly gave up there had to be well over a hundred he and sostratos werent the only ones whod spotted them either everywhere people on the street and on the quays stopped whatever they were doing and pointed out to sea like sostratos who do you suppose they are sostratos asked in a small voice you said it yourselfby the dog of egypt menedemos answered they have to belong to ptolemaios otherwise the athenians and kassandros men would be trying to shut the harbor against them and beat them back and theyre not they certainly werent a couple of kassandros macedonians waved to the officers on the deck of an approaching war galleyan immense ship at least a six with two men per oar on all three banks of oars one of the men on the galley waved back his red cloak clung to his shoulders the breeze blew from off the sea blowing from off the sea it carried the stench of the galleys to the shore menedemos made a face pheu he said in disgust thats a worse reek than the one i came away from at adrastos dyeshop a lot of men packed close together on a lot of warships without much water for washing sostratos as usual wanted to get to the bottom of things usually that was a virtue today it irritated menedemos i know my dear he said no matter what you may think im not a fool and whatever the reason thats a horrible stink transports started tying up wherever there was room along a pier naked sailors tossed lines to longshoremen who made the ships fast gangplanks thumped out onto the quays soldiers tramped along the gangplanks up the quays and onto dry land they wore their helmets and corselets and carried both spears and shields the longshoremen got out of their way as fast as they could they look ready for business dont they sostratos said they sure do menedemos answered i dont understand sostratos said is ptolemaios going to help kassandros garrison athens if he is will kassandros move some of his men somewhere else to the north say to fight against lysimakhos theres been no rumor about any of this by the way he sounded he took that as a personal affront but he wasnt the only one puzzled the macedonians whod waved to the approaching fleet came up to the closest column of soldiers one of them asked a question menedemos couldnt make out the words but it had to be something like whats going on here quite casually an oncoming soldier lowered his long spearit was more than twice the height of a manand thrust it into the macedonians gut his companion stared in astonished disbelief before he could do anything but stare another soldier speared him both men let out bubbling wails of anguish as they crumpled their blood spilling into the dust they died without ever knowing why forward men called an officer with the soldiers now we take hold of this place forward they came sandals thumping and as they came they shouted out their war cry demetrios son of antigonos eleleu demetrios son of antigonos menedemos and sostratos gaped at each other as the column pounded past that wasnt demetrios of phaleron the soldiers were shouting for it was demetrios the son of antigonos the oneeyed macedonian marshal and deadly foe to ptolemaios and kassandros both however hed done it his men were swarming into pekaieusand for all menedemos knew into mounykhia tooin what looked like overwhelming numbers sostratos had never thought hed be caught in the storming of a city he looked around for some place where he and menedemos might hidelooked around and saw nothing he didnt want to break and run that would draw the invaders attention to him and they were all too likely to serve him as theyd served kassandros officers some people did run away demetrios son of antigonos soldiers didnt pursue them and some people came pelting down toward the wharves to find out what was going on even more than most hellenes athenians were insatiably curious one of the war galleys a great fearsome six drew near the shore a very tall man wearing a gilded highcrested helm a gilded corselet and a crimsondyed cape draped over his back stood near the bow sostratos pointed toward him that has to be demetrios he said i dont know if it has to be but id think it probably is menedemos answered his father is supposed to be a big man his cousin polemaios was a big man we saw that when he was aboard the aphrodite a couple of years ago it must run in the family sostratos said and besides who else but demetrios would wear such a fancy outfit closer and closer came the war galley till it was within easy bowshot of the shore sostratos wondered if it would run aground demetrios soldiers formed a perimeter along the shoreline to keep anyone from coming too close but a good archer could have shot at the ship from beyond it he could have that is if hed found room to draw his bow the crowd of gawkers grew thicker by the minute sostratos and menedemos both used their elbows to keep from getting squashed together like olives in brine the man at the bow of the six waited a few minutes more to let the crowd build further then he cupped both hands in front of his mouth and called hail people of athens hail free people of athens i am demetrios son of antigonos told you so sostratos whispered hush menedemos whispered back and sostratos did demetrios dropped his hands for a moment to gaze out at the athenians and to let them see him the war galley was close enough to the shore for him to show off not only his size but also his good looks he was about sostratos age ruddy like so many men from the north with a long straight nose and a forwardthrusting chin hail he said once more in a ringing baritone my father has sent me here on what we both hope will be a mission that makes you athenians happy what i aim to do is very simple t aim to set the city free to throw kassandros garrison out of mounykhia and to give you back your own laws and your old constitution and by athena thats all i aim to do he stopped he waited the athenians looked at one another a quick gabble of conversation broke out a few people said that couldnt possibly be all demetrios and antigonos wanted from athens more though burst into delighted cheers euge for demetrios they shouted and to the crows with demetrios of phaleron and furies take kassandros and all who follow him some few of them had brought weapons they threw them down now in token of surrender out on the galley demetrios raised a hand men of athens i promise i will not set foot in your polis until kassandros garrison is gone i hope and expect it will be soon for i have wanted to see athens for many years cheers rang out and more shouts of praise for demetrios out of the side of his mouth sostratos said he may not come into athens himself till then but you notice he didnt say anything about his soldiers oh yes menedemos replied im just glad you were selling ink to some fellow who fancies himself a poet and not wine or truffles to kassandros officers over at their fortress youd be trapped there if you were oimoi sostratos exclaimed i hadnt thought of that but youre right demetrios shouted let word go into the cityin fact i will send itthat i would speak with whatever representative demetrios of phaleron will send to me for he must surely see that his time in athens is past that the polis now lies in my hands and that i will liberate it in accordance with my fathers orders lets take care of our business here and then get back up to athens as fast as we can sostratos said i dont know if well have the chance much longer that makes more sense than i wish it did menedemos said i hope demetrios men dont take it into their heads to plunder the aphrodite how do you propose to stop them if they do sostratos asked bleakly we cant his cousin replied which was exactly what sostratos thought thats why i hope they dont the two rhodians hurried to the merchant galley when they got there they found the normally unflappable diokles in a fragile state by the gods young sirs when i saw those soldiers on the quays i thought we were going to be somebodys opson maybe im wrong i hope i am but he shuddered those were a bad few minutes there till demetrios started talking the athenians ate that up didnt they he can charm the birds right out of the trees sooner or later though well find out whether hes telling the truth sostratos said there is that the oarmaster agreed what do we do now sit tight and hope he is that was menedemos decision not sostratos yes i think we do menedemos answered wed have to leave more than half the crew behind if we try to sneak out now and who knows if demetrios fleet will let anybody leave if he was telling even part of the truth well be all right if anybody does give us trouble we should shout out at the top of our lungs that were rhodians sostratos said plundering athenians is one thing for demetrios menup till now athens has been on kassandros side and kassandros and antigonos are enemies but rhodes is a neutral demetrios has to bewell hed better be if hes smartleery about offending her menedemos dipped his head right you are best one that makes good sense and im not sure i would have thought of it myself weve got a toikharkhos with a good head on his shoulders diokles said sostratos grinned diokles good opinion mattered to him then he remembered that theophrastos had said the same thing the philosophers good opinion mattered to him too did it matter much more than the keleustes sostratos tossed his head if that didnt show how much hed changed since his student days he couldnt imagine what would he got the ink and helped menedemos carry the jars of crimson dye to adrastos shop menedemos took the dyers money without counting it showing silver now could be dangerous lets head back up to the city sostratos said the farther away from all these soldiers we get the better ill like it his cousin was in many ways a daredevil sostratos wanted to throttle menedemos for taking up with their hosts wife he seemed to have got away with it but what if xenokleia had gone straight to protomakhos after his first advances toward her trouble that was what and what if her baby ended up looking like menedemos trouble again perhaps though not till the next visit to athens but menedemos showed no desire to play dangerous games with demetrios soldiers for that at least sostratos was grateful back toward athens they went the way up to the city was more crowded than sostratos had ever seen it he wasnt surprised he and menedemos couldnt have been the only ones who wanted to get away from the newly arrived macedonians demetrios name was on everyones lips somewhere up in front of them was the dividing line between people who knew antigonos son was seizing control of the harbors of athens and those who didnt as traders traveling from city to city sostratos and menedemos had often been newsb ringers on the very edge between those who knew and those who wanted to find out not today their stop at adrastos had let others get ahead they hadnt gone far before hoofbeats thundered behind them raucous voices shouted make way make way for the envoys of demetrios son of antigonos the cavalrymen raced past at a fast trot at that rate they might get to athens before any of the people on foot menedemos sighed as the horses went by i wish id done more riding he said not me as far as sostratos was concerned that was as much daredeviltry as his cousins taste for sleeping with other mens wives i may admire a man who can stay on a horses back but that doesnt mean i want to imitate him very often its a long way down the ground is hard and what have you got to hold on with your knees no thanks you were the one who hired a donkey to go exploring when we were in italy menedemos pointed out that was a donkey sostratos said nobly resisting the temptation to add and youre another one it was small and im pretty large my feet were almost dragging in the dust when i got astride it it walked it didnt trot or gallop and besides you were curious then menedemos said sostratos didnt dignify that with a reply especially since it was true on they went sweat poured off sostratos he wished hed drunk some wine or even water before setting out from peiraieus who could guess what demetrios men were doing back there though he looked over his shoulder no great cloud of black smoke rose into the sky they hadnt started burning for the sport of it anyhow demetrios had said hed come to liberate athens of course the difference between what a general said and what he did was all too often enormous sostratos and menedemos had almost got back to athens when they saw demetrios horsemen again this time coming the other way along with the soldiers rode a worriedlooking civilian who looked none too happy on horseback sostratos caught a snatch of conversation a cavalryman said dont worry o best one im sure well work something out i wonder what that means menedemos said maybe demetrios son of antigonos hasnt got a persian torturer waiting for demetrios of phaleron after all sostratos replied maybe menedemos laughed a nasty laugh or maybe he wants demetrios of phaleron to think he hasnt got a torturer waiting for him it could be sostratos admitted the macedonians play the game for keeps kassandros has had it all his own way here in athens for a long time and so has demetrios of phaleron if the other demetrios has trouble finding reasons to give him a hard time im sure plenty of athenians could suggest some once the rhodians got into the city sostratos found out how right he was athens bubbled like grape juice fermenting into wine for ten years people had had to keep quiet about what they thought that was what tyranny did it had been a genteel tyranny but tyranny it was nonetheless now now going through the city toward protomakhos house sostratos heard a lot of what people must have been thinking and not saying furies take demetrios was popular so was to the crows with demetrios someone said one of demetrios pals cheated me on a house i couldnt do anything about it for a long time but ill get even now somebody else added theres a lot of polluted villains whod better run before we catch em and hamstring em maybe he was speaking metaphorically on the other hand maybe he wasnt had sostratos been a man whod enriched himself during demetrios of phalerons years in power he didnt believe he would have cared to linger in athens to find out no matter who ruled athens business had to go on menedemos went back down to peiraieus the day after demetrios son of antigonos men took the port to make sure the aphrodite stayed safe no trouble here skipper diokles reported the soldiers are under good discipline and they arent plundering thats a relief menedemos said and brought some more perfume up into athens he was haggling with a hetairas slave in the agora the following day when a single sentence swept across the market square hes gone demetrios of phaleron menedemos asked couldnt be anyone else the slave woman answered she was middleaged and plain but her face glowed maybe things will be better here now i hope so menedemos said thinking on the other hand maybe they wont he muttered to himself that was something more likely to occur to sostratos but nobody whod watched alexanders macedonian marshals bang one another back and forth had an easy time believing any one of them could solve a polis problems just by appearing and snapping his fingers however much they wanted to be the marshals werent gods about alexander himself menedemos wasnt so sure as he and the slave went on dickering details followed that first exciting breath of rumor from what people said demetrios son of antigonos had granted demetrios of phaleron a safeconduct up to the border of boiotia which remained in kassandros hands too bad the woman said i wanted him up on a cross what did he do to you menedemos asked oh he didnt do anything to me she answered but hes been sucking up to the macedonians for years and im sick of it i see menedemos said but isnt demetrios son of antigonos a macedonian too well what if he is the slave woman asked in return he said were going to be free so of course id rather see him than demetrios of phaleron she herself was unlikely to be free no matter which demetrios called the shots in athens would the polis be free she certainly seemed to think so by the excited chattering all around so did a lot of the athenians to menedemos their optimism only proved they hadnt been free for a long time and werent very good at gauging what promises were worth demetrios son of antigonos would promise anything to win the athenians over just as menedemos might to coax a girl into bed delivering afterwards that was liable to be a different story menedemos shrugged the only thing he could do now was try to stay out of the way of macedonian soldiers no matter which marshal they claimed as their master he went back to haggling with the slave woman at last they reached a price that satisfied both of them she went off to get the silver from her mistress she came back with it herself instead of bringing along an enormous keltic body servant menedemos thought that wise before long soldiers loyal to demetrios son of antigonos would be coming into the agora they were liable to react to an enormous kelt the way hounds reacted to a boar sure enough demetrios soldiers did enter the agora later that afternoon they seemed more travelers than warriors though some of them gaped at the buildings lining the south and west sides of the market square others craned their necks to peer up at the even more magnificent buildings of the akropolis a whiff of panic swept through the agora when they first appeared as soon as the merchants found out they werent intent on rapine and murder the panic blew away the athenians started trying to sell them things instead so did menedemos he held up one of his little jars perfume fine perfume from rhodes island of roses make some athenian girl glad to see you when you give her perfume a soldier came over to him how much he asked menedemos told him he scowled then tossed his head youve got to be joking pal i can pay a platoon of athenian girls to be glad to see me for that kind of money ah but the ones you get with this are worth a platoon of the ordinary sort menedemos said some are better in bed than others sure the soldier said but none of ems that much better menedemos did not make a sale when he got back to protomakhos house as the sun was going down he found sostratos had news theyve dug a trench around the fortress in mounykhia none of kassandros men gets out you think the fortress will fall menedemos asked i dont see how it can do anything else his cousin answered no sign of demetrios son of antigonos in athens yet either maybe he does keep promises wouldnt that be strange i wish he would come menedemos said weve still got some wine and truffles and perfume left hes antigonos son he cant be poor maybe hell buy things now that the other demetrios has fled maybe he will or maybe his officers will sostratos said i certainly hope so right at the moment theyre besieging some of our best customers rude of them isnt it menedemos remarked sostratos raised an eyebrow thats one way to put it yes the rhodians kept trying to do business in athens but nobody seemed eager to spend much silveror perhaps to show much silver till people saw what sort of master demetrios son of antigonos would make the siege of the fortress at mounykhia went on every so often a few men came in or went out during brief truces people said dionysios the commander was dickering with demetrios over surrender terms menedemos had no idea how the people who said that knew it but say it they did demetrios didnt need all the soldiers hed brought along to maintain the siege he sent others west to megara to take that polis away from kassandros in the earlier days of hellas megara was a prominent polis but the rise of athens eclipsed it its walls didnt hold demetrios men out for long only pleas from athens to spare a former rival kept the city from being plundered protomakhos who brought word of that to menedemos and sostratos went on demetrios has some sense of what looks good in the eyes of hellenes thats probably why he spared the place thats more than his father does sostratos said antigonos is like a shark hell bite off your leg first and worry about what you think of it later so ive heard protomakhos agreed but demetrios is smoother than that he asked stilpon the megaran philosopher if any of his men had robbed him and stilpon answered no i havent seen anybody carrying away any knowledge menedemos and sostratos laughed menedemos said demetrios didnt stop all the plundering from what ive heard his men might have left the megarans their immovable property but they did steal most of the slaves in the town maybe for themselves maybe to resell to dealers i heard the same thing the rhodian proxenos said as demetrios was heading out of megara he told stilpon i leave this a city of free men and stopon answered i should say you do for youve taken all our slaves talking back to the man whos just captured your city takes nerve menedemos said protomakhos dipped his head sostratos asked if demetrios has left megara wheres he going that i dont know protomakhos answered wherever he can give his foesand his fathersthe most trouble is my guess but that guess proved wide of the target sostratos was the one who found out what antigonos son had been up to after leaving megara a few days after protomakhos brought the news of demetrios departure sostratos said hes gone to patrai or rather just outside of patrai to patrai protomakhos exclaimed thats well west of corinth isnt iton the north coast of the peloponnesos what made him go there not what o best onewho sostratos answered something in his voice made menedemos look up sharply his cousin wasnt looking his way but out of the andron and across the courtyard still menedemos sensed that sostraios was really talking to him as he continued it seems kratesipolis invited him to pay her a call menedemos knew the name still he thought it best to let protomakhos be the one who responded respond the rhodian proxenos did the woman who was ruling sikyon not far from patrai not long ago thats the one sostratos dipped his head shes the widow of alexandras son of polyperkhon and shes still supposed to be a famous beauty polyperkhon didnt amount to much did he menedemos remarked no one could possibly have argued with him the macedonian officer a man of the generation of antigonos and indeed of philip of macedon had ruled varying chunks of hellas since not long after the death of alexander the great but hed never managed to make himself a major player in the wars of the macedonian marshals no my dear but the storys about his daughterinlawand about demetrios sostratos said he went after her like a hound after a hare he dashed off to patrai with just a few officers and when he got there he set up his tent well apart from theirs he wanted to have a private visit with kratesipolis hes a young man isnt he the age of you two rhodians more or less protomakhos chuckled reminiscently when youre that age a lot of the time your spear stands and you just have to flesh it in piggyor you think you do anyhow now menedemos was the one who gazed out at the courtyard as if it were the most fascinating thing in the world if protomakhos suspected but he didnt seem to sostratos voice still held that sharp edge as he went on demetrios almost paid for his folly with his neck too some of kassandros men got word he was there and he barely escaped them when they came to call the story wasnt about adultery how could it be with kratesipolis a widow but it was about a man doing something stupid on account of a woman and almost dying on account of it just for a heartbeat menedemos gaze flicked toward sostratos his cousin looked almost indecently smug yes hed enjoyed telling it sure enough blindfortunatelyto the byplay protomakhos said maybe demetrios has learned his lesson maybe hell come back here and finish off the siege down at mounykhia by zeus i hope so business wont get back to normal till he does i hope he does too sostratos said but somebody whos mad for women like that hes liable to keep right on doing crazy things as long as he lives no he wasnt looking at menedemos but he was talking to him well i wont say youre wrong protomakhos replied whether hes mad for women or not though the way he got into our harbors shows hes a pretty good general thats true sostratos said the way he relieved ptolemaios siege of halikarnassos a couple of years ago too he got in another jab there though again not one protomakhos would notice menedemos couldnt think of halikarnassos without thinking of the trouble hed wound up in there on account of that merchants wife he glanced over to sostratos once more his cousin had had things all his own way lately when it came to giving menedemos knew that was his own fault his affair with xenokleia had given sostratos plenty of openings but that didnt mean menedemos wouldnt enjoy revenge oh no it didnt mean that at all demetrios men pummeled the fortress at mounykhia with dart and stonethrowing engines trapped inside the fort dionysios and the garrison fought back as well as they could but they were badly outnumbered and the catapults made going up on the battlements worth a mans life a few days after megara fell demetrios men stormed the stronghold the macedonians inside threw down their weapons when they saw they couldnt hold off their foes demetrios soldiers took dionysios alive and then instead of garrisoning the fortress at mounykhia themselves demetrios men started tearing it down that impressed sostratos more than anything else theyd done maybe demetrios really means it when he says he wants athens to be free and independent he remarked at supper the day after the fortress fell who would have believed that not me protomakhos said nibbling at an eel i just thought wed go from one foreign overlord to the next how about you menedemos me i just hope well be able to get some business done now menedemos said i let sostratos worry about the political side of things hes the one who enjoys fretting over things he cant change that held more venom than menedemos usually used to charge his words sostratos wondered what hed done to irritate his cousin he couldnt think of anything hed just been himself hadnt he before he could fix on anything he might have done protomakhos said they say demetrios will finally enter the city day after tomorrow to address the assembly and make everything official this time sostratos didnt quibble about what they whoever they were might say what the proxenos reported sounded too likely for him to quarrel with it sostratos did ask is there any way a foreigner could join the assembly when demetrios speaks to it id love to hear that with my own ears i doubt theyll be taking roll not for a meeting like this protomakhos replied i was thinking the same thing sostratos said eagerly want to come menedemos he tried to sound as friendly as he could his cousin started to toss his head but then shrugged instead well why not he said a lot of the people id want to see would be at the meeting anyhow the assembly met in the theater not far from protomakhos house the proxenos and the two rhodians left his home early as theyd done to see the tragedies and comedies even so the theater was already more than half full by the time they got there for one thing admission to the assembly was free for another after so long obeying demetrios of phaleron and through him kassandros the athenians seemed eager to reclaim their freedom that struck sostratos as a good omen as the dawn brightened and the sun finally rose a man strode importantly across the stage people pointed at him and exclaimed to one another sostratos nudged protomakhos who is that i dont recognize him thats stratokles by zeus protomakhos answered demetrios could have started better why sostratos pricked up his ears at the hint of scandal who is he what has he done hes a debauched arrogant buffoon protomakhos said he played at politics before demetrios of phalerons day and none too well he used to keep a hetaira named phylakion one day she brought back some neck bones and brains from the agora for a supper and stratokles said here are the things we political men play ball with sostratos made a disgusted noise menedemos said lovely fellow isnt he protomakhos dipped his head and then there was the time the year after alexander died when the macedonians beat our fleet off amorgos stratokles got word of the sea fight first somehow and told everyone it was a victory he put on a garland and proposed a sacrifice to the gods and a distribution of the meat then a couple of days later the truth reached the polis everyone started cursing him and he said why blame me when i made you happy for two days lovely fellow indeed sostratos said he would have said more than that but stratokles spoke then men of athens it is my great privilege to present to you our liberator from years of loathsome tyranny demetrios son of antigonos he might have been a rogue but he owned a ringing baritone voice that filled the theater without effort demetrios came out to stand beside him they made an odd pair for the athenian was short and squat while demetrios who had a godlike physique towered head and shoulders above him hail people of athens he said and his voice also outdid stratokles antigonos my father is concerned for the freedom and autonomy of all poleis of hellas and especially for those of athens the greatest and most famous polis of them all that won him a warm round of applause the athenians were no more immune than anyone else to hearing themselves praised demetrios went on this being so my father has ordered me to restore to you your ancient democratic constitution which tyrants have trampled on for far too long more applause a great roar of it sostratos clapped his hands along with the rest he lived in a democratic city and thought well of democracy but he couldnt help wonder what sort of strings antigonos and demetrios would attach to the restoration my father has also told me to tell you he is pleased to send you medimnoi of wheat from anatolia for your storehouses and your bakeries demetrios said and he will also send you timber enough to build a hundred triremes and restore your fleet to the glory it once enjoyed amid the rapturous cheers from the athenians all around menedemos muttered ha sostratos dipped his head rebuilding a navy took more than timber it took skilled rowers by the thousands where would athens find them how would she pay for them demetrios said nothing about that and triremes were the small change of fleets these days anyhow fours fives and sixesall full not only of rowers but also of equally expensive marinesdid the bulk of the work some of demetrios promises were less extravagant than they seemed that might have occurred to the two rhodians it didnt seem to have crossed a single athenians mind well thats their worry notmine sostratos thought he hoped it wouldnt be the athenians worry but feared and expected it would as the applause faded demetrios bowed to the assembled people of athens and stepped back leaving the stage to stratokles again the orator said with our first decrees as men free once more let us praise the great antigonos and demetrios for liberating us from the hateful yoke of demetrios of phaleron and kassandros his puppetmaster more cheers rang out demetrios son of antigonos looked artfully astonished as if he hadnt imagined stratokles would propose such a thing see how modest he is someone behind sostratos exclaimed sostratos had other ideas he glanced over at menedemos who was also looking his way putup job sostratos mouthed his cousin dipped his head may it be propitious stratokles continued the opening formula for a decree let us set up gilded statues of antigonos and demetrios in a chariot the said statues to stand near those of harmodios and aristogeiton in the agora so that one pair of liberators may regard the other do i hear an opposing voice no one spoke in opposition the decree passed without a single mutter sostratos thought it extravagant but shrugged mental shoulders harmodios and aristogeiton were credited with helping to overthrow the tyranny of hippias and usher in democracy at athens two hundred years earlier anyone whod read thoukydides as sostratos had knew things werent nearly so simple but by now what the athenians believed was at least as important as what had really happened andstatues whoever was making those gilded statues would need beeswax to coat his mold and take the fine detail he would sculpt beeswax sostratos muttered beeswax he didnt want to forget stratokles hadnt withdrawn may it be propitious he said again let us reward our liberators with honorary crowns valued at two hundred talents of silver to show the world that the athenians gratitude is not to be despised or taken lightly do i hear an opposing voice again demetrios looked modest and surprised again no one dissented again the decree passed by acclamation sostratos slowly dipped his head athens would pay and pay plenty for the privilege of liberation even for a polis as rich as this one two hundred talents was a lot of money may it be propitious stratokles said once more and sostratos wondered what was coming next he didnt have to wait long let us consecrate an altar to antigonos and demetrios this altar to be known as that of the saviors and let us consecrate another altar where demetrios first came down from his chariot and set foot on the soil of athens that one to be known as the altar of the descending demetrios and let the chief priest who serves the altar of the saviors henceforth give his name to the year as the arkhon does now do i hear an opposing voice there stood demetrios no matter how abashed he looked his men had just driven kassandros out of athens he said hed set the city free what could he do if he changed his mind anything he wants to sostratos thought the athenians no doubt thought the same way stratokles heard no opposing voices the decreeone servile enough to make sostratos faintly sick to his stomachpassed without a single protest from the assembly and more followed the newly freeor so demetrios had named thempeople of athens voted to add to the ten tribes among which they divided up their citizens two more to be named antigonis and demetrias they voted to hold annual games in honor of demetrios and his father with sacrifices and a procession and they voted to include the portraits of antigonos and demetrios on the ceremonial mantle offered to athena in the parthenon every five years along with the images of the other gods as stratokles said like the ones that had come before those motions passed without dissent that seemed to be all of them as if to prove it was demetrios stepped forward once mare he bowed men of athens i thank you for your generosity and f know my father thanks you as well he said sostratos fought down a strong urge to retch that hadnt been generosity it had been the most revolting display of sycophancy hed ever seen no one he was sure had ever flattered even the great kings of persia like this but now the athenians whod beaten the persians at marathon at salamis and at plataia whod preserved liberty for all of hellas wriggled on their bellies to kiss the dust through which demetrios had walked and they called that freedom no he didnt want to retch he warned to cry demetrios went on you have been kind to my father and me because you have we shall also be kind to you in the ways i have promised and in any other ways that seem good to us how the athenians cheered demetrios practiced that abashed smile once more or maybe it wasnt so practiced maybe all this praise heaped on him really had turned his head he surely couldnt have heard anything like it before yes he was antigonos righthand man but antigonos by all accounts was not a man one could safely flatterhe had wit enough to see through it nor was he one to spoil his sons either demetrios or philippos sokrates had to drink hemlock here sostratos thought he shivered two years before hed watched polemaios drink hemlock dying of the drug was neither so neat nor so philosophical as platon made it out to be but now the athenians have found a sweeter poison stratokles moved that the meeting adjourn that drew no more argument than any of his other motions had the people of athens streamed out of the theater by all appearances well content with what theyd done the morning remained young as long as he and menedemos were in the midst of the athenians sostratos said nothing all his cousin said was well well that could have meant anything sostratos knew what he thought it meant he agreed too protomakhos was also conspicuously quiet as he and the rhodians made their way back to his house once inside he led them to the andron and called for wine then making sure none of his slaves was in earshot he spoke in low intense furious tones you young fellows you come from a polis with a democracy that really works isnt that so yes sostratos said menedemos dipped his head the rhodian proxenos took a long pull at his winecup then he went on me im not a youth any more im old enough to remember how democracy is supposed to go i recall the days before philip of macedon won at khaironeia and put all of hellas under his boot people then cared about the way things went they cared about doing what was right doing what was best they cared about something besides bending over and showing demetrios how wide their arseholes were a disgusted look on his face he drained the cup and dipped it full again sostratos said the only thing he could think of that might make the athenian feel a little better you havent had a real democracy here for quite a while most noble one maybe now that this is done your people will get the hang of it again do you think so protomakhos asked morosely i dont stratokles got to play the sycophant today but plenty of others havent had the chance yet theyll take it and theyll take revenge on everybody who backed demetrios of phaleron too you wait and see if kleokritos didnt go over the border with his master i wouldnt lay an obolos on his chances of living to grow old would you well no sostratos admitted the proxenos was all too likely to be right whenever one faction ousted another the first thing it usually did was get its own back against its rivals sostratos could have gone into detail about that hed read herodotos and thoukydides and xenophon but few hellenes needed to read the historians to understand what their folk were capable of protomakhos almost certainly hadnt hellenes who knew themselves knew their own kind could see what was coming menedemos said as long as the city doesnt break out in civil warhe might have been talking about a pestilencewell do all right and so should you best one he added pointing to protomakhos theyll probably want to buy lots of slabs of marble to inscribe the decrees they passed today yes i suppose they will protomakhos seemed less than delighted at the prospect but then he brightened a little if they are going to buy them they may as well buy them from me thats the spirit menedemos dipped his head he seemed perfectly friendly toward the dealer in stone knowing how friendly menedemos had been with protomakhos wife sostratos found that bemusing he knew menedemos shouldnt jeer at the man hed cuckolded but his cousin was proving an even better actor than hed expected with an effort sostratos wrenched his thoughts away from adultery commerce he told himself thinkof commerce turning to protomakhos he asked do you know whos likely to do the statues of antigonos and demetrios in their chariot id like to see him as soon as i canthat will be my best chance to sell all the beeswax i got in ioudaia euge my dear menedemos exclaimed he beamed at sostratos to protomakhos he said isnt my cousin the cleverest fellow oh yes sostratos thought you like my wits well enough when i turn them toward ways of making us money but when i use the same logic to point out how you might want to choose a different road for your own life you dont want to hear me but whats more important in the end silver or satisfaction he clicked his tongue between his teeth menedemos no doubt would define satisfaction differently protomakhos played the diplomat both you rhodians are doing well for yourselves as for sculptors my guess would be theyll choose hermippos son of lakritos he trained under the great lysippos and hes the best in the polis nowadays lysippos was a fine sculptor sure enough sostratos said theres that herakles of his back in rhodespeople admire it oh that one menedemos said i know the one you mean yes he could make bronze and marble breathe sure enough ive seen some of his work too protomakhos said hermippos isnt quite in the same class but he does well enough sostratos almost remarked on that but held his peace people would admire lysippos work for generations his name would live on for every lysippos though how many men did well enough to make a living perhaps even well enough to gain some reputation while they were alive but would be utterly forgotten five years after earth covered them others besides thoukydides had written about the peloponnesian war what scribe copied their works these days before long if it hadnt happened alreadymice would nibble the last papyrus roll that held their histories and then they would be gone other bards besides homer must have sung who remembered them are you sure you want to write a history sostratos wondered if you dont write it youll surely be forgotten he answered himself if you do you have a chance of living on any chance is better than none he dragged his mind back to the business at hand where does this hermippos have his shop he asked protomakhos just north and west of the agora protomakhos replied the street of the panathenaia divides one road going to the sacred gate the other to the dipylon gate hermippos shop is on the road to the dipylon gate a couple of plethra past the boundary stone that marks the quarter of the kerameikos the next morning sostratos got his lump of beeswax out of the proxenos storeroom and made his way up the street leading to the dipylon gate to his reliefand more than a little to his surprisehe found hermippos shop without much trouble the sculptor was an excitable litde man in his thirties with broad shoulders and big hands no you thumbfingered idiot thisway how many times do i have to tell you he shouted at a harriedlooking apprentice as sostratos came up he glowered at the rhodian and what do you want hail hermippos sostratos said eyeing the work in progress an armored athena in marble a competent piece but with nothing about it to draw the eye back for a second look protomakhos had gauged the man well are you going to be making the gilded statues of antigonos and demetrios why do you want to know the sculptor asked suspiciously i dont need any new prentices the one ive got gives me enough headaches and if you think you can wangle some kind of kickback from me for the commission to the crows with you ive got it straight from stratokles you misunderstand o best one sostratos said instantly glad he didnt have to deal with hermippos every day i have fine beeswax to sell you that got hermippos notice you do eh lets see it some people would try to sell me cow turds and call em wax no cow turds sostratos said here he took the lump out of the sack see for yourself hmm hmm hermippos looked pleased in spite of himself he reached out to feel of the beeswax as sostratos set it on the counter sostratos watched his hands in fascination he had long elegant fingers but they bore the scars of countless burns and cuts his palms were nearly as callused as those of a rower the pale blotches of burn scars went most of the way up his forearms hermippos nipped off a tiny piece of wax with the nails of his thumb and forefinger so he could taste it as well after smacking his lips he dipped his head yes thats the genuine article ive had people try to sell me tallow too the abandoned templerobbers i dont play those games sostratos said ill get the best price i can but i sell topquality goods ive never heard anybody who doesnt say that hermippos turned to his apprentice do something useful for a changegive me a chisel muttering the young man obeyed sostratos wouldnt have wanted to work for hermippos he also wouldnt have wanted to be hermippos in a sculptors studio working side by side with someone he constantly abused too many lethal implements were too handy what was to keep that apprentice from driving that chisel into his back or picking up a hammer and smashing in his skull only the fellows own selfrestraint and hermippos seemed to enjoy flaying that every time he opened his mouth the sculptor thrust the chisel into the beeswax again and again grunting with effort he finally grunted one last time and without a word of warning tossed the chisel back to the apprentice taken by surprise the fellow dropped it on his footfortunately not pointdown he yelped anyhow just be more careful next time hermippos snapped he gave sostratos another grudging dip of the head you didnt hide any rocks in there to make it seem heavier than it is no sostratos said i made the same check when i bought it from a phoenician you werent born a fool then hermippos raked his apprentice with a glance unlike some people i could name he took a deep breath all right rhodian youve got it i want it how much are you going to try to gouge me for four minai sostratos answered what hermippos howled why you cisternarsed dungeating catamite furies take you i could buy a slave for that maybe t should id get more use from him than i do from this twolegged donkey here he jerked a thumb over his shoulder at the apprentice sostratos sent the harried youngster a sympathetic glance the apprentices lips moved silently squeeze him he mouthed he needs the wax nothing on sostratos face showed that hed seen inside though he smiled hermippos bad temper was going to cost him money ill give you a mina and a half and you ought to be glad to get that much the sculptor growled no good day sostratos picked up the lump of beeswax and made as if to go he didnt miss the look of alarm that flitted across hermippos face well two minai hermippos said sostratos didnt put down the beeswax he started to walk away two and a half hermippos called sostratos kept walking all right three then the sculptor cried that was enough to make sostratos stop he ended up selling the wax for three minai seventyfive drakhmai when hermippos went to get the silver sostratos told the apprentice ill gladly give you five drakhmai for the tip come to the house of protomakhos near the theater i wish i could say i didnt need it but hermippos doesnt pay me well enough to make that anything but a lie the young man said ill be there i he broke off for hermippos came back with the silver just then sostratos carefully counted it but the sculptor hadnt tried to cheat him he headed back to protomakhos house well pleased with himself even if he was paying a small commission perfume from rhodes menedemos held up a jar in the agora what man could resist a woman who wears perfume from rhodes the island of roses fine perfume from rhodes plenty of people seemed able to resist his sales pitch they walked past as if he didnt exist hed seen that only in the very largest and most sophisticated poleis rhodes taras syracuse and now here in athens most places people stopped and listened to the pitch even if they didnt intend to buy what else did they have in the way of entertainment things were different here though athenians had more choices available than people in most towns did theyd seen too many men trying to sell too many different kinds of things unless they felt like buyingwhich no one at the moment seemed toone more didnt much interest them several of demetrios soldiers strolled through the agora looking now here now there they spoke a wide variety of greek dialects menedemos wondered how they understood one another one of them a handsome wellbuilt man in the early years of middle age broke away from his friends and came over to menedemos saying hail rhodian weve met before menedemos hated people who introduced themselves like that this fellow did look familiar but he snapped his fingers euxenides of phaselis he exclaimed recognizing the manhed taken euxenides from rhodes to miletos a couple of years before by the dog o best one so we have youre one of the best carpenters ive ever seen that steering oar you made what are you doing in athens making catapults thats what i do best euxenides answered ill tell you the athenians have junk too they wont though not when im through his greek though basically a doric dialect like menedemos held overtones of hissing and sneezing phaselis on the southern coast of anatolia was a town inhabited by both hellenes and lykians isnt a catapult a catapult menedemos asked all of demetrios soldiers laughed hear the civilian euxenides exclaimed a smile on his face no indeed my friend there are two main typesflexion machines which are bent like overgrown bows and torsion engines which use twisted skeins of hair or sinew for their hurling force torsion engines throw harder and throw farther but most of what theyve got here are the oldfashioned flexion type ill fix that by hephaistos if i can lay my hands on enough sinew that made him look worried then suddenly he pointed at menedemos youre a merchant you wouldnt happen to know who might have a supply would you sorry but no the rhodian answered if i wanted sinew though id go to a butcher or maybe to a priest after sacrifice about what i aim to do euxenides said did you stop just to say hail or can i really sell you some perfume menedemos asked if youve got a sweetheart or a hetaira you want to impress theres nothing better havent been in town long enough to latch on to a woman demetrios officer replied i like it here though i wouldnt mind settling down if i have the chance theyll never let you become a citizen theyre even fussier about that here than they are in most poleis menedemos warned euxenides of phaselis only shrugged i dont mind from what ive seen they treat resident aliens well here theyd bettertheyve got a lot of them i dont care if i can marry an athenian girl or not and i really dont care if i get to vote in the assembly his chuckle had a nasty edge besides who knows how long the assembly will stay in business this time around anyhow he could see that menedemos could see it too he wondered why the athenians couldnt see it for themselves theyd gone without democracy for only about fifteen years all told was that long enough to turn them into blind men and fools evidently euxenides said i owe you and your cousin a good turn you could have turned me over to ptolemaios men when you stopped in kos you likely would have picked up a nice little reward but you didnt do it so what can i do for you can you put our names in demetrios ear menedemos asked we still have some luxury goods he might fancytruffles from mytilene lesbian and byblian wine things of that sort if he gets any truffleflavored olive oil from demetrios of phalerons house the other demetrios bought that from us ill do it euxenides said at once my pleasure where are you staying at the house of protomakhos the rhodian proxenos a littlesouth of the theater its not hard to findat least not by the standards of this place oh yes euxenides dipped his head phaselis isnt easy for strangers either but phaselis is a little town you get lost here you can stay lost for days good thing my sense of direction works he turned to go farewell rhodian i wont forget to mention you to the big boss thanks menedemos hoped the soldier meant it too many people promised to do something like that and then forgot about it as soon as they turned a comer menedemos shrugged hed made the effort if euxenides delivered splendid if he didnt well menedemos and sostratos were no worse off after crying hisperfume in the agora till close to sundownand selling two jars to a greasy fellow who wouldnt say what he did but who looked like a brothelkeepermenedemos made his way back to protomakhos house the proxenos wasnt there which raised menedemos hopes of sneaking up to xenokleias room after dark but sostratos returned a few minutes after he did and protomakhos a few minutes after his cousin oh well menedemos thought sostratos looked pleased with himself ive been going through the polis talking with physicians he said sold a lot of balsam of engedi today eugeprotomakhos said euge indeed menedemos added how much more could you have sold if you didnt fritter away time talking shop with the physicians reddening sostratos said i learn things talking with them it doesnt cost a lot of time and one day i might help a sailor who gets sick or hurts himself he enjoyed playing the role of a physician aboard the aphrodite how much good he did was a different question but then how much good any physician did was often a matter of opinion fortunately most of the rowers were young and healthy and didnt need much in the way of medical care nothing wrong with talking shop protomakhos said ive picked up enough chatting with builders and sculptors that i sometimes think i could run up a temple or carve the cult statue to go inside it odds are im wrong but i do think so menedemos would sooner talk shop with hetairai sostratos said slyly id rather talk about their business than about the best cure for chilblains or hammertoes yes menedemos said if you dont think the one is more interesting than the other thats your affair theres a time and a place for everything sostratos said i dont think about piggies every moment of every day protomakhos wagged a finger at him id say youre too hard on your cousin o best one from what ive seen of menedemos he doesnt chase women every hour of the day and night like some men ive known a long long silence followed sostratos looked at the ceiling menedemos looked at the floor at last several heartbeats later than he should have sostratos said well you may be right im sure i am protomakhos to menedemos vast relief seemed to notice nothing amiss he went on i know how kinsfolk can be my brother and i still quarrel whenever we set eyes on each other and as for one of my brothersinlaw he rolled his eyes brothersinlaw oimoi by the dog yes sostratos exclaimed and started telling the proxenos about some of the things damonax had done and had wanted him to do protomakhos listened sympathetically and the awkward moment passed menedemos had never before been praised for his moderation with women by a man he was cuckolding hed thought he was hardened to most of the things that could happen but this embarrassed him it was like being praised for honesty by a man whose house youd just robbed three days later the rhodians and protomakhos were about to sit down to supper when someone pounded on the door whos that protomakhos said in annoyance whoever it is why did he have to pick now when i can smell the fish cooking some people have no consideration agreed menedemos whod been able to indulge his passion for opson no less than other passions and far more openly but instead of some bore who wanted to gossip with protomakhos menedemos thought of the athenian equivalent of his fathers longwinded friend xanthosit was euxenides of phaselis hail rhodians he said are those the best tunics youve got theyll have to do i suppose demetrios bids you to supper and im to take you there come along with me the both of you you kept your word menedemos blurted sure i did euxenides said you did right by me so the least i can do is right by you come on we dont want to keep him waiting lets go sostratos said just let me grab the truffles i still have euxenides impatiently shifted from foot to foot while sostratos did protomakhos said all that lovely opson and only my wife and me to eat it he didnt sound disappointed he sounded like a man with a godsgiven excuse to make an opsophagos of himself out the door euxenides of phaselis went the two rhodians in tow behind him though euxenides had been in athens only a few days he moved confidently through its labyrinth of streets when menedemos remarked on that the soldier shrugged and said i told you ive always had a good sense of direction after that menedemos waited for him to get lost but he didnt he brought the rhodians to a large house north of the akropolis hulking macedonians in full armor stood guard in front of the door one of them said something to euxenides menedemos couldnt follow it euxenides of phaselis not only did he answered in the same dialect the bodyguards stood aside as euxenides led the rhodians inside he remarked this is where demetrios of phaleron lived before he ah decided to move elsewhere wait here just a moment best ones a slave said in the entry hall he hurried away then returned all right come ahead as menedemos entered the courtyard he got a fleeting glimpse of a very pretty girl hurrying to the stairway he wondered just what she and demetrios had been doing beside him sostratos let out a warning cough menedemos sent his cousin a hurt look killing himself by jumping from a high place would end quicker and hurt less than letting the son of a macedonian marshal catch him sniffing after a mistress demetrios son of antigonos lounged on a couch in the andron with a cup of wine hail rhodians he said when euxenides presented menedemos and sostratos to him he was very large and very strong and up close perhaps the handsomest man menedemosa handsome fellow himselfhad ever seen as the rhodian had noted in the theater he had a man of actions thrusting chin with it went a voluptuarys widelipped sensual mouth a long straight nose and prominent cheekbones a mane of light brown hair and eyes green as marble forgive me for not rising he went on but im getting over a fever yes i saw her just now as she was going away menedemos said blandly sostratos coughed again this time in horror but demetrios threw back his head and laughed very neat he said thats the sort of crack my father would make his voice when he wasnt using it to fill the theater of dionysos was extraordinarily smooth and musical the gods had blessed him with all they could give a man he waved menedemos and sostratos to couches on either side of his own and euxenides to another a slave brought them wine i found several amphorai of thasian in demetrios of phalerons cellars antigonos son told them coming from the north myself im partial to northern vintages the wine was sweet as honeyso sweet in fact that menedemos wondered if it had honey mixed into it the vintners of thasos sometimes did that it was also neat sostratos said most noble one could we please have a mixing bowl and some water otherwise your men may have to carry us back to our hosts house demetrios laughed again as you wish though mixing wine seems as silly to me as drinking it neat does to you if i want water ill drink water if winewine some of one some of the other who needs that menedemos wanted to fuss at sostratos for acting like a little old woman he thought about continuing to drink his wine without added water that he feared would only make his cousin look worse and demetrios was a large man and used to neat wine menedemos himself was much smaller and used to drinking it mixed getting hopelessly plastered while his host stayed sober would do nothing to improve him in the macedonians eyes and so when sostratos mixed one part wine to two of watera little on the strong side no doubt in deference to demetrios but only a littlemenedemos sipped along with his cousin euxemdes of phaselis drank his thasian without water he was a soldier though and by now surely used to macedonian ways they chatted for a while demetrios had a lively wit and a giftif that was what it wasfor puns that made menedemos cringe and even forced a couple of groans from sostratos who was also formidable in such sports if you think im bad you should hear my father demetrios said with a reminiscent smile strong men run screaming when he gets startedyoud best believe they do his affection for antigonos seemed altogether unfeigned he was one of the most powerful men in hellasno in the whole civilized worldyet he remained fond of and obedient to his father to menedemos whod been striking sparks with his father ever since his voice began to change that seemed very strange as twilight thickened outside a slave lit more torches and lamps in the andron holding darkness at bay another slave carried in a tray piled high with some of the finest whitest loaves of wheat bread menedemos had ever seen they were still warm from the oven and so light and airy the rhodian marveled that they didnt float off the tray and hang in the air like dandelion fluff the olive oil in which the diners dipped their sitos was some of the truffleflavored stuff menedemos and sostratos had sold to demetrios of phaleron mighty fine euxenides of phaselis said ripping another loaf to pieces so he could soak up more of the precious oil it is isnt it demetrios son of antigonos agreed complacently the other demetrios bought it but im the one who gets to enjoy it the glow in his eyes showed how much he enjoyed it he seemed to enjoy everything that came his wayfood wine women acclaim and yet he was also a solid soldiermore than a solid soldierand had displaced his cousin polemaios at antigonos right hand he probably enjoyed soldiering too menedemos knew he was jealous he also knew how foolish such jealousy was a monkey could be jealous of aphrodite s beauty and it would do the animal no more good not only did demetrios have his multifarious gifts he also had the chance to make the most of them like almost all men menedemos needed to devote the larger part of his energy just to getting by from day to clay what he might have done got lost in what he had to do back in ioudaia sostratos had despised hekataios of abdera for being able to travel as he pleased and having the leisure in which to write history and for not knowing how lucky he was menedemos sympathy when he heard about that had been distinctly muted now though now he understood have you got more of this oil demetrios asked licking his fingers sorry but no menedemos said while sostratos whose mouth was full tossed his head menedemos went on your ah predecessor bought all we brought here demetrios of phaleron is a man of taste no way around that demetrios son of antigonos said clever fellow and a nice fellow too pity he chose the other side and not my fathers i wonder where hell turn up next and what hell do there as long as hes not working against fathers interests i wish him well he sounded as if he meant it menedemos doubted he could have been so dispassionate about an enemy but he hadnt heard too many athenians who truly despised demetrios of phaleron yes they were glad to see their ancient democracy restored though some of the decrees theyd passed made it look as if theyd forgotten the point of ruling themselves but the general opinion was that kassandros puppet could have been worse for a man whod ruled as a tyrant for ten years the verdict could have been far harsher having swallowed sostratos said we have no more oil o demetrios but we do have truffles from lesbos your cooks can shave them if you like and steep the shavings in oil or they can cook the truffles themselves if youd rather if id rather demetrios laughed another of his easy laughs dont you find in your households that the cooks think theyre the lords and everyone else their subjects mine certainly do myriads of soldiers jump to obey my orders but if i tell a cook to steam a fish and hes intent on baking it ill have baked fish for supper that night oh yes menedemos said my fathers cook has been squabbling with my stepmother ever since father remarried a few years ago my familys cook isnt quite so temperamental as menedemos sostratos said but there are times when he has a whim of iron no doubt about it after supper talk to my servants ill buy whatever truffles you have left demetrios said let the men know i want them youll get a fair price i promise now menedemos didnt look at sostratos still he was sure his cousin was as delighted as he was demetrios servants would have to buy after orders like that and would have to pay a price better than just fair demetrios was one of the richest men in the world to him a silver drakhma counted for less than a bronze khalkos did for most mere mortalshardly even small change more slaves brought in course after course of opson stewed eels steaks cut from the belly of a tuna roast dogfish there were also smoking beef ribs they obviously came from an animal butchered on purpose they werent the gobbets handed out at random after a sacrifice menedemos occasionally ate pork but he didnt think hed had deliberately butchered beef before maybe his surprise showed on his face for demetrios said we macedonians live lives closer to those of homers heroes than most hellenes do were meateaters for we have broader lands on which to pasture cattle i wasnt complaining most noble one menedemos replied is that cumin in the sauce he smacked his lips tasty i do believe it is and black pepper from arabia too demetrios said after the ribs came fruit candied in honey and a cheesecake similarly sweetened a splendid supper sostratos said we thank you for your kindness my pleasure demetrios smile fairly glowed he had charm no doubt of that after a sip from his cup of wine he went on and where does rhodes stand amidst all the confusions of the world thats taken shape since alexander died it seemed nothing but a casual friendly question menedemos answered it the same way were neutrals and happy to be neutral we have no quarrel with anyone euxenides of phaselis spoke up the rhodian certainly speaks the truth for himself and his cousin demetrios they carried me the same as they would have carried one of ptolemaios men a couple of years ago good thats good demetrios smile remained charming but he went on what was true a couple of years ago could be less true now though and it isnt easy to stay neutral when one is a small polls in a world of large powers what had he almost said kingdoms none of alexanders squabbling marshals claimed a crown for himself though all of them were kings in everything but name so long as we do business with everyone and so long as we stay free and autonomous well hold on to our neutrality sostratos said oh yes so long as demetrios voice also stayed silkysmooth but when you do the bulk of your business with one fellow well naturally your other neighbors wonder just how free and autonomous you truly are athens after all claimed to be free and autonomous before i liberated her rhodes did much more business with ptolemaios egypt than with the lands of any other marshal including antigonos and antigonos lands were near neighbors to rhodes menedemos didnt care for the turn the conversation had taken especially since he doubted whether athens was any freer or more autonomous now than before her liberation sostratos said surely most noble one you cant be thinking of rhodes why weve built ships for your fathers fleets if that isnt how a proper neutral behaves i dont know what would be just so menedemos beamed across demetrios couch toward his cousin nobody could match sostratos when it came to bolstering arguments with good solid facts his cousin was so logical so rational disagreeing with him seemed impossible and demetrios didnt disagree with him smiling still antigonos son said i do hope you can see my friends that free and autonomous poleis like athens and rhodes can sometimes need protection against those who would try to force them into leaning in an unfortunate direction not being an athenian i would not presume to speak for athens sostratos said as far as rhodes goes since only we rhodians choose how we lean or if we lean the question doesnt arise i certainly hope it never will demetrios said that could be very unfortunate indeed was he giving them a warning it sounded like one menedemos said im sure all my fellow rhodians will be glad to know of your concern oh good i hope they are demetrios turned his head and shouted for more wine out it came that splendid thasian thick and sweet and potent even when mixed no one worried about anything as abstract as neutrality for the rest of the evening sostratos was haggling over the price of balsam of engedi with a physician named iphikrates when the front door to the athenians house opened and his slavehe seemed to have only one led a moaning man his face gray with pain and one hand clasped to the other shoulder into the courtyard he hurt himself the slave said in bad greek yes i see that iphikrates said and then to sostratos excuse me o best one well get back to this in a bit of course sostratos answered do you mind if i watch he was no physician and never would be but he was avidly curious about matters medicaland because that made him the closest thing to a healer aboard the aphrodite the more he learned the better not at all iphikrates turned to the patient what happened to you my shoulder the man said unnecessarily he went on i was repairing a roof and i slipped and i fell and i grabbed at the edge of the roof with one hand and the arm tore out of the socket iphikrates dipped his head yes i would have guessed at a dislocation by the way you carry yourself this is something i can relieve my fee is four oboloiin advance patients once treated have an unfortunate tendency toward ingratitude the injured man took his hand off his shoulder and spat little silver coins into it here he said fix it it hurts like blazes thank you very much iphikrates set the coins on the stone bench where sostratos was sitting he called to his slave fetch me the leather ball seuthes i bring him the slaveseuthesducked into the house returning a moment later with a small sweatstained leather sphere what will you use that for sostratos asked fascinated whos he he talks a little funny the patient said hes a rhodian iphikrates said while sostratos thought they can still hear that im a dorian iphikrates looked back to him youll see in a moment he told the man with the dislocated shoulder liedown here on your back if you please all right grunting his face twisting at each incautious movement the man obeyed what now he asked apprehensively take your other hand away yes thats good iphikrates sat down on the ground beside the patient seuthes handed him the leather ball he put it in the patients armpit and held it in place with his heel slipping his leg in between the other mans arm and his body then he grasped the mans forearm with both hands and jerked and tugged at the arm the patient let out what would have been a bloodcurdling shriek if he hadnt been gritting his teeth sostratos leaned forward on the bench to see better another jerk and twist another scream from the injured man this one less muffled i am sorry best one iphikrates told him i have to find the best angle to he jerked once more without warning in the middle of the sentence a sharp pop rewarded him the patient started to cry out again then broke off and sighed in relief instead iphikrates beamed there thats done it yes i think so the other man warily sat up as iphikrates took the ball and his foot away it still hurts but nothing like the way it did thanks friend my pleasure iphikrates sounded as if he meant it always good to get something i can cure for another four oboloi i can give you a dose of poppy juice to ease the pain his patient thought it over but not for long thanks but no thats almost half of what i make in a day ill drink more wine and put less water in it not being a macedonian he didnt even think about drinking his wine with no water at all suit yourself iphikrates said drink enough wine and it will dull the pain though not so well as poppy juke does i take it you dont want me to put that arm in a sling or to bandage it to your body so its less likely to pop out again you can put it in a sling for today if you like the injured man said im not going back to work now but if i dont go tomorrow how am i going to eat nobody will feed my family and me if i dont all right best one i understand thatwho doesnt iphikrates said but be careful with that arm and use it as little as you can for the next month or so you have to give the shoulder as much of a chance to heal as you can if you permanently weaken the joint and muscles it can start popping out all the time and then where will you be halfway to hades house the other man replied i understand you too buthe shrugged with his good shoulderi have to take the chance who can save money on a drakhma and a half a day he got to his feet iphikrates fixed him a sling from a length of cloth that looked as if it was hacked out of an old chiton the patient dipped his head thanks again doesnt hurt too bad my wife and son will be surprised to see me home so early farewell he walked out the door without a backwards glance turning to sostratos iphikrates sighed you see how it is here is a patient i can actually helpand any physician knows how many he cant help at allbut my treatment is likely to go for naught simply because the man cant afford to give the injured member proper rest if i had an obolos for every time ive seen that i wouldnt need to dicker so hard with you for id be rich you did very well there ive never seen that trick with the leather ball before sostratos said theres a physician on rhodes who uses an elaborate contraption with winches to fix dislocated joints oh yesthe skamnon iphikrates said some in athens use it too and charge extra for it i could but ive never seen that it works better than simpler methods or even as well as they do the point after all isor should behelping the patient not making yourself seem impressive it looks more like an instrument of torture than anything else sostratos said it isnt pleasant for the man whos strapped into it the physician said even so i would use it if i thought it gave good results but since it doesntno now where were we right at two drakhmai for each drakhmas weight of balsam sostratos answered i really cant go lower than that not considering what i paid in ioudaia and youll know most noble one if youve bought balsam of engedi before that you wont get a better price from anyone even a phoenician iphikrates sighed i wish i could call you a liar and a thief and beat you down some more for im not made of money myself but i have bought balsam before and i know youre telling the truth youre an odd sort of merchant you know most traders bluster and make claims i know to be false but you dont seem to you dont use the skamnon when you could sostratos said maybe we arent so different you would get a better price for your balsam from some of those who do the physician said by making themselves seem so splendid and so knowledgeable they extract bigger fees from their patients than i do but whether they seem knowledgeable or not they get no better results and as i say results are the point of the exercise i can make enough money to suit me at two drakhmai for each drakhmas weight sostratos said does it seem good to you to buy at that price it does iphikrates replied i will pay you twenty drakhmai for ten drakhmai by weight of balsam that will last me for some time perhaps even until i find another more or less honest merchant for which i more or less thank you sostratos said both men chuckled the rhodian went on youll have scales to weigh out the balsam oh yes iphikrates dipped his head i couldnt get by without them not with the remedies i compound i keep it with the medicinesthat room back there why dont you wait for me here for a moment ill get the silver and then well settle accounts certainly sostratos hid a wry smile iphikrates had called him more or less honest but wouldnt let him go unwatched into the room with the drugs sostratos wasnt offended some medicines were valuable even in small easytoconceal amounts iphikrates didnt know him well enough to be sure he wouldnt steal he wouldnt have let the physician wander unattended through the family warehouse either iphikrates returned with a fistful of silver come along he said he opened the door to let sostratos go in ahead of him after the bright sunshine of the courtyard the rhodians eyes needed a few heartbeats to adjust to the gloom inside his nostrils flared when he breathed in the room was full of scents spicy mint the sharpness of ground pepper the dark heavy odor of poppy juice delicate frankincense and bitter myrrh vinegar wine something that tickled the nose was that hellebore olive oil familiar from the kitchen and the gymnasion and others sostratos could not name the scales stood on a small table next to a heavy alabaster mortar and pestle and a bronze spoon sostratos sniffed again you must enjoy working here he remarked what why iphikrates frowned not following him the smells of course sostratos said oh the physician sniffed with the air of a man who hadnt for quite some time to me you understand theyre just the odors of work thats a shame isnt it here he set ten owls in one pan of the scale it sank down he handed sostratos the spoon put your balsam on the other pan till they balance as sostratos did the balsam of engedi added its own sweet fragrance to the rest of the odors in the room iphikrates smiled sostratos added a little more scraping the sticky stuff from the bowl of the spoon with his thumbnail down came the pan with the balsam he waited to see if he needed to put on a bit more yet but the two pans could hardly have been more even well judged iphikrates said he took the drakhmai off the scale and handed them to sostratos and here are ten more besides he added giving the rhodian the other coins as well i thank you very much and i you o best one sostratos replied i admire physicians for doing so much to relieve the pain and suffering that are a part of every life youre gracious rhodianmore gracious than my profession deserves i fear iphikrates said you saw me at my best a little while ago that man had an injury i know how to treat but if hed come to me coughing blood or with a pain in his chesthe set a hand on his heart to show what kind of pain he meantor with a lump in his belly what could i do for him watch him and take notes on his case till he either died or got better on his own as hippokrates did i couldnt cure him of any of those things or of a myriad more besides ive seen hippokrates writings sostratos said my impression was that he treated patients with all sorts of conditions he tried to treat them iphikrates answered whether his treatments did an obolos worth of good is liable to be a different story no man can be a physician without having his own ignorance shoved in his face a dozen times a day you have no idea how frustrating it is to watch a patient die from something that seems minorand that surely would be if only i knew a little more oh but i do sostratos said iphikrates looked dubious till he explained ive seen men aboard the aphrodite die of fever after belly wounds that looked as if they ought to have healed in a few days can you tell me why that happens no and i wish i could because ive seen it too the physician said life is fragile cling to it tightly for you never know when it may slip away with that reassuring piece of advice he sent sostratos on his way after the first meeting of the assembly the one that voted demetrios son of antigonos honors that might have embarrassed one of the twelve olympians menedemos didnt go back hed seen all he cared to see and more than he could readily stomach he would have expected sostratos to keep going whenever he could but his cousin also stayed away from the theater that one session evidently had been plenty for him too protomakhos on the other hand kept going whenever the assembly convened menedemos couldnt blame him for that he was after all an athenian he had an interest in the proceedings that the rhodians lacked he also had the right to speak and the right to vote one morning not too long after menedemos and sostratos sold demetrios their truffles protomakhos returned from the theater with the expression he might have worn if hed stepped barefoot into a big pile of dog turds right outside the house menedemos had come back from the agora to get some more perfume and was on his way out when protomakhos stormed in his hosts revolted look couldnt be ignored by zeus o best one whats wrong menedemos asked he didnt think protomakhos would look that way if hed just found out xenokleia was unfaithful but he wasnt sure to his relief the rhodian proxenos wasnt glowering at him protomakhos said you were there when demetrios first came into athens yes menedemos said simple agreement seemed safe enough you saw how we debased ourselves heaping honors on him and on his father yes menedemos said again and no doubt you didnt think we could sink any lower protomakhos went on he threw back his head and laughed shows what you know doesnt it oh dear menedemos feared he could guess where this was going what did stratokles do now it wasnt stratoldes the proxenos answered we have more than one flatterer in our polis arent we lucky he didnt sound as if he thought the athenians were lucky who then menedemos asked an abandoned rogue named dromokleides of sphettos protomakhos said sphettos is a village on the far side of mount hymettos here in attica hymettos has good honey sphettos has troublemakers this dromokleides proposed that demetrios be given the same honors as demeter and dionysos whenever he visits athens oimoi thats pretty bad menedemos said doesnt he realize theres a difference between being named after a god and being one yourself i can see why some people say alexander was a demigod look at everything he did but demetrios im sorry but no you have some common sense rhodian protomakhos said sadly thats more than i can say for the assembly you mean they passed this resolution menedemos said in dismay they certainly did protomakhos shouted for wine as a slave hurried to get some the proxenos turned back to menedemos im sorry best one but i have to wash the taste of this out of my mouth join me thanks i will i dont blame you a bit menedemos said and did demetrios look all shy and abashed the way he did when sostratos and i came with you he wasnt even there protomakhos replied dromokleides did it anyway i suppose demetrios will hear about it sooner or later when he gets out of bed with whatever woman hes got in there with him now menedemos remembered that pretty girl hed glimpsed when he and his cousin dined with demetrios but protomakhos hadnt finished as the slave came back with winehed included a cup for menedemos toothe rhodian proxenos went on that wasnt the only decree our new perikles passed today by the dog nonot even close he paused to let the slave pour the cups full the wine couldnt have been weaker than one to one the slave had done a good job of gauging his masters mood menedemos said do i want to know the rest probably not but im going to tell you anyhowmisery loves company protomakhos said theyre going to rename the month mounykhion demetrion in honorhonor haof the victory demetrios won at mounykhia theyre going to call the odd day between the end of one month and the start of the next that happens sometimes when you dont know just when the new moon istheyre going to call that a demetrion too and you know the dionysia you went to its not the dionysia any more by zeus from now on its going to be the demetria his larynx worked as he emptied his winecup then he filled it again menedemos sipped more slowly but he was hardly less troubled thats laying it on with a shovel isnt it he said i hope demetrios has the sense not to take any of this twaddle too seriously it he starts believing hes a god on earth well that wouldnt be so goodfor him or for anyone else demetrios had struck him as being on the vain side he was glad it was athens worry not his or rhodes you can see thatyouve got sense protomakhos said sostratos doesnt think so menedemos thought and neither would you if you knew xenokleia might be carrying my child since the proxenos fortunately didnt know that he continued i can see it too men like stratokles and dromokleides he tossed his head and i still havent told you the worst theres more yet papai menedemos said come on then let me hear it after ninetynine lashes whats the hundredth just so as part of an offering we athenians are supposed to consecrate some shields at delphi theres been a disagreement over how best to do it so dromokleides that worthless arselicker put forth a motion that the people of athens should choose a man who would sacrifice get good omens and then approach demetriosapproach the savior god is how the motion puts itand get his oracular response on how best to perform the consecration and whatever he says thats what athens will do and the motion passed someones probably busy cutting the letters into stone right now oh dear menedemos said again that wasnt enough oh my that wasnt enough either he finished his wine in a hurry and poured himself some more that might not have been enough either but it was on the right track we won at marathon protomakhos said bitterly we won at salamis we fought sparta for a generation i was just going from youth to man when we gave the macedonians all they wanted at khaironeia that would have been around the time you were born we lost but we fought hard we gave it everything we had even leosthenes stood up against the macedonians after alexander died and now this it makes you want to cry by his anguished expression he meant it literally menedemos set a hand on the rhodian proxenos shoulder im sorry best one he said on matters political he could and did sympathize with protomakhos times are hard nowadays furies take all the macedoniansdemetrios and antigonos kassandros lysimakhos ptolemaios polyperkhon all of them protomakhos burst out its the wine menedemos thought this is too strong a mix and its having its way with him but protomakhos didnt sound the least bit drunk as he went on this could happen to rhodes too you know if one of the marshals ever gets inside your walls youll bend over backwardbend over forwardto keep him happy too that made menedemos take a swig from the cup hed refilled he spat into the bosom of his chiton to turn aside the evil omen may that day never come he said if it did he feared protomakhos was right flatterers lived everywhere and none of the macedonian marshals with the possible exception of antigonoshad shown himself immune to praise we said the same thing rhodian dont forget that protomakhos replied what you wish for and what you get too often dont match he eyed the little jars of perfume menedemos had set down so he could drink some wine im sorry i burdened you with this go on back to the agora and make yourself some silver its all right menedemos said easily dont worry about it youve shown sostratos and me every kindness more than you know in fact the least i can do in return is lend an ear nice of you to say so protomakhos told him what i say is the two of you have been the best guests ive had since i became proxenos ill be sorry when you go back to rhodes and youre welcome in my home any time thank you very much menedemos took a long pull at his wine to help hide any blush he might be wearing he wasnt immune to embarrassment hearing such praise from a man whose wife hed bedded made him feel foolish not to mention guilty but showing what he felt would only land him in trouble and what protomakhos had to say then would be anything but praise for now the rhodian proxenos remained oblivious i tell you only what you deserve he said menedemos finished his wine took up the perfume and left protomakhos house in a hurry he didnt want to betray himself and he didnt want to lacerate his conscience any more either as he threaded his way through athens twisting streets toward the agora he wondered why it troubled him it hadnt during his affairs in halikarnassos and taras and aigina and any of several other towns why here why now youve been listening to sostratos for too long and hes finally started rubbing off on you but menedemos tossed his head it wasnt that simple and he knew it part of it was that hed come to know and to like protomakhos which he hadnt with any of the other husbands hed outraged part of it was that he remained unsure how much of what xenokleia said about protomakhos was true and how much invented to spur on her new lover and part of it was that seducing other mens wives was a sport that was starting to pall the thrill of sneaking into a strange bedroom seemed smaller the risks seemed bigger and hed come to realize that what he got from the women while better in its way than what he got in a brothel wasnt exactly what he wanted or wasnt all of what he wanted maybe i need a wife the thought so surprised him he stopped short in the middle of the street a man behind him who was leading a scrawny donkey loaded down with sacks of grain or beans let out an indignant squawk menedemos got moving again his father had started talking about looking for a bride for him up till this moment he hadnt taken the idea seriously himself and father has the woman i really wantand i think she wants me menedemos muttered under his breath for the past several sailing seasons hed done his best to leave thoughts of baukis behind when rhodes dropped below the horizon some things he would not do no matter how tempting he hoped he wouldnt anyhow he wondered why she drew him so she wasnt spectacularly beautiful even if she did have a nice shape the only thing he could think of was that hed got to know her even before he first found her attractive shed been a person to him a person he liked and then hed noticed her sweet hips and rounded bosom considerably sweeter and more rounded now than when shed come into the household as a girl of fourteen he whistled tunelessly could that make such a difference maybe it could here was the agora hed got to it without noticing the last half of his journey he tried to put baukis out of his mindtried but didnt have much luck he made an unhappy noise down deep in his throat even he knew how dangerous falling in love could be and it would have been dangerous even if she werent his fathers wife like any hellene he reckoned falling in love a disease it was in many ways an enjoyable disease but that didnt improve the prognosis of course the prognosis for anyone who fell in love with his stepmothereven if she was years younger than hewas bad the hurlyburly of the market square came as a relief with people chattering and chaffering all around him menedemos couldnt keep his mind on his own worries somebody said i wonder how the world could have existed before demetriozeus created it i suppose all our ancestors were just figments of his imagination figsucking figments somebody else replied and added another obscenity on top of that menedemos laughed not all the athenians were impressed with what the assembly had voted then that was a good sign he almost paused to talk politics with the men whod jeered at the latest decree then he decided to keep walking instead for he realized they likely wouldnt want to talk to him not when his accent proved him a foreigner the instant he opened his mouth a man could say things to his friends that he wouldnt to a stranger someone was selling garlic in the place where menedemos had been selling perfume that made him laugh again unlike sostratos who was given to prolonged sulks menedemos had trouble staying gloomy for long he found another spot one not far from the statues of harmodios and aristogeiton in the middle of the agora most athenians believed the two young men had liberated them from tyranny a couple of centuries before from what sostratos said that wasnt how things had really happened even nitpicking sostratos though couldnt deny that what people believed often helped shape what would happen next fine rose perfume from the island of roses menedemos called for this as opposed to politics his doric drawl was an asset he held up a perfume jar in the palm of his hand who wants sweetsmelling rhodian perfume as usual all sorts of people came up to him and asked how much the perfume cost also as usual most of them retreated in dismay when he told them and some of them got angry when they found out a woman whod brought a basket of eggs into the city from a farm or a village out beyond the walls exclaimed how dare you sell anything that expensive how do you think it makes people who have to worry about every obolos feel that she was there and unveiled and sunbrowned and wearing a tunic full of patches and mends said she was one of those people shrugging menedemos answered in the fish market some people buy eels and tunny and mullet others buy sprats or saltfish some people wear golden bracelets others have to make do with bronze as soon as the words were out of his mouth he wished he hadnt chosen that example the woman with the basket of eggs wore a bronze necklace the day was warm and the cheap piece of jewelry had left a green mark on her sweaty skin but her reply took a different tack but theres something for poor people there anyhow where can i find perfume somebody like me could buy nowhere all i can do is envy the fancy whores who get it he shrugged again what could he say to that she wasnt wrong before he found any words she turned her back and strode away in magnificent contempt he bit his lip he couldnt remember the last time a mere womanespecially one he wasnt beddinghad made him feel ashamed im allowed to make a living too he muttered but because the aphrodite carried only luxury goodsthe most profitable sorthe dealt for the most part with rich men and the occasional rich woman he and sostratos were rich themselves or rich enough he too often took for granted the life he led he never had to worry about where his next meal was coming from or to agonize over whether to spend an obolos on food or rent neither did anyone he knew even the family slaves had enough but life wasnt so simple wasnt so pleasant for most hellenes if it had been they wouldnt have had to buy sprats for opson when they could afford anything better than olives or a little cheese they wouldnt have worn clothes as sorry as that eggsellers they wouldnt have exposed so many infants and they wouldnt have been so thin she rubbed my nose in whats real the rhodian thought ruefully and it doesnt smell anywhere near so sweet as my perfume but if he didnt sell that perfume he would find out what being poor was likefind out from the inside and so he went back to calling out its virtues and before too long a man whose double chin and bulging belly said he didnt have to worry about hunger bought three jars two for my hetaira he said winking and one for my wife to keep her sweet youre a fellow who knows how to handle women o best one menedemos replied partly a merchants flattery partly one man talking to another the plump athenian who had a slave following him like a dog didnt haggle very hard over the price he didnt have to worry about every obolos either drakhmai rang sweetly in menedemos hands as the other fellow paid him the athenian strutted off his slave who hadnt said a word all through the dicker carried the perfume the rich man would have lost dignity if hed been seen carrying it himself the woman with the basket of eggs hadnt been shy about carrying it herself but then she didnt have so much dignity to lose menedemos made another sale not long before he would have gone back to protomakhos house the day turned out to be quite nicely profitable and yet as the sun sank down toward the pnyx and he did head back to the proxenos home he found himself less happy than he would have liked sostratos ran his tongue over his lips savoring the sweetness of what hed just eaten that may be the best honey cake ive ever had most noble one he told protomakhos my compliments to your cook very fine indeed menedemos agreed myrsos is a fine cook id be the last to say otherwise protomakhos replied still i dont think this cake would have turned out so well anywhere but athens the clover honey from mount hymettos is the best in the world youve mentioned it before i certainly wont quarrel with you not after tasting it menedemos said delicious yes sostratos snapped his fingers do you know my dear we could get a good price for it back in rhodes his cousin dipped his head youre right we could not only that we should do you recall who sold you this honey sostratos asked protomakhos looking faintly embarrassed the proxenos tossed his head im afraid i dont youd do better to ask myrsos he buys the food along with cooking it as long as he doesnt bankrupt me i give him free rein a sensible attitude menedemos said if you have the silver why not eat well that sounded very much like him though sostratos wondered whether his fathers second wife would agree by what menedemos had said shed locked horns with the cook at his house more than once but then his cousin surprised him by adding the ones i feel sorry for are the people who cant afford fine opson or good wine or honey like thisand there are so many of them sostratos sometimes worried about the plight of the poor too but he hadnt imagined theyd ever entered menedemos mind protomakhos said that is too bad for them but i dont know what anyone can do about it neither do i menedemos said no one seems to want to do much of anything theyre only the poor after all sostratos scratched his head such pungent sarcasm wasnt his cousins usual style at all what had happened to turn his thoughts into such channels sostratos didnt want to ask in front of protomakhos but his bump of curiosity itched since he was also curious about hymettos honey he went into the kitchen to talk to myrsos the lyclian cook was munching on a piece of honey cake himself he looked not the least bit abashed other slaves might have their rations carefully measured outthough protomakhos like sostratos father wasnt that strictbut cooks always ate at least as well as the men they served myrsos proved less informative than sostratos would have liked i bought it from a woman in the agora he said she had a big pot of it and the scent told me it was good im sorry but i dont know her name sostratos didnt want to wander the agora sniffing one pot of honey after another he deplored inefficiency his nose might also prove less sensitive less educated than myrsos the cook evidently knew just what he wanted in honey sostratos didnt he took a couple of oboloi out from between his teeth and the inside of his cheek like anyone else hed mastered the art of eating without swallowing his small changethough hed heard of a miser whod poked at his turds with a stick to get back an obolos that accidentally went down his throat anything else you can recall about the woman the rhodian asked holding out the spitshiny coins no myrsos said regretfully which made sostratos think him honest i will say though that physicians often use honey in their medicines to hide the nasty taste of herbs and such you might ask one some will use the cheapest of course but others will want to have the best thats a good idea sostratos said and gave him the money he went back to iphikrates house the next morning the man had bought the best balsam he might well use the best honey too hail best one iphikrates said i just prepared a firstrate salve for hemorrhoids lucky you sostratos murmured theres no part of the body that cant go wrong the physician said what brings you back here have you figured out some new way to pry silver out of me i warn you it wont be easy i havent got a whole lot more to spend as a matter of fact no sostratos answered i was wondering if you use hymettos honeyand if you do from whom you buy it ah iphikrates dipped his head now i understand yes i do use hymettos honey it costs more than honey from other places but the flavor is worth it so you think its worth exporting too do you if i can get a decent price for it sostratos said who sells it to you a fellow named erasinides son of hippomakhos iphikrates answered he keeps bees over by the mountain and doesnt come into the polis all that often you can either wait for him and hope he does or else go out and pay a call on him if you go youll want to take some people with you to carry back the jars of honey or else hire a donkey oh yes the rhodian said with a smile i do know something about that iphikrates chuckled i suppose you might probably more fun than making a salve to smear on somebodys poor sore prokton too i hope you dont use honey from hymettos in that sostratos said well no the physician replied not much point to it although considering how some people who come to see me get their hemorrhoids never mind sostratos said hastily iphikrates laughed out loud sostratos went on tell me whereabouts along the mountain this erasinides lives id rather not spend hours wandering the slopes calling out his name he made iphikrates repeat the directions several times to be sure he had them straight as in any city plenty of men in athens hired donkeys by the day sostratos arranged that afternoon to pick one up early the next morning for an extra couple of oboloi the athenian who owned the animal agreed to let him use some baskets with lids he could tie down and enough rope to lash them to the donkey im used to tying knots aboard ship sostratos said this will be something different youll manage the man with the donkey sounded confident of course he sounds confident sostratos thought he wants to make sure he gets as much money out of me as he can the rhodian took the donkey as the sun was just beginning to touch the buildings on the akropolis the owner even helped him fasten the baskets to the animal when he tugged at the lead rope the donkey brayed out a complaint but it came along it kept complaining all the way through the city and out into the countryside sostratos grew sick of its bellows and brays he thought about whacking it but feared that would only make it louder so he refrained a man leading a quiet donkey from mount hymettos toward the city grinned at him as they passed and said enjoy your songbird thanks sostratos answered sourly the horrible noise spoiled his delight in what would have been a pleasant walk mount hymettos lay about thirty stadia southeast of athens an hours journey with the donkey being obstinate and loud it seemed three times as long to sostratos he hardly noticed the fine warm morning the neat vineyards the olive groves with fruit steadily ripening the watered garden plots full of every sort of vegetable as the road began to climb the donkey complained more and more finally even sostratos a patient man had had enough he picked up a stout branch that had lallen from an olive tree broke off a few twigs and whacked the branch into the palm of his hand the donkey was far from young it must have seen that gesture before for it suddenly fell silent sostratos smiled he kept on carrying the stick the donkey kept on being quiet by what iphikrates had said erasinides lived about halfway up the mountain not far from the marble quarries that were hymettos other claim to fame sostratos looked for a herm cut from red stone at a crossroads and let out a sigh of relief when he spotted the pillar with hermes face and genitals carved on it up this road to the left he told the donkey it didnt like going up but the threat of the stick kept it from making a big fuss faint in the distance the sound of picks clanging on stone came to the rhodians ears someone shouted sostratos couldnt make out the words but recognized the tone that was a boss giving workers orders some things didnt change no matter where you were or in what trade even in ioudaia where the very language was different people in charge sounded just as peremptory just as impatient as they did in hellas brush and scrub lined the trackit hardly deserved the name of road any more every now and then it opened out to show a farm the farther away from the main road out of athens sostratos got the smaller and meaner the farms seemed the rhodian wondered how many generations of men had worked them as many as there are he thought no fewer bees buzzed at first sostratos hardly noticed when he did he grinned he took them as a sign hed come to the right place he also wondered what nectar they found to sip in this sunblasted summer when most of the fields and meadows were yellow and dry something he supposed or the bees wouldnt have been out at all another shabby little farm this one with only a tumbledown ruin of a barn just a couple of stadia to go to erasinides placeif im on the right track i think i am zeus i hope i am and then sostratos forgot about bees about honey about erasinidesabout everything except the hound baying like a wolf as it loped toward him it wasnt much smaller than a wolf either and no tamer the donkey let out a squealing bray that sostratos forgave it jerked the lead rope out of his hand and started to run the dog though paid no attention to it the dog wanted sostratos maybe it thought he was coming to rob the farm or maybe it simply craved the taste of human flesh he wouldnt have been surprised not with those great yellow teeth and that wide red slavering mouth if he ran like the donkey the hound would pull him down from behind only his certainty of that kept him from turning and fleeing instead he set himself hefting the stick hed picked up to beat the donkey one chance he told himself thats all i get baying the dog sprang at him he swung with all his mightand caught it right on the end of the nose those fearsome deepthroated howls changed as if by magic to yips of agony here you polluted monster sostratos shouted see how you like it he walloped the hound again this time in the ribs now yelping the dog ran from sostratos faster than it had run toward him now furious he ran after it when he saw he wasnt going to catch it he bent down picked up a rock and threw it it caught the dog in the rump and brought forth another shrill howl of pain here now what do you think youre doing a farmer came out of the house brandishing a staff driving away your godsdetested hound sostratos picked up his stick again he was angry enough to be ready for a fight if the other man wanted one thats what you get for letting the monster run loose if it comes at me again on my way back to athens ill kill it plenty of men were fiercer than he but he was larger than most and only half the age of the farmer whose scraggly hair and beard were white the man shook a fist at him but then retreated into his dwelling the dog peered out from the ruins of the barn it didnt seem to want to have anything more to do with the rhodian that suited him down to the ground he went back after the donkey which had moved faster without his guidance than it ever had with it it didnt seem to think him a hero for driving off the dog instead it might have blamed him for bringing it near the hound in the first place on he went up the western slope of mount hymettos is this the farm of erasinides son of hippomakhos he called to a man chopping weeds with a mattock the farmer jerked his thumb up the road next farm uphill stranger on the lefthand side of the track thanks sostratos plodded on so unhappily did the donkey erasinides farm was noticeably greener than the ones hed been passing he soon saw why a spring bubbled out of a cleft in the rocks a few cubits from the farmhouse channels led the water here and there sostratos knelt by the stream to wash his head and hands take a drink and water the donkey as he got to his feet drops dripping from his beard a stocky middleaged man came out of the barn and said hail friend do something for you are you erasinides sostratos asked the farmer dipped his head sostratos gave his own name and said the physician iphikrates tells me he buys his honey from you id like to do the same iphikrates is a good man he doesnt think he knows it all the way some physicians do erasinides said where are you from friend to speak such an interesting greek sounds like the doric bits you hear in tragedy im from rhodes sostratos answered he knew his accent had been heavily influenced by attic he wondered what erasinides would make of the way menedemos spoke do you have honey for sale oh yes but the athenian seemed in no hurry to haggle nine ships from rhodes under tlepolemos he murmured not quite quoting the iliads catalogue of ships but showing he knew it did rhodians speak oddly then too do you suppose i dont know best one sostratos answered erasinides plainly wanted to chat before getting down to business rustics often did we think our accent the usual one you know and everybody elses strange is that a fact erasinides laugh showed that if it was a fact it was an amusing one must come of being a long ways off from athens i expect with athens present prominence he had a point but he was the sort who would have said the same thing had he lived up in thessalia which had its own backwoods way of speech sostratos said custom is king of allpindaros poetic truth quoted by herodotos bees buzzed around a patch of clover next to erasinides barn pointing that way sostratos asked do you gather your honey from wild bees or do you keep your own hives oh i have my own erasinides replied collecting wild honeys like trying to build a house out of driftwoodyoull come up with some but never enough to suit you do you get stung when you take the honeycombs sostratos asked the farmer dipped his head now and again i wear a petasos with the thinnest veiling i can get to keep em off my face past thathe shruggedi pick the stings out and i go about my business they dont much bother me some folk arent so lucky i had a neighbor a fellow named ameinokles whod wheeze and gasp and have trouble breathing whenever he got stung you had a neighbor sostratos said thats right erasinides dipped his head again it happened once too often poor fellow his throat closed up and he strangled to death you might say sostratos wondered what iphikrates could have done about that nothing all too likely as erasinides had said the physician didnt try to hide his own ignorance sostratos said do you put the honey in jars all the same size oh yes i didnt used to but its better for business when i do i buy lekythoi from a potter i know i can get em cheaphe makes lots of oil flasks because people always need em either to hold olive oil at home orthe fancy glazed onesfor funeral offerings i dont buy those on account of they cost more how much for a jar sostratos asked twelve drakhmai that wasnt far from what the rhodian had expected over an hour or so pausing for politics and women and bees and wine and mean dogs and whatever else came to mind he haggled erasinides down to eight drakhmai the lekythos he paid in shiny athenian owls the farmer made it plain he had no use for perfume or balsam or anything else the aphrodite had brought to athens erasinides helped him pack the lekythoi into the baskets on the donkeys back and gave him straw to stuff between them to keep them from breaking thank you kindly the farmer said as he left you rhodians seem a goodly folk even if you do talk funny on the way past the farm with the fearsome hound sostratos gripped his stick tightly the dog didnt bother him he kept going down off the mountain and back toward the whirl that was athens wait a minute menedemos said isnt demetrios already married the man whod given him the news a sausageseller named kleon dipped his head thats right he said he married phila a long time agoantipatros daughter you know the one whod been married to krateros before he had an engagingly ugly face which he now twisted into an engagingly lewd leer but shes a lot older than demetrios and antigonos had to talk him into marrying her for the sake of her blood and her connections this time maybe he wants to have some fun all through the athenian agora people were buzzing with the news he certainly does like to have his fun menedemos said that little call he paid to have fun with whatshernamekratesipolis almost cost him his neck by the dog he thought isound like sostratos demetrios is too wild even for me who could have imagined that he went on so who is this new woman eurydike you said her name was thats right my dear kleon answered her bloods as blue as the sky shes descended from miltiades the hero of marathon she used to be married to ophelis the king of kyrene west of egypt but she came back to athens after he died phila kratesipolis and now eurydike menedemos said musingly demetrios must like widows well they already know how kleon leered again you dont have to teach em the way you do with maidens besides its not like demetrios is going to be faithful to this one any more than he has to any of the others no i suppose not menedemos said he sure hasnt up to now he remembered the pretty girl hed glimpsed at demetrios house demetrios could do anything he wanted menedemos sighed that sounded marvelous kleon said i just wonder if hes going to be cheap about it or if hell throw a feast and sacrifice animals and give away meat and wine like most of the athenians menedemos had met he kept his eye on the main chance as now he thrust his tray at menedemos asking you going to buy something or are you just going to stand around and gab here menedemos handed him an obolos kleon gave back a sausage link it was so full of garlic and fennel menedemos needed a couple of bites to be sure it was made from pork if the meat wasnt so fresh as it might have been the spices kept him from noticing sausages kleon shouted after sticking the coin in his mouth get your sausages demetrios gives his to eurydike but ive got sausages for everybody menedemos snorted no wonder aristophanes had written a sausageseller into his knights the only thing redeeming kleons vulgarity was that he seemed as unaware of it as a dog licking its privates he went on crying his wares and making crude cracks about demetrios wedding a good many athenians laughed too and several of them bought his wares holding up a little jar of perfume menedemos called fine scent from rhodes eat kleons sausages and dont stink afterwards kleon shot him an obscene gesture with a laugh he returned it the rhodian soon went back to his usual sales pitch the other made a good joke but wasnt likely to draw anybody who could afford the perfume too bad he thought he kept on calling a couple of women and one man stopped and asked him how much he wanted for the perfume when he told them they beat hasty retreats as did most wouldbe customers the man proved abusive menedemos gave at least as good as he got as he had with kleon a man selling wine by the cup strolled through the agora on a warm day like this he did a brisk business menedemos waved to him and spent another obolos the wine was a long way from the best the rhodian had ever drunk but hed expected nothing better no one sold ariousian or thasian or lesbian for an obolos this cooled him and quenched his thirst which was all hed had in mind another woman came up to him she wasnt far from his own age and wasnt badlooking slim darkhaired brighteyed with fine white teeth he smiled and said hail my dear how are you today well thank you she answered her greek though fluent had an accent that proclaimed it wasnt her native tongue menedemos hopes soaredthat probably meant she was a slave perhaps the slave of someone prosperous she asked for how much are you selling your perfume when he told her she didnt flinch all she said was can you come with me to my mistress house that depends menedemos said who is your mistress and can she afford to buy she can afford to buy the slave woman said gravely her name is melite and she is not the least renowned hetaira in athens im sure shes the honey of the city menedemos said the slave began to nod agreementagain proving herself not a hellene by birthbut then made a face at him he gave back an impudent grin the hetairas name sounded like the word for honey will you come melites slave asked again id love to menedemos answered the woman sent him a sharp look he stared back as innocently as if the remark couldnt have been taken more than one way after a moment she shrugged and started out of the agora scooping up the perfume jars on the hardpacked ground by his feet menedemos followed melites house was nothing special on the outside but hellenes no matter how prosperous didnt make a habit of displaying what they had the more they showed off the likelier someone was to try to take away what theyd worked so hard to get the man who opened the door for the slave and menedemos wasnt so ferociouslooking as the kelt who served menedemos earlier customer but the rhodian wouldnt have cared to quarrel with him his broad shoulders and thick arms said he could take care of himself in a brawl and his flat nose said hed been in a few in his time he and the slave woman exchanged a few words in a language that wasnt greek the way he looked at her told menedemos not to bother her in his sight the woman went upstairs even in a house melite owned she lived in the womens quarters she came downstairs with the slave veiled as if she were altogether respectable but just for an instant the breeze blew the veiling aside menedemos exclaimed in surprise oк you were at demetrios when my cousin and i came to supper thats right melite dipped her head you didnt see me for long then or now no i didnt menedemos smiled his most charming smile but i remembered you youre worth remembering i thank you for saying so to menedemos disappointment the hetaira sounded more amused than impressed she went on i hope you will not be angry when i tell you one of the things i have seen is that menespecially young menwill say almost anything if they think it will give them a better chance to take a woman to bed i dont know what youre talking about menedemos answered deadpan the slave woman snorted her mistress laughed out loud with a bow to melite menedemos continued my dear one of the things you will also have seen is that telling the truth often works best i was telling the truth when i said i recognized you so you were melite didnt give him another glimpse of her face she used the veil as a hoplite used a shield interposing it between his eyes and her features leaving him guessing about what she was thinking he believed her voice still held amusement when she said whether you recognized me or not though you need to understand i am not looking for a new friend i have as many as i care to im sure you do if you can count demetrios among them menedemos spoke as if her warning bothered him not in the least that too was how the game was played no matter how he spoke though he couldnt help remembering that when sostratos sold koan silk to a hetaira in miletos a couple of years before shed paid him silver and given him herself menedemos didnt care to think his bookish cousin could outdo him with women he didnt care to think it but here it might be true melite said demetrios plays with women the way a child plays with soldiers carved from wood because he is who he is he can do that but no woman would put up with it from an ordinary man menedemos drew himself up to his full height which was considerably less than demetrios godlike stature if you were to know me you would find i am no ordinary man either oh would you also give me golden bracelets and necklaces and rubies and emeralds for a single night the way demetrios did melite asked backtracking menedemos answered i didnt claim i had demetrios money but i would give silver in due measure and i would give you something i daresay demetrios didnt would you the hetaira said and what is that joyshe cocked her head to one side studying him he could feel her eyes even if they remained indistinct behind the veiling you are brash she said menedemos bowed again though he wasnt sure shed paid him a compliment she went on one of the things a hetaira does not do is talk about her friends that is how and why they stay friends with her hetairai as menedemos knew perfectly well were no more immune to gossip than any other people still he didnt really care to learn how demetrios reverenced aphrodite he was more interested in paying his own respects to the goddess but when melite said is it not true that you came here to sell me perfume not yourself he decided he wouldnt worship aphrodite in her company a grin let him put the best face on it he could my dear i would never be so rude as to charge you for that he said both the hetaira and her slave laughed then menedemos held out a jar of perfume for this on the other hand let me smell it she said he undid the stopper and handed her the jar she sniffed that is sweet she admitted returning it to him what is your price for the perfume i mean not for anything else when he told her she gasped in artfully simulated anger thats robbery your slave didnt think so when i told her the same thing in the agora menedemos replied what does a slave know melite said with a scornful toss of her head the glare she aimed at the barbarian woman said her slave should have known enough to keep her mouth shut the slave looked as if she wanted to vanish into thin air melite gave her attention back to menedemos anyhow thats much too much im not made of silver ill give you half of what you asked no menedemos shoved the stopper back into the jar you will have bought perfume before im sure you know what its worth and what perfume is finer than essence of rhodian roses melite sent him a sly sidelong look half what you asked thenand what you asked for earlier with real regret he tossed his head im sorryi am sorrybut no business is business and pleasure is pleasure and i would be a fool to mix them im not just in business for myselfi have my cousin and my father and my uncle to think of how would i explain the owls i ought to have gambling losses she suggested with the air of a woman whod made such suggestions many times before you can always explain such things if you use a little wit who would know but menedemos answered i would melites shoulders slumped ever so slightly the rhodian went on family counts for more than half an hour of fun family lasts his lips quirked again family youre stuck with if you say so melites tone showed she had a different opinion she pointed to the perfume what i say is you still want too much she named a new price higher than her first offer but still much lower than menedemos no he repeated i didnt give you a price much too high to begin with i can haggle well enough when i need to but i dont always haggle for the fun of it im no phoenician ive told you what i need if you dont feel like paying it ill go back to the market square maybe i should have taken you to bed at the start melite said thoughtfully then you might not have been so stubborn she came up again now menedemos moved down just a little he had left himself some room to maneuver he sold her four jars of perfume at a price as good as hed got in athens melite went upstairs for the money herself she didnt trust the slave woman to bring it she gave menedemos a mix of coins from all over hellas a mix that said not all her friends were athenians some of the coins were lighter than the athenian standard others like the turtles from nearby aigina were heavier overall he thought it evened out sostratos would probably have insisted on finding a scale and weighing every drakhma and tetradrakhm from other poleis menedemos didnt intend to bother melite spoke to her slave who carried away the jars of perfume shed bought to menedemos the hetaira said now i can smell like roses the rest of my life may it be long he answered politely have you a sack i can use to carry this silver back to the rhodian proxenos house where im staying of course melite called after the slave woman telling her to fetch one then she said for someone like me i wonder whether long life would be gift or curse why would you want to die menedemos asked in surprise youre young youre beautiful youre healthy and you cant be poor if you just spent so much money on perfume but when i get older when my looks fade melite sounded genuinely worried i bought the perfume because i think it will earn me more in the long run but if i dont get rich now what will i do if im still alive in twenty years i wont be able to do this anymore men wont want me maybe someone will marry me but more men make promises to hetairai than ever keep them i dont want to end up a washerwoman or something like that fretting over every obolos and going hungry half the time in your trade no one will care if you go gray or get wrinkled me its a different story she wasnt the first woman menedemos had heard who was alarmed about losing her looks hetairai though depended on theirs more than most women even so looks werent all that counted for them he said if you sing well if you quote from poetry and plays if you make men feel good about themselves while theyre with you all that will stave off the evil day it helps melite agreed still though if a man has a choice between a sweet young thing who can sing and quote and do everything else a hetaira should do and a dumpy older woman where will he go that works for me now but ive seen women who were famous once trying to sell themselves to slaves for a couple of oboloi so they could buy sitos she shivered death is better than that i think menedemos thought of his father and uncle who no longer put to sea they werent sitting around waiting for death to overtake them though they were still busy with the family firm but melite was right what they looked like had nothing to do with how well they could carry on briefly menedemos wondered what he would be like if he reached his fathers age he felt his imagination failing the only thing be was sure of was that he wouldnt be eager to go to his tomb he didnt think melite would either no matter what she said now here came the slave woman with a cloth sack menedemos dumped the silver into it he dipped his head to melite farewell and to you she replied i hope you go back safe to rhodes thanks he answered i hope you do well here i hope the perfume helps it willfor a while melite shrugged after that who knows the slave led menedemos to the door neither he nor melite said anything about her who worried over whether a slave did well no one doing well ever became a slave in the first place on his way out of melites home menedemos suddenly stopped so suddenly he might have turned to marble like a man whod seen medusas head so suddenly one foot stayed up in the air almost but not quite completing a step that last thought wasnt quite true if your polis fell anything might happen to you no matter how well you were doing anything at all sostratos went into the storeroom at the back of protomakhos house the room was nearly empty hardly any wine little perfume only a few jars of crimson dye and a few rolls of papyrus remained the silver he and menedemos had earned for their goods and die honey and other bits of merchandise theyd acquired here in athens already lay aboard the aphrodite sostratos smiled a slow pleased smile he knew what theyd spent he knew what theyd made he knew they would go home with a solid profit for this journey menedemos came in behind him perhaps to look things over too perhaps to make sure he wasnt someone else who aimed to pilfer what remained here over his shoulder sostratos said hail oh its you hail menedemos answered which showed what hed been thinking everything safe here safe enough sostratos said and it seems to me weve done about as much as we can do here in athens we arent likely to make enough from now on to cover the cost of our rowers day by day are you sure menedemos asked and then waved his hand forget i said that of course youre sure you dont tell me things like that unless youre sure you want to head back to rhodes then its earlier than i expected to leave which only means the weather is likely to stay good sostratos said dont you want to be somewhere else before demetrios starts wondering how much money weve made and whether he can get his hands on it he wouldnt do that were rhodians his father would skin him if he angered rhodes wouldnt he but conviction leaked from menedemos voice sentence by sentence when he laughed it was sheepishly who knows what demetrios might do if he set his mind toil thats how it seems to me too we have good reasons to go to the crows with me if i can find any good reason to stay sostratos said menedemos looked back over his shoulder no one from protomakhos household stood within earshot xenokleia menedemos whispered sostratos tossed his head any good reason i said if shes not a bad reason ive never heard one she wasnt bad at all his cousin said i still dont know if she was telling the truth about her husband but i dont much care either she wasnt bad there were times when sostratos could have gleefully strangled menedemos his cousin knew that and just as gleefully exploited it and so instead of losing his temper now sostratos reminded himself of that he said do you truly think the woman is reason enough to stay here when measured against all the reasons we have for leaving well no not when you put it like that menedemos admitted all right then sostratos said if were agreed ill go down to the harbor and bring back enough sailors to carry our leftovers to the aphrodite this has been a soft cruise for the men theyve been able to live it up as much as you can live it up on a drakhma and a half a day menedemos put in true but all theyve been buying are food and wine and women they dont have to worry about lodging or anything like that sostratos said im sure diokles will know which taverns they favor as sostratos walked between the long walls he kept looking back toward athens and the marvelous buildings on her akropolis he sighed hed done more than sigh after his father sent word he had to leave the lykeion and come home to rhodes hed wept bitter tears every step of the way down to peiraieus not now hed changed in the years since then he wasnt sure the change was for the better but he was sure it was real his visit to his old haunt his talk with theophrastos had shown him the life of the lykeion however marvelous hed thought it while younger didnt suit him anymore demetrios soldiers swaggered through the streets of peiraieus when the aphrodite first came to athens kassandros soldiers had done the swaggering aside from the master they served sostratos saw little difference between one set of macedonians and mercenaries and the other demetrios had proclaimed the liberation of athens and had even torn down the fortress of mounykhia to show he was serious but athenians still got out of the way in a hurry when macedonian soldiers came by so did sostratos he didnt want trouble with demetrios men no great warrior himself he knew what was too likely to happen if trouble somehow started he sighed again this time in relief when he reached the quays without hearing a shout of what do you think youre doing skinny or anything of the sort diokles waved as sostratos came up the pier toward him hail young sir the keleustes said youll be planning to sail soon wont you sostratos started how did you know that youve taken up just about everything we brought here to sell diokles answered by now youve had it a while either youve got rid of it all or else therell be some odds and ends left to bring back to the ship one way or the other whats the point to staying around any longer odds and ends it is sostratos said ill need some sailors to haul them here and then well head for rhodes the oarmaster dipped his head suits me i havent had much to do since we got here and im tired of sitting around and rusting i dont enjoy staying drunk for a week at a time the way i did when i was younger and i cant screw as often as i used to either im ready to go to sea he was so very ready he tramped up to athens himself with sostratos and some sailors and didnt complain about shouldering a carrying pole and helping to haul a jar of byblian back to the aphrodite most of the time that would have been beneath his dignity before sailing sostratos checked the silver stowed under the poop deck he smiled when he nished everything was as it should have been he was ready to see rhodes again tooand how better than coming home with a nice profit from his station on the raised poop deck of the aphrodite menedemos looked forward toward the bow are we ready he called to the rowers waiting at the oars no one said no two of the crewmen were athenians new men hired to take the place of a pair of rhodians whod fallen in love with women here and decided not to leave the newcomers had known enough to bring cushions for the rowing benches so they probably had a fair notion of what they needed to do menedemos eyes flicked to the quay yes the mooring lines had been loosed and brought aboard the akatos and yes the anchors were raised and stowed near the bow satisfied with the lastminute check he dipped his head to diokles the oarmaster raised his bronze square and the little mallet with which he hit it back oars he shouted and smote the square to set the stroke grunting the men at the oars got to work clang clang clang the first few strokes hardly moved the merchant galley menedemos had expected nothing different especially with the ships timbers heavy with seawater because she hadnt been dragged up onto the beach and dried out as diokles had been going to sea since menedemos was a little boy hed doubtless expected nothing different either he railed at the rowers anyhow come on you worthless lugs put your backs into it youre not lotoseaters any moreno more lying around or drinking or screwing and getting paid for it now youve got to earn your silver lets see you work by the dog little by little the aphrodite slid away from the pier picking up speed with each stroke as she backed out into the harbor menedemos glanced over to the quay again to make sure an irate protomakhos wasnt rushing up to scream adulterer at the last moment some women couldnt keep a secret neither could some men but menedemos chose not to dwell on that xenokleia though seemed to have stayed quiet long enough harborside loungers and sailors aboard round ships fishing boats and some of demetrios war galleys watched the akatos pull away from the quay menedemos caught diokles eye lets give them a little show shall we he said right you are skipper the keleustes knew what menedemos had in mind he raised his voice to carry all the way up to the bow at my order portside rowers keep backing oars starboard switch to normal stroke ready now menedemos helped the turn with the steering oars the aphrodite spun through half a circle almost in her own length so that her bow faced out to sea and her stern the quays she was leaving diokles ordered both sets of rowers to switch to normal stroke as the turn neared completion menedemos finished it with the steering oars alone and guided the merchant galley out into the saronic gulf a couple of men aboard one of demetrios sixes patrolling the harbor waved to the aphrodite complimenting her on a smart maneuver as soon as his course suited him menedemos took his right hand off the starboard steeringoar tiller and waved back one of those men wore an officers cloak praise from someone who didnt have to give it was doubly welcome well do better next time diokles promised and glowered at the rowers wont we he turned it into a threat im sure we will menedemos said the oarmaster played the villains role menedemos by contrast could be the easygoing one the one who sometimes took the edge off dioldes strictness he enjoyed that role more than he would have liked playing the harsh taskmaster himself the breeze came from off the land unbrail the sail and let it down from the yard menedemos said the sailors leaped to obey down came the big square sail brails and bracing lines cutting it into squares it flapped two or three times before filling with wind once it did fill menedemos took more than half the men off the oars even the ones who stayed at their benches didnt row they only waited to make sure the breeze didnt suddenly slacken the aphrodite wasnt in such a hurry that she needed to speed along under wind and oars both youre too cursed soft on them skipper diokles growled as he lowered his bronze square and mallet he looked back toward menedemos so the sailors couldnt see his face as he did so he winked menedemos couldnt smile back not without giving the game away to the men instead he glared at diokles much more severely than the remark really warranted the keleustes winked again to show he understood what menedemos was doing salamis and the crowded waters where great king xerxes fleet had come to grief more than a hundred seventy years before lay to starboard only a few fishing boats bobbed in the channel between the island and the mainland of attica today menedemos had no trouble filling it with triremes in his minds eye though neither xerxes sailors nor the hellenes they faced knew how to build anything bigger and stronger back in those distant days what a few fives and sixes might have done menedemos thought had he wanted to know more about salamis than he did he could have asked sostratos who was doing lookout duty up on the tiny foredeck his cousin would have quoted from herodotos and probably from aiskhylos persians as well not feeling like being overwhelmed menedemos didnt ask aigina a larger island rose from the water almost dead ahead the aphrodite had stopped at the polis there a couple of years before having seen it and having seen what sort of business merchants did there menedemos didnt care to pay a second visit beyond aigina blued and blurred by haze and distance lay the northeastern corner of the peloponnesos menedemos was contentmore than contentto let it stay in the distance he pulled the steeringoar tiller in his left hand toward him and pushed the one in his right hand away the aphrodite swung gently to port heading along parallel to the coast of attica which ran generally south and east toward cape sounion mild chop in the saronic gulf made the merchant galley roll a bit menedemos wondered if his cousin would lose his breakfast after a long spell ashore but sostratos seemed fine a handful of sailors did lean over the rail to feed the fish including one of the newly hired athenians the rest of the rowers ribbed the men with touchy stomachs there were always some in every crew menedemos enjoyed the motion hed had enough of steady ground under his feet he wanted to be reminded he was aboard a ship going out to sea again felt good he drew in a great lungful of fine salt air wonderful to get the city stink out of my nose he said thats the truth diokles agreed im sick of smelling shit the breeze freshened the sail thrummed taut with wind the aphrodite skimmed over the sea a long creamy wake trailed out behind her and behind the boat she towed menedemos took the last rowers off the oars when the wind pushed her along like this he didnt have to worry about anything more with a wind like this at her back even a round ship performed respectably of course a round ship trying to make her way up to athens had to tack against the wind and had a sorry time of it the long sleek merchant galley arrowed past a couple of those unfortunates who had to make reach after sideways reach to go a little distance forward even if we were heading the other way we could fight through the wind menedemos said for a while anyhow diokles said you go straight into the teeth of a stiff breeze for too long though and youll break your rowers hearts menedemos dipped his head the keleustes was right an akatos could do things a round ship couldnt hope to all the same a captain who thought the men at the oars were made of bronze like the legendary talos and so would never tire was doomed to disappointment if not to danger the sun slid across the sky the wind never slackened glancing now and then toward the coast of attica to port menedemos marveled at how fast it slid by ahead the saronic gulf opened out into the broader waters of the aegean the three westernmost islands of the kyklades lay to the east keos kythnos south of it and seriphos farther south still a sailor took sostratos place on the foredeck menedemos cousin came back toward the stern he climbed the steps up to the poop and stood a couple of cubits away from diokles where do you aim to stop tonight he asked menedemos normally id say keos or kythnos menedemos answered with this wind with this wind im tempted to see if i cant make seriphos that wouldnt be a bad days run would it no but sostratos sounded less than happy whats the matter menedemos asked if we put in at kythnos we might pick up some cheese there sostratos said we could sell it for a profit in rhodeskythnian cheese is famous all over hellas hmm menedemos considered well all right my dear well do that then he said were not in any enormous rush to get home and seriphos isnt anything much its so rocky people say the gorgon looked at it thats because its connected with perseus sostratos replied its supposed to be where he and his mother danae washed up after akrisios her father put them in a big chest and set them afloat and hes supposed to have shown the gorgons head there too and turned the people to stone its also supposed to be a place where the frogs dont croak menedemos said we wouldnt have heard them at this season of the year anyhow sostratos said which was true he went on and we cant sell frogs croaking or otherwise or chunks of rock good cheese on the other hand i already said yes menedemos reminded him he changed course a little till the stempost covered the island of kythnos from where he stood now im aimed straight for it are you happy im positively orgiastic o best one sostratos answered youre positively sarcastic is what you are menedemos said sostratos dipped his head that was something he could hardly deny the wind held all day the aphrodite raced past the tiny islet of belbina which lay eighty or a hundred stadia south of cape sounion a few sheep ambled over belbinas steep meager fields except for a shepherd or two the island was uninhabited kythnos still lay dead ahead in weather like this sailing was joy not drudgery rowers hung fishing lines over the side of the ship some of their hooks baited with bits of cheesecheap cheese every so often one of them would let out a yip of triumph and haul in a flying fish or a sea bream or a goby something he could cook over a charcoal brazier and enjoy for his opson kythnos swelled ahead it was greener than seriphos to the south but not much sheep and goats wandered the hills in back of the islands one small town which faced west back toward attica and the peloponnesostoward civilization menedemos thought unkindly kythnos the town boasted no developed harbor a visiting ship could either beach herself nearby or anchor in front of the town at menedemos order the anchors splashed into the sea after so long immersed the aphrodite wouldnt gain much from a night or two out of the water once back in rhodes she would come out of the sea till spring all yours menedemos told his cousin heres to cheese when sostratos listened to the people of kythnos talk the next morning he felt as if hed somehow traveled back through time they spoke attic greek but a very oldfashioned attic saying es for eis into xyn for syn with and any number of other things that had vanished from the speech of athens itself more than a hundred years before hearing them he might have been listening to aiskhylos had aiskhylos chosen to talk about cheese and the sheep and goats from whose milk it was made he supposed the kythmans spoke that way because even though they were only a days sail from athens not many ships bothered coming into the harbor here the locals were isolated from the wider world if change came it came only slowly a breeze from off the mainlandnot so strong as the one that had driven the aphrodite here but still brisk enoughruffled sostratos hair as he made his way toward the agora after athens kythnos seemed ludicrously small it might have been a toy town made for children to play with that didnt keep him from getting lost once there were enough houses to box him in to where he wasnt sure whether he needed to go right or left to find the market square and he guessed wrong he had to give a man with several missing front teeth an obolos for directions and then had to ask him to repeat himself for his dialect and the missing teeth made him hard to understand in the agora people displayed fish and woolen cloth and cheeses the fish were for other kythnians the cloth struck sostratos as nothing special the cheeses the cheeses were as fine as kythnos reputation would have led him to believe than which there was little higher praise and the prices proved amazingly low sostratos had to work to keep astonishment off his face when a fellow whod piled wedge after wedge of delicate creamy goatsmilk cheese on a little table behind him asked no more than a rhodian cheesemaker would have for something only a quarter as good the local an anxiouslooking man with large rabbity eyes and a wen on one cheek took his surprise for anger rather than delight i can come down a little best one the man said hastily even before sostratos made a counteroffer dont go away please sostratos collected himself well all right he said as if he didnt really want to stay maybe i wont as long as youre reasonable i can be very reasonable sir very reasonable indeed the cheesemaker replied he meant it too sostratos was almost embarrassed to haggle with him it felt like stealing from a helpless child sostratos knew he could have forced the kythnian lower than he finally did he didnt have the heart to do it he consoled himself by thinking he would still make a good profit on the cheese even if he bought it at this slightly higher price another man two stalls over sold a sharp crumbly sheepsmilk cheese for prices similarly small again sostratos could have bargained harder he knew menedemos would have squeezed every obolos possible from these men scorning them for fools because they didnt understand how splendid their cheeses were dickering with some merchants even most merchants sostratos bargained as ferociously as he knew how phoenicians athenians that truffleseller up in mytilenethey were all out for themselves just as he was these men though they seemed pathetically grateful that he would give them any silver for their cheeses owls the man with the crumbly cheese murmured almost in awe when sostratos paid him arent they pretty most of the time you know we just swap stuff back and forth amongst ourselves i get me a few owls though and who knows i may even go across to atticahe didnt say to athens which might have been beyond his mental horizonand and buy things thats what money is for sostratos agreed it is isnt it to the kythnian it seemed a new idea a karian farmer a hundred stadia from the nearest tiny town could hardly have been more distant from the kind of trading sostratos did than was this fellow hellene only a long days sail from athens the beating heart of the civilized world suppressing several sighs sostratos went on through the agora his only problem was choosing the best of the best one man gave him a sample of a hard yellow cheese that made him raise his eyebrows i dont think ive ever tasted anything quite like this he said i wouldnt be surprised o stranger the kythnian said with modest prideno one here seemed to display more than modest pride its made from cows milk really sostratos said and the cheesemaker dipped his head how unusual few hellenes especially south of boiotia whose very name was associated with cattle kept cows sheep and goats were far more common for they were valuable for their wool as well as for their milk do you like it the local asked its not bad sostratos answered no matter how pitiful he thought the kythnians he couldnt make himself sound too enthusiastic what do you want for a wedge he wasnt surprised when the cheesemaker named a price higher than any of the others had given him another reason few cows dwelt in this part of hellas was that they took more fodder for the amount of milk they yielded despite that for an exotic cheese like this what the kythnian wanted wasnt bad at all sostratos haggled a little harder than he had with the other men but only a little before long he and the cheesemaker clasped hands to seal the bargain i thank you very much the fellow said some of my neighbors think im daft for keeping a cow but i guess ive shown them maybe you have sostratos would never have let one relatively small sale go to his head like that but he was a rhodian used to dealing all over the inner sea to a kythnian for whom a major journey meant walking from his farm to this little townit surely didnt deserve to be called a polisshowing some drakhmai to his neighbors might be a triumph of sorts sailors from the aphrodite helped sostratos carry the cheeses back to the akatos one of them was teleutas with a sidelong glance sostratos way he said youd better get us back to rhodes in a hurry if you dont well eat up your profits the other sailors laughed sostratos didnt he knew teleutas better than he wanted to by the dog of egypt if even a crumb of cheese goes missing before we get home youll swim back to rhodes he ground out do you understand me easy young sir one of the other sailors said he was only joking teleutas grin didnt quite reach his eyes thats right he said nothings going to happen to them it had better not sostratos told him because im not joking an oppressive silence cloaked the working party till they got down to the beach even the men who rowed them and the cheeses back to the aphrodite noticed it somebody fart in somebody elses face one of the rowers asked when no one said a word as the boat glided toward the merchant galley you might say so moskhion teleutas answered yes you just might say so he eyed sostratos again smirking slightly sostratos glared back if we need another sailor in a hurry i expect we can find one even in a godsforsaken place like this he said moskhion looked horrified he said i wouldnt maroon anybody in this miserable dump if we had a thief aboard id maroon him anywhere sostratos replied moskhion shut up and started rowing again hed gone with sostratos into ioudaia the year before he couldnt very well forget the gold ring teleutas had stolen from a local there no one had ever provedno one had ever even claimedteleutas stole while aboard ship had that been proved or even claimed teleutas wouldnt have sailed with the aphrodite this spring he gave no more smirks now he looked out at the sea and at the akatos and said not a thing without a doubt that was the best thing he could have done had he given sostratos any more lip he would have gone out of the boat and into the water of the harbor sostratos had no idea whether teleutas could swim at the moment he was too angry to care when they came alongside the aphrodite the sailors in the boat passed chunks of cheese to the men in the merchant galley here well put them in leather sacks menedemos said weve got a good many left from the trip up to athens and theyll keep out salt water and vermin he grinned all the vermin that dont walk on two legs anyhow several sailors aboard the akatos laughed nobody from the ships boat did teleutas looked as if he were about to but he changed his mind even without a scowl from sostratos after all the cheese went onto the aphrodite sostratos and the sailors scrambled up over the rail and into the low waist of the ship his cousin waited till the two of them weremostlyout of earshot of the crew before asking whats wrong my dear you look ready to bite a belaying pin in two but i see you came back with plenty of cheese oh the cheese is fine the cheese is better than i expected it to be in fact sostratos said still seething but that polluted teleutas the story poured out of him he finished i wish he never would have come aboard the aphroditein the first place well unless he does come right out and steal were stuck with him till we get back to rhodes menedemos answered next year though tell him to go howl when he asks to go with us again by the dog i will sostratos said i wish i had this spring hes nothing but trouble even when he doesnt do anything wrong he always makes it seem hes just about to you have to keep an eye on him every minute many goodbyes to him then menedemos said well pay him off when we get home and thatll be the end of it when he comes around whining for work next spring tell him to bend over and i understand you thanks sostratos said hastily good thats settled then menedemos liked things neat and tidy he liked them that way so much he sometimes assumed they were when they werent here though sostratos agreed with his cousin menedemos asked anything else we need to do here on kythnos i dont think theres anything else to do on kythnos sostratos said ha wouldnt be surprised if youre right i know i dont want their water weve got enough and i remember how nasty and brackish it was when we stopped here a couple of years ago with polemaios aboard menedemos turned to diokles everybodys aboard and ready to row everybodys aboard skipper the oarmaster answered a few of the boys are still nursing headaches from too much wine but they can probably row sweatingll be good for em menedemos said with the airy confidence of a man who wasnt hung over at the moment lets get out of here then i dont think we can make paros with the daylight weve got left but we ought to get to syros without much trouble sounds about right diokles agreed he turned and started shouting at the crew they hurried to take their places at the oars and by the lines that would lower the sail from the yard rhyppapai diokles called rhyppapai rhyppapai the men began to row the aphroditemade her way out of the harbor sostratos was glad to go to menedemos every trading run every island every town seemed a new adventure sostratos liked the travel for what he could learn but there wasnt much to learn about kythnos and the more he saw of other places even athens and who could have imagined that the better rhodes looked rhodes was home and they were on their way menedemos swung the aphrodite to port kythnos was longer than it was wide to go east from the islands single town one had to round a headland at either the northern or southern tip of the island hed chosen the latter to catch the wind abeam the sailors swung the yard from the port bow back theyd started the motion only a heartbeat after he started the turn and finished it at about the same time he smiled to himself he hadnt even had to give an order pretty day diokles remarked as they swung past the headland and it was the sun shone warm and bright in the blue blue sky though it no longer stood so high as it had at the start of summer the aegean was a deeper blue or rather several deeper blues kythnos on the merchant galleys left hand added variety brown soil gray rock streaks of greenery amid sundried yellow other islands of the kyklades dotted the horizon everything from black rocks with the sea foaming around them good for nothing but tearing the bottom out of a ship that came upon them unawares to syros and paros and naxos in the east siphnos in the southeast and rocky seriphos and melos beyond it due south gulls and terns wheeled overhead skrawking and mewing they often attended ships what was garbage to men was opson to them an osprey folded its wings and plunged feet first into the sea two or three plethra from the merchant galley it came up again a heartbeat later flapping strongly to get back into the air its talons clutched a writhing fish when terns dive in gulls steal from them sostratos said but whos going to steal from an osprey no one in these waters by zeus menedemos answered i wonder what the fish was sostratos said i wonder if the bird chose it because it likes that kind of fish or just because it chanced to be swimming near enough to the surface to be seen menedemos laughed i wonder o best one if theres any limit to how many questions you can dream up if there is you havent touched it yet his cousin looked wounded whats wrong with curiosity where would we be without it wed be living in mud huts and trying to knock hares over the head with rocks thats where two more questions menedemos said even if you did answer one of them he wondered how angryand how entertainingsostratos would get at the tweaking he didnt tease his cousin as much as he had when they were younger sostratos had got better at holding his temper and so offered less amusement now he held it this morning saying i have one question more what difference does it make to you none really i was just curious menedemos made a face realizing hed delivered himself into sostratos hands thank you my dear you just proved my point for me sostratos could have said more and worse that was small consolation to menedemos what his cousin had said was plenty plenty to make his ears heat plenty to make diokles laugh softly for the next little while menedemos gave exaggerated attention to steering the shipwhich at the moment needed little steering hed lost the exchange he knew hed lost it and he hated losing at anything that hed lost it through his own foolish choice of words only made losing more annoying but he couldnt stay irked for long not with the breeze filling the sail and thrumming in the rigging not with the gentle motion of the ship and the soft splashing as the ram at her bow cut through the water not with thinking of the ram brought him up short serve out helmets and weapons to the crew diokles he said more pirates in these waters furies take em than fleas on a scavenger dog if they want us wed better make sure they get a hard fight since the akatos had had to fight off pirates each of the past two sailing seasons diokles couldnt very well disagree in fact he dipped his head and said i was going to do that anyway pretty soon before long with bronze pots on their heads and swords and spears and axes in their hands the men on the aphroditelooked piratical themselves the merchant galley was beamier than a pentekonter or hemiolia but the crews of fishing boats and round ships werent inclined to make such fine distinctions they never had been now though they fled with as much haste as menedemos had ever seen fishing boats smaller than the neat little craft the merchant galley towed behind her rowed away with the men in them pulling as hard as if they crewed a war galley charging into battle two different sailing ships heeled sharply to the south as soon as their sailors spied the aphrodite they wanted to get as far away from her as they could as fast as they could if standing behind the sail and blowing into it would help them go faster theyd do that too menedemos said with a laugh theyll be hours beating their way back up to their old course against the wind sostratos said too bad for them menedemos said hard to blame them sostratos said when taking chances can get you sold into slavery or murdered and tossed over the side you dont do it if we believed in taking chances we wouldnt have armed ourselves he wasnt wrong even so menedemos said you know there are times when you squeeze all the juice out of life there are times when i think you want just enough juice to drown yourself sostratos replied they scowled at each other menedemos yawned in sostratos face to show how dull he thought sostratos was sostratos turned his back walked over to the rail and pissed into the winedark sea maybe that was general contempt maybe he was getting rid of juice menedemos didnt inquire sostratos set his chiton to rights and stalked up to the foredeck back very stiff diokles clucked in distress the two of you shouldnt quarrel he said the ship needs you both he used the dual implying menedemos and sostratos were a natural pair menedemos was steering the ship he couldnt turn his back on diokles no matter how much he wanted to at the moment he would sooner have given his cousin a good kick in the fundament than been yoked to him in the greek language as part of a pair sanctimonious prig he thought for the rest of the day none of the sailors seemed to want to come near either him or sostratos the men walked on tiptoe as if the aphrodites planking were covered with eggs and they would be whipped if they broke one songs jokes the usual chatterall disappeared only the sounds of wind and wave remained the merchant galley had never been so quiet too stubborn and too proud to make any move toward sostratos menedemos stayed at the steering oars the rest of the day slowly slowly the island of syros drew near it was even more desiccated than kythnos the aphroditehad stopped here too a couple of years before menedemos remembered the verses from the odyssey wherein eumaios the swineherd praised the island from which hed come he also recalled sostratos comment that the praise proved homer a blind poet he angrily tossed his head he didnt want to think about sostratos at all doing his grim best not to he steered the merchant galley around the northern tip of the island which like kythnos was taller than it was wide and down toward syros town on the eastern coast the town sat inside the curve of a little bay the harbor was fine had the island of syros had more in the way of water and people and crops the harbor could easily have supported a real city as things were it mattered about as much as nice eyebrows on an ugly girl because only a few fishing boats and the occasional ship going from somewhere else to somewhere else used the harbor no one had bothered to improve it with moles and piers the aphroditesat in the bay a couple of plethra from the town her anchors plopped into the water to hold her fast by the sun an hour or so of daylight remained sostratos called for sailors to row him ashore where do you think youre going menedemos demanded theres a temple to poseidon here sostratos answered theres supposed to be a sundial in it made by pherekides who taught pythagoras it may be the oldest sundial in hellas while were here id like to take a look at it why are you planning to sail off without me dont tempt me but menedemos gestured gruffly toward the boat go on then be back by dark sostratos pointed to the handful of houses that made up the town if you think id stay there youre he broke off youre even stupider than i thought you were that was what hed been on the point of saying that or something like it menedemos resentment flared anew he conveniently forgot all the equally unkind thoughts hed had about sostratos on second thought stay away as long as you please he snapped he watched the boat take his cousin to the shore watched sostratos talk with an elderly local and take an obolos out of his mouth to give the fellow watched the graybeard point uphill and to the north and watched sostratos hurry off in that direction he also watched the men whod rowed sostratos ashore disappear into a wineshop skipper what will you do if the young gentleman has trouble diokles asked going off on your own in a strange place isnt always the smartest thing you can do how could there possibly be a problem menedemos answered sostratos seems sure its safe and he knows everything if you dont believe me just ask him diokles gave him a reproachful look most of the time the two of youhe used the dual again perhaps to drive home his point perhaps to annoy menedemoshave pretty good sense but when you dont you really dont most of the time he would have added something like meaning no disrespect today he didnt bother menedemos pointed to the boat which lay on the beach what am i supposed to do when thats there unfazed the oarmaster replied find some sailors who can swim and make sure theyre good and ready that made better sense than menedemos wished it did muttering under his breath he strode the length of the galley asking men if they could swim less than half the crew could which didnt surprise him though he knew how himself well wait till half an hour after sundown he said if sostratos isnt back by then but he was menedemos spied his long angular form with a curious mixture of resentment and relief after brief confusion when sostratos didnt see the sailors he went into the wineshop and brought them out they werent too drunk to row him back to the aphrodite and how was your precious sundial menedemos asked after his cousin scrambled back into the akatos it seemed remarkably like an old decrepit sundial sostratos looked and sounded sheepish eat some supper and then lay your old decrepit bones down on the planks menedemos spoke gruffly like a father annoyed at a wayward child that was how he felt again how sostratos felt about him never entered his mind resentment sparked in sostratos eyes but he seemed to decide he couldnt disobey sensible advice like that without looking a proper fool he wrapped himself in his himation before long he was asleep if he spoke very little to menedemos i dont much want to talk to him right now either menedemos thought just before sleep also overtook him sostratos looked down at the waxed wooden tablets on which hed kept the accounts of the trading run to athens as long as he paid attention to those he didnt have to worry about menedemos that at the moment suited him fine clang clang the keleustes bronze square beat out time for the rowers the wind had died the sail was brailed up tight to the yard the aphroditeglided east from syros across a deadcalm sea propelled by ten grunting sweating rowers on each side every other bench had a man in place sail ho called the lookout on the foredeck sail ho off the port bow that made sostratos look up from his accounts the lookout was pointing northeast sostratos stood up to see farther before long he spied the sail too he shaded his eyes with his hand to cut the glare from the morning sun nor was his the only head to swing that way after a few heartbeats a sailor said thats a round ship nothing to worry about he was right that huge sail and broad beamy hull could only belong to one of the merchantmen that hauled grain and lumber and cheap wine and oil and other bulk commodities around the inner sea the only way a round ship could endanger the akatos was by colliding with her once the sailors saw the ship to the northeast was no threat they went back to whatever theyd been doing sostratos was tired of going over the accounts he already knew them well keeping an eye on the round ship also let him avoid having anything to do with his cousin because the aphrodite sail was brailed up against the yard the round ships crew needed longer to spot her than they would have otherwise when they did they swung their bow away from her they couldnt very well run not on this windless day their ship would have had trouble outrunning a clam from his place on the poop deck menedemos said if i were ever tempted to turn pirate a time like this would do it that fat sow cant flee cant fight and cant hide shes just sitting there waiting to be taken i wonder how much loot shes got teleutas said wistfullyor was it hungrily sostratos couldnt tell though he was always ready to think the worst of the sailor menedemos spoke sharply were rhodians remember it we knock pirates over the head when we get the chance we dont play that game ourselves only kidding skipper teleutas said you were the one who brought it up you know and so menedemos hadbut hed made it plain he was talking about something contrary to fact he wasnt really tempted to turn pirate was teleutas sostratos wouldnt have been surprised but teleutas as usual had an excuse just plausible enough to keep him out of trouble sostratos stowed the account tablets in a leather sack then he went back to the poop deck hail young sir diokles said not changing his rhythm a bit as he beat out the stroke for the rowers menedemos didnt say anything he kept his hands on the steeringoar tillers and his eyes on the sea sostratos might not have been there but sostratos finally had something he could talk about without starting a fight that teleutas he said in a low angry voice he couldnt stand the sailor but was grateful to him in a curious way and sure enough menedemos dipped his head hes a piece of work isnt he he agreed you were right about that i wouldnt be surprised if hes been a pirate now and again neither would i sostratos said i will turn him away if he tries to sail with us next year suits me menedemos suddenly seemed to realize he was talking with sostratos instead of shouting at him he tried to glue the scowl back on his face but had less luck than he might have wanted instead he gave sostratos an odd grudging half smile hail hail yourself sostratos answered in those same grudging tones were stuck with each other arent we menedemos said we seem to be sostratos said if we were married we could divorce since were tied by blood well you said it we can make the best of it or the worst but we are stuck i saw you going over the accounts menedemos said sostratos dipped his head his cousin went on just how well did we do do you want it to the obolos or will the nearest drakhma do sostratos asked in turn if its to the nearest drakhma do you want it in athenian owls or shall i convert it to rhodian currency menedemos stared at him sostratos looked back deadpan menedemos took a hand from the steeringoar tillers to point an accusing forefinger at him oh no you dont you cant fool me you abandoned rogue you almost did but not quite youre having me on and im smart enough to know it sostratos named a sum in athenian drakhmai then he named a larger sum in lighter rhodian drakhmai he added that assumes we can convert currency without paying any fees the way we did in athens silver is silver no matter what the people who run a polis think if we do have to pay the fee what we make goes down by two percent in which case it would amount tohe named one more sumin rhodian drakhmai of course you arent having me on you couldnt be making that up now menedemos sounded uncertain for his part diokles looked as if he couldnt believe his ears go through the accounts yourself if you dont believe me sostratos said knowing menedemos wouldnt he couldnt resist adding another barb our fathers will of course so they will menedemos seemed disenchanted with that prospect too he said when we get back to rhodes were philodemos son and lysistratos son again one of the reasons i like going to sea is that i can be my own man away from rhodes not just my fathers son something to that i suppose but sostratos spoke more for politeness sake and to keep from starting another quarrel than from conviction his own father was more easygoing than uncle philodemos of that he had no doubt or that philodemos tried much harder to run menedemos life than his own father did with him still sostratos remained convinced menedemos would have had a smoother time of it if he didnt push back so hard against uncle philodemos hed tried saying as much now and again but menedemos as usual didnt want to listen i cant wait till next spring menedemos said now i want to get away to be free to be myself sostratos had never had any trouble being himself in rhodes if the number of wives menedemos had seduced in the polis was any indication he hadnt had all that much trouble there either one more thing his cousin wouldnt want to hear sostratos did say i can see why youre eager to be gone but im glad you dont sound desperate the way you did when we left rhodes a couple of years ago hed thought that safe enough no matter what hed thought he proved wrong without warning menedemos face turned into a slammed door sostratos cousin suddenly started talking in monosyllableswhen he talked at all for most of the next two or three hours he just kept quiet sostratos didnt think menedemos was angry at him again but menedemos was plainly angry about something partway through that unnerving silence sostratos asked what did i say that was wrong tell me what it is and ill apologize for it it isnt anything menedemos said tightly it isnt anything at all he wasnt telling the truth he didnt even come close to telling the truth that couldnt have been more obvious just as obvious though was that he didnt want sostratos poking and prodding at whatever he hid most of the time sostratos would have kept on poking and prodding anyhow being who and what he was he might not even have noticed that menedemos was holding something back after the quarrel with his cousin though he found himself more alert to menedemos moods and pushed it no further he did send an inquiring glance diokles way maybe the oarmaster had some notion of what was troubling menedemos but diokles after making sure menedemos wasnt looking at him only shrugged a tiny shrug maybe he knew and couldnt say with menedemos listening more likely sostratos judged he wasnt sure what troubled him either little by little as menedemos realized sostratos wasnt going to pry any more he came out of the shell into which hed retreated he smiled he laughed he cracked jokes but he gave no hint of why hed gone into the shell in the first place paros and naxos which lay side by side were the two largest and wealthiest islands in the southern kyklades they were both much better watered than the barren rocky islands farther west in the chain vineyards olive groves and fields of wheat and barleyfallow at this seasonflourished on them and they both enjoyed great mineral wealth too parian marble was famous all around the inner sea the stone of naxos had a smaller reputation but it was also quarried on the western slopes of the mountains that jutted up at the heart of the island menedemos brought the aphroditein at the polis of naxos on the northwestern coast the crew moored the merchant galley next to a round ship that was taking on blocks of marble bigger and heavier than a man could carry a wooden crane was carefully swaying them aboard the ship menedemos watched in fascination if the fellow in charge of the crane made a mistake or if a rope broke one of those blocks would tear right through the ships bottom it would end up on the floor of the harbor and the round ship would end up sunk easy easy the boss called to the workersprobably slaves straining at the capstan lower away a little more a little more hold on now once more a quarter of a turn there the block went down into the round ships hold sailors down below there must have freed it from the securing lines for one of them called up something to a man on deck who waved to the crane operator at his command the crane swung back to another block waiting on the quay its crew made the block fast before going any further the boss carefully checked the rope that would lift the chunks of marble that block could wreck the quay if it fell too or smash a man to a red rag only after the last block had swung into the hold did menedemos call euge to the man in charge of the crane thanks friend the fellow replied his shoulders sagged for a moment as he allowed himself a sigh of relief then straightening he went on and thanks even more for not bothering me when i was busy there youre welcome menedemos said i could see you needed to pay attention to what you were doing some people dont care by the dog a lot of the whipworthy rascals dont care anger blazed in the boss voice theyve seen you and that matters to them so of course the thickheads think it must matter to you too and if something goes wrong and you wreck a ship or crush a man what do they do they point and they gape and they laugh thats what to tartaros with all of them he spat on the quay more fire to him than i thought menedemos asked how did you get into your line of work about how youd expect i learned it from my father same as he learned it from his the naxian answered some of the things grandpa did and his father he tossed his head we know a lot more about pulleys now than we did a long time ago ill tell you that youre right menedemos gaze went to the top of the aphrodite s mast where a pulley block helped sailors raise and lower the yard little fishing boats still made the way they had been from time out of mind offered no such advantages aboard them raw muscle power was the only thing that counted good talking to you friend safe trip to wherever youre going with a wave to the rhodian the crane boss turned back to his crew at his shouted directions they broke the crane down into lengths of lumber and ropes and carried the pieces back into the polis of naxos menedemos hadnt realized the big impressive device was so easily portable i wonder how much a crane could lift sostratos said why didnt you ask the man in charge of that one menedemos said you seemed more curious than i was his cousin answered menedemos thought nothing much of that till he remembered how his complaints about sostratos unending curiosity had helped spark their quarrel he supposed he could have started another one if hed risen to the remark instead he answered watching somebody who really knows what hes doingno matter what it isis always a pleasure yes i think so too sostratos agreed are you planning to stay and do business here in naxos it would only be luck if we found anything worth hauling back to rhodes menedemos answered i do want to refill our water jars though this is the place to do it what weve got is hot and stale and hardly worth drinking and ive never heard of anybody coming down with a bad flux from drinking the water here the sailors he sent into town with the water jars laughedgiggled in factas they went some of them patted at their hair or dragged wood or bone combs through it carrying water was usually womens work that accounted for the sailors silliness hoping theyd meet pretty women at the wellhead accounted for their primping in due course the sailors came back with fresh water hail girls someone called from the waist of the aphrodite menedemos thought it was teleutas but he wasnt sure whoever it was he infuriated the men with the jars they didnt seem sure whod called out to them either which was probably lucky for him one of the watercarriers said go ahead and laugh you polluted catamite we saw real women honest women women who arent whores we didnt just see em either we talked with em and they answered back the other sailors with jars up on their shoulders dipped their heads in agreement menedemos didnt know how the jeering sailor felt about that as for him he was inclined to be jealous hellenes didnt get many chances to meet honest women to whom they werent related by the way the sailors acted theyd made the most of this one where will we pass the night tomorrow sostratos asked menedemos shrugged i was thinking of spending it at sea theres no good stopping place halfway between naxos and rhodes weve been this way before you know the choices as well as i dosome really miserable little islands he waited for his cousin to grumble and complain but sostratos only shrugged all right with me i dont mind a night on the planks especially when well probably be home for good the next night oh menedemos knew he sounded almost disappointed am i looking for another quarrel with sostratos he wondered i hope not home for good he tasted the words finding them not altogether to his liking i wont be sorry to sail away when spring comes back i dont suppose i will either sostratos looked west and a little northback in the direction of athens and yet he sighed visiting athens seeing it again after i had to leave reminds me that rhodes really is my home too late to make a philosopher out of me ive been chasing profit too long nothing wrong with profit menedemos said without it merchants couldnt operate and without merchants where are philosophers squatting there straining to take a shit thats where he wasnt sure whether aristophanes had said that about men who loved wisdom but it was something the comic poet might have said oh yes i had that same thought in athens though i didnt put it so elegantly sostratos said was that praise or was he being snide menedemos couldnt tell he wondered whether his cousin was sure with a shrug he clapped sostratos on the shoulder stuck with being a trader eh and stuck with being a rhodian well i suppose there are worse fates he could think of plenty of them what he didnt know was if any were better sailors who hadnt hauled water began clamoring to go into naxos unlike kythnos and syros this was a real city with plenty of taverns and plenty of brothels to choose from like an indulgent fathernot a breed with which he was personally familiarhe waved them away from the aphrodite some of them will come back to rhodes without an obolos to put in their mouths sostratos said shall i tell them not to drink and roister menedemos asked would they listen if i did i can think of more than one family back home that would thank you if you did but sostratos sighed that wasnt what menedemos had asked and he knew it with another sigh he went on no they wouldnt heed you thats too bad no doubt but i dont know what to do about it menedemos said as a matter of fact i was thinking of going into a tavern myself tonight you were sostratos sounded as if he were confessing to some particularly nasty vice by the dog why always a good idea to pick up some news of what lies ahead menedemos replied if pirates are out in force in the waters east of here id sooner find out in a wineshop than the hard way and besideshe grinned at sostratosim sick and tired of the wine weve got on board your second reasons a disgraceful excuse and i hope you know it his cousin said severely your first one on the other hand ill come with you two sets of ears might pick up something one misses they set out just before the sun dipped below the western horizon the twelve daylight hours shrank every day as summer waned while those of the nighttime stretched the wineshop they chose lay only a couple of streets in from the harbor a dried grape vine hung over the door said what kind of place it was so did the raised voices and discordant snatches of song floating out through the doorway some men hadnt gone to the tavern for gossip theyd gone to squeeze what merriment they could from wine menedemos and sostratos both coughed when they went inside torches filled the room with smoke soot stained the mud brick of the walls and the rafters above those torches oliveoil lamps on a few tables and on the stonetopped counter at the back of the room added the stink of hot grease to the smoke andmenedemos wrinkled his nosesomeone in the not too distant past had given back his wine that stink wasnt strong enough to drive the rhodians out of the tavern but it was there hail friends the man who ran the place had the falsely jovial air so many tavernkeepers assumed he was a scrawny little fellow with enormous ears when he didnt remember to smile and be cheerful his narrow face relaxed into what looked like a permanently sour expression menedemos had seen the like on other taverners on men who ran brothels and on those who made their living overseeing slaves this fellow put the smile back on and asked where are you boys from rhodes menedemos answered were on our way back there now from athens sostratos added wine the tavernkeeper said menedemos and sostratos both dipped their heads the naxian set two big deep mugs on the counter a round opening cut in the gray stone let him plunge his longhandled dipper into the amphora waiting below he filled the cups then held out his hand two oboloi each the rhodians paid menedemos sloshed out a small libation when he drank he sighed as far as the wine went he could have done better staying aboard the aphrodite he felt sostratos ironic gaze on him but refused to acknowledge it out of athens are you a grayhaired man with a big nose said whats really going on there we heard demetrios was out and then we heard demetrios was in somebody doesnt know what hes talking about thats plain there are two different demetrioi menedemos said thats right sostratos dipped his head demetrios of phaleron is out hes fled to kassandros and demetrios son of antigonos is in hes knocked down the fortress of mounykhia that kassandros men were using and hes given backhe says hes given backthe athenians old constitution is that whats happened no wonder i was confused the grayhaired man said menedemos was ready to take him for a fool but then a shrewd look crossed his face and he asked what have the athenians given him if hes given them their old laws now sostratos was the one who didnt want to go into detail theyve voted him many honors he said and would have let it go at that even here in the middle of the aegean he doesnt want to embarrass athens menedemos thought with amusement he didnt care if he made the polis theyd left look bad since he didnt he told the men in the tavern some of the sycophantic degrees the athenian assembly had passed some of them laughed the grayhaired man with the big nose said youre making that up theyd never sink so low this is athens were talking about not some miserable little polis in the middle of nowhere by zeus by athena by poseidon im telling you the truth menedemos said he is the melancholy in sostratos voice made him sound all the more convincing we were in the assembly with the rhodian proxenos when many of these decrees were proposed and we saw and heard them passed i wish i could tell you otherwise o men of naxos but to do so would be a lie menedemos thought such philosophicalsounding language would put the naxians backs up instead it seemed to impress them who wouldve reckoned the athenians of all people would turn out to be widearsed the tavernkeeper mutteredan epitaph for the polis if ever there was one the grayhaired man dipped his head thats right we didnt wiggle our backsides at antigonos like that when he brought is into his island league sure theres a cult for him on delos now but thats only polite these days the rest of the nonsense the athenians did pheu he turned away in disgust sostratos started to say something in response to that then visibly checked himself what could he say the naxian hadnt said anything he hadnt thought himself instead he gulped down his wine and shoved the cup across the counter to the taverner that worthy held out his hand not till sostratos paid him did he refill the cup hearing news like that out of athens makes me want to pour it down too the tavernkeeper said not that demetrios and antigonos are bad he added hastily after all they still ruled naxos but its a shame to see a city that was so great grovel like a cur dog grovel like a cur dog sostratos echoed bitterly and took a long pull at the wine hed just bought hes trying to make you want to get drunk menedemos said in a low voice hes doing a good job of it too sostratos said but he didnt upend the cup to drain it as fast as he could every so often his natural urge toward moderation served him well menedemos natural urges did not run in that direction as the captain of a merchant galley though he had to be prudent regardless of his natural urges he asked has anyone come into naxos from the east in the past few days what are things like between here and rhodes is it quiet or are pirates prowling the seas the grayhaired man spoke up again its been pretty quiet from what ive heard my brotherinlaws a fisherman and hes headed that way lately hoping for tunny he hasnt had a whole lot of luck with the fish but hes never said anything about spotting trouble on the sea thank you friend menedemos said ill gladly fill your cup for you again if you like the naxian dipped his head menedemos gave the taverner two oboloi the fellow plied his dipper the grayhaired man lifted the newly full cup in salute menedemos politely returned the gesture they both drank menedemos knew he wasnt sure to be safe on the way back to rhodes not till he came within sight of the polis but he was also glad to be sailing with good news and not into the teeth of bad peering east from the foredeck looking for the first sight of rhodes sostratos jerked as if stung ship ho he called urgently ship ho dead ahead i just see a hull and rowersno sail that meant or could mean trouble sostratos waved toward the stern to make sure menedemos had heard him menedemos waved back to show he had he ordered a full complement to the oars sostratos stared out to sea whatever the other ship was she was drawing closer in a hurry shed probably spied the aphrodites sail which sailors were now brailing upbefore anyone aboard the akatos noticed her that she was some sort of a galley had been plain from the moment sostratos set eyes on her the question now was what sort a hungry pirate ship would come bounding across the waves like that so would a rhodian war galley patrolling against pirates the aphrodites lean lines didnt fool only fishing boats and round ships which sometimes proved embarrassing still id rather clear things up with a rhodian war galley than fight off a hemiolia full of cutthroats sostratos thought he anxiously peered ahead so did all the sailors not straining at the oars suddenly painfully sostratos wished aristeidas still lived the lynxeyed sailor would have known exactly what to make of that other galley sostratos and the rest of the men with only average eyesight had to wait till she came nearerwhich meant till she became more dangerous if she was a pirate i think a sailor spoke hesitantly then with growing conviction i think shes showing three banks of oars sostratos squinted he pulled the skin at the outer corner of one eye taut closing the other that sometimes helped him see farther and more clearly sometimes the galley did have more than one bank of rowers did she have three i think youre right sostratos said after a few more heartbeats he let out a sigh of relief and the heartbeats after that didnt come faster on account of fear a ship with three banks of oars was bound to be a war galley not a piratical hemiolia or bireme he watched the sailors relax their grip on weapons too they wouldnt have to fight for their lives and their freedom today from the stern menedemos asked is that the dikaiosyne come to pay us another call the justice was the rhodian navys first trihemiolia an idea menedemos had had she was lighter and swifter than an ordinary trireme just as a hemiolia was lighter and swifter than an ordinary ship with two banks of oars both classes could quickly remove the thranite rowing benches aft of the mast and could stow the mast and yard on the decking where they had been after another glance across the narrowing gap of water sostratos tossed his head no he answered shes an ordinary trireme her mast was down but he could see that all three banks were manned from bow to stern ah well menedemos said one of these days id like to take a trihemiolia out and see what she can do seems only fair when there wouldnt be any if i hadnt thought of them the officer whod captained the dikaiosyne had done so not least because he was rich enough to have the leisure to go piratehunting without needing to worry about making a living here for once sostratos fully sympathized with his cousin just as having to work for a living had kept menedemos from command of a trihemiolia so it had kept sostratos himself from finishing his studies at the lykeion i am what i am now and ive made the best of it he thought but still i persist in wonderingwhat would i have been what would i have become if i could have stayed an officer in a red cape strode up along the triremes deck to the bow he cupped both hands in front of his mouth and shouted across the blue sunsparkled sea ahoy there what ship are you were the aphrodite out of rhodes and bound for home sostratos shouted back the aphrodite eh tell me what firm you belong to and where you were headed when you left this spring we sail for philodemos and lysistratos sostratos answered reflecting that rhodes wasnt too big to keep everyone from knowing everyone elses business and we went to athens were on our way back from there now you do know demetrios antigonos son has run demetrios of phaleron and kassandros garrison out of athens yes weve heard that the officer said as his ship came up alongside the aphrodite sostratos spied her nameiskhyspainted above one of the eyes at her bow strength was a good name for a war galley thanks to the triremes greater freeboard the rhodian officer could peer down into the merchant galley you havent got much aboard there whats your cargo well weve got honey from mount hymettos and cheeses from kythnos sostratos told him mostly though were bringing back a fine crop of athenian owls youll change them back to rhodian coins of course the officer said of course sostratos agreed hoping he wouldnt have to he would rather have seen the two percent rhodes took on changed money go into the coffers of the firm of philodemos and lysistratos safe journey back to rhodes the man on the iskhys said sostratos waved his thanks thinking the trireme would go on its way but before it did the fellow added ill check with the customs men to make sure you got back all right he waved to his keleustes who got the war galley moving again as she glided away the stench from her rowers who worked in the closedin area below the deck filled sostratos nostrils but the stench from the officers words revolted him even more the man had sounded polite enough but what he meant was that he would check up on the aphroditeafter the iskhys got back from her patrol and that meant sostratos would have to change his money or some large part of it or else face endless trouble from the rhodian authorities two percent of the grossa considerably larger part of the profithad just taken flight would you come back here my dear menedemos called he sounded polite too but sostratos wasnt deceived his cousin left most of the financial arrangements to him but menedemos wasnt altogether ignorant of the way money worked he couldnt be not if he wanted to make a living as a merchant he knew what the conversion fee would do to their profits what was i supposed to tell him sostratos asked as soon as he ascended to the poop deck he could see we werent carrying wine or oil or statues or slaves or anything of the sort hed figure out we had silver instead cursed moneychangers are worse than vultures menedemos grumbled they sit behind their tables and flick the beads on their countingboards with eyes cold as winter i dont think theres one of them who has a soul and theyll try to steal more than two percent if we dont watch them like hawks too ill watch them sostratos promised i know their tricks no false weights no thumbs on the scales none of their games i promise thats better than nothing menedemos tone suggested it wasnt good enough he didnt snarl at sostratos the way he might have but he didnt sound delighted either since sostratos himself was less than delighted he couldnt blame his cousin menedemos went on hide as much of the silver as you possibly can if were paying two percent on part of it thats better than paying two percent on all of it i already thought of that sostratos said good i wasnt sure you would sometimes youre more honest than you need to be im honest with our customers especially the ones we deal with year after year sostratos said as far as im concerned thats only good business it also fit who he was but he didnt make that argument menedemos would have jeered at it he did add anyone who lets the government know exactly how much silver he has is a fool though i should hope so menedemos said weve earned it those bunglers would only squander it sostratos dipped his head then he ducked under the poop deck there wasnt much room to hide things on an akatos but still if you knew what you were doing philodemos couldnt have looked more disgusted if hed practiced in front of a mirror of polished bronze waste of silver he grumbled as if what passes for a government in this polis will do anything worthwhile with the money it mulcts from us better we should have kept it yes father menedemos sounded as resigned as he felt hed known his father would be disgusted that theyd had to pay moneychanging fees we didnt have to hand over two percent of everything we managed to hide a good part of the silver euge but philodemos sounded sarcastic not pleased you shouldnt have had to pay any of it just the roll of the dice menedemos said that officer on the iskhys warned he was going to check on us if he followed through and found we hadnt paid an obolos that would have been worse furies take him his father snarled who was the longnosed snoop anyhow did you recognize him menedemos tossed his head no i didnt philodemos rolled his eyes as if to ask the gods why theyd given him such a purblind son stung menedemos said im sorry father maybe sostratos did maybe so i can hope he did anyhow at least your cousins not a blind man that did worse than sting nothing else philodemos did hurt as much as his praising sostratos menedemos knew his cousin had certain virtues he lacked what his father couldnt seem to see was that he also had virtues sostratos lacked sostratos himself admitted as much but sostratos approval wasnt what menedemos had been struggling to win since he was a toddler had been struggling to win and too often hadnt won abruptly his father changed course and what do you make of demetrios son of antigonos how dangerous is he if youre his enemy very dangerous menedemos answered we should have seen that a couple of years ago when he raised ptolemaios siege of halikarnassos for his father halikarnassos philodemos muttered and menedemos knew his father was thinking of his misadventures there not demetrios adventures the older man asked did he restore the athenian democracy as weve heard here he restored it yes not that the athenians know what to do with it anymore menedemos told of the extravagant honors the athenian assembly had conferred upon demetrios and antigonos those are true genuine philodemos demanded not just rumors by the dog father theyre true menedemos said i went to the assembly with the rhodian proxenos and i listened to the decrees being passed myself disgusting disgraceful philodemos said i had heard of some of those and thought they were a pack of lies put out to blacken the athenians nameand demetrios for accepting what he doesnt deserve they and he must be blind to shame i wish they were rumors menedemos said i think the athenians took demetrios by surprise i think they turned his head too you could almost see him thinking oh i must be marvelous after all hes younghes around your age isnt he by the way menedemos father said it no one of about his age had any business being allowed to run loose without a pedagogue following him around let alone being entrusted with anything important like captaining a merchant galley or seizing a polis from a powerful foe menedemos wanted to make a hot retort to that but he was the one whod said athenian sycophancy had turned demetrios head philodemos hadnt had to say it or even to suggest it im doing fathers work for him menedemos thought in dismay what he did say was hes going to be formidable demetrios is hes already formidable as a matter of fact he took kassandros men by surprise when he brought his fleet to athens and he took their fortress by the harbor neat as anyone could want what do you suppose hell try to take next philodemos asked hell come east from athens menedemos said hed almost have to antigonos two most dangerous foes right now are ptolemaios and seleukos the one in egypt the other in mesopotamia and points east but which one antigonos will send him after well old oneeye may know but no one else does i say seleukos philodemos stuck out his chin hes the upstart amongst the macedonian marshals kassandros and lysimakhos and ptolemaios and antigonos all have their places seleukos though hes trying to bring an extra couch into the andron for a symposion antigonos wont let him get away with that if he can help it makes good sense to me father menedemos would have guessed antigonos and demetrios would go after ptolemaios because he was closer and held lands along the coast of the inner sea on which coast hellenes clustered like frogs around a pond but philodemos arguments were also cogentcogent enough that quarreling about them seemed more trouble than it was worth besides well all know next spring so we will philodemos chuckle was on the grim side youve been asking me questions about athens and our other stops menedemos said whats been going on here in rhodes while i was away here in rhodes the question seemed to take his father by surprise philodemos paused and thought then said well i do believe weve finally got the last of the damage from the flood repaired the priests offered a bullock in thanksgiving at the temple of dionysos near the agora and i brought home a pretty nice piece of beef that is good news fatherthat you got some good meat and that things are finally fixed nine years before rhodes had suffered through a storm the likes of which not even the oldest citizens recalled along with driving rain hailstones weighing up to a mina pounded the polis some people were killed outright when struck by them others badly hurt to make things worse the storm came late in the rainy season the drains had been neglected and soon clogged up that meant the rapidly rising waters couldnt get out through the city walls rhodes was shaped like a basin with a good deal of difference between high ground and low the low ground by the agora and the temple of dionysos went under even the temple of asklepios was threatened people clung to roofs and statues and the tops of shade trees to escape the raging waters at last part of the western wall of the city had given way allowing the flood to spill out into the sea things could have been worse had rhodes been a city largely built of mud brick like athens many more houses would have collapsed and many more people on rooftops would have drowned even as it was though more than five hundred perished is it really nine years since that happened menedemos asked it doesnt seem so long ago to his surprise his father laughed well son maybe youre turning into a man after all philodemos said thats one of the signs when all thats past starts squeezing together in your memory you were born half a lifetime ago for me but there are times when it feels like just a couple of years he tossed his head in slow wonder by the dog there are times when it feels like just a couple of months ago not to me menedemos said from his own perspective his life was very long indeedwhat for a man could seem longer if twentyeight years didnt equal eternity what did and yet somehow as his father said the nine years since the great flood had compressed into what felt like not much time at all as he got older would twentyeight years crumple the same way he didnt think it was likely but he wasnt quite ready to call it impossible either his father took a meditative sip of wine times a funny business now if the philosophers wanted to do something useful instead of just standing around listening to each others fancy talk theyd figure out how things like that worked but dont hold your breath it isnt likely sostratos went back to the lykeion in athens menedemos remarked did he philodemos said what did he think his time stretched instead of shrinkinghe found he didnt belong there anymore menedemos answered he sold the philosophers papyrus and ink at an outrageous price and made em pay it that made philodemos grin in approval unalloyed good for him he exclaimed i cant think of a surer way to prove youve beaten your past menedemos didnt know whether his cousin had beaten his past or simply moved away from it he didnt think sostratos was sure either again though he saw no point to contradicting his father he asked how are things here inside the house are your wife and sikon still quarreling whenever you turn your back things arent perfect there philodemos answered baukis will still give the cook a hard time every now and then and im sure sikon sometimes buys fancy expensive fish just to spite her but they do get on better than they did they arent at war all the time and they dont fight so hard when they do lock horns by the relief in his voice he was thoroughly glad of that too so was menedemos who said good i always hated getting stuck in the middle when they started shouting at each other and theyd both get offended when i didnt take their side oh yes philodemos dipped his head thats happened to me too hasnt been so bad lately though gods be praised good menedemos repeated and meant it he asked his father no more about baukis even though they lived in the same house too much curiosity about the older mans wife would have been unseemly it might also have roused philodemos suspicions and that was the last thing menedemos wanted one of the first things he wanted was baukis hed known as much for years he hadnt done anything about it no matter how much he wanted herin fact precisely because he wanted her so much he hadnt and hoped he wouldnt hed been fighting this lonely silent battle ever since the knowledge of his desire first flowered in him and ill win too it would have been easierit would have been much easierto be confident of that and indeed to want to win if he hadnt begun to realize baukis wanted him too he gulped down his wine not that wine would help sostratos felt as if hed been riding this miserable donkey forever in point of fact he hadnt set out from the city of rhodes more than a couple of hours earlier hed left around noon and the sun wasnt even halfway down the southwestern sky his brain was sure of the time his backside and his inner thighs would have argued differently hed probably come about eighty stadia heading south and west hed passed through ialysos not long before along with lindos and kameiros ialysos had been one of the three main settlements on the island of rhodes before they joined together to build the polis of rhodes ialysos never had been a polis not in the proper sense of the word it wasnt a city but a community of villages with a wellsited fortress on the nearby high ground all those villages had shrunk in the hundred years since the polis of rhodes became the most important place in the northern part of the islandindeed the most important place on the island as a whole but they persisted like an old decrepit olive tree that kept sending out green shoots whenever the lifegiving rains came ahead the ground rose toward steep hills and then farther southwest toward mount atabyrion the highest peak on rhodes damonaxs farm and olive grovesabout whose products sostratos knew more than hed ever wanted tolay near the lower edge of the steeply rising ground it was good country for olives not so near the coast that flies ruined the crop but not high enough to let cooler weather damage it either before sostratos got to damonaxs farm he was glad hed decided to hire the donkey instead of walking it wasnt so much that hed shifted the pain from his feet to his hindquarters but when a farm dog came rushing up yapping and growling the donkey lashed out with a clever hoof and knocked the dog sprawling when it got up again it retreated even more rapidly than it had advanced its yelps were music to sostratos ears what a good fellow he exclaimed and patted the donkeys neck he didnt think that meant much to the beast getting off and letting it crop the lush green grass by the side of a creek counted for more a couple of pigs with ridges of hair down their backs nosed through garbage by damonaxs farmhouse a nanny goat tied to a tree had nibbled the grass around it down to the ground and had stood on her hind legs to devour all the shoots and tender twigs she could reach chickens scratched and clucked between the farmhouse and the barn out of the barn came a middleaged sunbrowned man in a short chiton and stout sandals he scratched at his shaggy bearda beard worn not in defiance of fashion like sostratos but seemingly in ignorance of itand crushed something between his thumbnails only after hed wiped his hand on his tunic did he call if youve come to pick olives youre still a few days early and you know youre supposed to bring your own pole to knock the fruit off the trees sostratos gaze went to the olive grove sure enough the olives were ripening on the branches getting darker and fuller of oil he turned back toward the overseer im not here for the olive harvest im sostratos son of lysistratos damonaxs brotherinlaw you must be anthebas thats me young sir hail and pleased to make your acquaintance anthebas answered i beg your pardon for not knowing you by sight i was uh expecting someone grander he dug the toe of one of those sandals into the dirt to show his embarrassment someone better groomed and all perfumed he meanssomeone like his boss sostratos thought without much anger sliding down off the donkey he let out a sigh of relief and rubbed at his hams anthebas sent him a chuckle and a sympathetic smile sostratos said damonax and my sister and their son are here that was what the slaves had said back in rhodes if theyd been wrong or perhaps lied for the sport of it his fundament would get even sorer on the way back but anthebas dipped his head he pointed to the farmhouse oh yes sir theyre in there would you like me to take care of your donkey if youd be so kind sostratos went over to the door and knocked on it hed wondered if his brotherinlaw would let him in himself but damonax didnt carry rusticity so far one of his slaves a man sostratos had seen in rhodes did the honors unlike anthebas who spent all his time out here this fellow recognized the new arrival bowing slightly he said hail o best one welcome in my masters name please come in thank you atys sostratos said and the lydian slave beamed as he stood aside proud to have his own name remembered though sostratos didnt say so the farmhouse struck him as cramped and dark especially compared to the fine home where damonax lived while staying in the city it was simply one room after another to form a square it wasnt built around a courtyard as all city houses above the level of shanty were that contributed to the gloom for the only light in the rooms came through the windows which were small and partly covered by shutters sostratos wondered why anyone would choose to live in such an uncomfortable place when he didnt have to hail most noble one there was damonax handsome and elegantly turned out as always good to see you he stuck out his hand sostratos clasped it damonaxs grip said he was holding back strength sostratos hoped his said he didnt care about such petty games hows your son he asked hows my sister he could ask that where inquiring after damonaxs wife would have been rude theyre both very well thank you damonax replied polydoros seems a very healthy little boy for which the gods be praised he was a man of no great pietywhich didnt bother sostratos who wasnt eitherbut spoke with the air of someone taking no chances since so many children didnt live to grow up sostratos couldnt blame him a wail from another room declared something had happened that the very healthy little boy didnt care for how do you get used to living with all the noise a baby makes sostratos asked with genuine curiosity it was hard at first when he cried so often damonax said now though his mother or a slave takes care of it and it doesnt bother me too much that hardly seemed fair to erinna on the other hand if caring for a baby wasnt womans work what was sostratos muttered to himself caught between loyalty to his sister and expectations about the way things were supposed to work damonax asked and how did you find athens oh you sail north and west from cape sounion and there it is sostratos answered blandly his brotherinlaw stared then let out an undignified snort sostratos went on seriously it could be better youll have heard that demetrios son of antigonos drove out demctrios of phaleron oh yes and restored the athenians old democratic constitution and knocked the fortress of mounykhia flat that all sounds promising i suppose it would but have you heard how the athenians paid him back for liberating them sostratos asked damonax tossed his head as menedemos had with his father sostratos told him finishing you see oh damonax said and then as if conscious that wasnt enough oh dear id hoped for better from them if that wasnt an expression of philosophical restraint sostratos had never heard one damonax asked did you get out to the lykeion yes sostratos hoped the oneword answer would keep damonax from asking any more questions about that no such luck his brotherinlaw inquired and hows old theophrastos he doesnt seem to have changed much from when i studied there sostratos replied truthfully he remembered me he could say that with more than a little pride good good damonax set a possibly friendly hand on his shoulder and what did he think of your going into commerce to the crows with you my dear sostratos thought shaking off the hand if i werent in commerce if my family didnt make a good living from it you wouldnt have been able to use erinnas dowry and the money we made from your oil last year to pay off the debts on this land the way you talk though i might have been keeping a brothel full of pretty boys he caught himself before any of that passed the gate of his teeth he didnt want to quarrel with damonax though he had to remind himself he didnt not only would it ruin this visit to the farm but it also might make life harder and less pleasant for erinna that being so he smiled back and answered he said he understood it was necessary for me to help support my family now with a certain malice he set his hand on damonaxs shoulder as if to say his brotherinlaw was part of the family he supported eryes damonaxs smile went fixed he took the pointtook it and didnt care for it sostratos had hoped he wouldnt damonax changed the subject in a hurry let me show you to your room that was unexceptionable sostratos dipped his head and followed his brotherinlaw the chamber was small and cramped with barely enough room for a bed it did boast a southfacing window though which made it lighter than most of the house through the window sostratos could look out at some of the olive trees on the farm indeed narrow silvergreen leaves from one of the closest trees would probably blow into the room when the wind came from the south very nice best one thank you again sostratos remembered he didnt want to quarrel with damonax he might have if he didnt fear locking horns with him would cause trouble for his sister since he did he tried to walk soft his brotherinlaw also took a moment and visibly composed himself before saying if you like you can rest here before supper and ill have a slave wake you if youre not up by then now sostratos smile was broad and genuine by the dog ill take you up on that one of the nuisances of life aboard ship is that you can never grab a nap in the afternoon after a while you get used to going without it but i like one when i have the chance ill leave you to it then damonax slipped out of the room closing the door behind him sostratos used the chamber pot under the bed then lay down the mattress was thinner and lumpier than the one back home but far softer than the aphroditesplanking and travel had taught him to sleep nearly anywhere he dozed off almost as soon as he closed his eyes next thing he knew someone was knocking on the door and saying supper is ready most noble one in accented greek the noise went on till sostratos said im up ill be there in a moment he rubbed sleep out of his eyes and ran his fingers through his hair and beard he knew he wouldnt be so elegant as damonax come what may that being so he didnt try too hard because he was erinnas brother she and the baby dined with him and damonax good to see you my dear he told her and my goodness but polydoros is getting big his nephew rewarded him with a smile wide enough to show top and bottom teeth hes a good boy erinna smiled too she looked tired even though damonaxs slaves did a lot of the work of raising polydoros a mother had to do quite a bit too and it told on her heres the sitos damonax said as a slave carried in snowywhite barley rolls and olive oil in which to dip them proudly he added all of it grown right here on the farm thats good sostratos said then he tried one of the rolls still warm from the oven mm thats very good im so glad you like the oil damonaxs voice had an edge to it my dear i never said i didnt like it i merely said the aphroditewasnt the right ship to carry it and athens wasnt the right place to take it erinna said lets enjoy the supper shall we and not squabble over it both her brother and her husband dipped their heads cheese and olives appeared for opson they too were products of the farm sostratos wondered if they would be all the opson there was that would make a rustic supper all rightmore rustic than he really cared for but then a slave brought in a ham on an earthenware platter the platter ironically was decorated with pictures of fish a far more common fancy opson damonax did the honors with a carving knife not much smaller than a hoplites shortsword he hacked off a generous chunk close to the shinbone that stuck out from the meat and gave it to sostratos we raised the pig here too he declared and smoke the meat with our own wood its delicious sostratos said after he took a bite do you eat meat here as often as youd eat fish in town not quite damonax answered at the same time as erinna said no he sent her a hard look she flushed and stared down at the ground hed wanted to give sostratos the impression of greater abundance than he really had and shed spoiled it for him its your fault not hers sostratos thought she just told the truth the wine that went with dinner was severely ordinary sostratos praised it anyway asking is this also from the farm it certainly is damonax answered as sostratos had hoped the question put him in a better humor as a matter of fact i crushed some of the grapes myself had menedemos said something like that sostratos would have made a crack about being able to taste his feet but his brotherinlaw didnt take gibes like that in stride and so he refrained no matter how angry i get at menedemos theres no denying he can laugh at himself damonax no so youll want to visit the valley of the butterflies tomorrow damonax asked if its not inconvenient yes sostratos answered ive heard of it since i was small of course but ive never had the chance to see it well go then damonax said its not inconvenient i told you id show it to you if you came out here youre back from athens a little sooner than i thought you would be so im sure theyll still be there good sostratos manufactured a yawn to show he was tired and didnt much feel like talking i look forward to it damonax dipped his head something in erinnas eyes glinted his sister knew him too well and knew he wasnt so tired as all that she didnt give him away though when damonax went out of the room to tell a slave to bring in lamps sostratos grinned at her erinna smiled back is everything all right sostratos asked her in a low voice everything is fine she answered ive had a son and i havent caused any scandal how could things be better did she sound bitter or just matteroffact sostratos couldnt tell and didnt dare ask hed never worried about how hellenes treated women he still didnt not in any general way but he worried a lot about how damonax treated erinna his brotherinlaw came back the slave followed a couple of minutes later the lamps he set out fought the gloom without vanquishing it as twilight deepened their small yellow pools of radiance seemed weaker and more fragile by the moment sostratos yawned again this time in earnest you must be tired his sister saidshe could take a hint even if damonax seemed to have trouble a bit sostratos admitted the nap helped less than id have liked a slave with a lamp led him to his room he hadnt intended to fall asleep right away but there wasnt much else to do he hadnt brought a book and reading by lamplight was an unsatisfactory business anyhow he stretched out on the bed and looked up at the beams of the ceiling a little gecko with sticky feet scurried along upside down on the prowl for moths and mosquitoes and spiders the next thing sostratos knew the room was dark except for a thin pale strip of moonlight slanting in through the window the smell of hot oil still lingering in the air said the lamp hadnt gone dry long before yawning sostratos reached under the bed and pulled out the pot after easing himself he lay down again he watched the moonlight creep across the floor for a little while then sleep claimed him once more he woke with the morning sky going from deep blue toward predawn gray early but not impossibly so noises from the rest of the house said he wasnt the first one up from the days when he was a boy and erinna a baby he remembered that infants woke up whenever they wanted to not when anyone else wanted them to sure enough when he made his way to the dining room he found a slave woman there feeding polydoros bits of barley roll and heavily watered wine a lot of the wine dribbled down the babys chin hail sir the woman said i hope he didnt bother you if polydoros had bothered sostratos she might get in trouble but he tossed his head no i woke up on my own can you bring me some rolls and oil and wine for my breakfast or tell me where to get them for myself ill get them for you sir the slave said will you make sure he doesnt wiggle off this chair while im gone of course sostratos stuck out his tongue at his nephew the babys eyes widened he gurgled laughterand then he stuck out his tongue too sostratos was halfway through his breakfast when damonax came in hail his brotherinlaw said ready for an early start are you id rather travel in the morning than in the heat of the day sostratos answered will we go by donkeyback or walk i was planning to walk damonax eyed sostratos feet do you want to borrow a pair of shoes mine might fit you or anthebas if they dont kind of you best one but dont put yourself to the trouble sostratos said ive spent too much time at sea and fallen into the habit of staying barefoot wherever i go damonax shrugged suit yourself he disappeared into the kitchen returning with a breakfast much like sostratos he ate quickly so he finished not long after his guest rubbing crumbs off his hands he said shall we be off then lead the way ill stay with you when sostratos went outside with damonax he saw the sun shining to the north damonaxs farm remained shadowed a little while longer for the mountain to the east shielded it from sunrise damonax set a brisk pace heading up toward the peak he seemed surprised when sostratos had no trouble keeping up with him your feet really dont trouble you he blurted no not at all sostratos tried to hold amusement out of his voice i cant recall the last time i wore shoes and my soles are hard as leather id say we could race but you know where youre going and i dont even if i knew youd probably win ive never been a fast runner damonax cocked his head to one side plainly having trouble believing that but didnt you fall just short of going to the olympic games a few years ago me sostratos laughed at the absurdity of the notion then he snapped his fingers know why you think so that wasnt methat was menedemos so you say damonax kept waiting for him to start to sprint or to offer a bet about which of them could run faster or something of the sort only when sostratos just kept placidly ambling along did it seem to occur to his brotherinlaw that he might be telling the truth several streams from the mountains ran down toward the sea most of them dried out in summer leaving their beds nothing but rockstrewn gullies one though kept a trickle of water even at the driest season of the year a hare bounded away as sostratos and damonax came up pointing upstream sostratos asked does a spring feed this river thats right damonax dipped his head we follow it now until we get to the valley of the butterflies they flushed another hare a few minutes later damonax sighed perhaps wishing he had dogs along so he could hunt a mouse skittered into the bushes a hedgehog rolled itself into a ball a lizard on a boulder by the stream stared at the rhodians out of beady black eyes it stuck out its tongue as if in derision after a while damonax stooped and dipped some water from the stream with his hand warm work he remarked yes sostratos drank a little water too and splashed some on his face it felt good they went on the stream bent a little more toward the north there damonax said you see those treetops the trees themselves are growing down in the valley or youd be able to spy the rest of them were almost there the valley of the butterflies was long and narrow sostratos wondered how long the stream had taken to carve it from the hard gray stone branches from the trees on either side met above the gurgling stream shading and cooling the valley sostratos sniffed a faint almost familiar spicy smell filled his nostrils what is that he asked sniffing again styrax damonax answered they make incense from the gum the butterflies seem to like the fragrance too the butterflies as sostratos eyes got used to the shade he saw them and let out a soft marveling sigh they were everywhere in the valley on the rocks and covering the trunks and branches of the trees their favorite spot seemed to be a big mossy rock next to a little waterfall at the far end of the valley mist swirled around them perhaps they especially liked the moisture there how marvelous sostratos exclaimed thank you so much for bringing me here my pleasure damonax said as if hed created the valley for sostratos benefit sostratos reached out and delicately plucked an insect from a branch its body was about as long as the last joint of his thumb though far thinner its upper wings were brown almost black and streaked with yellow when it fluttered for a moment lackadaisically trying to escape it revealed lower wings of a rich crimson with a few dark spots then it seemed to resign itself to disaster and sat quiet in his hand after examining it a little longer sostratos turned to damonax im sorry best one but this isnt a butterfly no his brotherinlaw raised both eyebrows what would you call it then a stingray an olive maybe though sostratos smiled at the sarcasm he answered a moth by the dog whats the difference ah theophrastos must have skipped that lecture while you were at the lykeion butterflies rest with their wings up over their backs while moths let them lie flatas this one does and butterflies have slim clublike antennae while moths have thick hairy oneslike these if it has the characteristics of a moth what else can it be nothing else i suppose damonax replied but would you have wanted to come here if id invited you to see the valley of the moths me probably im curious about such things most people would stay away though i admit sostratos put the moth back where hed got it it wriggled in among the others then held still he asked how is it that the birds dont come here and feed till they burst that i can tell you for ive seen birds take these butterflies moths i mean damonax corrected himself before sostratos could they take them yes but they dont swallow them the moths must taste nasty how interesting sostratos said and so they stay here undisturbed all through the summer damonax dipped his head thats right when the rains come in the fall they matesome of them even fall in the stream while theyre couplingand then they fly away so you might see them all over the island but when things dry up in spring here they are again and why not sostratos gazed around the valley in awe tempered by affection after all theyre rhodians too menedemos watched his father go over the accounts sostratos had kept during their journey to athens almost a pity to take the rowers along philodemos remarked their pay ate up a good chunk of profit if youd gone in a round ship instead we wouldnt have got there till later menedemos said as things were we had the market in our goods to ourselves for quite a while who knows how it would have gone if wed come in second and wed surely have had to carry damonaxs olive oil then i suppose so but philodemos still sounded unhappy he had other reasons to sound that way too i wish your cousin would write larger when you have to read at arms length the way i do these little squiggles drive you mad sorry father but i cant do anything about that now menedemos said a slave came into the andron excuse me sir but a man is here to see you philodemos started to get to his feet the slave said no sir to see the young master me menedemos said in surprise some husband catch you going after his wife his father asked i hope not menedemos thought before he could say the words or so much as toss his head philodemos told the slave bring this fellow here i want to see this for myself menedemos couldnt even contradict the order miserably he watched the slave hurry back to the entry hall when the caller appeared though his heart took wing with relief thats admiral eudemos he said adding and in case youre wondering i havent had anything to do with his wife his father only grunted eudemos was in his mid to late forties burned walnutbrown by the sun with a gray beard a beaky nose and hard eyes that seemed to see everything at once hail philodemos he said as he strode into the andron need to talk to your son for a minute hope im not interrupting anything nothing that wont keep most noble one philodemos could be polite he just didnt bother while talking to menedemos good eudemos turned to the younger man so youre back from athens a little sooner than you thought youd be thats right sir menedemos said wondering why the admiral cared eudemos was not the sort to keep a man hanging with a brisk dip of the head he said how would you like to take the dikaiosyne out on a sweep after pirates seems a shame you werent her first skipper seeing as you were the one who came up with the idea for the class but i know youve got to make a living still anyone who can captain a merchant galley can captain a war galley too and anyone who can captain a merchant galley should captain a war galley too the more people who know how to do that the better off the polis is what do you say when does she sail menedemos blurted he wanted to burst with pride he turned to see how his father responded here was the rhodian admiral acclaiming him not only as a seaman but also for inventing the trihemiolia philodemos though might have been carved from stone menedemos sighed quietly he didnt suppose he should have expected anything different tomorrow at sunrise eudemos said youll be there yes o best one ill be there menedemos said good farewell then nice to see you philodemos the admiral turned and left like any seafaring man he went barefoot and wore only a chiton though his was of very fine white wool they want you to skipper one of those newfangled war galleys do they philodemos said yes father not bad from the older man that was the highest praise menedemos got i was about your age when i first captained a trireme for the city its getting close to the end of the sailing season i hope you have good luck catching pirates and give them what they deserve on that subject philodemos views coincided perfectly with those of his son ive fought them off in the akatos menedemos said now ill have the edge he woke while it was still dark hed been sure he would the only question in his mind had been whether he would sleep at all or whether excitement would keep him up all night but excitement had faded after he lay in darkness for a while now he ran his fingers through his hairno time to scrape whiskers from his chinand hurried to the kitchen to snag a chunk of bread to eat on his way down to the naval harbor he was heading out to the front door when someone behind him called farewell menedemos that voice stopped him in his tracks thank you baukis what are you doing up so early i wanted to say goodbye to you philodemos wife answered after a moment she added your father is very proud of you you know is he menedemos said tonelessly to his way of thinking a grudging not bad didnt translate into anything approaching great pride but baukis dipped her head yes she said and so am i she took a couple of steps toward him then stopped nervously and looked around to make sure no slaves were awake to hear and see the two of them menedemos understood those jitters he had them himself id better go he said and did but he might have been wingfooted hermes as he made his way down through the nightsilent streets of rhodes toward the naval harbor he didnt think his feet touched the hardpacked dirt at all baukis was proud of him shed said so each bite of rather stale bread suddenly seemed ambrosial yes love was a disease of course it was but oh what a sweet one actually the streets of rhodes werent so very silent after all though mornings gray light was just coming into the eastern sky the sounds of drunken song floated up from the direction of the temple of apollo in the southwest those were surely symposiasts reeling home after a nighta long nightof debauchery menedemos smiled and chuckled hed come home at this hour once or twice and roused the whole household with his songs he laughed again remembering how splutteringly furious his father had been a night watchman with a torch patrolled the naval harbor excuse me o best one but which shipshed houses the dikaiosyne menedemos asked who wants to know the watchman asked menedemos smelled wine on his breath too though he hadnt passed the night in revelry im menedemos son of philodemos and im her captain this trip out the pride hed felt when eudemos named him captain rang in his voice the night watchman pointed to one of the sheds on the western side of the harbor those were the narrow buildings that housed triremes and now trihemioliai as well the shipsheds on the southern side of the harbor were broader to accommodate fives and other bigger beamier war galleys a galley with dry timbers was lighter and therefore faster than a waterlogged ship and so the naval vessels spent as much time as possible dragged up out of the sea and into the sheds three or four men carrying oars and pillows made their way toward that shed without bothering to ask the watchman menedemos trotted after the rowers he didnt have to be the first one there but he wanted to get there ahead of most of the crew he got his wish only a couple of dozen men had boarded the dikaiosyne that would have been a big part of the aphrodites complement but was only a fraction of the trihemiolias like a trireme she carried rowers plus a squad of marines although her oarsmen in the rear part of the thalamite bank would join the marine contingent once their benches were stowed a burly man with a bald pate came up to menedemos youre going to be the captain on this run he asked when menedemos dipped his head the bald man went on pleased to meet you im philokrates son of timokrates and im your keleustes is it true you were the one who had the idea for this class of ship yes thats right menedemos answered philokrates stuck out his hand menedemos clasped it the oarmaster said some god must have put the notion into your head for shes smooth and sweet as piggy his grin showed a missing front tooth menedemos smiled back philokrates reminded him of diokles the older man asked you ever skipper anything this big before no the past few years ive captained the aphrodite twenty oars on a side oh sure i know her philokrates banged himself on the side of the head with the heel of his hand annoyed at forgetting well all right big difference between this ship and that one is that not everybody on the dikaiosyne may hear you when you yellshes too big and a lot of her rowers are down below well use pipes and drums to set the stroke and youll want to rely on your mates to pass orders remember em and count on em theyre both good men menedemos met them moments later xenagoras was tall and thin with a broken nose menedemos turned out to know the second mate nikandros already theyd run against each other menedemos usually having the better of it by then the rowers crowded the shipshed and spilled out onto the walkway on either side real dawn had come before long the rising sun would shine into the mouth of the shed philokrates said looks like were ready menedemos dipped his head the oarmaster waited then snapped his fingers thats rightyou havent done this before the command you give is take her down take her down menedemos shouted and waited to see what happened next with a roar the rowers and marines pushed the dikaiosyne down the sloping ramp of the shipshed and into the water the aphrodites crew had trouble manhandling her the swarm of sailors on the trihemiolia made it seem easy down the way she went into the water of the naval harbor they scrambled aboard her the mates the keleustes and menedemos were not behindhand the dikaiosyne had a higher freeboard than the merchant galley standing at the stern steeringoar tillers in hand menedemos felt able to see as far as a god youll handle her yourself philokrates asked yes by the dog menedemos answered want to find out how she feels im not some gilded popinjayi know how to steer all right lets go then philokrates beat out the stroke the rowers began to pull the dikaiosyne glided across the harbor toward the outlet in the north a fresh breeze in his face menedemos grinned enormously he felt like a man whod been riding donkeys all his life and suddenly found himself on the back of a nisaian charger this ship moved she was made for speed and delivered it once they cleared the mouth of the harbor he swung the trihemiolia east intending to cruise along the karian coast looking for piratesor for ships that could be pirates this is the first time ive skippered one of these patrols he said to philokrates what are the rules if we spy a pentekonter or a hemiolia going along minding her own business about what youd expect the oarmaster replied we go up to her we question her crew and we sink her if we dont like the answers we get a captain or an owner who thinks we made a mistake can complain to the rhodian government if he hasnt drowned of course menedemos said philokrates dipped his head well yes there is that right away menedemos noticed one difference between the aphroditeand the dikaiosyne fishing boats and round ships fought shy of the akatos fearing she might be a pirate ship but sailors of all sorts waved toward the trihemiolia a threebanked oarpowered ship had to be a war galley a hound dedicated to hunting down the wolves of the sea you dont want to get too close to land and let the widearsed catamites playing watchman for the pirate crews get a good look at you philokrates said i understand menedemos answered you know what o best one it might be fun to send a round ship or a merchant galley close enough to the coast to be easy to spot with the dikaiosyne out far enough to see the decoy but too far out to be seen from shore then when the pirates come out for the nearer ship this one could dash in and swoop down on them the oarmaster contemplated the scheme a slow grin spread over his leathery features fun you say do you by poseidon s trident i like your notion of fun you ought to talk with admiral eudemos when we get back to rhodes hes the one whod have to give the orders to bring off something like that dont forget now because i think it could work i wont forget menedemos said even if i did you could tell the admiral you thought of it you deserve the credit philokrates said which went a long way toward making him a friend for life he added you are a clever fellow arent you first the notion for this class of ship and now a pretty trap not bad not bad at all menedemos was much more used to hearing sostratos called clever than to having the word applied to him he almost denied italmost but not quite he had thought of trihemioliai and he had come up with the decoying scheme he would have praised anyone else whod done such things didnt it follow that he deserved praise too he liked it as much as anybody else more than some people he could think of his father was sparing of praise but that didnt mean other people had to be with its countless headlands and little bays and streams running down from the hills into the aegean the karian coastline was a pirates ream it offered myriads of places to wait in ambush till a tempting target sailed by a quick dash and the victim was caught it offered even more places to hide a pirate ship against the prying eyes of the rhodians menedemos knew patrols like this didnt couldnt stop piracy altogether but making it difficult dangerous and expensive was worth doing ship ho off the port bow the lookout bawled menedemos swung the trihemiolia to the north he told philokrates up the stroke if you please lets see what she can do if the men put their backs into it the keleustes dipped his head right you are skipper the tempo of the drumbeats he gave the rowers picked up rhyppapai rhyppapai he shouted using his voice to emphasize the change the piper matched his piercing note to the one philokrates played on the drum and how the dikaiosyne responded the galley seemed to bound across the aegean toward the other ship and that other ship didnt hang around waiting to be questioned she turned and fled toward the shore as fast as she could go pentekonter the lookout said probably full of cutthroats right to the gunwales not full enough by the gods philokrates said no pentekonter ever made could outrun this ship we outrun triremes we run down hemioliai by zeus a pentekonter this for a stinking pentekonter he spat on the deck sure enough the dikaiosyne ate up the distance between the two ships plethron by plethron stadion by stadion but the karian coast also drew closer with every surge from the oars marine archers forward menedemos shouted when they didnt seem to hear him he sent xenagoras up to them adding tell em to shoot as fast as they can the more rowers we hurt the better our chance of catching them before they can beach philokrates grinned you know your business a lot of firsttime skippers you have to hold their hands and show em what to do not you you and the mates know this ship better than i do menedemos answered but ive fought pirates before too then they had more men and faster ships than i did ive got the edge now and it feels goodyoud best believe it does as the marine archers hurried forward they put the trihemiolia down by the bow and slowed her just a touch menedemos ordered other men back toward the stern restoring her trim the archers began to shoot a couple of pirates went to the pentekonters stern to shoot back but her poop deck was even smaller and more crowded than say the aphrodites it would hold no more one of the bowmen on the pirate ship reeled back clutching at his chest as a shaft from the dikaiosyne went home another man took his place then a rower on the pentekonter took an arrow in the shoulder and fouled the man in front of him again another pirate pulled him away but the pentekonter needed some little while to straighten out her stroke even so the pirate ship made the beach menedemos had known she would she rode half her length up onto the soft golden sand rowers jumped off her and ran inland as fast as they could do you want to go after them nikandros asked weve got a lot more men we could catch some of the rogues menedemos had had time to think about that on the chase regretfully he tossed his head and told the mate no no telling how many pals the abandoned villains have back in the hills well burn their ship thatll put them out of business for a while burn her they did and the pentekonter made such a pyre it was plain her timbers had been kept dry as carefully as a war galleys black smoke rose high into the sky good riddance philokrates said pity they werent all in her oh yes menedemos dipped his head but lets keep pushing east a little while longer now before answering the oarmaster glanced toward the sun menedemos did the same it was somewhere right around noon philokrates said if we go much farther east most noble one we wont get back to rhodes before sundown i know that menedemos said but dont you think pirate crews know it too wouldnt they be likely to base their ships out a little farther from rhodes than our patrols usually go theyd think they were likely to be safe maybe we can give them a surprise and if we have to we can find our way home by the stars or spend a night at sea ive done it plenty of times in my akatos an akatos isnt such a crowded ship as a trihemiolia philokrates pointed out that was true the war galley was bigger than the aphrodite but she wasnt four times as big and she carried four times the crewthat was why she could go so fast menedemos wondered how real his command of the dikaiosyne was if he gave an order philokrates didnt fancy would the keleustes and the crew obey him or ignore him he didnt find out here for philokrates grinned and said lets try it you make a good point and wed have a lot to be proud of if we came back to rhodes after wed skinned a pair of pirates the rowers dug in without a grumble catching and burning the pentekonter left them in a good mood catching pirates was why they went out on patrol in the first place and menedemos knew they didnt score even one triumph every time out far from it the oars rose and fell rose and fell in smooth unison if rhodians werent the best oarsmen around the inner sea menedemos had no idea who would be so many of them made their living from the sea they all had a good idea of what they were doing from what sostratos said a hundred years before the same thing had been true in athens no more if the athenians ever built and tried to man the triremes for which demetrios had said he would provide the timber theyd have to pay foreigners to pull most of the oars and a lot of the foreigners they paid would be rhodians menedemos countrymen also served in every macedonian marshals fleet by the time menedemos ordered the dikaiosyne to turn around she was well into lykian waters he saw plenty of fishing boats and more than a few round ships but none of the lean vicious galleys he sought he kicked at the timbers of the deck he wanted that second pirate ship wanted her bad enough to taste it he wanted to show admiral eudemos and the rest of rhodes high naval officials that he could make something out of a command even if he wasnt rich enough to serve aboard a war galley all through a sailing season and commanding a trihemiolia a type that had sprung from his imagination as athena sprang from zeus forehead made this patrol all the sweeter but the gods gave what they chose to give not what any mortal wanted as the sun sank in the west the dikaiosyne glided back toward rhodes menedemos kept looking over his right shoulder toward the rugged coast hoping to spy a hemiolia perhaps painted seagreen or skyblue to make her harder to spot while on the prowl but all he saw were golden sands rising swiftly to rugged forested hills perfect places for pirates to take refuge and then only a couple of hundred stadia from rhodes the lookout cried ship ho menedemos lifted a hand off the steeringoar tiller to wave to philokrates to increase the stroke the oarmaster waved back the drum beat faster the piper matched the rhythm the rowers responded magnificently theyd been at the oars all day to push the dikaiosyne out as far from rhodes as they could menedemos would never have worked the crew of a merchant galley so hard not without a pirate on his heels but they upped the stroke when philokrates ordered it menedemos showed his teeth in a fierce grin he didnt have a pirate on his heels this time he was on the pirates heels now or hoped he was that other ship certainly behaved like a pirate when the crew spotted the trihemiolia they didnt stop and wait to be questioned instead they sped north toward the karian coast as fast as they could go a long creamy wake streamed out behind their shipa hemiolia for she had two banks of oars she was fastbut the dikaiosyne was faster menedemos sneaked an anxious glance toward the sun it was sinking fast descending toward the sea that would quench its light his gaze swung back to the scurrying scuttling hemiolia would he have enough daylight left to finish the chase he didnt know but he intended to find out as before he ordered marines to the bow to shoot at the fleeing ship she wasnt in range yet but he wanted to be ready ahead of time philokrates grinned and dipped his head to show he approved were gaining on them the keleustes shouted for the benefit of the hardworking rowers who were looking away from the chase keep at it we may catch em before they can beach if the dikaiosyne could do that if she could ram or come alongside grapple and board the pirates wouldnt last long menedemos watched the hemiolia as the war galley came up on her her captain posted archers at the stern tooposted them there and then started quarreling with them menedemos could guess why a hemiolia was the fastest galley on the inner sea except now a trihemiolia the skipper and his crew couldnt have expected to get overhauled and were probably blaming one another but the karian coastline was coming closer with every stroke of the oars and the dikaiosyne wasnt much faster than her quarry getting within arrow range took longer than menedemos had hoped it would and then the pirates put on a mad spurt of rowing that would have burst their hearts if they kept it up for long the oarsmen on the trihemiolia matched it but the smaller ship slid up onto the beach men streamed from her some naked but for weapons others gaudy and glittering in finery and gold no doubt stolen a few stayed close to the hemiolia to shoot at the dikaiosyne most though ran for the nearest trees without looking back do we land and go after em sir philokrates asked menedemos eyed the sun again the flattened ruddy ball hung just above the horizon regretfully he tossed his head no no point to it not when well be fumbling around in the dark well burn the ship and go home no one argued with him the hemiolia went up in flames as the pentekonter had earlier in the day a pretty fair patrol philokrates said yes sir pretty fair far as im concerned o best one you can take the dikaiosyne out any time you please both mates grinned and dipped their heads thank you menedemos said the words didnt come close to showing how delighted he was but they were the best he had he used them again thank you friends sostratos went to the gymnasion more from a dogged sense that he really should than from any real enjoyment he got there he wasnt ashamed to take off his clothes and exercise hed never had the kind of body a sculptor would choose as a model for zeus or ares but hed never let himself go soft or get fat either looking down at his angular knobby frame he sometimes wondered if he could get fat even with the most diligent effort he didnt care to find out like most hellenes he believed no man had any business letting himself go to seed that way and so dutifully he exercised he ran sprints his bare feet kicking up the dust menedemos wasnt here at least he didnt have to eat his cousins dust along with his own he threw javelins at canvas targets stretched across bales of hay he shot arrows at the targets too grunting with effort because hed chosen a bow he could barely draw he was a tolerablebetter than a tolerablearcher which had helped more than once aboard the aphrodite and he dusted his oiled body with sand and got into the wrestling pits to grapple with his fellow citizens there he came close to having a good time because he could hold his own with most of them he didnt have the lizardquick reactions that would have made him one of the very best wrestlers but he used his long limbs to good advantage he was stronger than he lookedbecause he was tall and lean his muscles didnt bulge the way a squatter mans would haveand he was always one to come up with new holds and variations on old ones he used his head when he wrestled not just his arms and his back this morning he cast down a fellow named boulanax son of damagoras a man of about his own age boulanax spat dirt out of his mouth and said i didnt see that coming at all show me what you did certainly sostratos liked to teach when you came at me i twisted and jerked and threw you over my hip do it again slowly and ill show you just how i got the hold all right boulanax did sostratos went through the throw at half speed this time i see boulanax dipped his head and smiled his body could have been the model for a young zeus and he was handsome too handsome enough to have been almost as popular as menedemos when they were youths but he didnt seem offended to have lost as some men did when sostratos threw them instead he said well ill surprise the next fellow i take on by the dog did you come up with that yourself as a matter of fact i did by hellenic standards sostratos was modest but not modest enough to keep from taking credit for what was really his good for you then boulanax clapped his hands together in approval why arent you in the gymnasion more often i spent most of the spring and summer in athens sostratos replied thatll do it the other rhodian agreed as sostratos hoped he would he took that to mean sostratos had been studying there not that hed been engaging in commerce boulanax himself drew the sort of income from his lands that damonax wished he did he said so you were there when antigonos son drove out demetrios of phaleron yes i was sostratos said what do you think of him hes formidable no doubt about it sostratos answered charming tooi met him did you the other mans eyes widened then narrowed wait arent you the son of philodemos the merchant oh well sostratos thought now he wont believe i was studying in athens but he answered with the truth philodemos is my uncle im the son of lysistratos his younger brother thats right its menedemos whos philodemos son boulanaxs voice had a certain edge to it did he still think of menedemos as a rival because theyd both been popular as youths maybe he did for that edge remained when he asked and how is your cousin doing these days very well thanks sostratos said pretending not to hear it hes just back from skippering the dikaiosyne on a patrol against pirates they burned two pirate ships when they were out there admiral eudemos took him out drinking after he brought the trihemiolia back to rhodes he and menedemos often chafed each other when they were together but they presented a united front against the world two pirate ships boulanaxs eyes widened again euge thats fine work many goodbyes to them no rhodian would say a word against someone who hurt pirates even if he didnt care for the man menedemos was the one who suggested building trihemioliai in the first place sostratos added twisting the knife a little theyre so fast theyve been giving pirates a hard time in these waters good boulanax hesitated then went on i hope youll excuse me o best one but i just recalled im late for an appointment good day farewell he hurried off sostratos suspected that the appointment was mythical that boulanax had heard as much good news about menedemos as he could stand selling truffles or wine or crimson dye in athens wouldnt have impressed him that was commerce and commerce was vulgar but thinking of a new type of war galley and burning pirate ships things like those were a different story they helped the polis something every rhodian citizen aspired to do boulanax couldnt look down his nose at menedemos for them no matter how much he might want to after glancing around in vain for another wrestling partnerthe men he saw were too small to make a fair matchsostratos went back to the javelin range and got in a few more throws then he rubbed himself down with fresh olive oil and scraped it from his sandy sweaty skin with a curved bronze strigil he put on his chiton and left the gymnasion the agora lay close by it was smaller and less storied than athens but to sostratos it was home hed come here with his father or with a pedagogue since he was a little boy here rhodians gathered to spread and talk over the news of the day and here rhodians and all sorts of foreigners gathered to buy and sell and trade even so late in the sailing season sostratos heard hellenes speaking several different dialects dorians from rhodes ionians with their dropped rough breathings athenians who called the tongue glotta instead of glossa and the sea thalatta instead of thalassa oldfashioned cypriots the buzzing lisping sounds of those who used aiolic and macedonians whose native tongue was hardly greek at all phoenicians flavored greek with their own harsh guttural accent swaggering keltic mercenaries turned it musical lykians spoke sneezingly karians and lydians did their best to beat hellenes at their own game andsostratos eyed the fellow with interestthere was an italian in a toga a samnite or perhaps even a roman from farther up the peninsula sostratos had no use for romans on the aphroditeslast trip west three years earlier a roman trireme had almost sunk her he strolled through the market square mostly listening or watching now and then pausing to examine merchandise or to gossip or to spend an obolos for a handful of chickpeas fried in olive oil the name of demetrios son of antigonos was on a lot of mens lips with his youth and energyand with his spectacular swoop on athenshe seemed to have eclipsed his father in many peoples minds what will demetrios do next was a question sostratos heard again and again he heard it so often in fact he finally lost patience and said demetrios will do whatever antigonos tells him to do thats what hes antigonos right arm and right hand yes with his brother philippos the left but antigonos is the brain and the heart and how do you know so much about it o marvelous one sneered the last what will demetrios do nextsayer a man who stood behind a table full of painted terracotta statuettes because i got back from athens less than a month ago sostratos answered because i heard demetrios speak in the assembly and heard how he always gave credit to his father for everything he did because i had supper with him when my cousin and i sold him truffles and wine and because antigonos has been an important marshal for more than thirty years nowsince the days of philip of macedon and hes not going to disappear like so much dandelion fluff the man with the table next to the statuettesellers laughed guess he told you lapheides lapheides remained unquelled huh he said antigonos is as old as zeus by now hes almost as sly as zeus too sostratos said forget demetrios would you want antigonos for an enemy would you want rhodes to have antigonos for an enemy i know i wouldnt id rather have him than demetrios lapheides said stubbornly sostratos wondered how some people could be so blind and how rhodes could hope to survive if they were the only answer occurring to him was that other poleis also had their share of such fools and so things evened out that left him imperfectly reassured dont you see he said almost pleading you cant have demetrios without antigonos because demetrios doesnt do anything his father doesnt tell him to he screws pretty womenlots of em by what people say lapheides replied was he changing the subject or did he honestly think that was a real comeback to what sostratos had said sostratos wasnt sure but suspected the worst he said the best thing that could happen to rhodes would be for both antigonos and demetrios he used the dual number to show the two of them made a natural pairto forget all about her grammatical subtleties were lost on lapheides the statuetteseller stuck out his bristly chin and said im not afraid of em youre surely swiftfooted akhilleus come again sostratos said taking the sarcasm for a compliment lapheides preened sostratos sighed hed feared the statuetteseller would baukis turned a pirouette in the courtyard the hem of her long chiton flew up for a moment displaying a pair of shapely ankles menedemos watched appreciatively while doing his best not to be noticed at it she was showing off for his father not for him sounding anxious she asked do i look all right menedemos couldnt help dipping his head philodemos eyes fortunately were on baukis the older man dipped his head too you look fine my dear he said there for once he and menedemos agreed completely his wife clapped her hands together in excitement gold glittered on her fingers and on her wrists and in her ears one of her rings held a big deepgreen emerald philodemos had bought for himselffor her in other wordsafter menedemos got a good many of the precious stones from a merchant skipper from alexandria i get to go out in the city baukis saidsqueaked really she clapped her hands again i get to go out in the city without a veil i even get to go out of the city without a veil philodemos muttered something but had the sense not to make it any too clear the parade to the temple of hera eight or ten stadia south of the city wallout beyond the graveyardswas a festival the women of rhodes looked forward to every year it gave them a momentary taste of the free and open life custom kept them from living most of the time clouds drifted across the sky the setting sun tinged them with pink i hope it doesnt rain baukis exclaimed that would be awful philodemos and menedemos shared an amused glance both of them were weatherwise i dont think you need to worry about that my dear philodemos said and menedemos dipped his head no rain in those clouds that shower we had day before yesterday was enough to lay the dust but we shouldnt expect much more till later in the rainy season oh good baukis smile showed her projecting front teeth but it also showed how very happy she was if you two sailors tell me its so then it must be she pointed at philodemos and if it does rain now ill blame you you know that dont you of course people always blame me for everything that goes wrong around here menedemos father answered the rains bound to be my fault too baukis stuck out her tongue at him he made as if to swat her on the backside they both laughed no persian torturer could have devised anything more excruciating to menedemos than the casual happy byplay between them philodemos went on make sure you stay with lysistratos wife and the other women of the neighborhood mind you you know how the young rowdies get when the women come out he lowered his brows a little as he looked toward menedemos scandals on nights of religious processions and festivals did happen plenty of comedies revolved around who met whom or who ravished whom on such nights and menedemos had stolen a kiss or two and once or twice more than a kiss or two during festivals but he just smiled back at his father philodemos might be fretting about him and some other woman but wasnt worrying about him and baukis ill be careful baukis promised and now id better go or else ill be late she waved to philodemos and then plainly as an afterthought to menedemos and hurried toward the door that left menedemos and his father standing in the courtyard by themselves they turned away from each other both seeming nervous about being alone together menedemos cocked his head to one side and listened to baukis and other women out and about calling greetings to one another the same excitement rang in all their voices they were out on a holiday out doing something special out doing something they thought was wonderful and what will you do while the women are having their festival philodemos asked suddenly swinging back toward menedemos go out into the city and see if you can grab one and drag her off into the darkness somewhere while shes on her way home did you ever do that father when you were younger did you have a favorite spot near the route of the procession where youd wait and hope for someone pretty to pass by menedemos asked never mind me his father said a little too quickly but then philodemos rallied i never brought scandal to the family and youd better not either now answer my question what are you going to do tonight me i was going over to uncle lysistratos house myself to play sostratos a game or two of diagrammismos he just bought himself a new game board and pieces menedemos smiled now we can play with dogs even if we dont go out hunting hares pah you and your foolishness but philodemos dipped his head well go on then thats not a bad way to spend some time and if you put a little money on who takes how many dogs you wont want to get too drunk for fear of playing like an idiot and costing yourself some silver sostratos never likes to drink much when hes playing games menedemos said and then hurried out of the house before his father could start singing hymns of praise to his cousin hed heard too many of those and didnt care to listen to another when he got to the door of his uncles house sostratos opened it the slaves have gone to bed he said ill keep the lamps filled and the wine comingnot that we ought to drink a lot the game deserves a clear head slaves are lazy creatures menedemos said forgetting that theyd no doubt been working since the sun came up he set a hand on his cousins shoulder i told my father youd want to go easy on the wine you know me we know each other wed better by now like it or not by sostratos tone he wasnt sure he did always like it he stepped aside to let menedemos in come on ive got the game board set up in the andron as menedemos found when he went into the mens chamber sostratos had also arranged the lamps so they shone on the board to best advantage a bowl of olives and another of figs sat on the little round table by it so the cousins could snack as they played sostratos dipped up two cups of wine from the mixing bowl when menedemos sipped he said what is this one of wine to three of water exactly sostratos said thats a little too weak for an ordinary drink but it should be about right when we have to pay attention to what were doing to menedemos it was too weak anyhow but he let it pass he sat down in front of the white pieces sostratos in front of the black diagrammismos was played on a twelvebytwelve square board each player had thirty men deployed at the start of the game on every other square of the first five rows playing the white pieces was supposed to give a slight advantage menedemos knew he would need all the help he could get and probably more besides he took hold of one of the bone dogs and shoved it forward one square sostratos answered with a move on the far side of the board the struggle developed rapidly whenever menedemos moved his dogs so that a black piece was between two white ones either vertically horizontally or diagonally he captured the enemy dog whenever his cousin got a white between two blacks menedemos dog was lost a clever move could capture more than one piece at a time a dog could also be sacrificed losing itself to capture one or with luck more of his opponents pieces a piece could leap over an enemy to an open square just beyond but did not necessarily capture by doing so sostratos massed his dogs into a formation experienced players called a polis menedemos tried to match him but his mind wasnt altogether on the game before too long he was down to one lonely dog and sostratos with eight black pieces left hunted him down and captured him got you he said picking up the last white dog try again yes lets menedemos answered youre a better player than i am but i can put up more of a fight than that they rearranged the dogs menedemos went first again he did give sostratos a tougher game the second time but lost again sostratos set up the dogs to show a crucial position late in the game if youd gone here instead of here you would have had me in trouble he said moving a piece different from the one menedemos had chosen do you see afraid i do menedemos said ruefully and i see youre going to bring that polluted board along when we sail next season arent you so you can thump me like a drum every night it wont be so bad said sostratos who plainly intended to do just that you win some of the time when we play and you get better when we play regularly ive seen that and watching is fun too itll help keep the whole crew happy maybe menedemos sounded unconvinced ill tell you though when somebody whos watching a game says you thickskinned idiot you should have moved there i dont think its fun i want to clout the whipworthy villain mm thats true so do i sostratos said most people know better but one bigmouth is plenty to ruin things he paused and muttered then spoke aloud teleutas would do something like that and laugh afterwards he probably would but many goodbyes to him hes sailed with us four years in a row and thisll be the last menedemos said about time his cousin reached for the dogs which sat on the table by the board one more game after that i think ill turn in all right why not menedemos set up the pieces with him he made the first move again he gave sostratos a hard fight again sostratos beat him sighing menedemos helped his cousin put the dogs back in the drawer built into the game board almost he said almost but not quite do you terrorize uncle lysistratos too father and i are pretty even as a matter of fact sostratos replied i havent played your father lately from what i remember though and from what my father says hes the dangerous one in the family he would be menedemos said darkly he hadnt played diagrammismos with his father since he was a youth hed lost then but marked it down to youthful inexperience he didnt want to try it again now knowing his father hed get trounced again and would get sardonic lessons on the game along with the trouncing that he could do without sostratos ignored his comment which was probably just as well come on ill walk you to the door he said do you want a torchbearer to light your way back to your house i can wake a slave if i were going across town i would menedemos answered across the street not likely my dear though i thank you for the thought farewell he went out through the door sostratos closed it after him menedemos looked toward his own house no lights showed at any of the windows he could see his fathers room faced toward uncle lysistratos house it was as dark as the rest so presumably the older man had already gone to bed bare feet silent on the hardpacked dirt of the street menedemos went around till he could see all the windows no not a lamp lit anywhere the sky was dark too the moon wouldnt rise till midnight the festival of hera took place on the night of the thirdquarter moon zeus wandering star had blazed low in the west when the evening began but it was setting now buildings kept menedemos from being sure whether it had already slipped below the horizon kronos wandering star dimmer and yellower still glowed in the southwestern sky it was the only wanderer menedemos could see only starlight and a few lamps shining through shutter slats in other houses gave his eyes something to work with someone hurried down the street not far away menedemos hand fell to the knife he wore on his belt maybe i should have had a torchbearer after all he thought as in any hellenic city night was the time when the thieves and robbers came out rhodes had fewer than most or so menedemos had always thought but meeting even one could prove disastrous this fellow though ignored menedemos he hurried south toward the center of town menedemos brought a hand up to his mouth to muffle a chuckle the other man was no thief except perhaps of love he was probably off to grab a womanmaybe one woman in particular maybe any woman he couldwhen the celebrants came back from hera s temple menedemos had done the same thing himself in years gone by sometimes hed had good luck sometimes none another man and then another also slipped south menedemos stayed where he was only one woman mattered to him right now he knew baukis would be coming back to this part of town to this very street he didnt have to go looking for her she would be here and then what he asked himself shes still your fathers wife if you do anything like what youre thinking of doing he tossed his head he hadnt done anything yet or hadnt done anything much anyhow one kiss in three yearswhat was that it couldnt be anything you shouldnt be out here you should be in bed you should be asleep relentless as the furies relentless as storm waves his conscience battered him at last to his surprise it beat him back inside the house maybe i really will curl up and go to sleep ill feel good about it in the morning for him feeling virtuous was a pleasant novelty he lay down but sleep no matter how coaxed would not come he stared up at the ceiling his thoughts full of trouble he knew what he should do and he knew what he wanted to do and the one had nothing to do with the other presently the darkness in his room grew a little less absolute a strip of moonlight came through the window menedemos muttered a curse not too long after the moon came up he heard in the distance hundredsno thousandsof womens voices raised in song as they returned to the polis from the shrine the women of rhodes were praising the majesty of whitearmed hera the chorus grew louder and sweeter as they drew nearer of hera i sing she of the golden throne to whom rheia gave birth the women chanted queen of the immortals who is outstanding for her beauty and the wife and sister of loudthundering zeus the glorious one of whom all the blessed on lofty olympos stand in awe and honor like zeus who delights in thunder zeus menedemos said it wasnt a prayer he sprang to his feet and threw on his chiton when he left his room he closed the door behind him anyone walking by would think he remained inside quiet as an owl gliding on softfeathered wings he went downstairs and left the house the womens song filled the city as one group after another left the main procession and went off toward their homes here and there menedemos also heard squeals and giggles and a couple of shrieks as rhodian men paid calls of one sort or another on the returning women voices raised in song came up the street toward menedemos house and the one where sostratos lived menedemos ducked into a moon shadow blacker than the ink he and his cousin had sold in athens farewell he heard again and again as women left the group left the festival and returned to their homes and their everyday lives and there came baukis arm in arm with aunt timokrate both of them still hymning the praises of zeus consort they stopped in front of sostratos mothers house good night dear timokrate said farewell baukis said wasnt that wonderful it always is the older woman answered to be one with the goddess to be out in the city baukis said to be out of the city timokrate laughed there is that she agreed then she yawned and laughed again to be out when im usually sleeping i dont think ill sleep all night baukis voice thrummed with excitement like a plucked kithara string all right dear i know i will aunt timokrate sounded amused and tolerant of her sisterinlaws youth she opened the door said good night one more time and went inside baukis sighed then picked up the song of praise once more as she started to her own home menedemos hardly heard her above the hammering of his own heart you can let her go in ahead of you then go in yourself and go back to bed no one would be the wiser you can he stepped out of the shadow baukis hymn to hera suddenly stopped she froze whos there only me menedemos voice stumbled his legs as light with fear as if he were going into a sea fight he came toward her oh menedemos baukis reply was only the tiniest thread of whisper what are you doing here he almost laughed but it wasnt funny and he knew it wasnt and she had to know as much too without a word without a sound he reached out and brushed her cheek with the back of his hand it could have ended there she might have flinched she might have fled she might have screamed instead she sighed and shivered as if a winter downright macedonian had all at once descended on this tiny corner of rhodes oh menedemos she said again this time in an altogether different tone of voice she shivered again we shouldnt i know he answered but a shrug ive been trying to pretend this isnt here for three years now every spring ive run away to sea so i wouldnt have to think about you every fall when i come home he half turned away but then swung back drawn as irresistibly as iron by a lodestone he stroked her cheek again just for the fragment of a heartbeat her breath warmed his palm but he was already on fireor was that ice baukis started to turn away too but found herself as unable as menedemos we shouldnt she said again she looked up at the starcrowded sky menedemos stared entranced at the smooth line of her throat in moonlight maybe love was a disease but how many other diseases did the physicians know where the sufferer wanted anything but to be cured afterwards he never knew which of them moved first one instant they stood close together but not touching the next they were in each others arms each one trying to squeeze the breath from the other the soft firmness of baukis pressed against him drove menedemos even further into that delicious madness everyone said he ought to fear and he was afraid but not of that madness only of what might come from it his lips found hers the kiss was deep and desperate drowningdeep and he never wanted to come up for air at last he had to he trailed more kisses along the angle of her jaw the side of her neck the lobe of her ear her fluttering eyelids when his lips touched her cheek he tasted tears but she clung to him as if her ship had sunk and he were the only floating spar she still might have fled when he cupped the round fullness of her breast through her tunic he thought for a moment she would even if her firm nipple thrust against the soft wool of the chiton but then with what might have been laugh or sob or both commingled she clung to him more fiercely than ever they kissed again baukis moaned down deep in her throat menedemos led her back to the shadowed wall where hed waited some things even the silent moon should not see baukis bent forward oh she said softly when he went into her he set his hands on her hips just where they swelled from her narrow waist she looked back over her shoulder at him hurry menedemos also knew he had to be quick and did his best but as much as he wanted to hurry he wanted to please baukis more if he didnt after waiting so long the irony there was too cruel to contemplate as his pleasure mounted and his breath came short he listened anxiously to make sure hers did too then a small mewling cry burst from her lips she quivered inside and out menedemos groaned as he spent himself baukis pulled away from him and straightened her hikedup chiton fell down around her ankles once more darling menedemos said quickly setting his own tunic to rights he kissed her again i do love you yes baukis sounded as if shed only half heard him her thoughts were elsewhere ill go in first and i wont bar the door if you dont hear a commotion youll know your fathermy husbandis still asleep she gulped he wondered if she would start to cry guilt filled some women after they were unfaithful the innkeepers wife sostratos had known in ioudaia was of that sort but baukis gathered herself finishing and the slaves too of course and the slaves menedemos echoed well have to act as though nothings happened in the morning you know she dipped her head oh yes ill remember dont you forget that was probablyno certainlygood advice menedemos knew how much his father tried him the temptation to fling this in philodemos face might grow overwhelming he would have to hold it down from the very first hed seen this could be death between them if it ever came to pass now it had and now the secret had to stay a secret forever he kissed baukis once more she clung to him for a moment then twisted free im going if theres any trouble ill try to let you know i she stopped had she been about to say love you he never knew she squared her shoulders and almost as if marching into battle went into the house menedemos waited there in the shadows he cocked his head to one side anxiously listening all he heard were an owl and off in the distance a last hymn to hera that suddenly stopped as the woman singing it found her way home no sound of any sort came from inside the house he waited a little longer all the same then as quietly as he could he went to the door he opened it slid inside and closed it behind him when he reached for the bar he made sure he took firm hold of it and didnt drop it as he set it in the brackets the clatter would have roused the whole household he breathed a silent sigh of relief after setting it in place at the edge of the courtyard he paused again to listen everything was quiet but for a horrible rasping snore coming from sikons room sleeping on his back menedemos thought whenever the cook rolled over he sounded like a sawmill quickly menedemos crossed the courtyard tiptoed upstairs and ducked into his own room he barred his door as carefully as he had the one to the house then he lay down stared at the ceiling as he had earlier in the night and let out a long sigh i did it he murmured i really did it that wasnt pride talking he didnt quite know what it was guilt shame some of those more than hed expected adultery for adulterys sake was losing its appeal but what had passed between baukis and him was more than adultery for adulterys sake and what he felt had little to do with pride even though guilt and shame were mixed into it they were only partand a small part at thatof what crashed through him like storm waves up till now hed never made love with a woman with whom he was in love all at once he fully understood why the passion was so powerful so dangerous the only thing he could think of was making love to baukis again icant do that he realized and the knowledge burned like a vipers venom the next time baukis made love she would lie in his fathers arms the mere idea filled menedemos with fury hed long known that if he was to lie with his fathers wife that could make philodemos want to kill him hed never dreamt lying with baukis might make him want to kill his father i cant do that either he thought part of him wished hed stayed here alone in his room the whole night long the rest though the rest wanted yearned for craved more of baukis than he could get from a quick coupling in darkest shadow he wanted he wanted to yawn and did enormously next thing he knew the morning sun was streaming through that eastfacing window he yawned once more and stretched and got out of bed had last night been real memory flooded back it had he put on his chiton and went out into the courtyard intent on getting some breakfast his father was already there talking with one of the house slaves good day the older man said when menedemos emerged i wondered if youd sleep the sun around and only come out at night like an owl hail father was all menedemos said in reply he glanced at the sun it had risen almost three hours earlier or he missed his guess philodemos eyes went the same way dont tell me you were playing games with sostratos all night long menedemos father said hes not in the habit of staying up so late you went prowling for women afterwards didnt you you must have found one too eh a southbound crane flew by overhead menedemos watched it without saying anything it was a straggler most of its kind had gone south nearly a month before with an exasperated sigh philodemos asked did you bring scandal down on our house will some angry husband lurk in the street outside waiting for the chance to stick a knife in you still watching the crane menedemos tossed his head no father you dont have to worry about that true you wouldnt need to lurk in the street if you decided to knife me you must have found some slut then a wench whos as sunk in vice as you are philodemos growled rage and horror filled menedemos you fool youre talking about your own wife one more thing he couldntmustntsay this felt like something out of a tragedy and was baukis listening up there in the womens quarters how could she be doing anything else what sort of fight would she have to make now just to hold her face straight by the dog of egypt son what am i going to do with you philodemos said menedemos only shrugged i dont know father if youll excuse me he hurried off to the kitchen where he got a couple of barley rolls some olive oil and a cup of watered wine for breakfast he watered it less than he might have sikon who was kneading dough for the days baking leered at him menedemos ignored the cook he made a point of ignoring him made it so obviously sikon couldnt keep from laughing philodemos came into the kitchen too sikon immediately fell silent and started kneading as if his life depended on it menedemos would sooner have dealt with the cook than with his father philodemos wagged a finger under his nose when are you going to stop your nonsense and make a proper man of yourself he demanded admiral eudemos thinks i make a proper man now menedemos answered he worries about what you do at sea i worry about what you do ashore and what do you suppose hed say to that if he knew about it his father snapped from some of the stories he was telling when we celebrated after my patrol in the dikaiosyne hes chased a woman or twodozen himself menedemos said philodemos made a disgusted noise menedemos pointed at him and what about you father i asked you beforewhen you were younger didnt you ever try your luck when the women were coming home from a festival as long as you think i had some other mans wife this is another verse of the same old song i hate it hut i can put up with it but if you ever find out it was baukis he shivered and raised the cup of wine to his lips philodemos turned a dull red never mind me were not talking about me were talking about you menedemos could guess what that probably meant he kept quiet though so could sikon and the cook knew no such restraint he let out a loud rude snort then attacked the bread dough more fiercely than ever as if trying to pretend hed done no such thing from dull red philodemos went the color of iron in a smiths fire his glare seared sikon you mind your own business he snarled yes master sikon muttered one of the few times menedemos had ever heard him acknowledge he was a slave and not the lord of the household philodemos also heard the submission heard it and took it as no less than his due his attention swung back to menedemos were talking about you he repeated i want you to behave respectably from now on do you hear me yes father all menedemos wanted was escape he told the truth he did hear his father as for behaving respectably after last night too late for that or was it what was respectability but not getting caught no one knew what had passed but baukis and him as long as that stayed true he could go on living under the same roof with his father he said ill do my best gruffly philodemos said youd better but he sounded at least a little mollified maybe he hadnt expected even so much fie turned on his heel and left the kitchen after menedemos finished breakfast he went back out to the courtyard he hadnt gone more than a couple of paces before stopping dead along with his father baukis stood there looking at a plant in the garden she went pale when she saw him natural you have to act natural he shouted to himself good day he said and hoped his voice didnt shake too much hail she managed in something like her usual tones to menedemos vast relief his father noticed nothing amiss philodemos said now that weve had some rain things are starting to sprout they certainly are menedemos agreed baukis looked down at her feet menedemos remembered standing behind her and he felt his face heating going on as if nothing had happened would be harder than hed ever dreamt if he didnt betray himself his fathers wife was liable to shes only seventeen he reminded himself shes a woman yes but barely perhaps fearing to give the game away baukis retreated to the house menedemos father rounded on him now that youve slept half the day away like a lazy hound what will you do with the rest of it i dont know father i was going to go out into the city menedemos answered and go looking for the house of the woman you debauched last night philodemos said wasnt once enough to satisfy you how much trouble will you find for yourself once wasnt anywhere close to enough menedemos thought aloud he said i know where she lives but i dont intend to go anywhere near there that was a truth but a deceptive truth it made his father roll his eyes menedemos went on by zeus of the aegis father i dont the oath made philodemos take him a little more seriously he added my life would get more complicated than its worth if i did well at least you realize that much philodemos said i thought youd be blind to it the way cockhounds usually are go on then menedemos left doing his best to saunter and not flee once out in the street he sighed loud and long no he hadnt begun to realize how hard this would be there had been years when seeing the aphroditedrawn up out of the water at the great harbor in rhodes left sostratos sad that seemed less true now than in times gone by he had thought of the merchant galley as something almost magical like hermes winged sandals she could sweep him away to lands strange and mysterious and what could be more marvelous than that after going back to athens to the polis for which hed pined like a man mourning a lost love he thought he had an answer to that which he hadnt before what could be more marvelous than going off to lands strange and mysterious coming back to a home you loved khremes the carpenter waved to sostratos hail son of lysistratos how are you today well thanks sostratos answered and yourself pretty well khremes said my son gave me a grandchild this summer while you were at sea congratulations sostratos said youre young to be a grandfather that was no idle compliment he doubted khremes was much above fifty and most men among the hellenes didnt marry till they were thirty or so sure enough the carpenter chuckled in mingled embarrassment and pride ill tell you what it is were a hotpronged bunch my family i liked the thought of screwing without paying for it so well i talked my father into letting me wed early and aristion hes the same way i had to marry him off i was afraid hed get some respectable girl in trouble you dont want that sostratos agreed a feud between families doesnt do anybody any good they chatted a little while longer then went their separate ways sostratos strolled south along the edge of the great harbor eyeing the ships tied up at the quays or drawn up onto dry land most of them were as familiar to him as acquaintances he might meet in the agora every so often he would note one that had had some major work done since the last time he saw her he started with the same surprise he might have shown on seeing a bald man who came out sporting a wig he also saw a few ships that were new to him one in particular gave him pause a merchant galley bigger than the aphrodite and almost lean enough to make a pirate ship pointing to her he asked a harborside lounger what ship is this o best one the man didnt answer he might have been afflicted with deafness or perhaps with idiocy he might have been but he wasnt sostratos knew exactly what his trouble was an obolos effected a miraculous cure once the lounger had popped the little silver coin into his mouth he said thats the thalia friend abundance eh a good name for a merchant ship sostratos said who owns her he wondered if the other rhodian would have the hubris to try to squeeze a second obolos from him the fellow started to then visibly thought better of it he said she belongs to rhodokles son of simos does she sostratos said and the lounger dipped his head hes come into some silver then rhodokles was a competitor up till now hed never been a serious competitor his ships had all been older and smaller than the aphrodite and the other vessels philodemos and lysistratos owned the thalia though could go anywhere on the inner sea and could get where she was going as fast as anything afloat thoughtfully sostratos asked has he got any others like her this time the other man did dummy up instead of paying him again sostratos turned his back that earned him some of the hottest earthiest curses hed ever got he ignored them and walked away the lounger cursed louder which won him no money sostratos paused by a large ramshackle warehouse only a long spit from the sea no one stirred there till he stuck his head in the doorway and called somebodys giving away decorated drinking cups in the agora he waited he didnt have to wait long a deepvoiced gutturally accented rumble came from the bowels of the building giving them away out came himilkon the phoenician swaddled in his long robe a gold ring gleamed in one ear more gold shone on several fingers when he spotted sostratos suspicions spread across his narrow hooknosed face you liar you cozener you trickster he began and went on from there when he ran out of greek he switched to aramaic since hed taught sostratos that language the rhodian followed some of it even if he hadnt the sounds would have been plenty to show himilkons displeasure with its coughs and grunts and choking noises aramaic was a tongue made to show anger when himilkon at last slowed down a little sostratos used a sentence of aramaic of his own peace be unto you my friend and to you also peace himilkon said grudgingly so long as you do not trick an honest man like that what do you want besides trouble i mean trouble me no sostratos spoke in aramaic as the phoenician merchant had having learned the language he was glad to get a chance to use it to keep it fresh he did his best to look innocent instead of tossing his head to show that he hadnt meant to cause trouble he shook it he wanted to act as much like a native speaker as he could himilkon noticed very little went on around himilkon that he didnt notice still in his own language he said most ioniansin aramaic all hellenes were ionians probably because aramaicspeakers had met them firstmost ionians i say who took the trouble to learn my speech and precious few care about any language but their own would not bother with the gestures my folk use if i do something my master i want to do it well i want to do it as i should in greek sostratos would never have called any man his master in aramaic though it was only a polite phrase another illustration of the difference between the two tongues and of the differences in the thoughts of the men who spoke them the rhodian cast about for a word in himilkons language failing to find it he dropped back into greek when i do something i want to do it thoroughly your slave has known you for some years now and has noticed this about you yes even speaking greek himilkon kept flowery aramaic turns of phrase sostratos tried not to talk like a hellene when using aramaic how well he succeeded might have been a different story sostratos wondered how many people had noticed that about him when men talked about him while he wasnt there did they say things like sostratos will drive you mad trying to nail down every last little detail he hoped they did a reputation for taking pains was far from the worst thing in the world himilkon returned to aramaic if you did not come here to wring my liver with your japes my master for what reason did you assail my peace to see what you got while menedemos and i were in athens sostratos replied he had to pause for a heartbeat to come up with the secondperson plural masculine verb form aramaic conjugations took gender into account which greek verb forms except participles didnt to learn if you have anything we might want for the next sailing season when you bought papyrus from me last winter you called me a thief himilkon said but now you want to do more business eh i had to beat you down to a price where i could add in my profit and still sell in athens at a level where other people could afford to buy sostratos saidin greek the idea being too complex for his rusty aramaic i managed to do that and besides tell me youve never called me such names and ill tell you youre a liar i himilkon was the picture of affronted dignity he too went on in greek i am calm i am restrained i am judicious sostratos laughed out loud himilkon glared i am going to bash you in the head with a board a calm restrained judicious board i have no doubt sostratos replied that made himilkon laugh no one who grew up speaking aramaic would ever think to call a board restrained or judicious you hellenes can do strange things with your language that is probably why you are such a peculiar folk now sostratos reminded he was a hellene tossed his head to show he disagreed were not strange he said its all you folk who arent hellenes who are strange himilkon laughed raucously no o marvelous one this time you are wrong everybody from karia to carthage as the saying goes thinks hellenes are the ones who are peculiar and if you go farther east if you go among phoenicians or egyptians or persians well they will all say the same thing this proves my point is it not so sostratos laughed once more to hear a barbarian use a stock tagline from any number of philosophical dialogues the rhodian also tossed his head again im sorry my dear but it proves nothing of the sort what why not himilkons already swarthy features darkened with anger well wouldnt everyone from karia to carthage say egyptians are strange because of all the funny animalheaded gods they worship and the picturewriting they use certainly egyptians are strange himilkon answered they do everything the opposite of the way most people do that made sostratos laugh yet again for herodotos had written almost the same thing about the egyptians sostratos went on and wouldnt everyone say the ioudaioi are strange with their god whom no one can see and who forbids them from doing so many perfectly ordinary things oh yes the ioudaioi are strange too no doubt about it they are full of wicked customs himilkon spoke with the certainty and scorn only a neighbor could have some people sostratos remarked some people mind you might even say phoenicians are strange what himilkon stared at him what a daft notion phoenicians strange we are the salt of the earth the most ordinary folk around how could anyone even an idiothe eyed sostratos in a speculative waythink phoenicians are strange well for one thing you burn your own children in times of trouble sostratos replied that is not strangeness that is piety to show the gods we are their slaves and would give them anything and everything we have himilkon said it is only because other folk are not religious enough to do the same that it seems odd to them there you are sostratos pounced whatever any one folk does will seem odd to other people that doesnt prove the folk really is strange well maybe himilkon said sostratos thought hed vanquished the phoenician but himilkon added of course you hellenes do a great many odd things which is why everyone else thinks you are peculiar oh never mind sostratos said in some irritation we were going to go into your warehouse when all this came up i suppose we were himilkon didnt seem angry about the argument belatedly sostratos realized he was lucky some people got offended when you presumed to disagree with them he didnt want himilkon offended not when he did business with him the phoenician asked where do you think you will go next spring that will have something to do with what i show you im not certain yet sostratos said perhaps alexandria ive never been there but a new wideopen city like that gives a man plenty of chances for profit alexandria himilkon echoed now there i have never been either in your grandfathers day you know or maybe your greatgrandfathers rhodes was a new wideopen city like that maybe but sostratos didnt sound convinced rhodes never had all the wealth of egypt to draw on though not back then she didnt the phoenician merchant said now she does with all the trade from ptolemaios realm that went through rhodes these days that held some truth quite a bit in fact himilkon ducked into the warehouse and gestured for sostratos to follow here come along with me sostratos was glad to obey himilkons place of business fascinated him for he could never be sure what would turn up there he paused inside the doorway to let his eyes adapt to the gloom in the warehouse he needed to see where he was going for the passageways between cabinets and shelves were narrow things stuck out ready either to trip him or to poke him in the eye his nostrils twitched himilkon stocked frankincense myrrh cinnamon and pepper along with other spices and incenses the rhodian had more trouble identifying here himilkon paused and took down a box of curious workmanship made from a pale wood sostratos had never seen before tell me what you think of this with a melodramatic flourish himilkon opened the box amber sostratos exclaimed the box was full of the precious honeycolored stuff it too had a faint spicy odor or maybe sostratos was still smelling all the other things in the warehouse he reached out and picked up a piece even unpolished like this it was smooth against his palm is that a fly trapped inside it he said bringing it up close to his face for a better look let me see himilkon took it from him some kind of bug anyway you find that fairly often in amber you know that piece you picked up isnt the only one in the box with something in it i do know that about bugs sostratos said i just wonder how they could get into the stone in the first place its almost as if they got stuck in pine resin and then the resin somehow petrified i dont see how that could happen himilkon said i dont either sostratos admitted but it does look that way doesnt it i suppose so the phoenician said but i didnt show you the amber on account of bugs i showed it to you because it is something that comes down from the north alexandria has all manner of strange and wonderful things that come up the nile but does alexandria have amber i do not think so will the jewelers of alexandria want amber there i think they will sostratos thought they would too no matter what he thought he didnt care to admit it to himilkon he said i dont even know yet if i want amber o best one that depends on how much i have to pay for it and on what i can hope to get for it in alexandria well yes of course himilkon said i am not in this for my health either you know if i cannot make a profit i will not sell you the lovely stuff at all if i cant make a profit i wont buy sostratos said they glared at each other sostratos had looked for nothing else in some exasperation he asked how much do you want for all the amber you have in this box three minai himilkon replied at once three minai sostratos made as if he couldnt believe his ears actually the price was more reasonable than hed expected but he couldnt let the phoenician know that or hed lose the dicker before it even began he threw his hands in the air to show the dismay he was supposed to be feeling thats ridiculous he said if i want my blood sucked ill go to an inn and let the bedbugs do it himilkon made a face as if hed just taken a big swig of vinegar funny man he said you hellenes write these comedies to go on the stage this i know are you practicing to do one of them i know you want to write things not comedies by the dog of egypt and i wasnt joking sostratos answered youve given me a price you cant possibly expect me to pay the more he pretended to be outraged the more real outrage he felt he knew that made no rational sense but hed had it happen before in other dickers setting hands on hips himilkon haughtily demanded well o marvelous one how much does your majesty think the amber is worth oh a minas probably a little high but not too sostratos said one mina one himilkons eyes bulged the veins in his neck swelled so did the smaller ones on his forehead he let loose with a torrent of aramaic that should have burned down not only his warehouse but half the city it amounted to no but he was a good deal more emphatic about it than that have a care my dear or youll do yourself an injury sostratos said oh no oh no himilkon shook his head too upset to impersonate the hellenes i may do you an injury but not myself you are a brigand a bandit a pirate he ran out of greek and went back to his own language again this sounded even hotter than his first eruption gently gently now sostratos held his hands out in front of him in a placating gesture since youve let yourself get so overwrought i suppose i could go up to a mina and twenty drakhmai the rhodian spoke with the air of a man making a great concession and so in a way he was he never liked being the first one to shift his price in a haggle now he had to see how much himilkon would moveand whether himilkon was inclined to move at all when the phoenician kept on fuming in aramaic sostratos feared he wouldnt move three minai wasnt a bad price but it wasnt a great price either sostratos hoped to drive him down furtherand the rhodian knew he could get a lot more in alexandria especially if he sold the amber chunk by chunk and not as a single lot at last grudgingly himilkon said i dont suppose i would starve in the streetquiteif you paid me two minai ninety drakhmai he hadnt moved much but he had moved he wasnt wedded to three drakhmai as his price that was what sostratos had needed to know you only came down half as much as i came up he complained by ashtarts pinktipped tits youre lucky i came down at all himilkon growled so i am sostratos thought but that agreement didnt show on his face he said youll have to come down some more too if were going to make a deal himilkon raised his eyes to the heavens as if asking the gods why theyd given him such a cruel and unfeeling opponent in this dicker i try to keep myself from being robbed i try to keep my family fed and what does it get me nothing thats what nothing not a single solitary thing here is amber the frozen tears of the gods brought down to the inner sea from beyond the lands of the kelts and wait hed roused sostratos curiosity what do you know about the country from which amber comes herodotos says its at the ends of the earth but no more than that all i know is its up in the north somewhere himilkon was plainly indifferent no the other thing i know is you wont see any of this amber ever again if you dont come closer to meeting my price you may be dreaming of making a killing in alexandria but you cant make a killing if you havent got the goods that unfortunately was true sostratos made the best comeback he could and you cant hope to make a profit on your amber if you ask an unreasonable price which i do not himilkon said indignantly that unfortunately was also true sostratos had no intention of admitting it he did say well i suppose i could come up another twenty drakhmai he sighed and spread his hands again as if to show he was being magnanimous beyond the bounds of reason by doing so himilkon came down another ten drakhmai he grumbled and scowled and fumed as if to show he was being put upon beyond the bounds of reason by doing so at length they settled on two minai fortyfive drakhmai sostratos couldnt get the phoenician to lower his price even another obolos part of him felt hed made a pretty good deal the part that had noted that even three minai wasnt a bad price the other part mourned because he hadnt been able to get himilkon down as far as hed hoped he shrugged if he couldnt decide whether to be pleased the phoenician probably had just as many doubts which meant they were within shouting distance of the right price do you have a scale sostratos asked i want to weigh the amber why himilkon was suspicion personified we already made the bargain yes of course sostratos said impatiently i want to know just how much i have though so i can tell my father oh all right himilkon grunted come this way i use it mostly to weigh spices sostratos followed him through the warren of the warehouse reflecting that theseus probably hadnt had a harder time finding his way through the labyrinth the rhodian also had another reason for wanting the amber weighed if he knew just how much he was getting himilkon couldnt make a chunk or two disappear before exchanging it for silver the amber turned out to weigh less than sostratos had expected that set him to worrying again was himilkon laughing at him behind his curly beard sostratos said let me take one piece to show my father i would not do this for just anyone mind you himilkon said for you and especially for lysistratos very well take one piece whichever you choose sostratos picked the one hed eyed before the one with the bug in it with it in his hand he hurried up to his house when he got there threissa was pouring water from an amphora onto the herb garden in the courtyard his father sat on a bench in the courtyard quietly but most attentively watching the snubnosed redheaded slave girl as far as sostratos knew his father had never done anything more than watch threissa a husband who bedded a slave in his household was asking for trouble from his wife sostratos himself had lain with her several times sometimes his lust got the better of him enough to overcome his disappointment at her lack of enthusiasm hail father sostratos said come see what ive got oh hail sostratos lysistratos said sostratos was convinced that until he spoke his father had had no idea he was there lysistratos reluctantly dragged his eyes away from the thracian slave girl and got to his feet what is it amber sostratos opened his hand to show the honeycolored jewel ive just bought quite a bit of it from himilkon you have and this is a sample lysistratos asked sostratos dipped his head well let me have a look his father said when sostratos gave him the amber he started to bring it up close to his face then broke off the gesture with a frustrated grimace it gets all blurry when i try to look at it the way i used to he grumbled readings a trial these days too he held the piece of amber out at arms length thats better it does seem to be of good quality im glad you think so i did too sostratos grin held real relief he and his father got on a lot better than menedemos and uncle philodemos for which he thanked the gods but he still felt nervous when he made a large purchase in rhodes on his own this wont be the only chunk you bought will it lysistratos asked oh no sostratos told exactly how much hed bought to the hemiobolos his father blinked then smiled i might have known youd be precise and precisely how much did you pay im assuming the rest was of the quality of this piece sostratos dipped his head again i thought it was he answered i paid two minai fortyfive drakhmai for all of it himilkon started out wanting three minai and he wouldnt come down much two minai fortyfive drakhmai lysistratos spoke in musing tones almost tasting the words he looked up into the sky his lips moving silently as he decided what he thought of that he wasnt such a finicky calculator as sostratos but he had more experience and perhaps better instincts after half a minute or so he smiled again euge thats very well done especially if you go to alexandria next spring you should get a fine price there thats just what i had in mind when i made the deal sostratos beamed im glad you think i was right egypt is rich in gold it has all manner of precious stonesi remember those fine emeralds your cousin got hold of a couple of years ago but ive never heard of any amber there the jewelers should slobber all over you the way dogs will if you come out with a piece of meat theres a pretty picture sostratos said and lysistratos laughed sostratos went on well get the rest when i bring himilkon the silver he talked about going to alexandria with amber too i trust it more hearing it from you i will say im a little surprised he let you bring home any amber at all his father said he told me he wouldnt have for most people but he was making an exception for meand especially for you sostratos answered i took that for a typical piece of phoenician flattery but maybe i was wrong well i am flattered that himilkon would trust the two of us so far lysistratos said weve done business with him for a while now and he knows were reliable hes pretty reliable too come to that as long as you keep an eye on him youd better sostratos exclaimed that little game he played just before we sailed buying up all the papyrus in town and then gouging me when i bought it from him it was cursed clever and i wish id thought of it myself hes sly no doubt of that lysistratos said but if a hellene cant stay up with a phoenician when it comes to tradewell he doesnt deserve to thats all he paused then changed the subject is your cousin well menedemos i think so though i havent seen much of him the past few days sostratos said why because i was talking with him this afternoon while you were down by the harbor and he just didnt seem himself lysistratos said half the time when i asked him something id have to ask him twice it was as though he wasnt really paying attention to me as though his mind were somewhere else he looked worried too and that made me worryabout him i wonder if hes had a love affair go wrong or if some husband discovered he was sniffing around where he shouldnt sostratos said thoughtfully thats what your description sounds like and ive seen him go through spells like that before sailing season before last he seemed awfully glad to get out of rhodes and he needed weeks away to get back to his old self i remember asking him about it but he wouldnt say anything thats strange all by itself for he usually likes to brag whatever happened it hit him hard maybe this is more of the same yes it could be his father also sounded thoughtful it certainly could im glad you have better sense than to leap headlong into foolish love affairs by the dog thank you sostratos said lysistratos set a hand on his shoulder sostratos laid his own hand on his fathers and thank you for not jumping down my throat all the time the way uncle philodemos does with menedemos philodemos wants things just so he always has lysistratos face tightened for a moment before he had a son he used to jump on me instead thats one reason i dont keep you on such a short leash as he does with menedemos he taught me not to and im more naturally easygoing than he is i know things wont always be just so and i try not to fret about it the way philodemos does and youre steadier than your cousin generally speaking for which i praise the gods i praise the gods that we do get along whatever the reasons sostratos said whenever i think of menedemos and uncle philodemos i know how lucky i am how lucky we are lysistratos corrected sostratos grinned he didnt mind that correction at all now ive had what i wanted for so long menedemos thought why arent i happier he had no trouble finding one of the reasons he wasnt happier he hadnt been able to lie with baukis since the night of the festival hed never found a time when either his father or some of the house slaves werent around hed paid several visits to brothels since but what he bought at a brothel made him feel good for a little while without solving his real problem which was that making love with someone he loved had proved fundamentally different from taking pleasure with a whore his father noticed him moping too though philodemos didnt know all of what he was noticing he even offered what from him amounted to sympathy of sorts if her husbands home now son you have to make the best of things till he goes away again no point to wandering around like a bitch whos just had her pups drowned menedemos was eating olives in the andron when his father came out with that bit of advice hed been about to spit out a pit instead he choked on it his father pounded him on the back the pit came loose he spat it across the mens chamber then wheezed thank you father any time philodemos answered you can suffocate on one of those polluted things if you arent careful and you arent lucky or isnt that what you meant well some of both menedemos said with a sigh philodemos said way youve been dragging around here way youve been muttering snatches of poetry when you think nobodys listening way youve well a lot of things show youve gone and fallen in love with whoever your latest wife is adulterys bad enough but loves worse because it makes you stupider i dont want you to do anything to get yourself in trouble and i dont want you to do anything to get the family in trouble if i talk to you now maybe i can keep you from acting too foolish maybe i hope so anyway he does care about me menedemos realized with no small astonishment he mostly has no idea how to show itit comes out as anger because i dont act the way he wants me tobut he does and what am i supposed to do about that it shamed him the mere idea of wanting his fathers wife had shamed him for yearsbut finally not enough to stop him he had it coming on account of the way he treats me had been in the back of his mindsometimes in the front of his mindever since if that wasnt true if he couldnt even pretend it was he started to cry it took him altogether by surprise one moment he was fine or thought he was and the next tears were streaming down his cheeks here now here now philodemos said awkwardly at least as startled as menedemos was himself it cant be as bad as that noits worse menedemos choked out once the tears started they didnt want to stop he saw his father as a series of shifting blurry shapes not as a man at all you see this is what love does to you but philodemos for a wonder didnt sound outraged or scornful he put his arm around menedemos a rough caress but a caress even so you think this never happened to me youd better think again menedemos was sure this had never happened to his father for his grandfather hadnt remarried after his grandmother died imagining his father in love with anyone took work did it he asked in a small voice trying to gulp his way out of weeping oh yes oh yes philodemos said she was a hetaira not another mans wifeim not quite so foolish as you even in sympathy even in consolation he couldnt omit the gibe he went on her name was arkhippe and i thought the sun rose and set on her this was before you were born you understand before i wed your mother now as he looked back across the years his voice softened so did his features as they did menedemos realized how much his father looked like uncle lysistratos most of the time he had trouble seeing the resemblance for philodemos wore a severe expression that contrasted with his younger brothers cheerful air after some small silence menedemos asked what happened his fathers usual sour look returned i told youshe was a hetaira he replied she was out for what she could get when i gave her more than anyone else she loved meor she said she did but when she took up with a gilded fop who owned a big farm on the east coast well after that she forgot shed ever heard my name she ended up betraying him too theyre both dead now and the fellow who beat me out had no sons i go on and so does my line he spoke with a certain somber pride about as much as he ever let himself show when the subject had anything to do with menedemos youve never talked much about this menedemos said now i understanda littlewhy you worry so about what i do with women of course i dont talk about it philodemos said impatiently a hurt like that isnt a battle scar you display to show how brave you were you put it away and do your best to pretend it never happened i do anyway his face defied menedemos to challenge him on his choice after another pause he changed the subject high time we get you married off maybe then you wont play the cuckoo leaving your eggs in other birds nests by the dog youre old enough now menedemos thought of protomakhos and xenokleia his father fortunately didnt know about that he also thought about baukis philodemos even more fortunately didnt know about that either menedemos said i dont think im ready for a wife of my own not when the one i wish i had is yours but philodemos again fortunately was unable to follow his thought and replied its time thirty is a good age to wed and youre getting close finding the right family finding the right girl will take a while and so will the dicker over her dowry but youll be glad when its done having a woman to come home to every day will settle you down not if shes someone i dont want someone i dont care about one more thing menedemos found it best not to say all he did say was maybe his father took politeness for agreement philodemos was and always had been remarkably good at hearing what he wanted to hear and hearing it the way he wanted to he said ill start asking around i can think of three or four likely maidens about the right age just like that he snapped his fingers theres no rush menedemos said his father was also remarkably good at not hearing what he didnt want to hear he hurried out of the house as if he expected to come back with a match all sewn up by suppertime maybe he did menedemos started to call him back but what was the use hed waste his breath he might anger his father and he wouldnt change a thing besides he didnt think philodemos would come back with a match the older man had said it would take time then ignored his own words as if to escape the mere possibility menedemos went to the stairway and started up to his own room no sooner had he set foot on the lowest stair than he heard footsteps coming down he climbed the stairs with a lightened heart after that his feet hardly seeming to touch themit was baukis her pace sped up too as his eyes adjusted to the gloom of the stairwell he saw the smile on her face he knew his own wore the same kind of smile too they both stopped halfway menedemos looked up past baukis to the second story she looked down past him to the doorway that led out to the courtyard this was probably the only place in the house where they could meet without the fear that a slave was or could be spying on them i love you menedemos said softly i love you baukis smile crumpled like the thin timbers of a fishing boat when a trihemiolias ram slammed into them at full speed oh menedemos what are we going to do we cant i mean we mustnt i know he reached out and took her hands in his by the way she held on to him she might have been pitched from the deck into a sea full of sharks he leaned forward and brushed his lips against hers he wanted to do so much more than that he wanted to but knew he couldnt even that little was too much for it left him all on fire inside on fire and feeling as if a torturer were flaying him one digit of hide at a time after the festival we never should have baukis kept on leaving her sentences unfinished but menedemos kept on knowing how she would have ended them i know he said again regardless of what he said though he wouldnt have traded those few minutes for any in the rest of his life or for all the rest of his life put together i cant look at your fatherat my husbandthe same way anymore baukis said miserably but her hands kept clutching menedemos he dipped his head he couldnt look at his father the same way anymore either sudden alarmno sudden terrorin her voice she asked where is philodemos hes not here he decided i needed a wife and hes gone off to start looking for a match menedemos spoke the truth without thinking baukis gasped in dismay oh no i couldnt stand it if she broke off again now she grabbed menedemos hands hard enough to hurt dont worry he told her nothing will come of it right away if anything comes of it at all he knew something would come of it in a couple of years but that felt like forever to him what will we do what can we do baukis moaned before menedemos could find any sort of answer a noise in the courtyard sent the two of them flying apart baukis scurried down the stairs menedemos went up to the second story two steps at a time that wasnt why his heart thuttered as he walked down the hall to his room though what will we do what can we do he had no idea he saw no good end ahead either no matter what happened he couldnt even escape from rhodes till spring and spring seemed a hundred years away and for baukis there was no escape no escape at all historical note owls to athens isset in bc menedemos is a historical character though little is known of him the rest of his family is fictitious in all respects other historical characters who appear in the novel include demetrios of phaleron demetrios son of antigonos dionysios the commander at mounykhia dromokleides of sphettos euxenides of phaselis kratesipolis menandros the playwright stratokles and theophrastos the macedonian marshals mentioned from time to timeantigonos demetrios father lysimakhos ptolemaios and seleukosare also historical as is demetrios son of antigonos brother philippos though philip of macedon died in bc and his son alexander the great in bc their shadows dominate this period the decrees honoring antigonos and his son demetrios voted by the athenians after the ouster of demetrios of phaleron may seem extravagant but they are attested to by inscriptions by the history of diodoros of sicily and by plutarchs biography of demetrios son of antigonos the latter two are our principal literary sources for what antigonos and demetrios called the restoration of athenian democracy some scholars believe dromokleides of sphettos decree came later than those of stratokles during another conquest of athens by demetrios this is certainly possible but plutarch puts them all together under the events of bc and a mere novelist may tread where a historian fears to go it is not known in what year menandros offered the flatterer which survives in fragments other plays and poets said to be at the greater dionysia are fictitious as usual in this series all translations from the greek are my own i claim no great poetic virtues for them but do hope they accurately present what their originals say most names of persons and places are transliterated directly from greek into english with no detour through latin demetrios not demetrius euboia not euboea where names are very well known in a particular formalexander athensi have for the most part preserved that form transliteration is always a compromise and compromises rarely make anyone perfectly happy
