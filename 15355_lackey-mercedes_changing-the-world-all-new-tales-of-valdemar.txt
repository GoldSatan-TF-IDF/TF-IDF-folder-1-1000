ohlander the one left behind by mercedes lackey mercedes lackey is a fulltime writer and has published numerous novels including the best selling heralds of valdemar series she is also a professional lyricist and licensed wild bird rehabilitator marya was doing her shopping when the heralds rode into the village and the flash of white and sudden turning of heads in the corner of her vision made her stomach twist into an angry knot her jaw tighten and her fists clench she knew what it was only one thing could be that white in the middle of a village in the middle of a rainy spring done she said cutting off her bargaining abruptly and leaving druk pelan the egg seller openmouthed in astonishment she shoved the coppers at him took up her basket and the eggs and strode quickly back toward her house at the east edge of the village without getting any of the other things shed meant to buy the house inherited from her mother which had been her parents before her was really more of a cottage they hadnt needed much space the loft bed for her the bedroom her mother had slept in once she inherited the place until the day she died and one big room that served as kitchen and work space and held her baskets of yarn and the big loom so far as marya knew the cottage had been built around the loom she couldnt imagine how some of the big beams had been brought in otherwise the windows were all positioned to give the person sitting at the loom the best possible light all day the kitchen was almost more of an afterthought more often than not marya her mother and her grandparents had eaten food cooked at the bakers or cold meats raw vegetables bread and cheese well she would have to make do with what she had now the plain linen warp was half full of colorful woof threads now with the cartoon beneath for marya was not just any weaver she was a weaver of tapestries so her mother and grandparents had been people sent commissions to her from all over valdemar mostly from extremely wealthy households for when you wanted to really impress people there was nothing like an enormous tapestry hung against the wall ordinary arras hangings would do to keep down drafts but a tapestry that meant something this one was of some fancy family or others coat of arms a pair of stags fighting on their hind legs some tapestry weavers sent out for their cartoons or used images that they kept carefully folded and put away up in the loft there were stacks of those some going back a hundred years or more her family had relied on such aids since they had begun weaving not marya marya drew her own the sketch shed been sent had been no bigger than her hand the cartoon was twice the length of the loom and that was only half of it shed flip it for the other half the mirror image of the stag she was working on now and carefully sew the two halves together for the finished whole and an impressive backdrop to a head table that would be too but she was not thinking of that she was thinking of the heralds in the village square and wondering angrily how long they were going to be in the village not long she hoped because she had no intention of leaving her house while they were here or she just might be tempted to she froze at the polite knock at her open door surely not she turned slowly but the reflection of white in the pots on the kitchen wall told her who it was before she actually finished the turn marya bannod the older of the two heralds asked she nodded curtly unable to trust herself to speak wed like to ask for your hel he began she exploded oh youve a lot of nerve coming here and asking for my help she hissed hands balled into fists at her side whatever it is you can damned well just go and take care of it yourselves you with your great minds and fine ways get off my stoop and she slammed the door in their astonished faces then she let out a breath that had felt good not as good as flinging some kitchen things at them but good now theyd go away and get on their white horses and there was another knock surely not she opened it they were still there briefly she entertained a fantasy of snatching up the beater from the loom and driving them down the street with it cudgeling their heads and shoulders the whole time but no these particular heralds hadnt done her any harm just heralds in general youre not wanted here she said folding her arms over her chest and glaring at them get out perhaps you didnt you think im feebleminded she snapped i understood perfectly youve got some sort of tangle you think i can sort it out for you and save you some time and effort no i realize that you dont hear that very often perhaps you should it would do you good no what part of no do you not understand she slammed the door again this time when the knock came she didnt answer it instead she went to her loom and began work on the tapestry singing out the color changes as loud as she could to a tune of her own invention it helped her concentrate and it soothed her nerves a little she heard the sound of voices at her door four of them she sang louder eventually the talking stopped then there were footsteps going away she kept working she didnt stop until it became too dark to distinguish between different shades of the same colors by then her arms were weary and her back was stiff she didnt usually work that long at a stretch on the loom without taking breaks but she had been so angry that she hadnt dared stop or she was sure she would have smashed something she had started a fine pea soup with a ham bone in it this morning it would be ready now shed wanted fresh bread to go with it but oh well shed just have to bake her own bannocks or griddle cakes until the heralds left she was not leaving her house and they couldnt make her the soup was perfect she ladled herself out a bowl set some tea to steep and was about to sit down when there was another knock at the door and her anger flared like lint caught in a fire she snatched up her frying pan and stalked to the door flinging it open i told you now now marya the mayor of the village stefan durst held up both hands placatingly dont go hitting me with that i need the few wits i have left she snorted but she let the hand with the pan in it fall to her side i suppose youll be wanting to come in and explain to me why i need to do what their lordships think i should well in a word yes you can come in but im having my supper and im not feeding you she glared at him you eat better than i do stefan just sighed and looked putupon she moved out of the way to let him in but closed the door firmly behind him lest some herald think he could sneak in when she wasnt looking she sat back down at her tiny table and began to eat her soup stefan looked about for some place to sit and eventually he took the loom bench stefan a balding plump man with mousecolored hair looked down at his wellgroomed clean hands marya theyre heralds he said plaintively i know theyre heralds she snapped im neither blind nor feebleminded theyve got the queens mandate there was a whine to his voice hed been whiny as a child and he hadnt lost the habit they can have the queens crown and underwear for all i care im not helping them she put her spoon in the empty bowl and glared at him again and you of all people should know why what have heralds ever done for me but make my life a misery he moved his hands a little helplessly yes but do you have any idea what it was like to grow up without a father to have every other child in this village mock me by telling me hed run off to rid himself of me and mother to watch my mother write letter after letter that was never answered and go from hopeful to hopeless to bitter shed held this pent up for too long and then then when a man from this village takes a shine to me and theres talk of weddings along comes another one of those damned white horses and there am i left in the rain like my mother and the letters start to say you wouldnt understand and then they stop coming altogether the very words were bitter on her tongue at least i wasnt left pregnant and alone just alone she got up and washed the bowl and spoon in the sink well thats what theyre here about danet that is she turned slowly he was twisting those tooclean hands together and staring at them with guilt she thought what do you mean theyre here about danet her voice was dangerously soft all i know is what they told me he replied cringing a little theyre here about danet and they need your help thats all you can pick yourself off that bench and you can march yourself back to them and you can tell them from me that danet stens can rot in hell for all i care and theres an end to it she was unaware that she had picked up her sharpest kitchen knife and was holding it until stefans eyes went to it and he gave a little yelp she slapped it down on the table he jumped she pointed with her chin the doors that way he took the hint and scuttled out she moved her chair closer to the fire and took up her knitting it was soothing she never did patterns and never had more than one color on the needles although she would use up all the little ends of her weaving by making them into crazycolored knitted blankets and scarves after all the intricate pattern weaving she did during the day it was restful to be doing something with no pattern and no counting except to cast on she made smocklike sweaters out of rectangular shapes that needed only to be sewn together in winter she could layer on as many of those as she liked to keep warm it wasnt as if anyone cared what she looked like it wasnt as if she wanted anyone to one heartbreak in a lifetime was enough oh she remembered dan all right handsome witty charming everyone liked him and she had been so flattered when he started to pay attention to her though her mother had eyed him with suspicion and disfavor whenever he showed up shed been absolutely and utterly sure that her mother was suspicious for no reason at all who wouldnt love dan ohit was true that he didnt seem to do a lick of work but why would he need to he did what he did best for his father bring in business to the little tavern with his ready stories and skill at games he didnt get paid for that of course but that didnt matter she was already doubling the family business with her weaving once it became widely known that she wasnt just copying old cartoons for her tapestries that she was making original images shed be turning business away he could do what she couldnt flatter and please the customers so she could concentrate on the weaving she had it all planned out in her mind and then between one day and the next he was gone there had been some talk about some theftsshe dismissed them out of hand and then the whole village had been forced to do the same when letters came back telling how he had been carried off by a companion to be a herald the whole village had been forced to admit that theyd misjudged him and although she got her letters with some misgiving at first still she was getting letters she was not replaying her mothers story all over again but then the letters began to change it seemed as if every other line ended with but of course you wouldnt understand at first it made her anxious and bewildered then as the tone grew more and more patronizing it made her angry then explain it she demanded more than once it wasnt as if she were stupid if he thought she didnt understand well if he would just but the letters grew fewer and fewer and finally stopped altogether by that time her feelings had turned as bitter as her mothers she threw herself into her work her mother died in the middle of that winter but at least marya could congratulate herself that shed had every possible comfort not even the mayors wife had such a fine goosedown bed pillows and comforter not even the mayor was served such savory morsels when she could bring herself to eat it was all that marya could do for her when the bitter love had turned again to anguish in her mothers last illness and she spent her last breaths weeping and calling for her lost lover oh how she hated the heralds her anger made the needles fly and row after row of knitting grew beneath her hands stefan was an idiot but then again the entire village was herald mad probably all of valdemar was herald mad little girls and boys made white stick horses and played at being heralds you found decorations of heralds and companions everywhere there were more ornamental white horse heads than there were representations of the actual arms of valdemar the one and only commission she had ever turned down was for a tapestry of a herald and companionthe noble family of someone whose son had been chosen she had used the rather specious argument that she would never be able to get the companion and the uniform white enough and that the white wool would soon become dingy they had countered that they would send her companion mane and tail hair to make into yarn hair that would never get dingy because companions literally shed dirt she had replied without attempting it that companion hair could not be made into yarn and that she could not in all good faith take on such a commission knowing that herald and companion would soon become a grayish yellow she never heard from them again and i would starve to death before i there was a knock at the door she did not rush to get up she put up her knitting made sure the fire was burning cleanly while another couple of knocks came and only then did she get up to answer it stefan could just wait out there with the night insects biting him serve him right if he was covered in welts tomorrow she opened the door intending to tell him brusquely to be off and slam it in his face again but it wasnt stefan who was out there it was the two heralds a moment of shock and rage held her rigid and that was when the older of the two said the one thing that kept her from slamming the door in their faces danet stens is not a herald they sat stiffly side by side on her weaving bench she sat stiffly in her chair hands uncharacteristically idle but she was listening and what she heard from the two heralds as far as we can tell he did not begin by deciding to impersonate a herald the older of the twoherald callanwas saying he sent back letters that he had been chosen we think largely to cover up the thefts hed committed here but approximately a month later he seems to have understood that if he actually put the full ruse into motion he would have a free hand to do virtually anything she nodded slowly but why keep on sending letters back she asked suspiciously until we find him we can only speculate as to why said the other who had not yet given his name we have a lot of guessesthe most likely is to keep people from associating him with the thefts until enough time had passed that the losses were forgotten or at least the victims had given up on finding the thief she shook her head puzzled id heard rumors of thefts butyou talk as if these were something large and i certainly didnt hear anything about that the heralds exchanged a look i cant speak for the victims the elder said after a moment but given the circumstances i believe the items were purloined in a way that would have been very embarrassing to the victim if it had been made pub that was when the younger interrupted he was sleeping with womenand one or two menand making off with small valuables most of them were married shocked for a moment she sat there blinking she thought about some of her mothers comments she thought some more about the curious silence that had followed danets disappearance and still more about the times when hed said he had something or other to do for his father how did you when we began tracking him we knew where he had come from and we had an old list of things that had been reported as missing to the guard the younger said bluntly weve been interviewing the people who reported them stolen all day enough time has passed that when we told them that danet is not a herald we usually got the truth out of them well and the reports had generally come from the husband but when we interviewed the wives herald callan blushed visible even in the firelight lets just say that they were less than happy they were able to rationalize that he had taken the things to remember them by when they each thought she were the only one when we let it be known that this was far from the case he shook his head the spouses of course had no idea and had reported the items stolen independently most everyone assumed that it was a tinker or a gypsy or the like we havent enlightened the partners the younger herald said with a quirk of his lips that would be adding insult to injury she unclenched her jaw i still dont see what this has to do with me she replied stiffly they exchanged glances again the elder cleared his throat awkwardly we were hoping you would come with us at this point her emotions had been up and down so often her reaction was less rage and more incredulity you people are insane she finally said flatly why in the name of everything considered holy would i want to do that before they could answer her she continued on i have a commission to finish i have two more to start this is how i pay for my food my chopped wood my wool no one is going to give me these things she didnt mention that she had a very tidy sum tucked away safe and that if she wanted to she could probably live on it for several years without taking another commission in the first place that was none of their business in the second place that was meant in case she became ill or injured or otherwise incapacitated and in the third place it was none of their damn business and what makes you think i can or will do anything more than you can she leveled the most evil glare she could manage at them we thought because you knew him best herald callan began well i didnt know he was sleeping with half the village women and stealing their valuables and i didnt know that he never intended to marry me so i obviously didnt know him very well did i the bitterness in her words was so palpable that both of them winced thank you for telling me the truth about him you can leave now nowait she got up and stalked to the little chest where she kept her few keepsakes and pulled out a bundle of letters she didnt know why she had kept them instead of burning them maybe this was why she thrust them at callan here maybe you can make out something you can use against him the herald took the letters as gingerly as if they were on fire but can you think of what he is likely to actually do anything anything at all so far all we have are complaints from what seem to be random isolated communitiesthat a herald danet comes through makes a mess of things and when hes gone there are valuables missing by the time we get the reports hes long gone this has been going on for two years now so hed been at it from the moment hed left her oh she should have known better really she should have known better all along he was years younger than she was what handsome young man would ever have been truly interested in a dried up old spinster like her anyway it had seemed too good to be true and so it was and that was when the final humiliating thing occurred to her until either he had seduced one too many women or the wrong woman or someone was starting to make noise about missing items he probably had intended to marry her after all she was making fine money and she would have demanded very little of him he could have gone right on sleeping with anyone he cared to and she wouldnt have noticed or if she had a few sweet words of contrition from him and she would have forgiven him over and over and over and meanwhile he would have been living better than anyone in the village while continuing to do as little actual work as possible as good as he had been at pulling the wool over her eyes shed have probably considered it her privilege to support him she went hot then cold then hot again with shame especially when she thought about how often she had daydreamed of the long winter nights they would spend together cuddled up in each others arms by the fire that was when it occurred to her that there was one thing she knew about him that they probably did not if you can find his trail it will end at a place where he intends to spend the winter she said he wont travel in winter he hates the cold the rain and the snow worse than a cat thats all i know you can get out of here now reluctantly they left unfortunately they did not take what theyd put into her head with them if it had been daylight she could have lost herself in her weaving instead she picked up her knitting the needles flew at a furious pace but they could not still her thoughts it had been bad enough when she had thought he had just gotten tired of her when she had been left to wonder if she really was that dull that stupid truly unable to comprehend what being a herald was all about it was worse now she really had been stupid but in an entirely different way shed been manipulated made a fool of now she knew the reason for the pitying glances she sometimes caught from some women in the village all this time shed thought it was pity for having been jilted oh no it was pity for being such a fatuous fool as to believe a handsome young man could ever want her all those women that danet stens had slept with had felt the superior sort of pity that you do for someone who doesnt know shes living in a fools dream well i got the last laugh she thought bitterly now all of them know they were played for fools too it didnt help mother probably guessed or at least she guessed that danet was only interested in the money i made that would be about right finally as the fire burned down and the thoughts in her head would not stop buzzing about like angry hornets she realized that she was not going to get any sleep any sleep at all without help she went to the cupboard and got out the little bottle the healer had given her for her mother to help her through the bad nights she carefully measured out the right number of drops into a cup of lukewarm tea and drank it down she had expected it to be bitter but it had a kind of blossomy taste strange but pleasant she went back to her chair and put away her knitting noting sardonically that anger was good for one thing at least shed finished the panel shed bind it off in the daylight and start another firelight was no good for binding off you were asking for dropped stitches as she did every night she carefully hung her clothing on the chair next to the bed the bed that her grandparents and then her mother had slept inthough the mattress had been made new for her mother in her last year she got into a flannel nightrail the nights were turning cold now fall was not far off if those damned heralds did their job properly theyd find the wretch soon she got into the warm goosedown bed and wondered what he was doing right now probably getting into an equally warm goosedown bed with a pretty plump woman who was someone elses wife not a thin ugly stick like her she fell into strange confused dreams in which the heralds and danet chased each other around and around a copse of trees until the snow fell and a trio of beautiful women came and carried him off on a flying sheep all three of the women laughed and pointed at her as they flew away she woke up feeling entirely out of sorts for the first time that she could recall ever she was so very out of sorts that she didnt want to work on her tapestry instead she decided that she wasnt going to get any creative work done she might as well give the place a thorough cleaning she did have the very bad habit of leaving things she knew she would want later piled up next to her chair beside the bed or on the table she hadnt organized the yarn since spring for that matter she hadnt done more than give the place a cursory sweep and dust since spring she spent the morning turning things inside out the floor got a scrubbing the mattress was turned aired and the bed remade the blankets all came down out of winter storage and got a good wash every surface got a scouring she reorganized the yarn properly she stacked all the rectangles of knitting in order on a little table beside the chair so she could finally sew them together she went through her clothing relegating a few things to be given away since they had shrunk or never actually fitted in the first place she brought in all the dry blankets and laid them in lavender in the blanket chest at the foot of the bed she looked at the number of knitted tunics she had and decided that her next project was going to be to use up the yarn ends in making another blanket by noon the little cottage was clean but her temper was still high she decided that since the wretched heralds hadnt let a closed door stop them from pestering her she was going to finish her interrupted shopping serve them right if they turned up again and she wasnt there she was closemouthed to the point of monosyllabic with the village merchants but they were used to that usually it was because she was in her mind still back at her loom it wasnt often that her temper was as frayed as it was today but as she bought her bread and meat pies her winter squash and her cut oats for porridge her fruit and her soap and candles she noticed that the shopkeepers were just as preoccupied as she was it was abundantly clear why the entire village was abuzz with talk about danet and now of course everyone had suspected the worst of him even his own father who held court in the taproom of his inn holding forth about how his neerdowell son had been a devil from the day he was born and how no matter how hard he was beaten all he did was shrug the punishment off and go and do what he liked this much at least marya knew was a lie danets father had never so much as laid a willowwand to his back everyone knew how danet could charm his way out of any scrape he got into but innkeeper stens brewed the only decent ale and beer to be had in the village and imported the only mead and wine so no one wanted to naysay him and as for the innkeeper well he was making sure that memories were being corrected by pouring with a freer hand than usual and forgetting to charge now and again so the only one in the village today who wasnt singing the new song was marya and of course everyone remembered that danet was supposed to marry her looks both superior and pitying were cast on her and plenty of curious ones too but no one asked her anything perhaps they had already heard about the reception that stefan and the heralds themselves had gotten perhaps the black storm behind her eyes was more obvious than she had thought the upshot of it all was that she went back to her little cottage in the same temper that she had left itand behind that temper was a sinking feeling this was going to be a prime topic of conversation for the entire winter and there was not one thing that she could do about it until something just as sensational took their minds off it shed be gawked at and talked about and whispered over until the thaw and hard work took peoples minds off scandal she put her purchases away put the eggs to boil cleaned out a squash and tucked it into a corner of the fireplace to bake then stood at her window and found that she was torn between wanting to sit down on the floor and bawl like a child and wanting to break something she and her family had always been odd ducks herethe only people whose income came from outside the village and the only ones who made things that no one in the village could afford they had always kept to themselves and when maryas father had gone off to be a herald and had he gone off to be a herald after all that isolation had only increased she had reacted to the mocking as a child by throwing herself into the workshe did truly love the act and art of the weaving the more intricate the betterand by going off somewhere no one would bother her and crying this was often the dyeing shed since the only way to get a big batch of a consistent color was to dye it yourself that was what they did usually the shed was empty when a big tapestry was being made so it was a good place to go to cry later when she had mastered the craft of dyeing and was old enough to be trusted alone among all the boiling pots of dye and mordant baths no one questioned why she wanted to take the job over it was unpleasant in winter hot in summer and some of the dyes stank your hands turned colors and it didnt wash off it had to wear off her mother was just happy not to have to do it herself it looked as if the mockingin adult formwas about to begin all over again never had she so agreed with the philosophers bitter observation the more i know of humanity the more i appreciate my dog maybe she should get a dog as she stood in the middle of the now neatly organized room and contemplated forcing herself to the loom there was another tap on the door more diffident this time she answered it both heralds stood there the elder callan holding out the packet of letters we wanted to return these he said and thank you they have been of incalculable help she made no move to take them you might as well keep them she replied her stomach twisting in knots that did not bode well for the squash baking at the fire i cant imagine how they helped you we only got reports on what was happening as people sent them to haven which meant they werent in order of when danet was in the particular village the second oneshe still didnt know his nameexplained by the time we got a report people had forgotten when exactly he was there as well so there was confusion as to dates by the guard confusion as to dates by the victims when we tried to plot his movement on the map it didnt make any sense but he very kindly dates his letters to you herald callan pointed out wryly and although he doesnt necessarily mention the place he is in by name he usually lets something slip that has let us identify it now we know where he was when his course of travel is quite clear hes making his way south and west by the easiest route she frowned hes not stupid he cant be planning to carry on this scheme forever we dont think so either callan replied we think he intends to go to rethewellan his thefts by themselves have not been very largethe things he has taken have all been valuable but not the sort of thing that someone would raise a huge hue and cry over when he has defrauded people of money it has not been large amounts but impersonating a herald he has no expenses people rush to give him food shelter anything he needs she nodded slowly so all those little bits are adding up to a right tidy sum by the time he gets to rethwellan hell have enough to here callan paused well i am not sure i know what he plans she thought it over for a moment the same way that she thought over the design for a tapestry when it wasnt something straightforward like the family arms she let her mind go blank and waited for all the pieces to come together when they did she was glad she didnt have anything breakable in her hand for she would surely have thrown it hes going to trick himself out like a rich man or a noble she growled then he will go looking for a woman with a lot of money probably one older or ugly hell be very clever about how he approaches her so that she never suspects what he wants hell make sure that in the end it appears that she is courting him rather than the other way around he might marry her he might just live off her then disappear one day and go find a new victim now you see why we want you to come with us callan replied you know how he thinks she opened her mouth to give him a sharp retort but then the memory of her neighbors pitying and smug faces rose up before her to have to face that for the next several weeks or months the tapestry she was working on would not be done before winter came and made it impossible to transport and the owners were not expecting it before spring she had no pets no livestock nothing that depended on her to care for it she could just lock up the cottage and leave she had never been outside the village suddenly she wanted to all right she growled but i wont be staying in any of your herald shacks we would never expect you to callan said hastily they arent build to hold more than two anyway how soon can you leave no longer than it takes me to pack she didnt need much either she wasnt some fancy lady that needed fuss and bows and scent just her clothing her brush and her toothscrubber she turned her back on them and went into the cottage how hard was it to pack after all it wasnt as if she had clothing she had to go through what she wore for every day was good enough to keep the heralds busy while she packed she took the squash out of the fireplace corner and set it in front of them with salt and pepper on the table and even though she had never packed for an overnight trip before it really was no great task to have everything in a neat bundle in a short period of time they werent even finished eating by the time she was done so she ate one of the meat pies then put the rest of the food in her basket well wrapped up and put it next to her bundle to her surprise without prompting the heralds cleaned up after themselves and washed all the dishes to boot well get our things and the companions said the younger and so they went off leaving her to tidy what little there was left to do and shut and lock the door they didnt leave her waiting on her stoop long either they must not have unpacked their own bags long before she became impatient they came riding up to her door a pillion pad behind callan without a word the younger got down boosted her up behind callan and showed her how to hang on he took her bundle and basket up and tied them up on top of his own bags and they were off being up on the back of an animal was a new sensation it made her nervous at first but after the first few paces she began to enjoy it it was quite odd being half again taller than she was used to and the astonished looks that the villagers gave her as they rode through were altogether gratifying this might not be so bad after all they stayed in inns and not nasty ones either shed heard about the nasty ones from some of her suppliers of dyes and the yarns and threads she couldnt get locally and from the merchants who carried away her commissioned tapestries no these were nice tidy places where she wasnt afraid to sleep in the bed for fear of being carried off by vermin the food was decent not fancy but she didnt particularly trust food that came all covered in sauces and spices and hiding inside crusts she got her own small room there was always a bathhouse the younger heraldshe finally learned his name the third day outalso made sure that she put her laundry with theirs for the first time since she was a young child she was fed by someone else housed by someone else waited on by someone else taken care of by someone else it was a way of life she suspected she could get used to very quickly she noticed that the heralds paid for these stays with some form of paper scrip and she finally wondered aloud how danet was managing this without leaving some trail behind sendar the younger of the two just shrugged they are not that difficult to forge no one bothers because until now no one has ever tried to impersonate a herald all he had to do was get his hands on one and if he is a decent copyist and could carve a copy of the circle stamp he could make as many as he liked so many are turned in wed never find the forgeries among the real ones she sniffed a little at that it seemed rather too chancy a system to her shed heard that riding was hard that people were generally aching and sore when they werent used to it but maybe the people who had told her that were not used to working at a loom she was a little stiff and sore but it wasnt bad then again she was riding on a companionmaybe they were different she began to pay attention to the companions aside from their brilliantly white coats and blue eyes a suspicion began to dawn on her on the fifth evening when callan and sendar had finished their plotting and planning over another nice plain supper she voiced it your companions cant do anything a really good trained horse cant do she said perhaps a bit more tartly than she had intended two sets of startled eyes met hers well she insisted they cant or at least a really good trained horse can make it look as if hes doing the same things five years ago an animal trainer came through at fair time and his horse could do just about anything sit up like a dog lie down follow any command he gave it count add i was watching and he gave it signals because i gave him a complicated sum and the horse got it wrong just as he did but danet saw the same trainer all he had to do was find a white horse trained that well and get it to take signals from him and there you go companion just keep painting the hooves silver when no one is watching and plenty of white horses have blue eyes she thought a long moment more while the truth of her words penetrated to them it makes me wonder now if he didnt plan this all along maybe he even had a horse ready for him when he ran off that thought didnt help her at all if anything it made the deception even more bitter because he clearly had never intended any of the things hed promised her and shed had the wool pulled right over her eyes but she wasnt one to lie to herself if he planned that far ahead callan said slowly then he has surely planned for the moment when real heralds confront him hell brazen it out long enough to buy himself some time then bolt while youre dealing with all the people that think he is the real one and you are the imposters she pointed out he doesnt need long there was silence this is why we asked you to come along callan said ruefully you know how he might think and you point out things that we would not consider like trained horses she shrugged i hope you can work out some sort of plan to deal with this im just a weaver and with that she took herself up the stairs to that extremely comfortable little room when she came back down in the morning to enjoy a truly fine breakfast they still hadnt come up with much of a plan other than we are going to have to scout this out without him finding out we are heralds and what are you going to pose as she asked they both blinked we hadnt gotten that far sendar said she sighed and dug into a really outstanding slice of eggandbacon pie he wont have set up in a town when he settles in for winter he needs a small village so he can charm everyone in it and the one or two who are suspicious will keep their mouths shut for fear of antagonizing their neighbors that means everyone will know everyone else and you cannot impersonate someone local we could be peddlers sendar began she laughed where is your cart your packhorse do you know anything about the sorts of things that a peddler who visits a small village is likely to carry do you know the right prices what a fair trade would be i doubt that either of you knows the first thing about mending a pot so posing as tinkers is not going to work either as they began to look nonplused and flustered she helped herself to biscuits and butter finally she took pity on them instead of trying to do something you dont know anything about what can you do they exchanged looks again weve never thought about it callan finally replied she bit back the reply of well then start thinking about it and just left them to it they discussed it for far too long in her opinion coming up with all sorts of things that were likely to fall apart the moment someone in the village asked a few questions she was actually learning a lot about them although they were probably utterly unaware of the fact it became clear to her that neither of them had ever done what she would consider work in their lives which meant they were both from some highborn family or other the sort of people who commissioned her tapestries usually they managed to knock the legs out from under each others schemes which at least showed a modicum of good sense in her opinion once in a while she had to remind them of what life in a small village was like how everyone knew everyone else and how danet once he had ingratiated himself would have the upper hand but finally it was sendar who came up with something even she had to approve of we make up a religion and become monks or priests of it he said finally something humble inoffensive vows of poverty nonviolence all that we can crib things from any religion we care to and it wont matterno one can say we got it wrong because no one will recognize it and we can exclaim about how wonderful it is that our god says the same as the other god if anyone notices the cribbing why would you be traveling she asked people will want to know were going from one remote chapter house in valdemar to another in rethwellan callan said with confidence im from up near the iftel border and i doubt your danet will know anything about that area well say were from up there and just make up another village in rethwellan that seemed to be a good sound plan to her so she kept silent while they worked out the details of their new religion sendar did point out with some humor that it would be important that it didnt look attractive the last thing they wanted to do was to create followers for a madeup religion so aside from the vows of poverty abstinence and chastity they decided that complete vegetarianism was probably going to be the most effective against country folk wanting to join up she agreed country folk like our meat and cheese and eggs she said and in case you get some odd little fervent duck who decides this is all very lovely anyway make it a requirement that the entire family join this religion before any single member can ah yes the unity of the family is of the utmost importance said sendar pulling a grave face only when the family is united can such serious matters be properly decided they knew they were catching up to danet when as they entered village after village certain timid souls would come up quietly as they sat at a meal pardon herald the diffident speech would be begin but i wonder if well this just didnt seem right somehow do you know of a herald danet and thus would begin the revelations small things mostly suspicion of taking a bribe a girls dazzled infatuation with the white uniform taken advantage of sometimes things gone missing occasionally instead of a quarrel being solved having it fanned into a feud these things delayed them though not to maryas mind intolerably since she didnt have to do much but listen and verify that no danet wasnt a real herald and yes hed taken similar advantage of most of the people in her own village free from the need to keep her mouth shut over it there was a certain relish in being able to name names and reveal a great many indiscretions it felt a little like revenge in a way and a strange thing began to happen she found herself becoming the recipient of similar sad little stories rather than confiding them to the heralds perhaps out of embarrassment people seemed much more comfortable telling their tales to someone who was just like them but whom they would never have to see again a confluence of commonality and anonymity perhaps she began to take careful notes turning them over to the heralds at the end of the day when danet was found would these things serve to determine his punishment she hoped so his crimes against her were well not crimes at all breach of promise but there had never been any actual promise he never stole anything from her but her happiness but this was certainly a way in which she could exact revenge for that each place they stopped and had to sort things out danet was nearer to them in time he had been there two months ago a month ago a fortnight it was clear he was not aware he was being followed and it was time for the two heralds to scout ahead in their guise of humble priests they claimed they had also summoned help how she was not at all sure since they hadnt sent any messages back that she had seen but they wanted the people of springdale to be convinced that danet was a fraud first so that he had no way to make them rise up against the real heralds and whatever help was coming they left her behind in that village still coaxing stories from people and this time having to do something new she had to urge them not to follow in the false heralds wake and try to summon him to justice themselves think about what you would have said when he was among you she pointed out the bastard has a charm that is almost magical when he is around you he can talk you into thinking almost anything he wants you like him and want to believe him if you go after him all that will happen is that he will turn the people of springdale against youyoull be the outsiders and outnumbered and he will easily persuade them that you are for one reason or another disgruntled over his judgments sore losers somehow she managed to persuade them she wasnt quite sure how because she had not been very diplomatic about it actually not very diplomatic was an understatement shed been her usual blunt self she usually sat them down at a table near the fire in the inn and ordered beer for them after all why not the king was paying for it then she began with dont be an idiot and ended with i know because he did it to me some people started off a little bristly but when it become clear that she wasnt being personal eventually they ended up nodding their heads and going away if not satisfied at least prepared to allow the real heralds to handle it it might have been her powers of persuasion but she was more inclined to think it was the beer when the two heralds returned nearly a week later she knew from their guarded expressions that they had discovered just how powerful danets charm was we found him he went off the road to a smaller village but we finally found him he has definitely begun entrenching himself and they all consider themselves privileged to be hosting him over the winter callan told her over a gloomy dinner i must apologize to you marya i thought you were exaggerating his ability to charm people if anything it is more potent than you described there might even be some form of gift at operation here i dont have the ability to tell or he has simply gotten better with practice she replied dismissing the whole notion of these nebulous gifts with a wave of her hand tell me what hes done as callan and sendar talked she listened carefully it was clear that neither of them had any idea how to counter danets hold over an entire village an enormous part of that hold was the white horse that he or someone at least had trained the animal was amazing it did things that neither man had thought possible for an ordinary horse clearly its not ordinary at all its an exceptionally intelligent and well trained horsewhich means it can almost do as much as an exceptionally well trained dog she said tartly he probably paid a pretty sum for it so the problem is he has these people wrapped around his fingers theyll look at his fanciedup horse and not see any differences between it and your companions and you dont know how to prove to these people whats what withoutwhat we cant force a truth spell on anyone whos not been brought up in judgment sendar said gloomily right now its our word against his and they think hes a herald had you considered kidnapping she asked they both blanched breaking the law is not an option callan replied faintly she shrugged all right then i might have a plan they rode into town and headed straight for the inn where danet was holding court he looked startled to see two real heralds but the expression didnt last long and quickly turned to his usual selfconfidence he has the high ground here and he knows it his expression slipped when she slid down off from behind callan however he went absolutely blank hello danet she said pleasantly i see that you have convinced all these people that you are really a herald i wonder if they would still believe that if they knew you had taken elise garens silver locket after you slept with her of course and you borrowed over forty coppers from tulera that you never intended to repay she went down the list adding sadly all too frequently after you slept with her of course and paid close attention to the faces of some of the women around him doubt was creeping in not much but of course you must be a herald now she went on doing her best to sound perfectly calm and even because look you have the uniform just like herald callan and herald sendar and you have the companion now she turned to where the rather lovely white horse was peacefully standing quite untethered a few feet away she had to admit he had managed a rather good imitation of a companion if you didnt look too closely of course you do she took a few steps nearer or do you before anyone could move to prevent her she dashed forward as she had expected the horse was too well trained to shy away although it did throw up its head in surprise and snort she lunged and the hand she had held concealed in the folds of her dress slapped the flank of the horse the wad of rags saturated with dark walnut dye leaving a huge brown smear on its white hide of course everyone knows that companions are white because dirt and all just evaporates right off them she continued as danet and his little knot of admirers stared in shock so to be fair i should do the same to the others with the same dye so you cant claim that ive used something different on them she turned and wiped the dye off on the other two creating identical swaths of stain on their satiny hides now lets just seeoh look the two companions had gotten a look of curious concentration on their faces the moment the rags touched them and the dye was already fading within moments it was gone and their coats were as pristine as they had been before meanwhile the large ugly brown stain remained on the flank of the oblivious horse goodness me she said sweetly it looks as if your companion is a fake danet and if your companion is a fakewhat does that make you danet looked wildly about for help but his former admirers were backing away from him with expressions ranging from doubt to accusation she had a fair notion that the accusatory ones were the women he had already slept with herald callan stepped forward and clamped one hand on danet stenss shoulder danet stens i am taking you into custody to answer to one hundred and seventeen counts of theft thirty five counts of fraud three counts of breach of promise danet could only stand there looking stunned the guards had arrived just as the heralds had said they would and they took danet into custody they did not take the horse marya put a claim on it and since no one seemed willing to contest her for it she got it she immediately dyed all the blue tack a nondescript brown she thought about further dyeing the horse and decided to turn the streak into a patch adding another couple just to make it look more natural and significantly less like a companion with callan and sendar to escort her back home she got the hang of riding a real horse fairly quickly and they could actually have conversations riding three abreast better than they had when shed been pillion she talked for the first time about her father how devastated her mother had been when her letters were never answered how miserable her childhood had been they were troubled apologetic and on the whole their reaction came as close to satisfying her as much as anything ever would she was grudgingly coming to the conclusion that heralds might not be so bad when they reached silvergate just as the first hard frost hit by that time she was glad to see her own cottage again she made arrangements with innkeeper stens to board her horse with him she had plans for that horse she had decided that she liked travel she had it in mind that from now on she just might deliver her tapestries herself now and again she had just gotten the cottage opened up warmed by the fire and fit to live in again when there was a knock at the door she opened it callan and sendar were there with a wooden dispatch box when you told us about your father well it didnt sound right callan said without preamble so we sent off to haven to find out what we could and there is no other way to put this what you and your mother always believed was a lie she felt as if she had been slapped and sendar quickly added not what you are thinking he was chosen to be a herald but he never abandoned you not willingly here he thrust the box at her here are all the letters he tried to send which your grandmother turned back he was never allowed to contact your mother he tried but he was also in training and he couldnt leave haven and the collegium until the midwinter celebrations and the holidays and then then it was too late he got sick a lot of people got sick that year and he died callan shook his head sorrowfully the collegium tried to contact your mother one last time but they were turned away again marya blinked too stunned to actually feel anything yet finally she stammered come in and took the box to the table there she took out all the letters all the wonderful loving and then increasingly desperate letters and read them carefully that was when she knew suddenly exactly why her grandparents had done what they had maryas mother had been doing the bulk of the weaving marya herself was showing early promise even as a toddler but if they left to join their husband and father rage filled her one last time a terrible rage that swept through her and then exploded into tears she wept for her mother herself and the father she had never known she wept for the bitter selfish old man and woman who had kept their daughter miserable in order to keep her she wept first on callans shoulder and then on sendars until she couldnt weep any more and allowed herself to be led to her bed where she fell asleep fully clothed and awoke in the morning feelingempty the anger was gone what was going to take its place she didnt know but the anger had been washed away on the tide of tears she reread the letters knowing that she would do so many more times to come reread them with a heart open to what was in them and as she put the last of them back in the box there was a knock at the door it was callan and sendar again this time loaded down with all the shopping she would need for the next week and more we thought it was the least we could do sendar said cheerfully well be going back to haven but we wanted to thank you we never could have managed without you you certainly could not have you highborn babies she said tartly but with a bit of a smile no more notion of what common people are like than the man in the moon and thank you thank you very much but you can do me one more favor since thats your direction certainly callan nodded we owe you a very great deal still take this message to lord poul haveland in haven she held out the folded paper ill be taking that commission he wanted me to do after all and i would be obliged if some of that companion hair could be sent along in the spring so the creature can be the proper white and not a fraud and if the herald in that tapestry looked something like her misty memories of her father well that would not be bad either for want of a

denise lives in baltimore maryland where her hobbies include knitting writing and staying up too late writing code navar was an ordinary man a soldier and a good one rising from common foot soldier in the barons levy to sergeant of his company but his true gift was to go from here to there unseen and so captain harleth had used his talents for scouting for the barony of valdemar was beset on every side by enemies not those that came by day for all knew that the eastern empire was at peace but those that came by night for the iron throne ruled by fear and blood and dark magic so that no man might call his soul his own in later years many claimed to have known baron kordas valdemars mind to have plotted with him for their exodus into the unknown west navar was not one whose status gave him entry into the councils of the good and the great but he thought that such words were no more than idle tavern talk the speech of men who wished to be seen as greater than they were true enough that soferu who wore the wolf crown and sat upon the iron throne was but a man true as well that he was not a man like any other for lust for power ran as hot as magery in soferus veins and so the iron throne was an iron boot upon mens necks and an iron collar about mens throats and an iron chain about mens minds and only a fool would sow treason farther than he must and baron valdemar had been no fool only he and juuso beltran whose line had served valdemars as seneschal since the lands had first come into valdemars hands and terilee valdemars lady brave and bright as a swordblade had known all lord valdemars heart and mind the three of them had warded their plans with subtle spells so navar heard later and this tale he was moved to creditnot wards that would draw the attention of the hellhound mages of the imperium but layer upon layer of subtle shields of misdirection a deception as artful as a swirl of autumn leaves concealing a doe from the hunters bow of the journey to freedom itself navar knew as much as any man for a scouts skills were as vital as a mages when one must make ones way through lands first hostile then unknown they brought with them not merely the household troops that a barony was permitted to arm and muster but nearly all who dwelt within valdemars boundsall save for the barons eldest son lord dethwyn fostered as was the custom at soferus court as hostage against his fathers obedience would have willingly ascended to his fathers honors across his fathers grave were he granted the slightest chance when valdemars second son restil came of age he was meant to join his brother at the wolf court it was not unknown for the sons of inconvenient nobles to perish at court so that their fathers lands might return to the emperors gift and it wasperhapsthe thought of losing both his sons as much as anything else that caused the baron to move when he did it was the work of a yearhard travel and sometimes terrifying through the empire then by stealth and misdirection across the kingdom of hardorn and at last into the western lands which hardorn did not claimthat brought them to haven and haven it was in truth the city that they built upon the banks of the river that valdemar named for his lady some had died on that journey but their numbers were greater at the end of it than at the beginning for the rumor that their fellowship journeyed to a freedom beyond the persecution of the empire had spread and those who did not join them in the first days of their exodus followed them in the sennights and moonturns that followed to all who came seeking asylum valdemarnow king valdemargranted it for the work of building a kingdom was the work of many hands for valdemar now ruled a kingdom the lands baron valdemar could now claim as his own were vaster by far than those that he had once ruled at the emperors pleasure and he ruled now at no mans pleasure save his own and just as valdemars lands had grown so had the army grown into a great force of many companies many captains many sergeants and harleth now styled general over them all that growth was the reason navar was now uneasy the days in which navar had known every man and woman with whom he served were long gonehad been gone since before they had come to rest in their haven thirty years ago when he had been new come to the barons levy he had known everyone his duties brought him near both holder and servant alike he had been able to measure the hearts and minds of all who sought to command him any soldier knew that just as there were good orders and sensible orders there were bad orders and senseless orders and it was a good soldiers duty to evaluate each given order to see where it fell he had seen countless lives saved by a swiftwitted sergeant playing sunstruck at precisely the right time and he had kept his own list in his mind never written where agents of the iron throne might see for no one would think to look within the thoughts of a common sergeant and navar played the fool better than most when there was need of those whose orders he himself would lose for precisely long enough to ease their disaster in baron valdemars holdings that had been possible in king valdemars country it would not be possible for long in the moonturns since they had settled here many men and women had stepped forward to take places of service and that was well and good for the tally of things to be done to create their safe haven was so great that no one man could oversee them all king valdemar could direct their work from long before sunup to long past sundown and still not make every decision that must be made thus far all of them had proven to have hearts as good and as kind as king valdemar himself but how long navar wondered before someone with honeyed words and subtle magic stepped forward to cloak a desire for power in a promise that his actions were in valdemars best interests had they made this long and frightful journey only to stand vulnerable at the end to one who would seek to rebuild the empire with themself at its head king valdemar was a good and honest man and would likely raise young restil to the same values butafter him how long until valdemars people had to flee tyranny once again navar kept his suspicions quiet for lessons learned in the shadow of the iron throne would take longer than a single year of flight and a few moonturns of safe haven to fade away they had reached their new home in autumn and suffered through their first winter scrabbling to feed and shelter themselves for provisions ran as low as spirits ran high but if nothing else there was good timber and good grazing in plenty and what began as a bedraggled city of camp tents in the first weeks of autumn was a crude though growing settlement of wooden huts by spring stakes and stone cairns marked the location of future streets and roads so that the building could progress in an orderly fashion all through the fall and winter those who could be spared from the labor of building and hunting had ridden out to map and explore for the new kingdom of valdemar was an unknown place navar had been among them for no longer was he baron valdemars only scout nor yet one of a dozen four score served in the kings army who had once been the barons huntsmen or his spearmen or common farmers and as all the army they wore not the uniform of the barons guard but ordinary clothes with nothing to mark them out save a gray brassard worn upon their left arms yet both caution and weather dictated that the scouts did not go far from haven when the snow was gone and navars labor was no longer needed to help put the first crop into the fields captain arwulfhe who had charge of the scouts now that they numbered a whole company of men and womensummoned navar and asked him to command an expedition to scout the great forest to the western edge of the lands valdemars people had claimed see what we can use there captain arwulf said and if there are any people who have claimed that land ill send a mapmaker with you we need to know more about our neighbors it was a mark of king valdemars new teachingsfor he had chosen as the motto of his kingdom the words no one way is the true waythat navar felt that he might refuse this order did he think it was a task beyond his ability and true it was that never had he commanded men and women in the field though he was well liked by his fellow soldiers navars skills had always been set to tasks where he must only command himself yet it was a needful task and one he did not think beyond his ability and so he asked merely to choose those who would accompany him and to this request captain arwulf made no demur saying only that there was no better mapmaker than the one he had already chosen almost did navar reconsider his audacity at accepting such a great undertaking when on the very day he and his dozen chosen soldiers were to depart he first met young doladan the lad seemed to him hardly older than prince restil and he frankly admittedafter hed fallen off his mule while attempting to adjust his cloak greet navar and repack his saddlebags all at the same timethat hed never held sword or bow in his life in the old valdemar hed been the master gardeners chief assistant and when several of navars soldiers dared to laugh at this admission he pointed out hotly that the baronial gardens had covered several hundred acres and without detailed mappings of what was planted whereand what should be planted wherethe gardens would have been a wilderness i wouldnt be so high and mighty if i were you doladan said fiercely if mistress karilgrass werent here now to tell everyone what plants were safe to eat you louts would have had a leaner winter than you did true enough navar said for the beginning of a journey was no time to set a grudge weve all become more than we were in the last year and more and if youll oblige me by learning a bit of swordwork why torimund and felara here will learn a bit of gardening doladan navar realized was quite beautiful when he laughed they followed the river north and west for rivers were natural roads and any threat to come to haven would come more swiftly along the water road at each stop doladan sketched tirelessly filling page after page with detailed notes and taking samples of plants and leaves as well navar had hoped to be back in haven by high summer but the expedition took longer than he had planned for the forest proved to be dark and dangerous full of twisted creatures when torimund died doladan said angrily that that the name of the forest should be pelagir a word that meant danger in one of the old tongues and pelagiris forest it became forest of dangers but if torimund was the first casualty of the journey he wasnt the last they lost six of their twelve soldiers before they won their way home again with the first frost nipping at their heels when he and his company staggered back into haven with the maps and surveys they had paid for with the lives of half their comrades navar was shocked to see that the settlement hed leftcrude wooden huts and houseshad been transformed through equal application of magecraft and sweat to a city that rivaled well perhaps not high ashuel the eastern empires capital but certainly one of the smaller cities in the empire they had left behind them and well king valdemar and queen terilee and lord beltran now king valdemars chancellor were all mages and mages could work miracles overnight where mere men would require moonturns of backbreaking work but haven now was larger than navar had ever thought it could beand as much stone as wood i am so glad to get home doladan said he gestured at the young city before them and only look nav wallsand roofsand floors and neither of us had to build any of them well sleep warmer this winter than last ill wager if we can find our own roofs by first snow senard grumbled from behind them i hope theyve built barracks as well as all these houses i hope theyve built a tavern rusama chimed in she glanced across the stubble of the fields good harvest means good beer navar let their chatter wash over him as he brooded on the sight before him seeing haven flourishing so impossibly navar realized his greatest fear had never been for some future that he would not live to see but of a present that he most certainly would if this fragile new kingdom grew past the ability of the great and the good to watch over it who would defend it from soferus plots hardorn had ever been the empires enemy it would be a great coup for the iron throne to gain a foothold on hardorns western border he feared that day had already come who was governing the city who was making sure that the right decisions were being made no matter what else might happen in haven harleth and arwulf were competent soldiers and so there were sentry riders set beyond the far bounds of the town one of them came to direct navars little company to the new stables and barracks and to tell navar where he could find captain arwulf hed hoped to make his report there and be released from his duties for it was doladans report that king valdemar would wish to hear not his but arwulf had merely grunted when he presented himself and told him that general harleth would want to see him at the palace not a patch on what its going to be arwulf said but well enough for now praise the all that valdemars prayers were answered prayers doladan asked his eyes bright and shining as he drank in all the changes that their moonturns away from haven had wrought youll see arwulf said haven had been no more than a mean scrabble of leanto shelters and tattered tents when navar had ridden out now though the air was filled with the scent of newcut timber and the buildings that greeted their eyes as they walked in the direction arwulf had indicated were all sharp and raw and new they were sturdy and wellmade perhaps master rilbard had built the sawmill that hed talked of all the winter for navar could think of no other means by which so much good cut timber could have been procured in so short a time there were even sturdy plank walkways edging the wide packedearth streets and that would be a great boon come the rains the air was filled with the sound of hammering and sawingand with the laughter and song of children as well when haven was being designed on the dark days of winter when little else could be done but plan and wait for spring parks and playing grounds had been thought as necessary to haven as common gardens and proper drainage soon enough they reached the far end of the city and what would someday be the royal palace for now the palace barely deserved the name though it was grand enough considering their circumstances a threestoried manor house of magecured wood rivaling if not the baronial palace valdemar had left behind then certainly a manor house of one of his more prosperous underlords it stood in the middle of a vast open parkland upon the banks of the river terilee its fields straddling the river and stretching away to forest left yet uncleared beyond it where gardens might otherwise have stood stonemasons had outlined the footings of what navar could tell would become the permanent palace and many workers were coming and going in good cheer it was a busy place full of industry with children watching the goingson with interest navar could see several horses standing free in the fields on the rivers far banks their coats brilliant white and shining in the autumn sun he wondered if wild horses had been found by another scouting party tamed and brought back for breeding stock his group had seen nothing of the sort on their travels either in the northern valley or in the heart of the forest that had tried so hard to claim their lives with its menace but captain arwulf had surely sent others in directions other than to the west general harleth when found proved to be one of the men hauling stone for the palaces foundation stripped bare to the waist and sweating even in the cooler air of late fall one of the brightshining horses was lingering nearby watching the proceedings with what navar would swear was an assessing look on its face and navar revised his earlier thought uneasily this was surely no newtamed wild horseits every line spoke of quality and breeding navar had friends among valdemars ostlers and in his many visits to the formerbaronial stables he had never seen horses with such a glow to them when he gained harleths attention navar gave his report upon the spot as tersely as possible for he could feel doladan vibrating beside him with excitement doladan had learned some measure of grace during their travels but his ebullience was undimmed before doladan could move to spread out his pages of sketchings on a stonewallinprogress to show them off harleth snickered at some thought navar could not guess and clapped doladan on the back come he said shifting his gaze to navar to include him in the invitation the king and queen and the heralds council are eager to hear your report the phrasing made navar wince inwardly for harleth had never before seemed the type of man to take it upon himself to speak for the baronturnedking heralds council had the worst of navars fears come to pass and king valdemar had been influenced into letting power pass from his control so quickly and who of the men and women who had been moving to secure their position in valdemars new kingdom had been named to such a governing council and how had valdemar judged them worthy how could any man be satisfied that he had properly taken the measure of another without resorting to the same mind magic coercion the empire had used so freely and king valdemar had decried so fiercely had king valdemar set principle aside for expedience have we fallen so far so quickly doladan either did not notice or did not think general harleths words troublesome for he simply fell into step beside harleth as the general reached for his discarded tunic and set out for the manor house navar would have chosen rather to wash and change his travelstained clothes before showing himself before the king but harleth seemed to see no reason for delay he led them straight to where king valdemar and queen terilee were holding court and the moment their small party stepped into the salon valdemar rose and held out his hands welcome back he said in his warm and booming voice that always inspired such trust and confidence in those who heard it we had feared you lost not lost navar said his mind unquiet looking around to see who was in the room he recognized but half of the two dozen men and women present and his heart sank further at the sight of so many for how could so many have fairly been judged it seemed frighteningly likely that valdemar had chosen but one or two or five and they had filled his court with their own partisans for of those he recognized half were those he would not think to name to any council he would be comfortable obeying and he could name at least as many more who he would have thought should be present and werent juuso beltran was there of course now kings chancellor and young prince restil now entering his fifteenth year and those were to be expected but so was mistress emolde who had been wetnurse to both restil and dethwyn his elder brother lorton one of valdemars journeyman mages was present but not blydel or imryn the others mistress karilgrass the chief gardener and doladans old master was present but captain arwulf was not it was not that navar thought all of those present were poor choices how could he he did not know them all yet it seemed that these people were king valdemars chosen council how could so many who had joined the exodus as it proceeded have risen to such power tell us everything king valdemar urged what of your travels is the danger containable and that was a curious thing to hear from the king for navar had mentioned the loss of his men and women to general harleth but he had not had time to speak of it here perhaps king valdemar had been able to intuit the danger from the fact that their return had been so delayed or perhaps king valdemar was listening to his mind even now navar blanked his face and did all he could to bury his thoughts reporting briefly on what they had found in contrast to navars taciturnity doladan chattered so energetically it seemed he scarce drew a breath his maps were passed from hand to hand and each man and woman who saw them had some thoughtful thing to contribute lorton pointed out a range of hills that might prove to contain iron for mining a woman whose name navar did not know spoke of the possibility that the valley to the north might be suitable for a farming settlement in another year or several navar could fault none of the questions or observations made but neither could he shake the sense of unease that surrounded him like a cloaks mantle he listened carefully and he watched even more carefully for since the day that captain harleth had taken him from the ranks of valdemars household guard and set him the task of going forth and gathering informationnot spying never that for spying was quite another matter than simply walking over the land and seeing what was to be seennavar had been able to see all before him and remember what he saw and as he watched doladans speech before valdemars new council navar saw a great riddle lying at the councils heart it was not merely that they spoke of sharing doladans report with those absent for any might do that or that they spoke names he did not know for even now he did not know all the inhabitants of haven it was that they spoke of these others as if they were present now again and again he heard ardatha says or kyrith thinks and whoever they werefor those names too were strange to himthey were obviously held in high regard for their advice was always heeded doladan would have willingly talked the sun out of the sky so on fire was he to tell of all he had seen and learned but at last king valdemar broke off with a rueful laugh but ardatha tells me i am being very rude to keep you standing and talking when you are undoubtedly tired and thirsty and wish for nothing more than a hot meal and a clean bed i am certain juuso can see you lodged be certain though that we hope to hear more of your journey even the most informal court was a court nonetheless navar said nothing as he and doladan followed lord beltran from the salon but when the doors had closed behind the three of them he cleared his throat meaning no disrespect but id as soon go back to barracks id be more comfortable there than in a palace lord beltran did not answer immediately he seemed to be listening to words navar could not hear and whatever they were he found them amusing indeed there have been many changes in haven since you left us i hope you will find them to your liking and if i do not navar wondered wed thought the western lands were empty he said carefully its good to see weve found friends here i saw their horses i think as i walked through the park to his surprise and consternation lord beltran threw back his head and roared with laughter horses he said when he could draw breath again oh they have the look of horsesi grant you thatbut the companions are the answer to a prayer arent they horses doladan asked before navar could make some polite demur to get the two of them out of there whatever madness had taken the new kingdom for its nursery chancellor beltran was obviously its nurserymaid lord beltran clapped doladan on the shoulder and navar bristled with the helpless need to protect one who had become dearer than self in the past moonturns come the kings chancellor said let us share a cup of wineor a stoup of new aleand i shall tell you both of how fortune and all the good gods have smiled upon our kingdom the ale was goodand beltran was no fool for he provided bread and cheese as well the food and drink went down navars throat with more ease than the tale he was told their band of refugees had grown to twice its original size during their flight from the eastern empire during navars absence the kingdom of valdemar had grown again for valdemars legend had taken root and all knew that the new king meant his land to be a haven of freedom tempered by lawone that would fall equally upon the shoulders of high and low mage and commoner navar had heard the inevitable problems whispered about that not merely lawabiding exiles and fugitives would flock to valdemars banner but every stormcrow and wolfshead and gallowglass that velgarth held men and women who would make of their refuge a sanctuary for lawlessness and depravity in fact many such had attempted to join them seeking protection from welldeserved justiceonly to find that they had leaped from the cooking pot into the cookstove itself and so one spring night when a new band of refugees had arrived petitioning to become citizens of valdemar king valdemar had prayed to all the gods and goddesses that his kingdom would be saved for all time from corruption such as he and his people had fled so that valdemar would never fear to be a haven for the innocent nor a judge of the wicked his prayer had been answeredso lord beltran would have itby the appearance from a copse of woodland in the palace park of a shining creature in the shape of a horsesave that its hooves were of shining silver and its eyes of deepest blue these horsesor as lord beltran would style them companions for there were now nearly twenty of the creatures in valdemarwere able to speak directly into the minds of their chosen though not directly to any other they were as smart as any man or woman but infinitely wiser and more good i should like to see one doladan said yearningly and kyrith is eager to meet you as well lord beltran said smiling but without a companion of your own what conversations you might have would be more than a little onesided tomorrow we will go to companions field and speak to him doladan opened his mouth to reply and navar feared that his next words would be a request for a companion of his own already navars heart was troubled enough for it seemed to him that he had never seen lord beltran as barons seneschal or kings chancellor look so much at his ease as if a great burden had been lifted from him he spoke up quickly saying they had kept lord beltran from his duties long enough and would be on their way you all but dragged me out of there by the hair doladan complained once they were in the open air once more navar looked about himself several of the white horses were in sight but none close enough to hear i wonder how it is you lived to grow up he said with a sigh the king surrounds himself with an outlandish courtlord beltran tells a tale of otherworldly guardians in horse shape who come in answer the kings prayers and that can speak into the minds of the folk it is but a small step from speaking to overshadowingand we have but lord beltrans word that these beasts are good and wise butking valdemar is a great mage doladan sputtered nearly skipping in his agitation and his need to keep up with navars long strides there is no mage so great that he may not meet a greater one navar said grimly the barracks had been half built even before theyd left as dormitory buildings were the quickest and most efficient way of getting havens population out of tents and under roofs but they werent the cheeriest lodgings to be had navar was spared that this night for on his way back theredoladan at his heelshe spied proof that haven had become a city in truth a tavern there was not yet a royal mint established or any coin circulated but the tavernkeeper was willing to take navars signed chit in payment the journeys end had all they might have found elsewhere and one thing more gossip this was not the only tavern in havennavar was surprised to discover there were fourbut it was the oldest by three moonturns and the largest and the nearest to the new palace men and women came here to drink beer and cider to get a hot meal and to exchange the news of the day that news was as grim as the news that lord beltran had relayed word of these companions were on everyones lips from those who wished to be chosen themselves to those who simply wished to give thanks that king valdemars prayers had been answered none had anything less than full praise to deliver for these companions supposed wisdom and goodness which merely raised navars suspicions further one hallmark of life learned through painful lessons there was naught so good that someone would not despise it for none to speak ill of these companions spoke less of the quality of valdemars prayers and more to navars worst fears doladan sought to discuss what they had learned but navar bade him hold his tongue for he had already decided this haven had turned to nightmare and navar would not remain to be overshadowed in turn they would leave at first light he and doladan and make their way up the river terilee until they could find a suitable place to winter where they would be sheltered from forests dangers come spring they would continue pressing west or perhaps south until they found another settlementone that bent knee to neither iron throne nor white spirithorses he outlined his plans to doladan in a quiet voice masked by the sound of revelry in the tavern as drunken men grew more drunken and doladan looked as though he held back protest navar kept his eyes moving around them looking for any signs that someone was paying more attention to them than he should ill slip out after weve retired and find a storehouse to provision us navar said while trying to decide if the barmaid was showing too much interest in their bowedhead conference i do so wish you wouldnt its the only way we can be sure to have sufficient supplies for a winter navar said trying to bite back his anger that doladan would question him hadnt he proven his ability to plan and execute a long journey already we dont know how harsh the winters of this land will be doladan ducked his head cant we stay here and see what will happen what if thesethese companions arent a sign of something bad what if theyre exactly what people say they are you never suffered beneath the boot of the iron throne navar dropped his voice even further i have seen what power drives men to do and i tell you freedom is sweet i will not fall beneath a madmans subjugation a second time navar brought doladan back to their room and impressed upon him the urgency of remaining where he was then dressed himself in his darkest clothes and smeared ash from the firepit across his cheeks and forehead as though he had simply failed to bathe after a days long labor it was well past midnight when all in the taverns front room had finally retired for the evening and he could slide noiselessly through the taverns doors the night was clear and cold and the moon was barely a sliver after years of scouting it was second nature for navar to remain in the shadows where an onlookers eyes might pass him by he wished he had had more time to learn the lay of the city for the only storehouse whose location he could be sure of was the one that served valdemars army and that was perilously close to the palace grounds but every instinct was telling him to be gone by suns rising and that meant he could spare no time creeping from door to door until he found somewhere with sufficient wealth to serve their needs and besides he had served baron valdemar for thirty loyal years true he had been well paid for them all but he did not think valdemar would begrudge him the cost of what he would take as a parting gift while his conscience would not let him steal from another the armys storehouse was locked of course and navar spent a moment praying to all the good gods that it was not locked by magecraft for he no longer had the tools king valdemar had betimes equipped him with for defeating the magelock of an enemy his luck was with him though and so he knelt before the lock to work at it with two scraps of wire he had brought with him for that very purpose you are the stubbornest man i have ever encountered navars nerves were well hardened against shock and so he did not leap in fright to hear someone speak to him merely turned his head to see whether he was at swordspoint or whether he had a chance of winning free it was no man who spoke to him though at least not in his ears as he rose slowly to his feet he saw one of the spirithorses staring at him near to the turning that would lead to the palace and he would have sworn it beckoned him to come near and was that not proof of sorcery or mind magic being applied for navar found himself following without thought to his own safety through the streets across the grounds of the palace over the bridge to the fields beyond without struggling against the witchery another voice sounded different than the first he thinks were bewitching him he doesnt realize his heart truly wants him to follow is he still being stubborn yet another voice this time and navar realized that they were sounding not in his ears but in his mind the realization made panic rise in his throat for to hear voices in the mind meant sorcery and sorcery meant that he was far too late silence all of you youre frightening him navar this is no sorcery you have the ability to hear us all it is a skill nothing more tell him the spirithorse that had led him stamped its foot as yet another voice interjected and all of a sudden navars mind was silence again he looked around startled to find that he had crossed the bridge across the river terilee into the field beyond into the copse of trees that waited there this is companions field the voice that had bade the others to silence said looking at the spirit horse that had led him navar realized it must belong to the voice or the voice belong to it he was certain enough of it that when the voice continued it seemed in response to that new understanding and yes i am ardatha king valdemars companion and i have led you here because we cant let you go running off until youre satisfied that we are no demons nor pawns of some great sorcerer and valdemar is not overshadowed by some other mage we need you valdemar needs you king and kingdom alike and i am to believe that navar said his voice rough well he knew that a mans anger was a blade set at his own throat yet he could not keep himself from feeling it he thought of doladan awaiting him in their bed at the taverndoladan who trusted too quickly and too easily he thought of the hope that he might live in freedom and under law a hope that had kindled from a fragile spark to a great blaze over so many moonturns it is for this hope that we have come ardatha said to crush it navar growled for he had discovered that it was far more painful to have a dream destroyed than to live without dreams at all no never and though ardathas face was a horses face in his mind navar could feel the companions emotions as if he could see them on ardathas face horror and disgust and anger and an utter repudiation of the thought of tricking king valdemar into a tyrannous rule navar desperately wanted to believe and he knew that faces and voices could lie but for the first time since he had discovered that valdemar had become infested by mindcontrolling spiritbeasts it occurred to him to wonder if these companions were in fact the answer to king valdemars prayer to keep his kingdom free of tyranny and corruption just how were they going to go about it we choose ardatha said and those we choose are good men and good women who will govern and lead and administer the laws of valdemar wisely thats all navar asked after a moment you just pick people it didnt seem like much he had the sense that ardatha was clearing his throat in mild rebuke though he could not say how he came to have that sense we choose ardatha corrected and we advise our chosen speaking to them mindtomind as i am to you though you are the first who can hear all of us each whom we choose has some gift of magery though perhaps so small that it has never been noticed before to be chosen is a great responsibility you havent chosen me have you navar asked in alarm if he could hear ardatha the silvery laughter of a dozen companions filled his mind until ardatha stamped his hoof i have chosen kordas and our bond shall endure until one of us dies you and i merely speak together through your gift of mindspeech as i hope to persuade what is surely the stubbornest man in all valdemar not to leave you could tell the king to order me to stay navar said i could ask kordas to ask you ardatha corrected he would not compel you to remain against your will nor will i nor will any of those who have been chosen compel you to stay prince restil or herald beltran or herald peralas they will but ask as do i peralas navar recalled was general harleths milkname he thought of the heralds council and its unlikely membership it seemed to himstanding here in the freezing dark beside a horse that was far more than a horsethat this was no more than a dream but valdemar itself was a dreamthe best dream the hearts of men could hold rather than the uneasy nightmare of oppression and tyranny they had fled he thought of the pelagiris forest and he knew there would be no sanctuary for him and for doladan there and a man might live rough for one moonturn or even a dozen but in the end all that might be found in a solitary life in the wilderness was starvation and an early death worth it to die in freedom foolishness if he fled merely from shadows in his own mind i am nothing and no one he said at last i can hardly threaten your plans for valdemar ardatha seemed to sigh in exasperation hardly the companion said but you can make them a realityif you have the courage courage navar asked his voice was hard for no one had ever questioned his courage not even a oh what did you call us mindcontrolling spiritbeast infesting valdemar and tricking kordaspoor simpleminded kordasinto placing his people under a tyrannous rule the voice in navars mind was a new one somehow as feminine as ardathas was masculine it belonged to the white horsethe companionwho walked from the stand of woods behind ardatha and stood at his side if you believe that king valdemar is so weak and foolish its a wonder you followed him all this way the new companion added i believed navar said simply then believe in him still the new companion said more gently now help him he needs good men and yesstubborn ones to do what navar asked roughly taking a step toward her what is right she answered alwaysonlywhat is right her words were feast after famine water in the desert in the east the baron had been accounted a good man but to keep his people safe he had been forced to turn a blind eye to injustices done outside his own borders so many times in his service to the barony navar had been forced to balance what was right against what was safeor politicor possibleand the actions he had taken had caused him to armor his heart so that he could deafen himself to its promptings the reality was so simple now that he could see it he had lived so long in that chambered silence that he had nearly succumbed to the greatest folly of all of believing in evil and refusing to believe in good he had believed in valdemars dream when it had seemed dangerous and impossible he would believe now he took a last step forward and reached out his hand the nothorse placed her soft muzzle into it my name is tisarand navar i would choose you for my companion if you would have a mindcontrolling spiritbeast it was as if the sound of her name had unlocked a floodgate within his own mind his answerpromise and agreement and avowalcame faster than he could form words conscious choice and automatic answer all at once navar took another step forward wrapping his arms around her neck and burying his face in her silken mane his body shook with reactionhe had come so close to stealing away into the night thinking valdemar had been taken over by monsters not monsters at all but something far greater hope i might have gone after you to bring you back tisarand said and i would have disliked that very much we have a great deal of work to do here navar yes navar said yes we do he took a deep breath and the first thing we have to do is get back to the tavern before doladan comes looking for me hes a man of many giftsincluding that of getting hopelessly lost within a few yards of his own doorway tisarands mirth sounded like silver bells within his mind and navars voice sounded strange in his own ears it was a moment before he recognized the new note in it it was joy softly falling snow by elizabeth a vaughan elizabeth a vaughan writes fantasy romance her most recent novel is white star part of the star series at the present she is owned by three incredibly spoiled cats and lives in the northwest territory on the outskirts of the black swamp along mad anthonys trail on the banks of the maumee river i believe that is the last issue before us today queen elspeth the peacemaker kept her face composed as she rose stiffly from her seat thus cutting off the possibility of further discussion her knees creaked as she straightened up shed had more than enough for one day the council is adjourned my thanks my lords chairs scraped back as the councilors rose and bowed as she swept out of the room the full skirts of her royal whites brushing the floor as queens own lancir had the privilege of accompanying her back to her chambers he extended his arm and she placed her fingers lightly on his wrist as custom dictated the private audiences now i believe elspeth tried to make her voice regretful but lancir had her measure he arched an eyebrow as they walked toward her chambers only one your majesty for some reason not many seek a private audience with you during this season true enough and those that do dont linger elspeth agreed refreshing how they get straight to the point i am sure he said dryly ill have one of the herald trainees escort lord wolke to you she gave him an impish look and he quirked an eyebrow at her a few paces before her door he stopped and bowed the guards opened the doors on her approach and they also bowed as she moved past she nodded to them both as she stepped into her antechamber only to meet with a flock of bright songbirds or so it seemed to her her handmaidens all daughters and wives of her councilors were fluttering about dressed in all the colors of the rainbow she towered over most of them like the thin old stick she was some days it made her feel as plain as a pin to wear her plain royal whites with the black trim of mourning her companion stirred in the back of her mind and sent an image of a mink the black tip of its tail twitching elspeth sent back a pulse of laughter she might not have mindspeech but theyd communicated very well this way for all the many years since shed been chosen she wondered if her dear one was warm enough the feeling of a warm blanket draped over her shoulders and she knew that all was well she turned her attention back to the room and the chorus of voices that resounded around her you cant your majesty dont go out there youll catch your death its snowing one of the youngest cried out and the flock circled and wheeled around the room to press their faces to the windows looking out over her private gardens meredith her maid of many years stood nearby ive your boots warming by the fire she said quietly do you need assistance elspeth gave her a grateful nod yes please it wasnt easy to admit that she needed some help with dressing but meredith understood and made no fuss elspeth sank onto one of the chairs closest to the hearth and drew her petticoats and skirt up meredith knelt down and gently eased off her slippers dont linger too long your majesty she said softly theres a formal court dinner tonight ill remember elspeth said with a smile meredith gave her a knowing look as she laced up the boots but she said nothing more she just helped elspeth with her heavy winter white cloak the hood lined with white fur she retrieved the matching white furred muff for her hands elspeth smiled at her warm as toast mind you stay that way meredith whispered with the ease of an old friend ill send out tea for you and your guest elspeth turned to the garden door smiled blandly at her protesting women and stepped outside she closed the door firmly behind her and took a deep breath of cold air silence blessed silence the cold air stung at her flushed cheeks and she took another breath watching the vapor rise her private garden lay deep in a blanket of snow the trees were frosted like cakes and the ground sparkled as if diamond dust had been blown over the crust of white her spirits lifted after a morning spent in an overheated council chamber oh how she loved winter a path had been stamped out and she followed its curve as it angled away from the door her skirts brushed along swishing against the edges of the path there in what was normally a rose bower sat two benches opposite each other a brazier set between filled with glowing coals the rosebushes cut back for the season protruded from the snow like thin black fingers she settled on one with a sigh of pleasure and looked about at the trees the sky was a pale blue with just a few clouds that promised more snow later on but for now there was only the occasional fat fluffy flake falling to rest on the fur of her muff the snow made everything look different perfect with the covering of white and the glint of ice cold and lovely her heraldmages had offered to set up a warm shelter or cast a warming spell on the benches but she had refused they didnt seem to understand that the entire point was to be cold well that and keeping these private audiences short and sweet no one lingered with petitions and political maneuvering in this kind of weather elspeth had been too long on the throne to actually chuckle but she smiled inside two pages approached bundled up and carrying a tray and a small table she offered them thanks as they set the table down and poured her a large mug of tea she slipped her bare hands out of her muff and carefully took the hot mug in her hands enjoying the warmth please let the queens own know that i am ready elspeth smiled at the pages the two young lads bowed slowly then ran off down the path to the door elspeth sipped her tea enjoying the white perfection of the cold stillness she heard the door open and one of the herald trainees appeared with lord wolke in tow the trainee hadnt bothered with a cloak and he walked briskly toward her she plastered on her court smile setting her mug down on the bench next to her your majesty the trainee looked so serious and so very young as he bowed but all the trainees looked younger to her every day lord wolke lord wolke bowed as well his cloak wrapped tight around his body such a handsome young man with charming manners or so shed been told elspeth smiled as the trainee left them alone sit lord wolke may i pour you some tea that would be most welcome your majesty he sat on the stone bench gingerly as if afraid hed freeze off something valuable you honor me not really im afraid she handed him his mug and then refreshed her own this is an honor my court avoids at all costs i cant seem to convince them of the loveliness of the garden after a snow even my companion prefers a warm stable elspeth cast her mind in that direction to be met with a sleepy comfortable response their loss is my gain your majesty he flashed her a smile oh yes there was charm there indeed no wonder half her ladies had lost their heads over him arent you nice she laughed lightly ive always loved to come out into a clear cold day and enjoy the sun i am so glad you could join me wolke shifted his weight on the bench and tried to adjust his knees so they wouldnt come into contact with the brazier ive been at court for some time your majesty yes she picked up her mug and gave him that same smile without a summons or invitation let us discuss that my lord elspeth watched as young wolke retreated down the path moving as fast as dignity allowed the afternoon shadows had lengthened in the garden and thin clouds had moved in the snow had turned a pale bluish color the tree branches blacker in contrast the lights from the window cast a glow over the drifts in front of the windows night would fall soon enough still she sat deep in her furs and white leathers and stared into the glowing coals of the brazier the pages approached again with more fuel and tea she watched as they fed the coals and filled her mug i do not wish to be disturbed i will come in when i am ready elspeth said and they bowed and ran off back to the warmth of the palace they probably thought her mad or eccentric lancir understood as did some of the older members of her council they knew it wasnt so much the cold or the snow that drew her out of the warm palace snow meant that armies were not moving to mass at the border to threaten valdemar the cold kept feuding lords at their hearths bandits did not attack settlements or raid the herds of cattle since any fool could track the transgressors in the snow ice cloaked the roads and paths in treacherous footing rivers froze the ice uncertain various religious holidays and celebrations kept people busy with other tasks rather than killing their neighbors the lack of daylight concealed the world keeping those with malice inside their lights burning bright they might plan and plot connive and ponder but they stayed within winter was peace made manifest she dreaded spring oh not the warmth or the violets with their lovely scent it was a joy to watch the garden come alive again small green leaves and delicate flowers emerged from the soil almost overnight but the land wasnt the only thing astir the fragile network of agreements that shed built over her reign always trembled under the strain of spring she could already see problems looming she stared at the fire and wondered if shed have the strength to deal with it all she heard the door open and the crunch of footsteps on the path her eyes werent what they used to be but she recognized the stride of the man coming toward her his scarlet uniform a stark contrast to the snow as he grew closer she could see his face one that still stirred her heart after all these years he approached and then made a formal bow with a flourish of his hand your majesty he said as he knelt in the snow his tone a mocking one the queens own has asked that i inquire as to your welfare bard kyran elspeth glanced toward the door i take it then that they can see us from the windows why else would i be on my knee in the snow beloved kyran looked up his eyes twinkling some of the younger handmaidens are pressed to the farthest window watching to see if i can convince you to come in and get warm those eyes shed fallen for those eyes so many years ago those eyes that seemed to glow for her and her alone the years had not dulled their sparkle sit with me for a moment she said gesturing to the bench so that the watchers knew she had given her permission youve a formal court dinner this night kyran reminded her as he rose with grace and settled on the bench ah still warm from young wolkes ass he held his hands over the brazier and rubbed them together he blew through the chamber without a word or a nod to anyone are we rid of him then yes she tucked her hand back into her fur muff i sent him back to his lands young fool the ladies of the court will be crushed hed charmed almost all of them idiot elspeth growled to think he thought he could claim a position on my council i should have boxed his ears now there would be something to sing about kyran chuckled gather now my children for you should truly hear of the night that elspeth peacemaker boxed young wolkes ears he raised his eyebrows theres still time i doubt hes left the palace yet she stared at him a sudden sorrow welling up in her chest he frowned concerned elspeth was it worth it beloved she choked out tears beyond her control filling her eyes she clamped down on the pain to protect her sleeping companion understanding filled his face oh my love what brought this on i dont know elspeth closed her eyes letting the tears fall i woke this morning and i felt so tired so very tired i do not think i can bear the spring kyran i just wanted to lie there in my warm bed with my soft pillows and sleep forever elspeth kyran whispered no elspeth blinked her eyes not daring to lift a hand to wipe the tears away since the day i took the throne ive fought argued beguiled and struggled to keep the peace she looked away from him up to the snowcovered trees i turned from you my love to marry a man i didnt love for the sake of an alliance elspeth kyran grew somber so long ago even after his death i used my mourning as a political tool fending off other offers of marriage playing them off against each other elspeth held herself still on the bench not moving a hand or making a gesture that would give the watchers any information and then darvi my son my beautiful boy dead her voice caught in her throat and for a moment they sat in silence and shared pain she looked down at her muff where a few tears were clinging to the hairs of the fur small diamonds against the white which brings to mind a bit of gossip from the city kyrans voice was rough seems that one of the craftsmen of the city recently died in his will he took advantage of that new law of yours the one about the statuary elspeth choked out all too willing to change the subject thats the one seems he was fair well off being of a thrifty bent hes endowed a statue of himself to be built in the city and provided for its upkeep kyran cleared his throat has the nobility in a bit of a snit how so elspeth asked i placed no limits on well the dead gentleman has apparently snagged one of the busiest crossroads in the city so very soon theres to be erected a statue with a water fountain for any and all to drink from and not just humanstheres a lower font for animals elspeth knew kyran well she titled her head and waited for it well it seems our craftsman is fairly short of frame and rather round and bald i understand he was well known for his cheerful countenance so in among the heros of the realm and the proud members of the noble bloodlines he will stand smiling happily holding the tools of his trade much to the horror of the noble lords and ladies he laughed that easy laugh she loved so well i should have named you laureate she watched as a few flakes settled in his thinning hair me he widened his eyes in mock horror wear a coronet and attend all those interminable council meetings he shook his head and have the entire court and kingdom speculate on our relationship elspeth it would not have worked besides i have had all that i

some time i was hustled out of there and informed in no uncertain terms that just was not done kyrans laughter echoed off the stone walls and well and truly punished by the bardic councilfifty copies of my ladys eyes do you know how many lines that song has add in the instrumental parts kyran shook his head i thought the cramp in my hand would be with me until the end of my days he focused on her

the bardic council i think i fell in love right then and there with your dark hair and flashing eyes and the scent of violets kyran tilted his head back so very serious as he looked up into the trees why is it that we remember the pain of our lives more than the joy her breath caught in her throat i dont know beloved then know this elspeth queen of valdemar and my love kyrans voice was low and strong she hung on every word as he intended no doubt valdemar has been at peace since your fathers time and you are the reason everything you have done everything you have suffered has been worth

throat but then common sense intervened youre freezing i am come youve a court dinner and even queen elspeth the peacemaker had best not anger the cooks kyran stood and offered his arm she stood stepped close to him you still smell like violets kyran whispered he held out his arm elspeth placed her hand on his wrist stroking his cold skin with her fingers tips as they started down the path kyran flipped his hand and for a brief sweet moment their fingers intertwined before returning to their proper places meredith is on duty in my inner chamber tonight she offered the bit of information with a sly look really kyran arched an eyebrow at her meredith likes me if an old worn out bard were to appear at your chamber door late at night shed open it and none the wiser true elspeth said id even welcome an old wornout bard to my chamber away from prying eyes and whispering tongues figures moved in the glow behind the windows as they grew closer the door opened letting warm air wash over

mathematically guarded secret the square root of minus the hypotenuse of an isosceles right triangle with a side length of lubonnes wooden sword cut through the icegrained air of early spring and his feet stamped evergreen needles deeper into the muck sharp brown burrs clung to his britches and the hem of his tunic prickling through the fabric as he moved his bandy legs switched directions with sharp precision their shortness belying their strength and speed his relatively long arms supplied a reach that never failed to surprise opponents the practice blade skipped around his homely features his eyes small and pallid his nose broad and overarching his mouth thin lipped but wide mousebrown hair cut short framed his features unwanted curls fluffing it at the back a voice interrupted lubonnes solitary practice hello there it left an impression of femininity and strength yet it felt strangely ephemeral as if he sensed rather than heard it lubonne hid his startlement behind a feigneddeliberate sword stroke it bothered him that while he practiced martial maneuvers he had allowed someone to sneak so close through his defenses he had heard stories of fey and magical creatures inhabiting these and other woodlands tales of spirits and drakes of humans taking beastform and nature yet none of them involved friendly voices shocking through a young mans mind in broad daylight keeping the mock weapon raised he glanced around the clearing as usual lubonne squinted the sun painful in his toolight eyes trees and shrubbery flashed through his vision as he turned then something brilliant white seized his full attention it was large and horseshaped its forelock and mane snagged with the same type of burrs that clung to his clothing one enormous blue eye nearly as pallid as his own studied him his gaze went immediately to its back where no rider or saddle perched not even a dirtsmudge to suggest one ever had it wore no bridle or halter either lubonne lowered his sword whats this he had seen only one animal this magnificent the stallion herald walthin rode whenever he came to town has something happened to walthin suddenly alarmed he called out sharply herald walthin are you all right walthin has decent hearing but i doubt your voice will carry all the way to valdemar lubonne went utterly still his next shout frozen on his lips the voice in lubonnes head recited the answers to questions he had not yet thought to ask yes a white horselike creature is speaking to you no theres no other human around yes im speaking directly into your mind it paused apparently hoping he would take his turn lubonne found himself still incapable of action except to pinch himself through the fabric of his britches where his buttock met his right leg he idly wondered where this convention had originated and how it had become cliché surely a man could dream he had pinched himself a detail far less shocking and strange than what faced him at the moment the creature seemed to read his mind oh and dont risk injuring your backside youre not dreaming lubonne that finally jarred his jaw loose though lubonne asked the least important of the myriad questions now bounding through his mind how do you know my name the animal studied lubonne why do you ask is it a deep dark secret of of course not i just dont have the um pleasure of of your lubonne looked around wondering if someone was playing a cruel joke his brothers probably crouched snickering behind a nearby bush carthea the beast bowed one long leg extended forward the other curled beneath its broad chest lubonne could no longer convince himself that the voice came from any other source im your companion well yes at the moment i suppose you are lubonne managed to sputter out marveling at how stupid he suddenly seemed to have become what does one say to a talking horse your companion she repeated with a capital c oh still stupid lubonne pinched himself again with the same result even if i am dreaming i can at least try to act like i have something more substantial than rocks in my head discovering no more words he left the conversation to the companion again the beast stomped a snowy hoof this is the part where you squeal oh ive always dreamed of the chance to become a herald of valdemar leap joyfully upon my back and take a smooth and magical journey to the collegium to train it is gah i still sound like a total moron lubonne shook his head trying to clear it it is carthea bobbed her head once forcefully and with finality at last lubonne discovered his wits and his tongue he bowed as if to royalty no thank you the companion merely stared what do you mean no thank you now who sounds like a moron i wasnt aware that no thank you required explanation i appreciate your generous offer but i decline it while you are an inarguably beautiful animal with clear amazing abilities i have no wish to ride to valdemar to attend a collegium nor to become a herald carthea planted all four feet in the mud left by the springmelted snow you cant refuse ive chosen you lubonne waved and started to turn ill forget it if you will just go and choose someone else who will be the wiser it doesnt work that way lubonne sighed and reluctantly looked back real or dream he hated to disappoint what seemed like a wonderful and decent animal listen carthea my answer is no and i wont change my mind i have the perfect life here im the third son of wealthy parents my older brothers inherit the land and the responsibilities that go with it i get money and no duties free to spend it as i please im engaged to an exquisite woman my life is happy and i have no intention of changing it with that he turned on his heel and left intending to walk out of cartheas life forever lubonne never looked behind him as he strode toward the village the wooden sword tucked rakishly into his belt his route took him from forest to beaten path to cobbles and it was not until he reached the latter that he heard the steady clop of hoofbeats behind him he stepped to the side and stopped making room for the rider to pass him but the instant he went still the noise ceased as well ive got horses on the mind lubonne continued on his way with his first new step the hollow unmistakable sound of hoof on stone resumed lubonne whirled to find himself nose to nose with carthea she studied him curiously through one eye neck gracefully arched head tipped perhaps i didnt make myself entirely clear carthea raised her wellmuscled neck and snorted you did lubonne glanced around to make certain no one could hear him talking to a horse seeing no one all the way to the edge of the village he continued then why are you still with me because you are mine chosen one and i am yours we are a team bonded until no lubonne waved his hands in broad gestures we are not a team we are barely nodding acquaintances ride me the temptation was great lubonne had known how to ride a horse as long as he could remember most often bareback and on boyish whim he suspected he had molded the shape of his buttocks from old rinnys back he knew a great animal when he saw one and cartheas conformation impressed him mightily he could imagine the powerful legs bunching beneath him the silky mane stroking his face the thrill of its wild gallop the closest thing to human flight i certainly will not ride you youve already told me youd carry me off to valdemar yes well im not going to valdemar or anywhere im happy here its home home is where your heart is and i dear one am your heart lubonne rolled his eyes sighing no maam im pretty sure my heart is that familiar beating thing lodged firmly in my chest he started back down the road toward his parents mansion please the sooner you leave me be the sooner you find your rightful partner without another glance deliberately deaf to the drum of hoofbeats he headed toward home and carthea followed a nudge awakened lubonne with an abruptness that sent him leaping from his bed blankets tangled around his legs his foot mired on a misplaced bedsheet and he tumbled to the wooden floor the familiar sights and smells of his bedroom surrounded him but those seemed to disappear as he focused on the one oddity a furry white head shoved through his only window carthea stared at him head cocked twin puffs of breath smoking in the cold air what the hell are you doing lubonne scrambled to his feet and attempted to wrap the blankets around himself in the process he wrenched a corner from directly under his foot and wound up sprawled on the floor a second time im sorry carthea sent did i wake you in a whirl of surprise anger and uncertainty feeling awkward as a toddler lubonne resorted to sarcasm no no im still asleep im thoroughly accustomed to massive animal heads popping through the window to shove me onto the floor he rose more carefully and twisted the blankets around his half naked body he could barely comprehend the discomfort he felt beneath her stare surely a mare even one intelligent enough to speak had no intention of judging or worrying about a humans exposed privates you dont have to mock me i can read your moods you know only then lubonne realized that she had sent him more than just words he read a mixture of emotions radiating from carthea as well she was clearly young little more than a filly uncertain and definitively frustrated and you dont have to talk at me youre quite capable of mindspeech i am lubonne shook the thought aside of course im not ive never heard herald walthin or his stallion ive certainly never mastered reading what any woman is thinking thats because youve only just met me lubonne squawked and covered his head as if this might protect his mind from the companions intrusion get out of my mind you have other gifts too strong ones in fact youd just never realize them without a companion to enhance them no no no lubonne wrapped both arms around his head trapping the blankets in place with his elbows stop enhancing me quit bothering me go away but lubonne would hear nothing more go away the horsy head retreated from the window and disappeared into the night lubonne replaced his sheets respread his blankets and tried to get back to sleep servants decorators and cooks filled the mansion and lubonne escaped into the stable as quickly as decorum allowed though excited about his upcoming engagement party lubonne withered under the constant flurry of questions he had no opinion on the menu saw no need to add flourishes to the already spectacular décor he had selected his suit weeks ago what others wore did not interest him he would not refuse a friend fresh from a spar sweating profusely and swathed in filthy rags to lubonnes relief the groomsman vannath had his bay mare saddled and bridled smiling he stirred the star on her muzzle revealing pink skin beneath the spot of white fur idly he wondered if cartheas hide was pink throughout and swiftly banished the thought he wanted nothing to do with the creature who named herself his companion ready for a ride rinny all ready master lubonne vannath replied giddy with anticipation lubonne joked why rinny old girl your voice has deepened you sound positively masculine vannath chuckled dutifully i knew youd want to get away from that sir he gestured vaguely toward the manse engagement party preparations he shook his grizzled head its no fit place for man or beast lubonne agreed walltowall womenfolk they actually seem to enjoy it he stepped into the left stirrup and swung his right leg over rinnys redbrown back to settle into the weathered saddle well im off to find honoria better make sure shes still crazy enough to agree to marry me before we seal the engagement he walked the sturdy bay from the stables and into the latemorning light vannaths voice chased him good luck master lubonne with a backward wave of acknowledgment lubonne trotted across the grounds he dared not look at the mansion hoping no one recognized him from behind and demanded his return he rode unaccosted to the gate and bent for the latch years of practice allowed him to swing it open and closed without dismounting the latches bent and battered from all the previous efforts of himself and his three brothers a perfectly measured push sent it swinging back into place and he heard the satisfying clang of its proper falling and engagement no dismount necessary this time he mentally applauded himself yes rinny stood placidly and patiently while he worked accustomed to the brothers antics she took loud noises fidgeting riders and waving sticks and swords in stride insecurity is not a crime cartheas voice came out of nowhere lubonne nearly crawled out of his skin instinctively he whirled only to find the companion just off rinnys left flank what carthea stepped out fully from behind the neighboring smithy some of our most heroic and gifted heralds initially believed themselves unworthy im not insecure every eye in the street went suddenly to lubonne reminding him he was no longer alone he waved cheerily to a friend headed for the tavern and tipped his hat toward the smiths young wife carthea had said he could use mindspeak and this seemed the perfect time to try it he focused heavily on each word i am not insecure carthea shook her head falling into lockstep with rinny stop shouting i heard you the first time she timed her steps to the bays so that it sounded as if one giant horse walked the cobbled street instead of two smaller ones lubonne reined toward the woodland path preferring to take the back route to honorias home over trying to explain the presence of the companion to every passerby he could imagine getting stopped every few steps as someone new admired the white mare and questioned him about her presence he tried to put together mental words without the emphasis wondering how much thought the creature could read im sure i told you to go away you did but youre still here that being selfevident it scarcely needed acknowledging but carthea obliged him i am why it surprised lubonne how easily rinny accepted the presence of a strange horse usually such a meeting would result in sniffling sharp whinnied challenges sometimes even a bit of mock battle because chosen one you are my heartmate my soulmate my lifemate lubonne suppressed a scream as they moved from cobbled road to wooded dirt he returned to regular speech it felt more natural exactly how many times and in how many ways do i have to say no find another heartmate carthea im not it but you are im not and you have to undergo your herald training i dont you must come i mustnt carthea pulled up directly in front of rinny perpendicular to the path and the bay pranced to a stop you can do this lubonne you really can lubonne sighed drawing rinny to the left he walked around the living road block i told you im not insecure i know i can do it ive got decent weapons training and im a damnsight smarter than herald walthin bless his kindly heart carthea followed drawing abreast of rinny again a quaver entered her sending all right perhaps its me whos insecure then im only three years old lubonne looked at carthea three years youre just a baby a fluttering wave of guilt and empathy passed through him and his patience softened he felt abruptly sorry for the persistent creature you take that back cartheas lips tightened and her wide nostrils flared im not a baby im big enough and strong enough to carry a grown man im sorry lubonne said sincerely he had not intended to offend her look carthea im just not the heroic type all right im a bit spoiled somewhat of a gadabout and satisfied with my life the way it is if i didnt wear this face he waved a hand in front of his homely features id probably be a carouser like my little brother as it is im lucky to have my beautiful honoria he could not help smiling emotion clearly crept through in his voice or thoughts you love her this honoria i do lubonne sat back as the trees bounced by them unnoticed were getting engaged officially tonight were having a party carthea tipped her head toward him and what exactly is wrong with your face lubonne stared at the companion my nose is well like a second head i dont see anything wrong with your nose of course not youre a horse your nose is your head hey im not being mean its what a horse is supposed to look like on a horse a giant honker is sweet and soft its ideal lubonne had come to grips with his appearance long ago i have a nickname hawknose my brothers call me beaky im cursed with pale squinty little eyes too that only make the nose more obvious and ive never found a way to tame this crazy hair me either carthea tossed her matted burr filled mane ah but a simple grooming will make yours shine like the stars brushing just makes my hair fluffy carthea rolled back the eye on the side of her head toward rinny to look directly at lubonne her ear went with it pressed nearly flat to her head while the other cupped forward to catch upcoming sounds why quibble over features all humans look essentially alike to me on the outside its the inside that matters and your insides my chosen are the insides of a herald lubonnes small eyes ratcheted to slits that sounds utterly disgusting carthea raised her head as if to trumpet out a whinny but no sound emerged im not talking about your bowels beloved idiot i mean your soul its gorgeous the words came with a wash of love bordering on awe and youre more gifted than i initially guessed look how quickly you picked up mindspeak the companions words gave lubonne pause but only for a moment just call me hawknose gorgeoussoul a collegium trainee it all seemed a ridiculous fantasy look carthea those sound like lovely compliments aside from the idiot part its not a matter of whether im capable of becoming a herald ill take your word that i am its just that im happy with my current life i want to live it out fully and completely and i made a lifelong promise to honoria cartheas gait went stiff she clearly wished to say something and a hint of an unidentified emotion that seemed rough and unkind slipped through the mental contact however she remained silent rinny did not need guiding to take the left fork toward honorias family home do you understand for the first time lubonne actually wondered what carthea might have been thinking what cruel words she had kept to herself responsibility heroic devotion carthea seemed to be thinking aloud these are the virtues and the curse of a herald she bobbed her head i understand lubonne heaved a sigh of relief then youll leave me alone carthea melted into the woodland shadows but the mental contact left a lasting impression lubonne scarcely dared to believe that this time it might actually finally be over a private sunny picnic with honoria drove all thought and concern about the companion from lubonnes mind their engagement felt so right so normal as opposed to the odd conversations he had shared with the magnificent horselike creature moments earlier though barely a days ride away the country of valdemar seemed like another world in another time and its selfnamed city even more so lubonne could almost convince himself that carthea had merely appeared to him in a series of weird and consecutive dreams it took most of the afternoon for honoria to pick out her dress the process every bit as tedious as the decoration of the feasting hall blurryeyed and bored within the hour lubonne found himself saying the same flattering words over and over until they sounded insincere even to himself then honorias sisters combed and cut and perfumed the couples hair until lubonne thought he could stand it no more in the end he looked exactly the same at least to his own eyes but he complimented the girls to the sun and beyond just to get them to finish dusk darkened the horizon by the time honorias parents and sisters rode off in their small family carriage they lived a modest life their fortune more meager than lubonnes own honoria planned to use lubonnes inheritance to fix up the small piece of soupy land that served as her dowry then he would secure a guarding job in the city to support her and their forthcoming family honoria perched delicately behind the saddle while sure steady rinny picked her quiet way across the packed earth roadways through the forest must we go this way my darling hawk honoria asked sweetly im afraid things falling from the trees might muss my hair the thought had occurred to lubonne but he still worried about the need to explain carthea the companion had left him to his own devices since he had chased her away that morning but she had a habit of turning up inconveniently lubonne removed his coat and held it over honorias head with one hand the other clutching rinnys reins here use this honoria looked up i dont want your coat stained either i want a perfect entrance nevertheless she took the coat in both hands and held it over her hair to protect it from the wind leaves and elements perfect entrance eh then ill have to walk in backward lubonne quipped or this nose will precede us and spoil everything he expected honoria to laugh but she did not instead she muttered at least our children wont have to worry about it lubonnes brow furrowed as he tried to make sense of the comment about what my darling at his back lubonne felt honoria stiffen nothing nothing lubonne frowned wondering what she had intended to say our children will have your stunning beauty no one will even notice the size of their noses but even should one inherit my beak its not such a bad thing ive done well enough with it he reached back to pat her hand im blessed enough to have you as my future wife honoria gripped his hand released on one side the coat flapped over her my darling hawk rinny bunched beneath them but accustomed to boys play she did not shy at the noises the wind made of his coat honoria let go of lubonnes hand to grab up both sides of his coat again and the fluttering sounds ceased soon however rinnys walk slowed to a crawl as she navigated jutting roots rocks and pocks in the makeshift roadway as the earthern path met the cobbled one lubonne pulled rinny up to wait for two servants to assist a cousins family from their coach as the cousins headed for the house and a groomsman led their horse and vehicle away lubonne reined rinny at the gate vannath took the bays reins while a servant lubonne did not recognize helped honoria dismount apparently brought in by one of the hires the young handsome man seemed to enjoy his duty a bit too much he cradled honoria in his arms as he carried more than assisted his grin containing a hint of interested leer my lady you shouldnt ride in a gown like that horse hair doesnt become anyone and the stench of the beasts is hardly perfume without so much as a glance toward lubonne he held out the young lords coat lubonne accepted it curiously whats your name groomsman the young man finally spared lubonne a haughty glance haralt sir and im not a groomsman im a server im just helping until my job comes up lubonne pursed his already thin lips into a taut line well haralt you may place my bride on the ground now last i checked she did have feet small and delicate though they are honoria giggled coquettishly as haralt obeyed yes sir turning on a heel the servant walked stiffly back toward the house while vannath took rinny to the stable lubonne crooked a brow uncertain how to feel about the exchange do you know that man of course i do a friend of my family hes sweet really sweet maybe lubonne pulled on his coat absently he watched the mans back as he headed up the walkway fine blond hair splashing over muscular shoulders but he certainly took a few liberties honoria hit lubonnes arm in mock irritation then set to work preening her dress and hair back into proper order oh please dont be so priggish youre not going to be the kind of husband who lords over me and bridles every time a man looks in my direction are you that was hardly looking in your direction she hit him again a bit harder youre going to have to get used to it when you marry an attractive woman men are going to stare stare yes lubonne knew better than to contradict honoria aloud but i dont expect them to carry off my bride he shook his head at his own concern i love her she loves me i wont let the antics of a poorly trained servant distract me from our own party he took honorias arm reveling in the silken touch of her skin you smell lovely not like horse sweat honoria pulled at the back of her gown nothing like horse sweat lubonne took a deliberate sniff a nose like mine never lies you carry the delightful scent of honoria freshly laundered lace wind and that fragrance your younger sister spilled on your head and even if you did smell like rinny i love the smell of sweet old rinny servants met them at the door fussing with collars brushing off bits of twig leaf and horse hair one stepped forward to announce loudly through the din of conversation presenting master lubonne and his lady honoria the talking ceased as if choked and silence fell over the ballroom the clapping began in one corner where lubonnes parents stood and swiftly spread in a wave that morphed into thunderous applause honoria curtsied gracefully then started up the marble staircase that arched over a balcony and into the ballroom below head high grinning at his bridetobe lubonne climbed proudly at her side a noise behind him caught lubonnes attention and it took force of will to remain focused on honoria and the crowd below them then suddenly someone cursed and the hollow sound of hoof falls on marble clattered through the chamber grin wilting lubonne whirled carthea marched up the steps at their heels looking for all the world as if she belonged there what are you doing lubonne shouted before he could think to hold his tongue what the hell are you doing only then he thought of mindspeak mother throws a fit when fathers dogs come in the house the light of every torch and candle seemed drawn to carthea and her burnished white coat gleamed so brightly that lubonne found himself squinting again someone had combed the burrs from her mane and forelock and it fell around her neck in glossy waves her pale eyes looked as gentle and innocent as an infants murmurs rose from the crowd then before lubonne could think to stop her honoria gasped in utter delight and hurled herself at him oh thank you thank you my darling hawk shes beautiful honorias warmth stunned him they had embraced before but she had always felt woodenly reluctant shy and demure no woman has ever had a more wonderful engagement gift releasing him honoria caught carthea around the neck carthea took two careful backward steps teetering on stairs designed for human paces get her off me honorias grip tightened and she buried her face in the smooth white fur no honoria you dont understand lubonne lunged for his betrothed as cartheas balance wavered you know id give you the moon and stars if they were mine to give but theyre not and neither is honoria was not listening lubonne could see cartheas delicate hooves slipping the sounds of the crowd grew louder honoria lubonne grabbed her as carthea wheeled she struck honorias a glancing blow and sending her staggering breathlessly into lubonnes arms carthea sprang the length of the stairs toward the door for an instant she hovered in midair a massive yet strangely agile bird in flight then she landed on the parquet scrambled helplessly for a moment somehow caught her footing then raced for the stillopen door she disappeared through it in a flash of snowy white leaving the attendants ashenfaced and slackjawed my horse honoria wailed loud enough for the whole assemblage to hear her my magnificent perfect engagement present she buried her face in lubonnes coat lubonne could do nothing but hold her and curse the companion who seemed hellbent on ruining his life honoria please if you want a horse ill find you the finest my money can buy but that one does not belong to me do you hear shes not mine to give you i dont want she sobbed any horse i want that one lubonne had never seen his beloved like this honoria please well talk about this after the party no no honoria refused consolation she pulled away from lubbone rubbing tenderly beneath her bosom where the hoof had grazed her is no one in this hall man enough to catch her for me her gaze roved over the gathering to land directly on the servant who had helped her from rinnys back now impeccably dressed in caterers livery balancing a loaded silver tray haralt looked tall lean and remarkably muscled fine blond curls swept from chiseled features his forehead uncreased his chin heroically squared and his nose flawless placing his burden on a nearby table he bowed prettily and gazed up at honoria id be honored to assist my lady without another word he headed up the stairs edged around the bridal pair and strode through the open door scattered and hesitant applause followed haralts action honoria clamped her hands together and watched him leave isnt he wonderful she continued to rub absently beneath her breasts oblivious to a smudge the hoof had left there lubonne could think of no appropriate reply sure wonderful he placed his hand on hers stopping it are you all right do you need to see a healer honoria let her hand fall into lubonnes im fine she barely hit me lubonne wanted to drop the whole matter but needed to say one more thing you know even if he finds her hell have to let her go she doesnt belong to him or to us honoria straightened her dress and plastered a smile back on her face for now lets just enjoy our party and enjoy they did lubonne did not awaken until nearly midday and he did not attempt to visit honoria until the following day he found her out though no one could say where and though she returned that night after his visit when he came for her the next morning she had gone away again preparing for the wedding lubonne tried to convince himself but doubts plagued him he could not forget the way his betrothed had sought assistance from the selfsame servant who had swept her so majestically off of rinnys back he could see any woman falling prey to haralts striking appearance a beautiful woman like honoria deserved a beautiful man yet lubonne knew she loved him no mere servant no random pretty face could steal her away from him and honoria deserved a better life than haralt could possibly give her alone with his thoughts lubonne walked the edge of the forest headed for his favorite river bank there he could lose himself in the bird calls the rustling of the wind through reeds and the occasional plop of fish and frogs in the water whenever he paused there to skip stones and revel in the sunlight happy boyhood memories invariably swept away his adult worries a faint call touched lubonnes mind help me lubonne stiffened turning only one creature could communicate with him in this way carthea he had not seen her since the party either where are you he received no direct reply just a repeat of the indistinct soft call help me chosen i need you lubonne focused on mental words this time deliberately shouting where are you a flood of relief accompanied the next communication apparently over finally reaching him he wondered for how long she had been calling him the clearing where we first met hurry lubonne hesitated he could run back home get rinny and a weapon and gallop back nearly as quickly as he could run straight to the clearing in the end he chose the shorter distance running as fast as his bowed legs would carry him im coming though it took no breath to answer lubonne found himself too focused on movement to concentrate on mindspeaking whats wrong whats happening carthea gave him only come see then it seemed as if a wall had closed between their minds carthea lubonne called carthea he got no answer he dodged between trunks vaulted deadfalls trying to save a few paces and hoping he did not corner himself and have to backtrack for his efforts brush tore at his tunic and prickles scored his legs carthea answer me a vine entangled his ankles and he tumbled into a bush damn he got nothing in return but the vague wonder of why it mattered he was not a future herald he was not cartheas heartmate he could not be yet she had done nothing worse than try to convince him she had the same good soul she sensed in him and he would not leave her in danger especially if he might indirectly have caused it he tore his way through the bush ignoring the scratches and jabs that tore clothing and flesh alike answer me carthea he staggered free now lubonne could hear faint voices punctuated by a boisterous whinny the type horses use to call to lost herd companions he quickened his pace bursting breathlessly into the clearing carthea was there her coat dark with sweat and striped with filth she held her head low a rope winched around her neck and bloody foam bubbled around a hard steel bit more ropes circled each fetlock the feathery hair shaved off by movement against them a crude wooden saddle lay strapped to her back and a tight rope bridle bit deeply into her cheeks gaze fixed on the companion and her plight lubonne barely noticed the five humans who shared the clearing iron stakes deeply pounded held the ropes enwrapping cartheas hind fetlocks men struggled with the two in front holding her splaylegged and essentially helpless a third forced her head down preventing her from rearing fire boiled through lubonnes veins at the image of this proud and intelligent creature trussed up like the main course at a banquet he opened his mouth to shout then saw the other two humans in the clearing a man and a woman oversaw the process holding one anothers hand lubonne recognized them at once haralt and honoria and no words emerged his mouth just kept silently opening wider and wider until he thought his jaw might touch the ground honoria ran to lubonne darling youve ruined the surprise lubonne doubted it was possible for him to be any more surprised let her go he managed the words strangely softspoken but still firm and controlled he had intended to scream them honoria took his arm snuggling against him were breaking her for you my darling hawk for us for once honorias touch failed to move him no i dont want this lubonne looked at the three men straining at the ropes let her go he wanted to attack to chase them all away from carthea how could anyone condone this cruelty honoria ran a hand along his cheek its not what it looks like my darling were not hurting her haralt finally spoke master lubonne shes worthless as she is but an exceedingly valuable horse once we break her sometimes lubonne snapped i dont want her broken i want her whole he shook off honoria shes perfect as she is and i order you to release her sometimes the process looks harsh but i assure you its necessary to this time honoria cut him off forget it haralt its not going to happen she turned to lubonne and her whole demeanor seemed to change where she had once seemed demure and dewyeyed she became as callous as any huntsman it could have worked out perfectly for all of us she shook her head frowning you would have had your bit of land and your gorgeous fawning wife despite your she made a gesture to indicate his face haralt turned positively green honoria what are you doing she persisted undaunted i would have had my handsome lover and our children she poked lubonne your children could they have been more stunning lubonne gritted his teeth as it all became clear honoria had never loved him she had wanted only his status and his money which she intended to use to make a home for them then while he was out she would entertain haralt pass off his offspring as legitimately lubonnes and live out her life in secretive happiness honoria threw up her hands as if lubonne were the one who had just exposed a cruel scheme and we all would have lived happily contented if you hadnt put an animal over your love for me torn between screaming and crying between attacking and running lubonne stood his ground he continued to speak gently his tone flat to hide his building rage i could say the same for you that you put your love for an animal lubonne turned his gaze directly on haralt over me but then i would be granting this conniving servant the same status as carthea and he does not deserve it haralt drew himself up clearly affronted he did not speak however nor dare to approach let her go lubonne roared fists clenching and unclenching he wished he had brought a weapon even the wooden one he used for practice would suffice honoria grinned wickedly then started to laugh by what authority do you command this hawknose youve admitted in front of an entire ballroom that you have no claim to this animal you dont own her we have as much right to her as you more so because she is now in our possession she was right lubonne knew and his heart sank he looked at carthea forcing himself to examine only her sweet longlashed eyes if he took in the entire picture again he could not have retained his composure with my help can you break free i dont think so carthea dropped her head further ive tried theyre strong and im exhausted its up to me lubonne studied honoria wondering what had seemed so special about her in the past where once she had seemed flawless he now discovered a million faults her external beauty seemed worthless her gray eyes as welcoming as a rusty steel trap what do you want her for anyway honoria glanced at haralt who seemed suddenly engrossed in his own boots as haralt said shes a valuable animal she headed back toward the servant once shes broken lubonne reminded watching honoria leave he had never before noticed how she waddled when she walked which will never happen hows that going so far carthea snorted pale eyes like brimstone well break her honoria promised no matter how long it takes or lubonne suggested suddenly thoughtful you could sell her honoria shrugged well have to now well need that money to fix up the land build a house lubonne had heard those plans before many times but always in the past we had included him now he felt certain honoria referred to haralt you knew all the time didnt you lubonne accused his companion knew what knew what kind of person i had affianced myself to knew she didnt really love me that she would hurt me badly carthea snorted again i knew why didnt you save yourself this trouble and pain why didnt you just tell me carthea rolled the one eye he could see her ears pricked forward you know why i do and suddenly lubonne realized he did i wouldnt have believed it i would have thought she was lying to get me to join her though he made no attempt to mindspeak the thought carthea apparently received it she bobbed her wise white head once before the man holding the rope jerked it still at the violence of the movement anger flared anew i was so busy chasing fake love i didnt see the real thing when it thrust its huge fuzzy head through my bedroom window lubonne turned his attention to haralt and honoria driving all trace of malice from his tone and his features how much what the word was clearly startled from haralts mouth honoria had more experience in matters of finance you want to buy her from us yes honorias smile broadened and lubonne wondered why he had never before noticed how dingy her teeth looked the meanness in her grin it would cost you your inheritance sold lubonne said before she could change her mind or think to ask for more he had no wish nor need to reduce the deal to writing honoria had four witnesses to corroborate her claim and he had no intention of dishonoring his word he claimed the ropes from each man in turn carthea remained utterly still while he unwound each rope removed the offending bridle and tossed the makeshift saddle to the ground im not going to fall off am i carthea turned him a withering look using a deadfall for a step lubonne clambered upon his companion a herald trainee astride his heartmate and bound for collegium tell my parents the money is yours and that ive gone to valdemar carthea bounded over a copse of berries in one smooth leap and settled onto the packed earth forest road home for your things and spoil this grand exit for a few possessions lubonne made a broad gesture in the general direction of valdmar i have my future and my heartmate what more do i need what more indeed carthea agreed a storytelling of crows by elisabeth waters elisabeth waters sold her first short story in to marion zimmer bradley for the keepers price the first of the darkover anthologies she continues to sell short stories to a variety of anthologies and magazines her first novel a fantasy called changing fate was awarded the gryphon award she is now working on a sequel to it in addition to short story writing and editing the annual sword sorceress anthology she has also worked as a supernumerary with the san francisco opera where she appeared in la gioconda manon lescaut madama butterfly khovanschina das rheingold werther and idomeneo the horse wasnt the first animal to come to maia calling for help but it was the first one with a human on its back not that maia noticed the human at first she sat in a clearing in the forest of sorrows avoiding her older brother she was listening to the chatter of the crows while working on the fletching of the arrows that she made and her brother sold to support them then the voices of the crows changed warning her of strangers in the forest this was followed by the sound of something large stumbling through the trees and then the sight of a white horse with an arrow protruding from a hind leg and a pile of arrowstudded red and white rags on his back help my chosen his voice was very clear in maias head he spoke as if he expected a human to hear and understand him maia been able to hearand converse withanimals as long as she could remember but this mental voice wasnt like that of any animal she had encountered before it sounded more like a human which made her wary shortly after the death of her parents three years ago the people of their village suddenly and inexplicably didnt like her any moreand her brother had never liked her now she avoided people whenever possible living at the edge of sorrows helped she could retreat into the forest and be left alone still whatever this was he was in distress so she dropped the arrows and moved to his side help your chosen what she asked him my herald her name is samina i am clyton lets get this arrow out of you clyton maia said and then perhaps you can get closer to the ground so i can get her down without dropping her she looked at the arrow in his leg and frowned this looks like one of mine she remarked grasping it firmly below the fletching and pulling it straight out the horse cried out in pain and maia stared in horror at the arrow she was holding it was one of hers but the last time she had seen it the shaft had simply been sharpened to a point since then somebody had added metal barbs to the tip and it had not slid out as she expected it to instead it had ripped a chunk out of clytons leg i am so sorry she gasped it didnt have barbs when i saw it last she snatched up a cloth she used to wrap supplies in and pressed it against his leg to stop the bleeding its not that bad clyton said although she suspected him of being less than truthful at least were far enough into sorrows that the bandits arent likely to track us here probably not maia agreed my brother wont even come in here still keeping pressure on the leg she twisted to look at the woman on his back who had at least four arrows in her bandits she asked there are usually no bandits anywhere near here there are now clyton said grimly suddenly she found herself looking through his eyes she recognized the road leading to her familys farm not that it was much of a farm since her parents had died and her brother had sold all the animals and stopped working the land as clyton and his herald approached the farm men fired arrowsall of them barbedfrom the trees on both sides of the road and then moved into the road to surround horse and rider she saw her brothers face clearly for a moment as he reached to grab the left side of clytons reins but then everything blurred as clyton put on a seemingly impossible burst of speed and broke out of the trap maia blinked and found herself back in the present and seeing through her own eyes again was that real she asked what i just saw i mean yes thats what happened to us you obviously have mindspeech if you can pick it up from me like that maia lifted the cloth carefully and looked at his leg the bleeding had almost stopped i think youll be all right for the moment if you dont try to move much she said ill just have to lift samina down as carefully as i can and hope for the best i can see four arrows in her backdo you know if there are any more i dont think so but check before you try to move her and be careful removing the arrows dont worry maia assured him i learned my lesson with the one in your leg better my leg than her body clyton sighed maia felt around saminas body to check for additional arrows but she didnt find any more she wriggled her arm and shoulder between saminas body and the saddle took most of the womans weight and went to the ground in something between a slide and a fall at least samina landed on top of her and none of the arrows hit the ground maia positioned the herald carefully so that the arrows were still pointing away from the ground ill need to cut them out very carefully she murmured looking around for the knife she used to trim arrow shafts there should be a medical kit attached to my saddle that would help maia agreed moving to examine the saddle an impressive variety of items was attached to snaffles on the skirting it might be more to the point to ask whats not attached to your saddle she remarked as she searched for and finally found the medical kit in addition to a clean knife there was a needle and thread to sew the wounds and cloths to bandage it after she was done there was also a jar of something clyton said should be put on the wounds to help clean them and a powder that could be made into a tea to lower the fever that samina was undoubtedly going to have at the moment she was still unconscious which made cutting out the arrows and cleaning and sewing her wounds easier but maia could feel clyton worrying about saminas lack of responsiveness she could see that the woman had lost a lot of blood but there was nothing she could do about that so she unsaddled clyton and put the saddle on a fallen log the crows came swooping toward her calling that her brother was home and looking for her the vision of her brother working with the bandits flashed back instantly filling her sight my brother is a bandit no wonder the villagers hate us she shuddered i cant go back she said to herself hell know that i know what are you talking about who will know that you know what you cant understand the crows she asked they said that my brother wants me maybe he could help us clyton asked hopefully he was the one who tried to grab your reins maia informed him so i really doubt it your brother is a bandit he attacked you maia pointed out even if he wasnt working with the bandits he doesnt like animals and hes not all that fond of me he doesnt like work either she frowned considering her brothers past behavior hes always taken the easy wayi just didnt realize how bad it had gotten its not just bad clyton pointed out its getting coldand dark youre not dressed to stay out all night and the bandits got our pack mules and all of our supplies except what i was carrying we need to get to the waystation youre very smart for a horse i am not a horse i am a companion but you dont have hands with your leg injured you cant move around much and samina cant be moved at all can you tell me how to find the waystation unless you can see in the dark it doesnt matter what i can tell you he sounded exasperated im trying to help here she snapped back and i dont have to see in the dark as long as i have friends who can the crows retreated to the tree branches as an owl floated silently out of the darkening sky to perch on the log next to clytons saddle its worth a try i suppose clyton sighed if i show you the path to the waystation can you show it to the owl we can try she said mentally linking with both of them it was a struggle because the companion and the owl saw things differently but finally she was satisfied that she and the owl knew the way she pulled out her fire starter gathered twigs and started a fire near samina she walked quickly around the edges of the clearing to get dead branches to keep it going can you add the branches to the fire as it starts to burn low she asked we need to keep samina warm until i can get back with blanketsthere are some at the waystation right clyton nodded looking subdued he didnt need to say anything maia knew he was in pain and worried about his chosen ill be back as quickly as i can she promised in the meantime she continued since you dont have hands ill leave you with someone who does she sent out a mental call and a few moments later a raccoon poked his head cautiously into the clearing dexter she said this is clyton and the lady is samina she handed dexter a clean cloth could you wet this in the stream and use it to cool her forehead please also if the bandages start to come loose fix them all right dexter assured her he would take care of her new friends maia looked at clyton to see if he could hear dexter but apparently he couldnt she prayed to whatever gods might be listening all the way to the waystation and back when she returned staggering under a load that was as much as she could possibly carry the moon was high and the clearing was bright with its silvery light samina was awake and fretting despite clytons attempts to calm her i need my arrows she insisted i should think youd had enough arrows for one day maia remarked samina tried to twist to face her with a notable lack of success i need my arrows she repeated desperately theyre in a case attached to my saddle where else maia asked ironically im already getting deliriousi have to send the message while i still can samina insisted i woke up and saw a raccoon nursing me relax maia said soothingly if all you saw is dexter youre not hallucinating yet dexter the raccoon i had to leave for a while and he has handsin fact hes quite dexterous she ignored saminas look of disbelief ill find your arrows for you she went to where she had left the saddle clyton limped over to join her and shoved at a cylindrical case with his nose she unfastened it from the saddle and took it to samina thank you samina opened the case and removed three arrows one had a green band and the other two had yellow bands with shaking hands samina bent several of the barbs on the fletching of each arrow and tied the arrows together so that they didnt interfere with the patterns in the fletching clyton she said these need to go to the healing templeyou know the one clyton cant take them maia said he was shot too didnt you notice that hes walking on only three legs samina buried her face in her hands and moaned does he have to be the one to take them maia asked or will they be enough of a message if they just get there theyll be enough by themselves but how else can we get them there can you take them maia shook her head i know a faster way clyton she asked exactly where is this temple you can hear my companion samina asked in astonishment yes maia said he says ive got mindspeech a view of a road and the temple at the end filled her vision she passed it on to the nearest group of crows do you know this place she asked them can you find it about a dozen crows spiraled down out of the trees to perch in front of her assuring her that they knew exactly where to go take the arrows then she told them and make certain that nobody on the ground sees them i recognized my brother but i dont know who his friends are or where they live fly safely one of the crows grabbed the arrows and they took off clustered together even knowing that the arrows were there maia couldnt see them maia didnt know how many days passed before the crows returned with a healer clytons leg was obviously hurting and samina despite maiasand dextersbest efforts became feverish and delirious maia collected several bruises trying to care for her she wondered when she had a moment to think if she would have done a better job if she actually knew anything about healing just keep her alive till the healer gets here she told herself thats what matters finally she heard the chatter of crows escorting the healer a woman in green robes arrived in the clearing riding double with another person dressed in white and riding a white horse presumably another herald and companion the crows were all talking at once telling her all about their adventure but maia was too tired to care as soon as she finished telling the healer what little she knew and what little she had done and explaining to the new herald what she knew about the attack she fell asleep and didnt wake for days by then the military units had rounded up her brother and his fellow bandits and taken them away for trial the healer explained that maia would not be needed for the trial as she had not been present during the attack i guess id sound pretty silly telling a judge that i saw the attack hours later through the eyes of a horse maia told samina later samina was recovering but the healer didnt want her to move yet so she encouraged maia to sit and talk to her clyton was doing better also but he still wasnt up to galloping at top speed while carrying a rider so they were still camping in the safety of sorrows it was a much more comfortable camp now someone had brought three mules and a load of actual camping supplies so they were no longer making do with what maia had been able to scrounge from the waystation samina looked sharply at her you can see through clytons eyes only when he wants to show me something maia clarified but when he does i can see what he saw and you can communicate with the raccoon his name is dexter maia said and the crows anything else maia shrugged i can understand pretty much anything that wants to talk to me why samina smiled its one of the gifts we heralds call it mindspeech it appears that you have a strong aptitude for it she paused and then asked could you hear your brother maia shook her head just animals and clyton i didnt even know that my brother wasnt supporting us by selling the arrows i made the way he told me he was using them to rob people she frowned in thought does that mean that my arrows arent good enough to sell i though they were very effective samina said dryly they certainly made an impression on me her face was straight but maia could tell that she was joking several impressions maia agreed keeping her face straight and as innocent as possible but i didnt put the barbs on them she added quickly did clyton tell you that he did samina reassured her he also said that you saved my life it was the least i could do after having made the arrows that nearly killed you maia shrugged off the praise and returned to her original subject i notice that you carry arrows if my arrows are good enough can the heralds use a fletcher im sure we can find a place for you samina smiled are you saying that you want to go back to haven with us can dexter and any of the crows who want to come with me i dont see why not samina said ive brought back stranger things from my travels are you really certain that you want to leave your home maia nodded i wasnt raised alone in the forest that happened after my parents died and my brother antagonized all our neighbors i didnt know why everyone suddenly hated himand mebut now that i do i think it will be better for everyone if i leave here then you can come with us as soon as clyton and i can travel samina said the healer had done some work on clyton and he was walking normally now it looked as though the flesh maia had accidentally gouged out of his leg was going to heal completely without so much as a scar the crows were still telling stories of their trip to the temple they had been ever since their return they appeared to regard it as a great adventure samina smiled as she watched maia listen to them what are they saying she asked theyre telling stories maia said its hard to sort out and put into words did you know that there are two name for a flock of crows samina asked no maia admitted most of the villagers called them a nuisance but i never thought of them that way theyre often called a murder of crows but yours saved my life so thats not right for them samina grinned these are obviously the other kind a storytelling of crows i do talk with them a lot maia admitted and they certainly talk back you know samina said i think youre wasted as a fletchernot that you arent good at it she added hastily but there are more good fletchers than there are people with animal mindspeech so you think i should do something else maia asked uncertainly what samina smiled and took maias hand theres a temple in haven that would kill to have youif all its priests werent such gentle and peaceful souls theres a temple that would want me maia said in astonishment what kind of temple is that the temple of thenoth the lord of the beasts it does sound like your kind of place dexters mental voice was encouraging maia started laughing yes she agreed that does sound like a place i could fit in waiting to belong by kristin schwengel kristin schwengels work has appeared in two of the previous valdemar short story anthologies among others she and her husband live near milwaukee wisconsin and recently adopted a gray andblack tabby kitten named what else gandalf kristin divides her time between an administrative job a growing career as a massage therapist and writing and other pastimes when the companion had come to breyburn folk had gathered in the square though no one had raised any summoning cry nearly the whole of the town was there to see who would be chosen when the dazzling white horse trotted into the square gleaming harnessbells jingling and dancing in the late afternoon light not that anyone truly doubted for whom the companion had come on search no one was surprised to see teo standing to the front of the crowd framed by his family staring at the companion with a dumbstruck delirious smile his joy shone from every fiber of his being so strong shia could have sworn that she felt it too rippling through her in waves shia had turned her gaze away at the last moment before the companion brushed its no her soft nose against teos incandescent blue eyes meeting guileless brown even as their minds spoke to shia it had seemed too intimate a moment to be observednever mind that the rest of the town was staring avidly she could not watch it afterward there had been an evening of wellwishing of jokes and congratulations and the occasional hearty we always knew youd make a herald someday surprised they waited till you reached fifteen winters to send a companion out for you lad and then they had gone teo and his companion off to haven and his new life with the heralds shia had held a baffling empty ache deep in her heart taking small breaths to control it as she and the rest of the town watched them canter off the next morning teos face was flushed with the excitement his unruly hair bouncing in time with his companions long strides she had watched only until he was far enough down the old quarry road that she wouldnt be thought rude then had fled to the stillness and sanctuary of her herb room it was there that calli stadres found her her head bent over the table while she stared unseeing at the plants and herb mixtures before her one foot and ankle twined anxiously around the leg of her tall stool he looked back shias head jerked upright and she stared at her visitor through the wispy blonde strands of hair that fell over her forehead not many years older than shia calli was wife to one of the towns wealthiest merchants and already had a young daughter toddling beside her clinging to her mothers skirts his parents waved as though he had turned to look for them but he didnt wave back i dont think he even saw them shia reached out to a pile of dried seedpods from the edge of the table trying to still the unexplainable trembling in her hand calli watched the younger girl work savoring the quiet coolness of the room and the crisp herbal scents around them why could you not say something to him he is still teo after all shia glanced over at calli then returned her attention to the dried seeds as she carefully separated them from their husks for storage the silence between them drifted a little longer then she shrugged a heralds place is in haven a herald belongs to valdemar to the crown to the people she hunched one shoulder as if hiding behind it after my mothers death the town allowed me to take her place as herbalist i belong in breyburn calli frowned there is no law that says otherwise yet i think you are wrong thirteen was too young for you to be tied to such responsibilities no matter how much you wanted to earn your keep surely there has to be more for you it does no good to dwell on it shia responded at last it is as it is here rub these together until they crack open for me she held out a handful of the dried pods to calli who looked at them for a moment then giggled like a much younger girl youre just trying to make me useful arent you shia only smiled her hand still outstretched of course teo came back to breyburn but only briefly not even every midwinter over the several years of his training when he did his time was taken up with his family with the townsfolk at large with the town council and with the other herald or heralds he was usually in company with and of course his companion he was never there just as teo not anymore he was teo the herald trainee teo the journeyman herald soon to be teo the herald he even looked like someone else in the gray clothing especially when he suddenly grew several inches from one summer to the next midwinter unsure of how to approach this new person who looked so different and yet should be so familiar shia chose to retreat keeping to herself in the solitude that had been hers since her mothers death barely two years before teos choosing if she was there at all when teo came back to the town she stayed to the rear of the crowd of townsfolk ducking her head so her hair fell over eyes she never noticed the concerned blue gaze of teos companion following her nor did she see teos eyes wandering restlessly over the faces when all were gathered together shia sheeeeeaaah up on the mountainside far from the town walls where the winds sighed and roared by turns in the deep firs there was no way that shia should have heard a childs thin cry but hear it she did in her head as much as her ears and with that impossible sound came another impossible thinga bonedeep knowledge that something was very wrong in breyburn she grabbed the last of her herb packs how was it they were full already what had she been gathering while her mind had been wandering who knows where and sprinted to where she had tethered her shaggy mare stowing the pack and freeing the horse almost in the same motion without thinking she reached up and broke off a small branch of one of the overhanging firs tucking it and its three cones between the straps of the secured packs she pulled herself up into the saddle and kneed the dun into the fastest trot she could safely take on the uneven mountain paths letting the mare choose her steps as the early spring mountain fog started to coalesce around them the knot in the pit of her stomach took on more solidity as she approached the town although the urgency faded she reined in the mare while she was still hidden beyond the treeline looking down on the cleared lands of the townsfolk and her guts churned smoke coiled upward from somewhere near the center of town dark and thick and the smell of it as it drifted towards her was wrong wet and musty she could see broken staves of wood near the main gate and a few of the town guard nervously standing at attention beside the gate whatever it was had come and gone again leaving the town in uneasy quiet as the day slipped towards evening she kicked the mare to a canter angling from the forest to ride onto the old quarry road far enough down that the edgy guardsmen would recognize her well in advance as she approachedor would at least know mirris stocky body and rough coloring the relief on guardsman fellans face as she rode up would have been amusing were it not for the worry and fear that haunted the corners of his eyes bandits he said before she even pulled up the mare surprised we were and they seemed to know where to strike hardest they knew who to hit moren what the usual raiders weve seen would know capn was first then sergeant the merchants too they attacked and robbed and then they were gone quick as they came dead or injured four five dead maybe dozen or more injured mlady stadres has got em all down to the chapelthey fired the inn shia swallowed her heart quailing at the thought of that many injuries her mother had only known the basics of herbcraft and had often scolded her daughter for being an indifferent student apprehension of the severity of wounds she might face filled her and despair clawed at her tightening her stomach and freezing her blood in her veins when the guardsman looked up at her question in his eyes she gave herself a mental shake healer she might not be but she was the closest thing to one that the town had she would have to do she nodded at the guards and angled mirri down to the square to the house across from the towns one inn as she neared it she could see that the smoke was still drifting from the inn in slow coils now held lower to the ground by the weight of the late afternoon fog that had started to roll down from the mountaintop the building wouldnt be lost though she thought the rainy season was only just over and the timbers hadnt yet dried out so they had been slow to catch and even then had smoldered rather than burned outright it looked as though the townsmen had been quick enough to set up a water chain from the cisterns and as she rode past she could hear voices from the side of the building assessing the damage she slowed mirri as they approached the stadres household it was the only house in town large and elaborate enough to boast a chapel dedicated to kernos and the stadres family were certainly the only ones wealthy enough to build one calli stadres stood at the front door her young daughter clutching her hand i told you she would hear me pira cried in triumph before her mother hushed her callis eyes met shias in question and shia gave the tiniest of nods before dismounting the impossibility of shia hearing piras voice was something that they would think about laterbut shia suspected that it would not be more than a few winters before breyburn would have another white visitor how many how bad shia started unloading her herb packs glad that calli had always been sensible she was sure that most merchants wives callis age would have been in hysterics instead of calmly gathering the wounded into their own homes for care captain nolan and two others were dead before the bandits left but i think sergeant dara will be well soon enough several of the guardsmen can only have their pain eased i think but most of the others have lesser wounds twelve injured guardsmen including the worst shia sucked in her breath with three deaths that was more than half of the town guard unable to act no wonder those who remained were bewildered and uncertain she handed two packs to calli and swung the others over her shoulder absently tucking the fir branch she had brought into the lamp bracket beside the door before she realized that she had harvested a silver pine the tree of kernos protection she whispered a brief petition for the gods hands to hold all those whose wounds she was about to tend then followed calli inside the house and the others the men at the gates said some of the merchants were attacked she reached out her hand to touch callis arm as they hurried down the hall to the chapel your husband is he callis breath hitched but she kept walking injured but not the worst master widthan may not last the night though nor josette and master riordan is gone lord corus will need to be informed although i dont know that hell be able to send any men from torholdthe muster to karse has spread his forces thin shia said faintly he will need to send word to haven to the heralds his majesty must also know of these new attacks especially if they are organized it might be they had help from karse either way if they met with what they deem success they will be back and heraldtrainee teo must be told of his fathers death she hoped her voice didnt sound too strangled well if it did let calli think that it was fear of more bandit raids that stole her breath even three years later the strange empty ache that had blossomed as she watched him ride down the old quarry road still swelled within her whenever she thought of him take me to sergeant dara first then ill see the worst of the rest for shia the next candlemarks passed in a blur of treating the wounded moving from one injured person to the next thankfully calli was for the most part accurate in her assessment of the severity of injuries sergeant dara had been knocked unconscious but her other wounds were minor she regained her senses while shia was applying healing poultices to the cut that laced across her leg and it was clear that she was in full possession of those senses she began directing the remaining guard propped up in her cot the captains sword bared across her knees she even dictated a message that two of the merchants sons would take down the mountain roads to torhold on the fastest of the towns horses calli stadres proved a surprisingly capable pair of hands assisting shia readily learning how to mix the basic poultices and clean and dress the lesser injuries and if between one patient and the next she always walked down the hall to stand for a few moments at the door to the room where her husband slept bandages swathed around his head and shoulder shia could hardly blame her when they had finished tending the last injured merchant shia was pleased with her work she even thought that her herbs might be able to bring around a few of those that calli had thought would not last josette the innkeeper she was sure would make it although she herself wouldnt be able to take credit for that the old woman was just too stubborn to as she put it let em put paid to me ifn i wouldnt let em put paid to my inn she had grumbled and complained about the damage to the inn while shia had fussed over her but she had finally accepted the sleep tea and let her body get to the more important business of healing shia was glad though that she had been gathering in the area of the mountain where she had been at that height several of the best wild plants for bleeding injuries developed a higher potency and today she had harvested an inordinate amount of those plants more than she ever needed for the normal injuries of the remote mountain town this was not the first time however that she had harvested without thinking about it every so often she would gather herbs in a daze seeming neither to hear what was around her nor even to see what she was doing she had learned to trust it those rare occasions for what she gathered in those moments was always usedlike the time when she and her mother had gone to harvest feverdraw and she had found her basket full of the elm bark they used in tinctures and teas for throat ailments and that winter a coughing illness had stricken the town pira stop twirling about like that youll make me too dizzy to think calli stadres laughed as her daughter danced in the shaft of sunlight that lanced across the sunroom her outstretched hands scattering tiny bits of seedfluff that floated and glinted in the air around her her mother turned back to the worktable reaching one hand around to rub her lower back some days i dont know how ill ever keep up with two her voice cut off when she saw shias face and she lunged forward to take the mortar and pestle from the young womans hands before she dropped them shia what is it whats wrong are you well shia leaned forward until her head rested on the cool stone slab laid across the top of the table trying to calm the roiling in her stomach i am well she managed captain dara her voice trailed off as another wave of something that felt like pain and anger hit her then as soon as it had come the feeling fled replaced by the same surety of wrongness that she had felt up on the mountain when the town was first attacked she pushed her hair out of her face and met callis worried eyes i think the troop has been ambushed how do you callis eyes widened when shia only shrugged and she glanced over at pira the young girl had stopped twirling but just stood in the sunbeam looking at her mother in confusion calli took in a slow breath of relief that her daughter had not been affected then nodded slightly ill check the bandage kits while you rub the powders for the poultices weve set so many supplies aside from caring for the traders that we shouldnt need to prepare too much new by the time captain dara brought the wounded of her small troop back to the room in the stadres household that had served as a makeshift infirmary since the first attack calli and shia had prepared enough that they were immediately able to care for the worst of the injuries this time at least none were lifethreatening shia unwrapped the hasty field bandages and held lieutenant fellans arm tightly trying to keep from jarring his newly realigned shoulder as she attempted to match up the shattered bones of his forearm you seem to have had the worst of it of all the group she murmured he had already bitten his lip to bleeding on the ride back to the town and her liquorlaced herbal concoction for pain had barely started to take the edge off dont know how they do it he muttered hazily they dance around the town when theres traders then slink off into nowhere tradersre coming round less too ifn we cant stop em itll be a thin winter capn daras good but shes only one he grunted as shia made a last shift of his wrist then settled to a drugged sleep as the herbs deepened their effects letting his arm rest on the splint on the low table beside them shia closed her hands lightly over the break trying to sense if anything still was out of place beneath the skin her fingers tingled slightly feeling the heat of injury spreading up from his flesh and she held her hand there for a longer moment as though she could force the angry heat to subside and the bone to knit together binding the lieutenants arm securely to the slats of her splint shia glanced over to where she could see the captain standing and talking to calli and one of the other injured guardsman lord corus had sent his approval for daras field promotion to captain as soon as he had learned of the first attack but as they had suspected torhold had not been able to spare any militia to pursue the bandits even torholds healer had only given a halfdays visit to check on breyburns injured he had come a day or two after the first attack glanced at the dead who were about to be buried briefly examined those who were not yet back to their activities then returned to torhold saying only the girls mother must have had good skills to teach her that well for all that no one knew where shed come from accepting that they were on their own the townsfolk had resolutely taken matters into their own hands dara had taken any and all volunteers from the townsfolk or the shepherd and small farm families outside the town training up some to join the town guard others to simply learn how to stay alive if the bandits came back into the town and come back they had though none of their raids had the impact of the first rather they picked away at the town and the trader caravans making trade sporadic and shattering the cycles of the towns summer the season was half over but it felt as though it had barely begun for few of the townsfolk had been able to work as they usually did captain dara held out her arm to shia wincing just the slightest bit as she dabbed the sharp cleansing ointment over the edges of the wound its been months now and we cant find the bastard she said thats what bothers me he runs aground as soon as we get close weve picked off his band and found most of his hidey holes enough that i dont think hell be back soon but he keeps slinking off bad enough that theyve been coming back all summer but if he has time now to go back to wherever he came from and find more men hell be back as soon as the rains are done next spring shia sighed as she put down the cleansing pad and reached for her bowl lieutenant fellan is right youre only one you need to take more care for yourself until lord corus can approve your new militia no one else has the training experience or personality to lead the guard torhold cant spare anyone now any more than they could when captain nolan was killed in the first raid my young menand the two girlsare doing well enough especially since fellans arm healed up so quick and he was able to help with the training again they did well enough to take on an ex merc bandit who thought to control the trade routes down from the quarry and the tin mines weve stopped him for this year at least despite her frustration the new captains satisfaction with her troop was palpable holding the edges of the wound together shia applied her poultice and started wrapping bandages her fingers tracing along the length of the wound beneath the fabric feeling the heat from the angry gash an absent part of her attention drifted down to the injured flesh almost willing the healing to happen she didnt notice the startled way the captains eyes flicked up to her so absorbed was she in considering the importance of captain daras success or failure if they had indeed done enough damage to the surprisingly wellorganized bandits to keep them from attacking for the last moon of the summer the harvest and preparations for winter and the spring rains could go back to normal or normal enough to make do at least the sheep and the goats have already been brought back down to the town green she said at last and the traders wont fear to bring the grain supplies up here now so well be able to winter the animals well enough the captain nodded her eyes considering the young woman seated beside her we should think about increasing the grain stores this year just in case how are your harvests coming josette says her bones are telling her that itll be a long winter and a hard rainy season shia smiled fondly no one would ever dare suggest that josettes bones are telling her that shes too old to spar with the youngsters calli and pira have helped me gather though and calli is allowing me to experiment with growing some plants in the sunny room next to the chapel its close enough to the kitchen fires that i think it will stay warm enough to keep some of the hardier stock alive all winter she didnt add that she thought that josettes bones were right and that she had already prepared for a long and hard season away from the mountains wild herbs drawn by some unnameable call shia opened the side door off the stadres kitchens and glanced out over the garden as she expected the rain was pouring down creating lakes and rivers where in summer there were plant beds and paths no sane creature stirred out of doors during the unpredictable flash rains yet here she was somehow knowing that she needed to be somewhere other than tucked securely in callis tiny spare room where she had spent the winter tending her experimental plants tugging her cloak up around her ears she darted out through the sheeting rain and splashed around to the front of the house finding a spot just under the eaves that was a little less wet not knowing why she was standing there she stared down the main road for long cold minutes until she saw movement that was not falling rain coming towards her from the edge of her vision mudspattered worn out he was everything a companion on search shouldnt benothing like the gaily caparisoned mare who had come for teo he was so drenched it was impossible to tell where the lathered sweat ended and the cold rain staining his coat began he didnt even look white anymore just a muddy dark gray yet he was unmistakably what he waseven to the bells on the soaked harness though their ring could not be heard above the rain pounding on the roofs this time shia was the only one who stood in the square rain running in rivulets down her face light glowed out of the windows around the square and she suddenly hoped that no one was even looking out to see this bedraggled colt slogging through the fetlockdeep mud and then he was standing before her his sodden nose brushing her cheek his glorious impossibly blue eyes swallowing hers im sorry you had to wait so long for me chosen tears mingled with the rain on her face streaming warm with cold and shia collapsed heedless to her knees in the muck weeping out the agonizing emptiness of the last four years the companioneodan she knew without wordsfolded his forelegs and lay in the mud beside her curving his neck around to draw her slight form against his steaming side his warmth seeping into her bone chill i came as soon as the kings own companion said i was readyalthough he warned me about the spring rains in breyburn there was a note of selfdeprecating amusement in his rich mindvoice you will learn that patience is not natural to me what about pira shes gifted im sure so shouldnt you be for her shia finally managed to get words past the rawness in her throat her companion is more patient than ipira is still a little too young to begin the training you my chosen should never have had to start this late there was a strange note of regret coloring his mindvoice as it echoed in shias head it would have been different if he cut off his thought then abruptly changed the subject nudging gently against her shoulder come chosen its a good thing youll soon be wearing trainee grays for those leggings are unsalvageable shia gave no response to his jest lost in the wonder of eodans presence and yet baffled by the forlorn ache still within her deeper than the presence of eodan beside hereven part of hercould reach without words she knew that eodan knew and regretted that it was there inside her that dull pain that lost feeling of incompletion trust me chosen you will understand soon when we are in haven i think shia turned to stare at him in disbelief astonished at her own courage in thinking to argue with a companion in haven what about breyburn i cant just up and leave themand its folly to go anywhere during the flashrain season eodan shook his head at her and only now did she finally hear the jingle of his harness bells beneath the drum of the falling rain chosen you have been patient enough for two but now that i am finally with you this will be my time to practice it myself the last part of the way by brenda cooper brenda cooper has published over thirty short stories in various magazines and anthologies her books include

all that stuff stop by wwwbrendacoopercom and visit three riders passed beneath trees shrugging fall color into the wind each time a gust spurted through cold and edged in winter it plucked gold and orange and brown leaves and sent them to tangle in the riders hair and crunch under the hooves of their mounts the redheads rhiannon and dionne would have been impossible to tell apart except that rhiannon wore flamboyant bardic red and dionne a soft and subdued healer green the women shared the same red hair bright blue eyes slender figures and the same deep laugh lines they rode similar horses big sturdy bays with wide white blazes and patient alert walks one of the horses had white socks and the other didnt between them a much younger man named lioran sat easily on the back of a white companion mila everything about mila was neat and trimmed and nearly perfect while her herald wore his long black hair unkempt had stains on the knees of his white uniform and a sad silence on his face dionne and rhiannon had been riding circuit twentyfive years now and were too old to keep peace on the borders or fight teenaged toughs but even usually peaceful towns needed healing and song so they were sent around the easy middle of valdemar far from border skirmishes and the beasts of the pelagir hills and the intrigues of haven the twins were often assigned a young bard or healer who needed a safe year or two to gain confidence but theyd never before been asked to take a herald along a mudslide had buried his family and in fact his whole town everyone he knew the news had come to him right after he was given his whites right after hed packed his belongings onto his companion for a trip home to the small town of golden hill after two weeks dionne despaired of helping him she watched liorans face as rhiannons musical voice chided him there will be things you can do even in shelters end his voice came out gloomy there wont be anyone under forty there youll be there dionne responded allowing only a bit of the disdain she felt into her voice no one said you had to like a patient or even a herald we go where were needed and dont whine if we dont like it i wish we could just go past i dont want to stop in a retirement town or a town at all i want the woods rhiannon looked as though she wanted to skin him but all she said was the winds chill wed better find a place to make camp we dont really want to ride in on them at night anyway how about right here he asked how about you and mila find someplace a little more sheltered rhiannon countered the impatience in her voice enough to make dionne wince although lioran didnt bother to react mila cast both women a baleful look turning her head slightly side to side watching each of them with her bright blue eyes although dionne had no mindspeech she imagined milas thoughts going something like hes young hes hurt hell come around dionne grinned back at her wishing for a way to tell the companion how much she appreciated her patience and how much she wished she had more of it handy the boy got on her nerves silence sat heavy on the group for half a mark dionne was about to give up and pick a place herself when lioran pointed to a rather nice spot on a hill above the trail in a copse of trees sturdy enough to shelter people and animals from most of the wind dionne rubbed her cold hands together as she waited for her sisters nod it was almost full dark by the time they fed and brushed and watered the animals and gathered enough fuel to start a small fire lioran did his share silent and sullen but without actual complaint after they finished the twins settled near the fire stretching their fingers wide and close to the warm yelloworange flames lioran didnt sit beside them he climbed up on milas bare back and looking out into the woods he said me and mila are heading off well be back in an hour or two he didnt wait for acknowledgement but simply faded into the trees and the darkness his dirty whites and milas clean white outline the last thing they saw disappearing into darkness if tonight was like every other night when he came back hed look soft and sad rhiannon sighed its too bad hes not a kid then i could just tell him to snap out of it i know hes hurt but all this pouting and whining is unbecoming in a herald in anybody i sure hate him going off like that hes a full herald hes supposed to be watching over old women rhiannon arched an eyebrow well thats what most would think dionne flexed her fingers and added another handful of small sticks to the fire hard not to see him as a kid even if we were younger when we got our uniforms this is our last chance to get him out of his depressionwere due back in haven in two weeks so how do you think shelters end is going to help dionne shook her head its not shelters end itself i mean its a good town and they always need help from a strong back i hope that will get past his head and engage his heart she sighed heavily shifting her weight to ease her aching back i havent been able to do it so what makes you think anybody else can hes skittish and hard dionne added a log to the fire and watched the sparks do a sky dance in the wind well one of my old teachers is there melony she helped us all out of funks and thats what he seems to need i mean it seems like he stopped being an adult in full whites the minute he learned his parents died and became a spoiled kid i havent been able to reach him whatevers broken in him isnt physical or even really in his emotions its like his very self is cracked i bet melony has some ideas im going to ask her for advice dont you remember how she helped jon after he broke his hand and yvette after that merc in town roughed her up maybe i was pretty dazzled by the collegium melony taught me salves and teas in my first two years there everybody loved her so much she got awarded teacher of the year three times in a row shes still alive she was last time we came through five years ago i think i remember her gray hair dionne playslapped at rhiannon that describes the whole town sorry i dont remember everything yeah well maybe age is getting in the way of your memory already rhiannon laughed were not gray yet i pulled out two gray hairs yesterday she looked toward the trees lioran had disappeared through we should think about what were doing next rhiannon sighed im not ready to stop performing yet but i hope your friends alive to help old age and experience beats smarts dionne let out a short bitter laugh then we should have succeeded by now were not old tell that to my fingers truth tell it was rhiannon she worried about even though she showed no interest in even slowing down as a healer dionne would be fine even with the beginnings of arthritis which was truthfully a bit noticeable on a cold morning of late but old hands did real damage to a bard a healer could speed the bodys natural response to damage but there wasnt much dionne or anybody else could do about old age and rhiannon was stubborn as an old mule she liked to take charge of everything queen of the road it made dionne smile sure enough rhiannon had a pronouncement about the topic were not ready for shelters end yet and that would be the end of that rhiannon reached into her pocket and pulled out a handcarved wooden flute she started playing and dionne settled in to listen content for the moment to just be with her sister and pleased that the unhappy herald had taken himself off somewhere else theyd both be older tomorrow and they could worry about being older then lioran true to form returned after about an hour he looked as bad as dionne expected him to his face thin and drawn his skin so pale he might be the child of a ghost it was all she could do not to wince as mila picked her way carefully through camp and stopped at a good place to drop her tack lioran took good if quick care of his companion then he lay down on his rumpled bedroll plumped his coat up to be a pillow pulled his thick woolen blanket close up around his ears and turned away from them all mila took the first watch rhiannon gave dionne a resigned look with a small smile attached when dionne nodded rhiannon picked up her flute and blew the first soft notes of a lullaby dionne followed and so the two women sang together rhiannons trained voice the stronger washing over dionne until she too felt sleepy and content they sang five songs and then the same five songs again looking over at the back of the shivering silent herald from time to time his breathing finally regulated into sleep rhiannon carefully packed her flute and the women began to get ready to sleep themselves dionne nestled closest to the fire listening to the faint sounds of the warm coals and the stomp of the horses feet wind brushed branches together above her head she imagined finding melony the next day making little lists in her head of all the things she had to tell her old mentor she must have eventually gone to sleep since rhiannons soft hiss woke her dionne opened her eyes careful not to make a sound or change her breathing until she knew more if it was rhiannons watch it must be the middle of the night a light fog threaded through the trees above her and dampened her cold cheeks and nose the thud of at least five horses maybe seven went by on the road below the flash of a torch blinded her to the details of the riders gruff voices called out hurry and quiet now although clearly no one in the party really believed they needed to be quiet they had thick accents and gruff voices undoubtedly from somewhere else and if allowed to pass not likely to come back this way there were too many to confront maybe fifteen years ago but now dionnes blood pounded through her as she held still ready to leap up and grab her staff if the horses called attention to them or worse if lioran woke up and decided to play hero the sounds faded slowly still dionne and rhiannon held their tongues listening until all they could hear was the night wind and an owl hooting mournfully in a tree above them bandits rhiannon whispered not good riding away from where were going and they sounded proud of themselves mila must agree with them she was already nosing lioran up her blue eyes wide with worry rhiannon covered the coals with dirt while dionne and lioran saddled up they were on the road in short order milas tossing head made dionne ask lioran what does she know something bads happened his eyes looked big in his pale face his expression hard to make out in the meager light thrown by the stars overhead theres death and fear she can feel it but she cant tell what it is what happened in shelters end his voice sounded high and a bit squeaky im the only herald around in spite of their hurry they started the horses at a fast walk before moving into a slow canter it was too dark to allow them a full run mila pranced keeping a close eye on the road ahead and behind herding them toward town dionne glanced over at rhiannon to see her eyes narrowed with worry a combination of fear and fierceness playing across her features by the time they could see the town dawn had started kissing the horizon gray light illuminated the two long streets full of small houses beside a placid thin river nothing appeared to have been burned no dead bodies littered the streets hooves clattered as they trotted from the dirt trail onto the stone road when they stopped they heard the horses hardblowing breath and above that the sound of voices and tears and a low mournful wailing from one of the closein houses two men stepped out from behind a tree both gray haired one stooped and slow while the other still moved well the slower one had on a torn red shirt an old bard then the stronger man wore no telltale colors although that meant little he smiled grimly as he neared them looking to lioren glad to see you im jared he nodded toward the house theyd clearly been guarding in there ask them to send someone out to walk your horses cool and this was where lioran should be taking control of the situation dionne swallowed and let a beat of time go by rhiannon ran out of patience first dismounting and handing her reins to the man im rhiannon and this is my sister dionne she glanced at the herald her look driving him from milas back and this is lioran the man gave the threesome a puzzled look but jerked his head toward the house they need you in there he nodded toward dionne who was untying her healing bag from the back of ladystars saddle especially you dionne made it inside first a great room full of seats including extra ones pulled in as for an impromptu meeting most of the chairs were full shovels and staffs lined the near wall makeshift and true weapons alike the conversation stopped although a woman sobbed softly in the back where five people had been laid out blood from wounds staining a thin green rug at least fifteen other faces turned toward her and then rhiannon and lioran came in behind her and the groups attention fell on lioran dionne headed straight for the back where two old healers bent over the patients she knelt beside them can i help her one of the women pointed and went right back to work on a set of deep cuts shed just finished stitching dionne bent over a shattered wrist taking a deep breath to ground herself behind her rhiannon asked what happened dionne focused on the splintered bone under her palms whispering hold still to the tearful woman she sat beside whats your name leidra okay leidra this shouldnt hurt much i know as dionne drew the earths energy to help her work snatches of the story drifted at her from the lips of old men and woman they were strangers not from near here they burned smileys farm before they came here and who knows what else they didnt expect us to fight them well we didnt not at first they didnt respect who we are petulant a woman her voice shaky were someone else snapped then continued we stood our ground quiet like wanting our lives more than our stuff but then they started in on us saying they were looking for treasure the warmth dionne had built up in her hands flowed into the woman in front of her she focused so hard that for a minute she didnt hear or feel anything but her patients need only when shed done all that she could did she listen again to the conversation died then we fought them old ray hes the one outside he stabbed one of their horses in the butt with a pitchfork someone actually laughed good laughter almost always had healing properties no matter how ironic or pained dionne looked for the next patient and one of the other two healers directed her to a man who couldnt move his leg she started feeling along it starting at the foot and working up but then they knocked him down that got cherie all mad and she started throwing stones and of course dionne could fill in the rest even though they were old and frail they had all done their turns in the salle during training and a few of them would have been on the front lines of various wars and skirmishes even though heralds didnt tend to retire in shelters end the assortment of older bards who didnt want to teach and retired healers who wanted the outdoors instead of the noisiness of the city included its own strengths melony was that way shed been offered a permanent place in haven her answer had been that shed spent forty years there and now she was just darn well going to relax and be an old woman melony where was she her patient groaned and dionne returned to the job at hand whatever had led him to choose this place for the end of his days hed come near them now blunt forceprobably a fallhad shattered his hip and hed have to be really tough to make it out of this alive the injury under her hands was simply insult added onto the deeper challenges of old age but she could encourage his body to increase the flow of blood and help it feel less pain after that it would be pretty much up to him and how much he still wanted to live she bent to her task spending most of her awareness drawing and feeding energy her lips spilling soft good wishes for the man under her hands her eyes watching his cragged and lined face and his light green eyes he stared at the ceiling barely moving his breathing slowed and regulated his skin began to regain color his heartbeat was a thin thread rest would do him more good than she could now her knees hurt from kneeling on the thin rug and her back screamed that shed better stretch or find a healer for herself as she sat up straight and raised her arms she came a little more aware of the room around her there were fewer people some must have gone off to bed or something she hadnt heard the door open or felt the fall chill enter the room rhiannon held a teapot in one hand conferring in low tones with two women lioran stood against a wall an impassive look on his face surely he should be outside where did everyone go she asked rhiannon glanced over at her met her eyes and the look in them sent a cold fear to settle into dionnes chest whats wrong theyre digging graves for the dead rhiannon put the teapot down on the top of the great cast iron stove and crossed the room pulling dionne up and holding her your friend melony shes the first one they actually killed she got mad when they knocked down the guy you just finished working on she told the leader off and they made an example of her it couldnt be true melony should have died of old age not violence not after being the best teacher for three years running violence shouldnt happen to old women what an irrational thought she was a healer so was melony they knew the world was unfair but still melonys face swam in dionnes imagination as she slumped into her twins arms grateful as always for rhiannon she swayed held up by her sister feeling as if everyone left in the room was watching them rhiannon brushed the hair from her face and whispered im sorry i know rhiannon of course knew what to say next how to drag her into the present and focus her they killed two others and one more fell and cracked his head theyre all outside digging graves together dionne shivered the room suddenly cold and her skin clammy she swallowed it wasnt as though she hadnt seen and felt death but shed so wanted melonys help she glanced toward lioran to find him watching her closely his narrow pale face a closed book his eyes almost afraid i should go help them dig she kept her gaze on lioran we all should although people from nearby towns bartered for singing and healing with strong backs she hadnt seen any this near the end of harvest there might not be any they were the three ablest hands left here and lioran was the strongest by far in spite of being slight of frame the look he gave her was deep with resentment almost like hatred it couldnt be hatred people with hatred in their hearts didnt get chosen but it was it was an emotion as dark as his eyes and his hair and as unfocused as her own pain he stalked to the door threw it open and headed outside without so much as a word dionne took a step to follow him but rhiannons arm shot out and stopped her not after all that work you just did for emphasis she glanced down at the old man dionne had just finished with she led dionne to an empty overstuffed chair youll be wanted when theyre ready to bury her these people are used to digging graves if usually for different reasons than this its probably familiar salve to their wounds but lioran can hang himself for all i care rhiannon shook her head i dont mean that hes just gotten under my skin besides mila wont let him hang himself i mean if he doesnt go off into a blue funk he might even be useful to the diggers he was already in a blue funk before dionne could get even one word out rhiannon had covered her with an extra coat kissed the top if her head and turned back to the stove and the teapot no use talking to the redheaded queen of any situation when she was in this mood her next conscious thought was to wonder how the room had gotten so warm it smelled like black tea and flowers rhiannon was humming a soft ditty about working she often sang when they were setting up or taking down camp dionne blinked and looked around her eyes starting out on rhiannon who held out a steaming cup dionne took the cup warm in her hands she sipped the tea so pungent it opened her sinuses and made room for fresh thoughts in her full head memories came back melony murder the bandits maybe she should have skipped the tea the wounded still lay in the back of the room one of the two healers leaned back against the wall with her eyes closed soft snores indicating she slept a tired old woman whod just done too much she would look like that soon herself she and her sister were both getting old from the change in angle of the light slanting through the windows shed slept at least two marks maybe more funny how it felt like moments she took another sip of tea and choked some words past the lump in her throat are they done soon thats why i got you up hmmmph dionne handed her the empty tea cup and walked over to the wounded they still slept a typical outcome of healing they all breathed normally and dionne adjusted a pillow here and a blanket or coat there before she went to the privy to clean up and wash her face the cold water did only a little to help her feel refreshed surely it was just because shed spent so much energy healing but melonys death weighed on her mood like a stone so heavy it was impossible to drag up a welcoming smile as a woman bundled in a warm coat and handmade sheepswool scarf came in the door is the healer here dionne im here ylia the way the woman said her name had a bit of singsong in it wed like you to come out to say something before we bury them all dionne shouldered into her coat sure she didnt want to go stand graveside and say nice pretty things she was too tired she and rhiannon followed ylia to the four graves either rhiannon had told them about her relationship with melony or someone had remembered since although the other three were finished theyd saved the work of throwing the first earth onto melonys body for dionne the simple gesture made the last few steps to the graves even harder to take she stood in front of melonys coffin the lid was still open the familiar beloved face marred by a cut cheek and a bruised lip with her life gone her mentor appeared simply slight and thin wispy dionne felt thinner herself as if some of her soul followed melony as if her past had begun to die lioran and rhiannon stood behind her close enough for dionne to hear their breathing the same man who had taken their reins this morningjaredclimbed down into the grave and closed the lid of the coffin hiding melony from the world the faces standing graveside were lined with spider webs of dignity and pain some of the men with settling jowls or bald heads most of the women shaped more like boxes than urns slow and broad a few thin and reedy all bone and skin as a group the primary expressions they wore were resignation and hope dionne tried to look hopeful to be the healer she was but all she could manage was a lighter despair than shed started with the afternoon was like molasses time moving slow and everything exaggerated she knelt down and took a fistful of rich damp earth a week of relentless rains had stopped a few days ago even though the surface of the earth had dried in the previous days wind the bottom of the grave was damp dark mud as soon as she stood she started talking not saying anything at all like what she usually said at graves not comforting life is not fair it unfairly plucked this wonderful woman too early and for doing what she always did helping people i came here to get help from her she has helped me all my life when i needed it oh i havent seen her for years but thats partly because she helped me grow up rhiannon came and stood beside dionne like a pillar it gave dionne the strength to continue this year i needed her and shes not here a tear fell down her face she let it go healers cry thats something melony taught me if we dont cry we die inside a little bit every day so when we need to we cry and then she was sobbing great piles of breath backing up in her throat and bursting out her nose and eyes running like streams she threw the dirt before she couldnt see any more then she knelt down by the grave rhiannon next to her head bowed she heard other fistfuls of dirt thudding into the hole murmured prayers accompanied each throw one and another and another thank you speed on your journey ill always remember the blackberry jam goodbye and who am i going to weave with now ill miss you so pass well in time the wet sloppy sounds stopped rhiannon elbowed her gently dionne looked up in time to see lioran throw his own fistful of mud a tear streaked down his cheek as well and then another the most genuine emotion dionne had ever seen on his face he was doing the one thing she hadnt seen him do since she met him crying she started to push herself up but rhiannon held her down finish your own grief but her grief had lightened a little she glanced back at the coffin smeared and splattered with mud and prayers thank you she whispered you did find a way to help almost everyone went back to their violated houses and even rhiannon followed murmuring something about making more hot tea dionne stayed graveside standing in the chilling breeze while leaves blew around her feet lioran came to stand beside her his eyes were red and sore his cheeks puffy and pink his hands covered in mud his whites dirty beyond saving he put an arm around her and pulled her close to him the two of them standing in silence for a long time she felt warmer with him there finally he whispered youll remember her i remember my mom every day i remember the way she bit her tongue when she cut potatoes for dinner and how her voice lilted when she called jackie our farm dog i remember my little sister calling me a wimp and a bookworm and then asking for help with numbers his voice had lost the whine i remember my dad the day i was chosen looking like the best and worst thing ever had all happened to him at once and wishing me well he swallowed thats where i go at night to remember them im so afraid that ill go back to town and get busy and forget the little things and then theyll really be dead dionne looked down at the fresh earth shes dead i will forget the details because im not dead and i have a job to do but that doesnt change the beauty of her life or make what she gave me any less i have work too yes more silence and then dionne whispered thank you for telling me about them thank you for singing to me he said ill tell rhiannon that too two days later they started their return journey to haven there theyd tell their tales and see if there was a way to get help for shelters end maybe some guards or a few young families theyd encourage the crown to send out a hunting party to find the bandits and clean up after them ylia and jared accompanied them to be witnesses riding horses borrowed from a farm in a nearby town haven was stretchedit was always stretchedand dionne expected that only a little could be offered but theyd give whatever was possible dionne cracked her sore knuckles and told her back there were a few more years of riding left shelters end was worth keeping maybe a place theyd go themselves although not for a while on the first night away from town lioran picked a campsite without being asked he did go off with mila barebacked and silent but on his return he didnt roll away from them all and stare out into the night he sat beside them at the fire ylia and jared on one side lioran between rhiannon and dionne on the far side when rhiannon started to sing he joined in dionne had never heard his voice it

virtual hives of scum and villainy offline she is either hiking with the smirking entity she calls the guy or on the couch with cats and a laptop stacked atop her recovering from the aforementioned hiking trail this is madness lelia said this her twin lyle looked over his shoulder at the haven marketplace packed with people engaged in the mindless happy activities that swirled about at this time of year its just the midwinter market she punched his shoulder a futile gesture as they were both bundled up against the cold she in mittens and a coat he in riding leathers and a heavy white cloak lyles companion rivan stood off to one side saddled and ready to go five years as a field herald had whittled lyle downpunching him felt like punching a tree he grinned at her pitiful attempt to bruise youre such a mooncalf sometimes she muttered sweeping her bangs back under her cap so she could fix him with a full glower i was beingwhat dya call it funny she only frowned anyone who knew the two would have been amused or greatly alarmed by their role reversal shesolemn as a priest he smirking like a page whod filched cream cakes off the queens table they were in a snug side street off the market one of the few not accommodating the overflow of stalls and hawkers a few minutes ago shed been happily browsing jewelry in her scarlets which was probably how hed spotted her usually she wore plainer clothes but shed hoped formal regalia would drum up a little midwinter work work had found her all right and it wore whites they realize im a bard she said not a herald thats the point they also know that i will likely foul this up you dont even know what this is even more likely lelia he reached out and touched her shoulder gracing her with a beatific smile that had reassured more than a few valdemarans in its time youre going to do fine she narrowed her eyes did you suggest me lyle cocked his head actually no well if you didnt something nuzzled the back of her neck and she shrieked leaping forward lyle grabbed her shoulders and gently turned her around to face the companion waiting there the companion inclined his head and bent his knee in an equine bow be polite to vehs lyle mindspoke to her vehs companion to herald wil she thought back sweating with the effort their twinbond was not the stuff of legend if they hadnt been touching she wouldnt have been able to mindspeak to him at all yes lelias heart sank of course it would be him the network of heralds only went so far wil lyles senior on circuit training wil who probably only knew one bardher wil the herald shed been obsessed with years ago just the memory of the way shed romanticized him made her ears burn she tried to reassure herself but you grew up you stopped wearing that stupid necklace he gave you you got over it she straightened her spine youre a master bard now suddenly lyle hugged her disrupting her train of thought love you she sagged against him letting some of her anxiety drain out stay safe she muttered remember that if you die on the job i will eulogize you in a fivepart cycle with at least two flute solos he chuckled by the way i told mama and papa youd come with me next year for midwinter she drew back horrified you didnt he grinned lylemidwinter is about earning money for a bard his face grew stern when was the last time you visited lelia she sputtered unable to say anything but i cant afford it well figure something out lyle winked then gestured to vehs who had presented a stirrup up you get she ignored his offer of help despite vehss mountainlike build she didnt so much mount as scale him he whickered and turned at the last possible moment lelia twisted round and said to lyle im staying in your room hope you dont mind his face fell what she squeezed vehs gently he took her lead and leaped forward moving off into the crowds the last she heard from lyle was lelia if you burn down the heralds wing vehs chuckled in his chosens head wil leaned against a post in the companions stable and thought back what i have been part of something sneaky mine is an evil chuckle he demonstrated it again oh wil rubbed his brow for the record yes yes its a terrible idea understood chosen vehs chuckled again wil paced he was not alone in the stableanother herald the official who would be signing off on this mission stood nearby with hands clasped behind his back always still always composed not wil he kicked up hay and graindust as he paced between the deepening shadows of late afternoon he wanted another solution but no ideas were forthcoming he took a step gray winter sunlight sliding over him and the next put him in shadow another step and his gut wrenched as his gift triggered body on the floor and a woman in jewelry standing over it two knives at her waist one in her hand the tip bloody as she smiled and raised it he came back to himself on his knees clutching his head over on the other side of the stable the other herald asked are you all right fine wil said climbing to his feet and brushing off his knees sir i dont know if this wait for her to get here the herald said then well decide if its a bad idea i could swear hes been talking to vehs wil thought sourly as if cued vehs said were coming through the heralds gate wil walked over to stand beside the senior herald he folded his arms across his chest and watched as the redclad rider drew closer vehs stopped a few feet away from the big open building of companions stables oh lelia thought when she saw who stood next to wil she dropped to her feet and executed a deep curtsy sweeping off her cap mlord herald she said queens own talamir inclined his head slightly herald wil she said to the other dropping another curtsy albeit more shallow a fierce joy welled unbidden inside her she did her best to squash it i am a master bard i am a master bard she reminded her galloping heart wil grunted a hello how much did lyle tell you talamir asked her his voice had a faint quaver but his gaze was direct and difficult to meet even if he hadnt been spooky as a haunted castle being under the eye of a herald this high gave lelia the quakes nothing she said honestly just that the heraldic circles interested in enlisting a bard for something delicate her voice dropped in volume as she finished the sentence glancing about nervously she had to presume that the heralds had chosen the stables for a reason but it still felt awfully open its safe wil said blandly addressing her concern the companions are keeping an eye out lelia nodded lyle vouched for you as trustworthy talamir commented lyle you mooncalf lelia thought furiously he talamir indicated wil with a nod has reason to get inside the mansion of a lord in haven without anyone knowing a herald is there and i have it on good authority that the lords wife is seeking a musician for her midwinter parties lelia pursed her lips suddenly this didnt sound so bad discretion would be required talamir said who placed you there would have to remain confidential this is a potentially volatile situation she nodded discretion understood do you wil asked fixing her with a look his tone caused a flicker of irritation to rise inside her and when she met him gaze for gaze she saw in his face something she hadnt anticipated deep distrust not skeptical not suspicioushe didnt trust her the joy of reunion died leaving behind a wealth of annoyance ive performed for the queen she replied coolly and had to suppress a smirk when he blinked in obvious surprise didnt know about that did you she thought mlord talamir would you say i did so with grace indeed the queens own murmured also she continued its been a while since i wore my rusts but im sure dean arissa would vouch for me assuming shes forgotten about that incident with the chirra and the inkwell well herald talamir said to wil its either this or try to get in as a servant wil massaged his forehead grimacing i guess well try this very well talamir rubbed his hands together lightly i will make the arrangements do you have a handler maresa applegate lelia replied promptly i shall make your arrangements with her then i leave you two to the rest he walked off abruptly without further farewell when wil finally bothered to look at lelia he did so with a sad sober expression it made her own smile fade a little im glad to see you she said and hugged him women confused wil he never felt comfortable around them unless they were younger than fifteen or older than dirt or married or saddled with babies none of which described lelia when shed been younger shed beenwell manageable didnt cover it but it had been different now though he patted her back awkwardly as she hugged him and felt relieved when she disengaged not that it hadnt been a nice hugher coat hung open and hed shed his due to the warmth of the heated stables her body squished comfortably in the right places her height had also put her hair right under his nose giving him a whiff of honey and cinnamon and so it went around the women whoconfusedwil they hugged him or said they were glad to see him and his response always felt wrong he decided to focus on what he knew being a herald im staying at the companions bell he said as attikas goldenoak what else can you tell me about thiswhatever it is he briefly thought about explaining it to her well lelia ive been having stomachlurching visions of a horrible murder but theres no hard evidence aside from a brigands confession and a handful of gems in fact the only solution the supposedly brilliant queens own could come up with was dropping me in the lords home and letting my gift do its work no no the only thing worse than this socalled plan was trying to explain it to someone the less the better he said she rolled her eyes you wont pass for an entertainer you know thats just one problem with this plan its not a problem vehs said stubbornly you just dont want to come up with a solution assistant wil hazarded trying to mollify his companion the whites might give you away conveniently i wouldnt be wearing them she widened her eyes innocently the queen lets you take them off wil felt his cheeks burn was she being funny or making fun of him she was smiling what did it mean she nodded to herself i have an idea you have a weapon he gave her a disgusted look one you can wear to a party without looking like an idiot yes excellent on that note going to tell me why she cocked her head oh i think the less you know the better vehs chuckled gleefully glad youre amused wil thought sourly at him i need to collect some things she said see you at the bell in the morning sure he mumbled have a good night herald she waved and wandered off whistling as she went wil directed his attention to vehs it was funny vehs said wil stalked off in a direction opposite hers not the fastest route off the palacecollegia complex but at least it guaranteed hed be alone vehs drew up beside him mostly alone wil thought talamir thinks shes capable vehs said and lyle is a herald id be happier if she were too but then she wouldnt be a bard and then you wouldnt be able to get onto the counts grounds vehss amusement sparkled like barleywine wil looked in the direction the bard had gone she has matured i mean physically she hasum womanly assets wil flushed remembering the brief but warm hug i wasnt lookingokay i was but that wasntexactly shes a woman now but shes still lelia he found distinct comfort in that bit of curmudgeonry vehs bumped him from behind this is your problem you know you only have faith in me and other heralds thats because i like breathing there are worse things than dying like what never truly living wil guffawed what philosophers memoir did you dredge that from vehs would not be deterred just because someone doesnt wear white ill think about it wil replied annoyed vehs went silent but wil knew the bard and what she was capable of and that worried him wil thought hed been poleaxed by another vision when the countess swept in but his gut remained quiescent and no invisible force drove him to his knees they were here now i am countess chantil of tindale she said three attendants accompanied her two ladies and the stiffcollared butler who had fetched her im master bard lelia lelia dropped a curtsy and skillfully elbowed wil at the same time he bowed hastily this is my bodyguard attikas chantils brows crept upward bodyguard really admirers following you home bard lelia smiled blandly something like that bodyguard that had been lelias plan yesterday morning when wild walked downstairs and found her waiting wil had grudgingly admitted it wasnt a bad idea a visit to the midwinter market had yielded proper clothes and his longknife completed the ensemble no one expected him to dance sing or even speakjust look grim something he excelled at chantil gestured this way she swept off down a hallway retinue trailing wastes no time wil thought youll be playing in the grand hall chantil said walking so briskly wil thought her heeled shoes would crack the marble floors any needs you have please speak to my steward einan she gestured to the man wil had taken for a butler she wheeled suddenly causing her voluminous raw silk skirts to spin i would appreciate it if you kept things she coughed delicately into her satin gloved hand cheerful and understated nothing morose please a glint lit in lelias eye wil immediately knew that had been the wrong thing for the countess to say he hoped that lelias retaliation would be discreet enough to not get her position here terminated focus on your job chosen let the bard do hers if she performs a protracted singalong of the vigil that never ends vehs snickered as i stated before lelia said reemploying that graceful curtsey shed used earlier i am well experienced at performing for clientele of your caliber countess and might i say what an honor it is to be here your happiness is my first priority these seemed to be the words the countess wanted to hear oh you bards her eyes flitted to wil and her smile soured a trifle surely its quite safe here its a matter of my peace of mind lelia said firmly and now since you have me performing this very eve i find it necessary to test the acoustics of the chamber chantils smile didnt quite play true if you need anything the kitchens are that way she gestured toward a wing of the mansion or find einan or marjori they can assist you she gave wil a final cursory glance and then sashayed off minions in tow lelia set herself up on a chair gittern in lap wil stood about feeling awkward and unnecessary until she said you know i think the countess is right i should be quite safe here be a dear and fetch me some water when he didnt move she gave him a curious look then broke into a laugh and shooed him go on as he started forward she called dont get lost his confusion lasted to the doorand then her hints sunk in getting lost was exactly what he needed to do he plunged into the depths of the mansion as a trainee hed been taught that foresight wasnt all flashes of the futurethat his uncanny gut instinct stemmed from it and that doubt proved particularly toxic to someone with his gift because it muddled its messages he tried to listen to his gut now as he passed oaken doors with brass knobs and double doors with inlaid glass leading out to the atrium he navigated twisty corridors noted alcoves with busts of former tindale lords in them and passed a door with gryphons carved on it he saw cozy windowseats with curtains both drawn and down flower petals strewn across the cushions he tried but eventually he had to admit defeat and return to the bard emptyhanded midwinter vigil wasnt for four more nights but you couldnt tell that by the press of revelers at the mansion lelia thought her sets were well received although they sounded contrived to her ears no one listened to her anyway she was little more than a musical bauble at parties like this maresa had worked out an excellent contract not just in payment but also in the number of breaks lelia got it gave her ample time to lurk and mingle while wil went on endless errands to fetch her water and tidbits the countesss entourage avoided her but the servers were happy to talk the characteristics of a bard were curiosity as deep as the sky and enough charm to coax secrets from a stone by the end of the night lelia had a pretty good idea why wil was here so she said once they were back at the bell and could safely shed their coats and personas i talked to some servants tonight wils eyes narrowed andris is the countess fourth husband did you know that his face went blank and she thought ah ha the counts awfully young she continued seemed impressionable to me vulnerable too lelia i hear her last three husbands all died under questionable stop she held the sentences ending hostage meeting and holding his gaze its not a game lelia he said quietly and i told you i know that and you act like i dont she shook her head at him hoisting her heavy pack of books and notes good night she muttered and stomped off to trudge through the cold wil rubbed his forehead i cant do this he said at last you can vehs protested no i cant wil unbuckled his belt and slipped his weapon loop off the stories are right talamirs halfway to the havens only a simpleton would have assigned me to do this withher chosen vehss mindvoice was flat serious that isnt it at all vehs i cant shut up wil rocked on his heels feeling as if hed been slapped ever since you spoiled that brigands ambush this is all ive heard endless whining about how you cant and this isnt your forte youre a herald its all your job wil sat stunned into silence hed never known vehs to be thisdirect you are the one herald with foresight having these visions you are the one who stopped the brigand interrogated him under truth spell and learned of the danger to andris and yes you are the one who will uncover enough evidence to take to the queen so we can keep chantil from murdering her fourth husband and do you know why why wil asked meekly because you are my chosen dammit and i didnt choose an idiot a long silence followed and then and neither did rolan wil slumped im sorry i justi dont he carefully rephrased the thought i feel like a fish out of water talamir gave you gills use them wil touched his neck confused the bard chosen what no no no no she learned a lot in one night she is far more social than you she fits in where you do not if you havent completely offended her she might even help you vehs retreated then leaving wil alone with his thoughts he crawled into bed but it didnt want him he tossed and turned thoughts churning ages later he gave a resigned sigh vehs is going to be insufferable he thought with that realization wil finally slept lelia had neither a smile nor a good afternoon for wil the next day wil tried to strike up conversation and every time she either walked faster or intercepted a street vendor cutting him off oh sure when i want to apologize he thought irritated once at the mansion she immediately set up and started playing he stood mutely by finally wandering off when she muttered water he wandered the hallways and corridors trying to feel whatever his gift relayed past an alcove past a cupboard past the door with the twin gryphons carved on it and he stepped back to stare at the door hunger pangs or something else that door it opened he jumped face to face with einan chantils toady are you lost sir he asked uhyes sorry privy einan pointed wil thanked him and hurried off the bards silence lasted even after her performance and when they marched back to the bell she walked past the front entry hey he called she looked back glaring coldly she hadnt yet stopped wil winced he pointed to the bell i want to talk please she slowed then turnedand came back nicely done chosen vehs said upstairs she sat down on the edge of the bed and said nothing wil started pacing i cant believe im saying this need your help he said she cocked her head somehow i need to get around that mansion without anyone interrupting wil stopped long enough to meet her gaze can you help i can she pursed her lips have you heard about salia what chantils former maid one of her trusted circle a week after the tindales came to haven for midwinter festival chantil ousted her for stealing lelia pulled her knees to her chest and rested her chin on top einan marjori and ylorathats the third onewont talk about her but the others she chuckled oh twas just scandalous okay interesting but he stopped wait what was she accused of stealing silver jewelry a couple of necklaces and brooches the brigands mysterious employer paid him in gems wil thought excited you think chantil took them off her own jewelry to pay the brigand and then blamed it on salia and i have to wonder if she melted those settings down or hid them to reset later how smart do you think she is or how arrogant wil thought of the gryphondoor room and his gut twinged exactly did chantil report her to the guard wil asked curious you should ask lelias eyes sparkled chantil never demanded the jewelry back never brought charges against her she didnt even do the oustinggave all the dirty work to einan or marjori depending on who you ask chantil said she didnt want to see salia again wils brows lifted well lelia nodded mull on that ill try to think of a suitable distraction he frowned like what she stood in the doorway and looked back over her shoulder the less you know she said winked and stepped out lelia timed her announcement for when the grand hall was at its fullest she stilled her strings rose and cleared her throat with full bardic projection she said attention the volume died down heads turned a few stray threads of conversations continued but not for long as some of you are aware she said i am the composer and original performer of today i ride she arched a brow or as some of you call it that sendar song a murmur of recognitionand a few chuckles rolled through the crowd well tomorrow i will perform the song she lifted the other brow for the last time a collective gasp went through the room wil remained stoic i ask that if you all wish to hear it for the last timefrom its creatorthat you be here tomorrow three candlemarks before midnight she bowed deeply thank you a wild clamor followed the outraged look from chantil warmed lelias heart the entourage fluttered and muttered looking just as distraught as their lady lelia had just swiped all the attention and chantil could do nothing about it if youre smart youll pretend you suggested it mlady lelia thought back at the bell and once again safe from prying eyes and ears she said sendars song is a little less than a quarter candlemark in its full unedited form i can get you half if i include one of the parodies there are parodies oh yes my personal favorite is today i lunch she giggled its very respectful right nothing i havent done before so many times im sick of it to be honest the wages of fame her lips twitched eh got me in to see the queen i assume its how talamir knew me and why chantil jumped to hire me she took a deep breath speaking of her haughtiness ill use my gift no one will leave that room the whole room under bardic gift im not that good but chantil and andris will be my focus with them pinned no ones going to leave might actually work good she stood up tomorrow then tomorrow he agreed lelia had her hand on the door to the heralds wing when she heard the hiss of something swinging through the air having spent years being hammered on by a large and skilled excaptain of the karsite army had its merits when lelia heard things hissing toward her her first instinct was to duck she dropped her weight shed her packs and rolled off to the side she sprung up again facing whatever had been swinging at where shed been standing she saw a nothing that was somethingblack clothes black gloves black hood and half mask the blackclad nothing lunged at her with what looking like a club taking another twohanded strike at her face lelia stumbled backward opened her mouth and screamed with full bardic gift stop her attacker staggered in place lelia jumped forward and landed with bonecrunching force on her assailants foot a clunk followed the howl as the club dropped lelia crouched and came up swinging the discarded weapon her assailants ribs cracked like greenwood the figure issued an ear piercing shriek turnedand ran oh no lelia yelled brandishing her new weapon get back here you baguh her own pack fouled her one moment she was on her feet the next she sprawled on the pathway tangled in books and leather the club bouncing merrily away the sound of footfalls receded by the time she regained her feet she was alone gods damn it she whispered somehow she made it up to lyles room and lit the hearth with shaking hands the warm familiarity of her brothers quarters kept her from curling up into a hysterical sobbing ball she locked and barred every window and door shivering despite the warmth of the fire wil heard a knock early the next morning he stumbled out of bed to find the bard on the other side of his door you look got attacked she said wearily couldnt sleep what she told him with monosyllabic sentences and a demonstrative stomp she showed him the short leadweighted stick of wood shed turned on her attackers ribs she hadnt seen a face but she also hadnt told anyone she did however tell him where shed been staying the heralds wing he struggled to keep his voice level she blinked everyone knows lyles my brother i uh forgot to mention thats where she was staying didnt i vehs managed to sound sheepish youre worse than me at being sneaky wil thought why didnt you come and get me he asked her very wary after neardeath experience long walk no magic horse lelia sokay not hurt her eyes drifted shut need sleep just a candlemark here okay her eyes opened again pleading he pointed to the bed go she patted his cheek good herald the bard curled up on his bed dragging the covers over her snores drifted up from her a moment later wil picked up the club his gut twisted hellfires he muttered wil scanned the crowd feeling a rising level of annoyance and frustration as he watched the countess dance gaily to lelias composition not a sign of pain or a limp the room was packed stifling with heat despite it being nearly the middle of winter the only reason wil spotted the countess was that shed dressed like a peacock that had been doused in rainbow hued pitch and set ablaze a gesture he took to be overcompensation for lelia stealing her glory lelia gestured him over and whispered time now he nodded ill get you that right away maam he said as he straightened turned and strode off ladies and gentlelords lelias voice boomed over the crowd rolling out like a banner who wants to hear a story about valdemars greatest king wil breathed more freely when he got into the corridor and away from the crush of people and the roaring cheers servants jostled past babbling about whats hername and the sendarsong someday he realized he would need to ask her to play it for him the wide corridor beyond the great hall and kitchens echoed utterly deserted he tried to be quiet but the farther he went the more urgently his gift nudged him twisting his gut into harder and tighter knots the need to get there overwhelmed the lesser need to be silent he turned a corner his destinationpossibly his destinycame into view a terrible notion slid over himwhat if the door was locked then i will break it down he thought grimly he touched the doorknob it turned with a click opening on a room lit by a single lantern a wan familiar face floated in the inky darkness something metal gleamed wils insides gave one final painful alltoofamiliar lurch not now knife blood silver settings empty of gems crossbow waitcrosswhat as wil staggered under the weight of foresight he heard the snick of a quarrel being fired the enraptured audience stood motionless before lelia as she stretched her gift her attention utterly focused on the count the countess and her entourage of wheres einan lelia thought her fingers continued strumming even as her thoughts turned frantic where is he einan fired the crossbow cradled in his arms just as wils vision drove him to his knees the bolt slammed into the wood paneling behind him raining splinters into his hair wil drew his longknife einan swore and struggled to rise from the settee hed been reclining on wil tackled him to the floor and on a wild guess punched him in the ribs the bones yielded easily einan screamed handy gift foresight heyla wil said at a loss for words that wasnt very nice einans lips pulled back showing his teeth youdispleaseher he coughed then drew himself up and spat at wil wil flinched and jerked back for just a secondall the time the steward needed a dirk appeared in his hand from a holster on his wrist chantil he shrieked and rammed it into his own throat blood painted the walls and wil einan expired gurgling his ladys name his neck lelia said toying with a silvery pendant dangling about her own throat wil nodded from the edge of his bedthe real one in his room in the heraldic wing einan was chantils childhood friend lowclass family couldnt marry her so became her steward wil rubbed his eyes hed been debriefing for candlemarks since last night sleep had not been possible we found journals and madness doesnt begin to cover half of it pages about how much he adored chantil how perfect she was how the people who served her didnt deserve her including her husbands he pointed at her you too lelia grimaced he followed you home every night palace guards keep records of visitors but since he was the tindale steward no one questioned him being there einan was convinced you were a herald in disguise she gaped what the irony is really not lost on us what you were staying in the heraldic wing buteveryone knows not everyone it seems oh wil rubbed his face found the jewelry under the floorboards of einans bedroom empty settings chantil was flabbergasted would have loved to see that heh in retrospect shes not that bad a person lelia shrugged still a snob butnot a murderer wil nodded sometimes people arent what they appear to be oh vehs said dryly what philosophers memoir did you dredge that from hush you wil yawned his eyes drooping tired sorry dont apologize for doing your job she stood so what next nother circuit probably works never done she smiled valdemar first yeah she bent forward and kissed his forehead i spoke to valdemar she said to sleep its her midwinter gift to you he cracked a smile thanks no problem goodbye good night he yawned back before he dropped off wil thought it nice when she kissed him lelia sang a word the sound echoing across companions field a white form broke off from the herd and trotted toward where she waited at the fence an apple in her outstretched hand midwinter gift for you she said as vehs delicately nipped the fruit from her palm the companion chewed then bent and touched his nose to the pack at her feet the stories call she said evendim if it matters rumors of halfhawk men there she stood up on tiptoe and kissed his cheek keep him safe vehs shook his mane and stamped his hoof a gesture of frustration it didnt matter anyway even if it was she had songs to sing the companion watched her as she walked through the frosty grass toward the gates whistling as she went wil hummed to himself on his way to lyles quarters he lifted his fist to knock she left vehs interrupted wil froze what vehs told him this time of year wil thought madness i know waityou and the bardtalk of course not she talked to me and im the one who suggested her remember vehss mental voice danced with amusement jealous wil thought that a very stupid question and expressed as much in other news vehs said when he was done kyril wants to meet about your next circuit where evendim perhaps sorrows the barbarians softly vehs added im sorry wil shook himself eh what for he shrugged i go where the crown wills wil walked in silence down the stairs rubbing his forehead lightly as he went wounded bird by michael z williamson michael z williamson was born in the uk and raised in canada and the us a twenty fouryear veteran of the us army and us air force combat engineers he is married to a reserve army combat photographer who is a civilian graphic artist they have too many cats and two children who have learned how to fight anything including zombies from the age of four women only wore dresses in mirr riga had compromised with a knee length tunic of wine silk with crimson and silver embroidery and beading over her trews it stuck out in vivid contrast to the somber blacks and whites of the natives she acceded somewhat to their law and wore a kerchief over her flaxen hair but her warriors braid hung below rather than loose under a long headdress like the locals not that it mattered to anyone but her father and erki knew her and the locals would never regard her as anything other than a girl she saw how the locals treated women as servants jesrin for example serving her minted tea was lean and healthy looking and seemed rather bright shed never develop as anything here though she was unnumbered and unlettered and probably not much of a cook just a serving girl riga would have liked to talk to her at least but shed have to go to the kitchen to do so women didnt talk in front of men even if riga might jesrin certainly wouldnt riga thought about the kitchen but that was a concession she didnt want to make she was not a servant she was a trader and a warrior jesrin moved on with more tea for the amar the local trading lord she hesitated around his gesticulating arms then moved to pour he changed his motion just in time to catch the spout of the samovar and deliver a big splash of liquid to the lush woolen rug the men sat on clumsy wench riga twitched as amar rabas backhanded jesrin the blow was hard enough to stagger her but she flailed through contortions to avoid dropping the silver tea set riga could only imagine the penalty if the girl did that a moment later she wasnt sure she could imagine the slight girl shrieked as her ankle twisted but she laid the tray down carefully on the marble flagstones behind her not a drop spilled however rabas drew a heavy cord from somewhere and laid into her the knotted end thunking heavily right through her thick clothes the girl writhed and twitched but she let out only whimpers presumably crying was punishable too father gave riga a warning glance and she nodded once her face blank while inside she burned with rage it was not their business to interfere though he obviously didnt like it either rigas brother erki fought to keep his own temper he was three years younger though only fourteen what a lesson on foreign cultures for him it was worse for her because riga was a trained warrior had the amar swung at her like that shed have broken his arm and then sliced his throat and of course been beaten to death or hanged for her trouble it just drove home that fighting was not always the answer it also drove home that she despised this southern city and its culture in the week theyd been here the amar had escalated his hospitality gifts and praise every day hed also escalated his brutality and rudeness to his servants and his own

five shipsboth of theirs and three others belonging to distant cousinswere being packed with valuable spices silk and teas riga really wasnt sure it was morally worth it mirr was pretty mirr was also a filthy dump as far as attitudes decency and anything beyond decadently carved stone and flowers went amar rabas father interrupted diplomatically when the man looked up from his flogging he continued we are grateful for your hospitality it is time to retire to our inn for the day i hope to see you again tomorrow as we prepare to leave the amar rose and the girl crawled to her knees and bowed low he glanced at her snapped get to the kitchen then turned back to his guests of course gunde may i host you for dinner tomorrow a feast in farewell before you eat ship rations my son and i would be honored father said of course riga was only a daughter and was not mentioned here any more than a dog would be they bowed all around and departed as the girl scurried limping away taking the tray and towel with her once outside and out of earshot riga muttered i think id prefer ship biscuits and salted meat to hospitality such as his they are not a nice people father agreed but we need the trading stop if we could transport only across the lake back home and stay solvent id do that we need proper trading voyages now and then though its also good learning for you two we need to learn that some people are pure evil erki asked the amar is brutal even by our warrior standards father said but he is not evil at least their trade is honest and tariffs fair theyve held off miklamars encroachments so far if you want evil you remember the refugees fleeing that murderous thug i do erki said as he rubbed his stubby thumb so did riga she vividly remembered him losing half that thumb when the two youths had had to be warriors and guides for those refugees tonight is our last night in the inn father said well remain aboard ship under tent until we leave oh good riga said i prefer our tent to their opulence its friendlier nothing about this city was friendly except the other traders and embassies of course they werent of this city riga wore heavy clothes despite the mild weather but no sword erki and father carried swords they were her protectors her status none at home she wore her catjeweled sword and no one would be silly enough to ask if she knew its use the feast was not a happy event it could have been but riga had no complaints about the food she didnt like being behind a curtain at a second remote table set up for women where she ate with the wives and servants she didnt like getting what were basically the leavings from the men the entertainment would be better if she could actually see it rather than just hear hints of it past the curtain the food was wonderful though redolent with spices and rich and savory the manner took getting used to one formed rice into balls or tore pieces of bread and just reached in to scoop up the saucy mess even at the womens table there was a hierarchy the senior wife sat at the far end her two junior wives flanked her and the wives and concubine of two other guests sat down from there riga guessed her position at a table end was of some status and two daughters flanked her between were the servants a warm sweet smell seemed to indicate dessert or at least a dessert thered been two so far jesrin served the men then came through to serve the women as she leaned past riga to put down a platter of pastry her layered gown slipped revealing some shoulder riga almost recoiled in horror at what she glimpsed that delicate shoulder was a mass of blood blisters bruises and welts their color indicated they were healing but hed laid into this girl horribly steeling herself she said nothing made no acknowledgementservants werent people hereand ate quietly the food was good it would have been twice as good if shed been granted the courtesy of eating with the men she reminded herself that her own people regarded her as a warrior no insults here could change that of course father had asked that she diplomatically not discuss any of her manly skills while she knew weaving and a little of spinning she knew much more of boatkeeping and lading numbers letters horse care and maneuver the women chatted amiably about textiles and art and riga just nodded and smiled jesrin slipped back through a few minutes later came over and discreetly handed riga a slip of parchment which riga just as discreetly opened in her lap and read we are staying here tonight your room will be across the hall from minegundefather if there was one thing riga didnt want to do it was stay here beneath her status she momentarily raged inside it wasnt just being treated as an inferior it was that it didnt matter what her status was didnt matter her skills she could run the business herself if need be she lacked fathers decades but she had a grounding in all the basics and plenty of her own travels and deals and war but here just being born female meant that she was beneath a horse even beneath a dog and wouldnt even be treated with contempt she just wouldnt be treated at all the offered hospitality was for father and erki not her her room was a mere courtesy to father otherwise theyd stick her in a hole with the servants she was sure after that she withdrew completely from the conversation and just steamed silently until jesrin led her up the marble stairs long after the men had retreated to a frilly dainty girly room it was very lavish of course see how well the amar treats even a daughter of a trader if you need jesrin said that cord will ring a bell below ill hurry right up you wont sleep yourself riga asked jesrin seemed confused by rigas accent or perhaps the question itself of course ill wake up its my duty to serve if im not available then aysa will come thank you though ill be fine youve been so gracious jesrin replied with a demure bow thank you all i do is on behalf of my lord riga couldnt wait so asked jesrin would you like me to look at your shoulder i may have a salve that will help oh miss riga you are gracious no the housemistress is taking care of it i will be fine the poor girl seemed embarrassed and ashamed just to discuss it girl jesrin was easily a year older than rigas seventeen yet riga was a woman among her people able to run her household sign contracts travel freely or as mistress of a mission jesrin seemed younger frailer helpless she could manage any number of chores but she had no voice was illiterate a glorified pet riga could give orders to laborers and warriors jesrin wouldnt know how even if she could with nothing else to offer riga said then i shall retire i hope to see you in the morning and please rest youve made me most comfortable thank you a blessing on you jesrin bowed and withdrew with what looked like a happy smile it made riga shudder the next morning riga awoke to sun peeking through chiseled piercework in the shutters the weather was wonderfully mild the bed was silken over feathers with a very fine cotton sheet riga would gladly give it all up to keep her status a breakfast of fruit and pastry sat on a tray near the door she snagged a couple of fat strawberries and a roll partly to quiet her stomach and partly to be polite to jesrin and the other servants she didnt care what the amar thought and was pretty sure he wouldnt even ask how shed fared she rebraided her hair threw a scarf over it to appease local customs and opened the door no one was around so she crept across and tapped on what she hoped was fathers door she could hear his voice and erkis and that brightened her mood a lot he swung the door open and said welcome daughter im sure youre dreading returning to the sea fox oh yes very much father please get me out of here now her mind and face said once downstairs she stood back while father erki and the amar exchanged bows she wasnt expected to participate for which she was glad a few minutes later they were striding down the broad dusty street toward the port erki said ill be glad to eat normal food i got sick of the rich fancy stuff very quickly i enjoyed the food not the company i wish i could have jesrin seems like a nice girl she said she does he sent her to my room an hour after bed last night father admitted oh father you didnt she exclaimed of course i didnt he replied with a grimace and shiver gods shes barely older than you girl ugh he cringed again i bade her sit and talk for a while gave her some medicine for the pain and some herbs to help heal they dont do that here either herbs are the work of the devils she wasnt easy to convince but i promised her id never mention it then i made her sleep on the divan she seemed both grateful and put upon riga wasnt sure she parsed that but no matter thank you she replied for what not bedding a child i need no thanks for that he sounded annoyed i wish we could help her buy her perhaps father leaned up and back and met her eyes i know you mean well but no her looks make her highly prized you could ask she said i have my share to pledge against the cost he sighed and looked uncomfortable riga his beneficent excellency was struck by your stature and eyes he offered me a sack of saffron and your weight in gold for your hand for his son riga choked and stared wideeyed great gods that was more than both their ships were worth they might do that gross business in five years feeling nervous ripples she asked and you told him i said you were to be betrothed to a wealthy merchant in our lands but his offer was most generous and thoughtful i thanked him for the compliment he paid me as a father and merchant seeing her sunken expression he added riga shes got good food a warm bed and shelter her lot as a free peasant would be no better in this desert it would be worse you cant save everyone remember the birds and the rabbit yes shed tried to save injured animals when younger you stewed them she said accusingly i only stewed them after you tried to save them and they died they were meant for the pot anyway i didnt appreciate it at the time she said erki said if a kossaki treated a woman like that hed be driven from town in disgrace its a strange place you should have been treated better riga im sorry it keeps me humble she said trying for selfdeprecating humor few places gave women the status the kossaki had this place though well tonight we sleep in linen and wool and fur father said we have dried goat and fish berries and nuts ill see about a stew erki said let me father ill be glad to make us some real food he leaned over and added and i promise not to cook any stray pets you find riga she stuck her tongue out you cook i have to help tally the goods the tariffs and the port fees then father can sign it and pretend im just a dumb girl ill pretend nothing he said they can assume whatever they wish under the sail tent riga couldnt sleep the contrast between the beauty and the evil just seemed to make the evil that much more horrifying the girl had been beaten for the slightest of errors because it embarrassed her owner then shed been sent to whore for a guest while still full of welts and crippling bruises that was considered redemption here for the amar that thought decided it for her riga rolled her quilt off carefully slipped to the deck and felt for her boots in minutes she was dressed for her mission and in a way no woman should dare dress in this city that made it both joyous and sobering she could wind up dead for what she planned even if she didnt succeed erki was still and undisturbed and she figured to leave him there he was handsome even asleep and she smiled then she realized there was one thing she needed him for if nothing else she touched him on the shoulder and his eyes snapped open she held a finger to her lips in a shhh and beckoned him to join her he slipped his feet out and fumbled for clothes and gear he was always twitchy and energetic but at least he was silent about it he seemed excited probably because he knew she was up to something would he be agreeable when he found out what though he matched her choice of dull fighting clothes when she pointed he grabbed his sword without hesitation a few minutes later they shimmied over the gunwale and onto the beach none of the crew were awake or had noticed some of them were still in rooms in town in fact and would only return in time to push off she hoped if they were late erki whispered what are we doing were going to rescue that servant girl jesrin you havent discussed this with father have you he asked at once damn the boy no she admitted this is my plan hell thrash us both erki said how will that help her hell thrash us because we deserve it she said that girl got far more than that i didnt say i wouldnt help you he said but how do we keep her from being found with that first part agreed she started creeping across the beach she only has to keep out of sight in our ship the fleet leaves in the morning with luck they wont even start looking this way by then if they do father might just give us to them well be endangering everyone really i thought we were warriors and nations quivered at our mention she said with contemptuous sarcasm not as much as they did long past erki said look im still with you good then stop trying to argue me out of it she said because he was right what she proposed was dangerous foolish and could start a war she also knew it was the right thing to do i swore my warriors oath to protect the weak she said and i didnt swear that it stopped at the edge of our lands the beach was convenient the docks proper had activity at all hours but just a few dozen yards away few people were about only small fishing vessels and the shallowdraft kossaki trade and warships used the beach even when trading the kossaki ported like raiders ready to dart away in moments the two youths flitted through from shadow to shadow their boots were softsoled leather their dull clothes disappeared into the night riga had no sword but she did have her seachs knife she planned to not need it that would mean their mission had failed it was the principle though besides if she did get caught she wanted them to know she was a warrior it also helped her cope with the knowledge that if discovered she would at the least be publicly beaten with canes and heavily fined or rather father would be fined at worst in far less time than she remembered they were at the outer wall of the amars residence the building ran around three sides of a courtyard i know her room is on the left riga said second window from the far end down that alley she cocked an eyebrow how do you know erki blushed even in the dark stuttered and then said shes very pretty i watched her go there she had to smile thats fine good lad she left it at that lead the way right there he pointed she really hoped he was right she also hoped that jesrin was there if the amar had her in his bed or even if she was just doing scullery work of course either would let them return knowing theyd tried or more likely cause me to escalate until we do have a war riga thought she had no illusions about her diplomacy or temper the shutter opened to the fourth peasized pebble once jesrin understood their gestures her eyes grew a foot wide and she shook her head in horror they gestured again come down come with us riga even held up the spare cloak for emphasis it took long minutes while occasional flickers of lamplight in other windows indicated early risers up to bake breakfast or reach the tide before the girl nodded assent erki tossed up a coil of thin strong silk rope and it took more minutes to explain she should loop it around the center post of the window and run it back down riga was worried if jesrin was strong enough to slide down a rope rather than fall but she managed well enough though clearly stiff from some beating or other she bumped the wall and scuffed loose some plaster which made riga cringe perhaps she was being too cautious there was no indication anyone else had noticed she was thankful they didnt like dogs here dogs would have heard and smelled them long before the seconds were hours long as jesrin slipped down the slender rope her layered dress was not practical and would be abraded to shreds before she reached the ground then she slipped and fell erki and riga both rushed forward and caught her and she convulsed in agony at their hands on her beaten back the fall had scraped her knuckles and forehead and she leaned over in the dust and vomited twitched lay still for a moment then twitched again as she woke up through it all she barely uttered a sound erki snatched the rope down as riga gingerly helped her to her feet with the shutters ajar and the rope recovered there was no obvious sign of departure but it was early and father would awaken soon himself they had to move the girl meekly donned the offered hood and tied the cloak around her neck wincing as even that weight touched her abused flesh shed pass as kossaki from a distance but her underdress was clearly servant class and her poise was as submissive as rigas was challenging still that shouldnt matter this way riga said and led the way a moment later erki grabbed her shoulder and stepped in front oh right male must lead she flushed in anger embarrassment and frustration still thats why shed asked him along and he was doing his part well the stout boy they were five streets away when a watchman came around the corner right into their faces who are you he asked riga could puzzle out the words but she couldnt speak had erki paid attention to their lessons and then she knew why she loved her brother annoying as he could be he stepped forward as he did for any problem and showed no reluctance harad of the kossaki he lied and my sisters i return to my uncles ship it is very late the man spoke simply for them but his tone made it clear he wanted an explanation my sister took sick and had to stay with friends we are lucky your gods saw fit to make her healthy in time it was very rude to look at a womans face here but this man was an official he looked as if he was considering doing so and he stared at their feet shes wearing sandals not boots riga realized explain them as locally supplied but she couldnt talk and would erki grasp it under her cloak she gripped the hilt of her seachs in about five heartbeats he was going to find out why she was called sworddancer even if all she had was a knife he looked at erki again said a blessing on you and turned away riga exhaled jesrin whimpered erki didnt twitch at all and he led the way forward it was definitely near dawn and gray as they reached the beach jesrin spoke at last we go on your ship yes quickly riga said gripped her elbow carefullyit might be bruisedand hurried her along some crew were about securing the ships for sea the tents would be down soon then hoisted back up as sails luckily no one paid much attention to three youths erki bounded catlike over the gunwale and pulled at jesrins hands as riga shoved at her hips the girl winced beaten there too but it took practice or help to board the outward curve of a kanr in the dim twilight father was visible at the stern checking the steering oar and ballast before he turned riga shoved jesrin down behind a pair of barrels erki she said and stood as he threw a heavy smelly tarp atop the girl he stood and whispered dont move at all until i say so father came back moving easily around netted crates and barrels he didnt look or act his age and the ship was his domain where have you been he demanded crossly i took a last look at the tiled market to the south she said its so pretty she tried hard to make that sound honest it was something she might have done four years before would father catch that youll have cleaning duty until i say otherwise both of you he replied he looked relieved and annoyed but not angry sorry father she said yes father erki agreed stow the ropes help with the sail bindings and get ready to depart we have a good wind to speed us north by west at once she agreed good shortly theyd be away from this beautiful hell the incoming tide made the ship sway and bob and the wind and the poles inched them down the sand all at once they shifted dragged shifted again and sea fox was back in her realm the crew jumped to the oars and sculled for deeper water they were free peasants hired and paid and riga would bet them against any slave rowers as free men theyd also fight for their master and their pay yet another reason the kossaki traded unmolested the ships were just forming up in line to head out to sea when a bright yellow harbor boat headed for them with a toot of a brass horn they all stopped their departure keeping station in the lapping waves to avoid beaching again the boat drew alongside and some official or other in gleaming white silk accepted a hand aboard behind him was the watchman from the night before and rigas nerves rippled cold may i help you father asked i believe our tariffs are in order he held out a leather book with a stamped sheet from the revenue agent hed paid the tariff riga had calculated and tossed in ten percent as a gift for the temple which meant for the agents pocket all should be in order though riga knew that was not the issue in question my apologies for disturbing you the man said with mock politeness the amar sends his regards and his sadness at losing a fine servant girl we brought no servant girl father said the only woman on my ships is my daughter grom has his wife and girl child aboard his ship ranuldr has his wife and two daughters erki stood alongside riga theyd had the same lesson that to stand firm was better than to cower here they were side by side and would the guard know or mention it if he did erki had changed clothes so he would not be apparent at once would the man recognize riga though but no local man should look at a woman hed seen her earlier but had he seen her she was also in shipboard trews and tunic now leaning on a rigging hook as if it were a spear she stared back at him trying to look quizzical and faintly bored he studied her but it was all pretense he really hadnt noticed the women thered been no real reason to at the time and he wouldnt admit so now riga didnt blame him knowing how the amar might respond he looked hard at erki but without the cloak and in light the boy looked more a man he also didnt show any expression at all though she could sense the nervous shivers she was with a young boy last night what about your boys only erki here father said he was on watch last night i expect your own shore patrol will remember him there are a number of other young men though it depends on what you mean by boy was father lying as a matter of course to get this over with or did he know and was covering for them his words were unbothered the watchman looked erki over but didnt finger him good so far the official asked which girl was sick and stayed in town not mine father said i suppose it could have been ranulds eldest girl shes fifteen all ours are accounted for though were not missing any of course they werent missing any father was deliberately misunderstanding my people are in order do you believe your own are not all your women are as they should be they looked uncomfortable the kossaki ships had canvas weather shields at the rear and little privacy it was understood that one didnt stare or annoy a woman even bathing or changing but that was certainly not understood here the very subject made them cringe and shy away inside riga grinned they were going to back off right now there are few enough that i can count to six father said with a grin riga twitched would he insist on seeing them all i will inspect your cargo and your manifest then as a courtesy riga grimaced as father said if you wish everyone knew something was up at this point they were all just pretending it wasnt he started at the bow peering through the nets and checking the crates for stamps and seals all were as they should be and of course he knew that he moved slowly back to a pile of barrels staked down containing figs tea and spices past the mast and the bundles of sail lashed to the spar father said i dont wish to rush you but we have five ships and tide to keep weve always dealt in good faith ill just work my way back and be done then the official said with a false frown be quick about it i feel sorry for the amar but i have my own dramas and i dont share mine with the help was father trying to cause the man to search in detail that comment flustered him and he checked a barrels number very carefully you might want to check under that tarp its a prime place to stash an escaped servant girl i dont find my own daughter enough trouble so i try to pick one up in every port clutching his tally board the man strode forward again in a careful dignified fashion swung over into his boat and indicated to the rowers to leave he turned back looked at father and said thank you for your help you are most welcome i hope the amar finds this girl and that she hasnt fallen among those who would shame her or him i cherish his hospitality and trade i will tell him the official said beckoning the guard to join him as he sat down on a thwart good travels to you and a blessing a blessing on you and the amar and your king father said as they rowed away he turned and ordered pick up the speed were not earning money to row like a holiday ship he seemed quite relaxed and good natured riga wanted to run back and check under the tarp she knew jesrin was alive though and silence was a good thing it might be night before she could come out it might even be five days and port before she admitted the girls presence she had silly notions of sneaking her ashore with a few coins somewhere she could find good work though she knew the girl like any injured creature would need support for a bit she stood her post and helped tighten the sail as they gained room to maneuver and the five ships spread into a longer line for travel they cleared the headland and entered open ocean the deeper swells swaying sea fox twisting and torquing her she was designed for that though and surged across the waves father came past checking the rigging hows the servant girl he asked quite casually riga knew better than to lie alive and quiet she said at once this is the same servant girl we discussed i assume yes she is jesrin badly bruised in body and spirit damn it daughter this is worse than an injured goose you cant save every helpless creature in the world especially at a risk of war of course not she said then she smiled at him a challenging smile that would yield a flogging in mirr and perhaps start a duel in kossaki lands it was the smile of a merchant and warrior among her peers but i can save

is in daws anthology better off undead what are you doing to that damn kitten jem asked from under the tree his voice laced with laughter ree lay stretched out on a tree branch almost too small to support his weight with his toe claws dug in he stretched his hand as far as he could toward a kitten maybe ten weeks old who in the way of his kind kept just out of reach and fluffed its white and gray fur into a big dandelion puff while emitting ceaseless plangent meows because ree was a hobgoblin changed in the magic storms into something with cat claws cat eyes and the brown fur and tail of a rat he heard the kittens cries in a range humans couldnt hear besides the kittens mother that other damn cat had been adding her own increasedrange pleas to ree to save her baby damn kitten ree stretched his hand to the cowering furball who of course retreated farther out of the way there was only so far ree could stretch and hed be cursed if he was going any further on the frail end of the branch he tried to make the peculiar chirping sound that other damn cat used to call her kittens beneath the tree jem laughed hed grown a lot over the last yearwas now the height of a man and had blond fuzz on his upper lip his voice was changing too to adult man ranges just thinking about it made rees heart turn in him hed been just a hobgoblin like other hobgoblins sometimes hed been more animal than human he thought if hed not found jem if jem hadnt been so convinced ree was human in time ree might have forgotten he was human himself he might have become one of the wild hobgoblinsa beast and nothing more but hed saved jems life and jem ree liked to think it was love or some form of it and that they would be together their whole lives but theyd met really young though neither was that sure of his agenot exactlytheyd been thirteen or fourteen that had been two summers ago and now jem was changing ree knew from when hed been a human among humans that when young men changed a lot of things changed about them not just their appearance and their voices but their manner their ways and sometimes their hearts too as for ree who knew what happened to hobgoblins he didnt think he would change much looking away from jem he turned back to concentrate on the kitten in a storm of flustered mother catlike meowing or at least he hoped it was mother cat like im probably telling the poor thing i want to eat it he thought jems laughter wasnt helping oh ree imagined he looked very funny but all the same if one of the green apples festooning the tree had been within range hed have flung it at jems head even so the kitten didnt seem put off by the laughter it looked at ree with big rounded eyes as ree continued what he hoped were his reassurances of fish and milk for the kitten back at home for a while it looked as though it would back up yet further then suddenly it seemed to make up its mind and charged forward needlelike claws extended it ran lightningfast along the branch and leaped atop ree bracing itself with claws in the space between rees neck and his shoulders rees involuntary shriek only caused the claws to dig in further and jem said now sounding concerned come on down that branch is too thin for you im coming im coming ree said shuffling back uncertainly what did jem think exactly that he wanted to set up a treehouse up here just at that moment there was a crack like thunder and the branch moved beneath him on the ground jem jumped out of the way and yelled ree be careful but it was too late for ree to do anything short of growing wings and that hed missed when the changes had come the branch didnt break it just peeled off the tree ree and all his world tilted down and then he was holding onto the branch and there were other branches flying past him as he fell he tried to grab onto the passing branches with hands and feet all the while trying to secure the kitten with yet another hand even as that damn kitten dug its claws hard into the securing hand it occurred to ree that it might have been a good idea to have been caught near an octopus when the changes came failing wings he could have used another complement of limbs he landed on the ground still atop the branch the force of impact jarred his brain and made him dizzy jem was there trying to help him up jem was taller than ree by a full head now but the look in his eyes was the same as it had been two years ago when hed decided to cast his lot in with ree and that theyd stay together come what may are you all right jems gaze was balm to rees heart he brought the screaming kitten down off his shoulders and put up a hand to prevent jem reaching for it dont touch it that damn kitten is full of needles he put it carefully on the ground where it ran to rub on that other damn cat who hovered nearby and who gave ree a reproachful glance ree sucked on the claw wounds on his fingers gee i rescue her baby and she glares at me youd think shed treat me like a hero jem sidled close smiling but only half joking i think youre a hero isnt that enough for you well it just might be if only he stopped he stopped because having raised his head hed caught sight of something against the sky but it was a good thing he stopped because what could he tell jem if only i werent sure youd grow past and away from me and forget all that lay between us what is it ree never could hide anything from jem the younger boy caught his expressions before anyone else would ree pointed see smoke up there its not cooking fires its darker and it doesnt look right i think its a house burning and look theres another one farther off that means soldiers his chest and stomach tightened soldiers meant trouble he didnt know if it was the empire coming back to make sure everyone paid their taxes and to take away the boys who were old enough to be in the army or if it was one of the bandit lords theyd heard about it didnt matter either would kill him just as theyd kill the wild hobgoblins that haunted the forest that was the law and maybe it was right after all who knew what would happen to ree when jem grew up and moved into the world of men and left ree behind alone with the beasts if there were soldiers coming garrad had to know he was the farmer herean irritable old man whose temper protected a heart big enough to take in a city waif and a hobgoblin when ree and jem had arrived two winters ago if they hadnt found garrad just in time and if he hadnt been willing to shelter them on his farm jem would have died of a horrible persistent cough hed caught after theyd left jacona to be sure garrad would probably have died too as hed injured himself in a fall and been unable to get up and look after himself but all the same even in that situation ree knew most humans would have turned him out garrad taking to jem was easy jem looked enough like him he might have been his grandson taking to ree though what human in his right mind would want to offer shelter to a creature part rat part cat and part human now ree and jem ran to find him jem had the advantage over ree his legs having gotten much longer loping over a cluck of chicks pecking at the dirt and barely avoiding a head on collision with one of the goats ree followed behind his claws digging into the dirt the farm animals scampering away from his path garrad was in the barn with the cows when the boys had come there had been two cows and an old horse and not much else but ree and jem had had to kill some of the wild hobgoblins to defend the farm it wasnt something they talked about they just did it they patrolled the forest and kept the bad or stupid hobgoblins away and killed the ones who wouldnt obey the hobgoblin furs fetched handsome prices as did the herbs and mushrooms they gathered in the forest where villagers from the nearby hamlet of three rivers were afraid to go now they had four milk cows an unruly herd of goats and a donkey the donkey had come straying in from the forest arrived from who knew where she was a yearling wounded and weak perhaps jem had thought she was like him because hed nursed her to health and now he harnessed her to the cart he took down to the village once a week to sell milk and cheese and herbs garrad looked like a prosperous farmer in clothes theyd had made from bought cloth and not homespun and they looked like a prosperous farmers grandsons in all except rees unfortunate modifications granddad jem shouted as he came into the dim cooler barn which smelled of clean animals and fresh milk garrad was sitting on the milking stool milking one of the cows white liquid splashed into a tin bucket he looked up and frowned at them he always frowned but ree had learned to read the expressions and this one was alarm what is it his hand reached for the stick that rested near him jem had carved it to help garrad walk when theyd arrived but now it was used mostly as a pointing tool and a weapon what happened they told him the smoke soldiers garrads thin hawkish face grew grim well then he said if theyre coming they will come there aint much we can do is there not like we can pack up the farm the animals and those damn cats and all and hide out of their way i can go to the forest ree said hed deliberately hung back in the shadows of the barn behind jem a bit and out of garrads line of sight and stay there you know it might make it easier for you easier surely if the soldiers didnt think they were harboring a wild hobgoblin which was as much a capital crime as being a hobgoblin not that ree had ever quite understood how it could be a crime when hed had no control over it garrad snorted and turned back to his milking his movement so jerky that the cow shifted her back leg and gave a low surprised moo you cutting out on your family boy garrad said as he gentled the cow yeah you might have to hide when the soldiers come but not in the forest stay nearby boy we might need you or dont you care there were no words to say how much ree cared so he simply said all right and went to muck out the goats peering through the narrow air slits high up in the barn let ree see garrad leaning on his walking stick so he looked as helpless and inoffensive as a cranky old man could and jem pretended to support him all the way across the field ree didnt think it would help it had taken the soldiers three days to get to the farm and each day smoke pillars had risen up from the valley bringing with them a smell of unclean smoke when he climbed the trees near the farm ree knew the soldiers were burning out places and the column in which they moved grew with long lines of people tied up behind the soldiers slaves or prisoners didnt matter which even children were tied up and dragged along little ones barely able to walk garrad snapped at ree when ree couldnt eat and said they would be all right but it seemed to ree no better than a magic incantation and everyone knew magic wasnt much good anymore jem and garrad approached the soldiersgarrad doing his best to limp jem supporting him solicitously the leader of the soldiers didnt dismount he stayed atop his big gray mare glaring down at them like a man who knows a puton when he sees it he looked like one of those big mean bastards built solid like garrads outhouse and he sized up jem and garrad like a trader checking furs orand the older memory made ree swallow and wipe his hands on his pantslike some of rees mothers customers when they looked at him back when hed still been human before shed shooed him away to avoid his being sold to some of those that preferred boys the commanders metal armor glinted in the sun about half of his soldiers had the same armor the others a mix of metal and leather but all of them had swords and some of them had long bows they werent imperial soldiersthose all had metal armorbut they moved like men whod worked together and knew their strength the big one grinned at jem licked his lips and then looked at garrad before he could say anything a different man rode into rees view this one wasnt a soldier he was dressed like rees idea of a lord only he didnt have a sword instead he had a big leather bag and he held a rolled paper in his hand is this the farm of garrad lenars son he spoke as if he smelled something bad all thin and whiny garrad nodded its my place and youd be the man sniffed we represent the grand duke parleon who owns this land really garrad leaned forward on his cane last i heard it belonged to the emperor emperor melles so i heard a few of the soldiers looked at each other they must not have expected to hear anything about the emperor here times have changed said the unarmored man my lord parleon holds here he unrolled his paper and glared at jem according to the records you have no dependents garrad shrugged that paper of yours is a bit out of date my boy in the imperial army he sent me his son to look after me he nodded to jem hes a good lad a bit sickly for soldiering what with the hacking cough and all but he helps jem was skinny enough but he couldnt disguise his height he couldnt fake a cough either jem was no good at lying the next thing the man said was all about taxes and fines and things but it sounded to ree more like he was looking to plunder as much as he could and was trying to claim as much wealth as the soldiers could carry off it made no sense in jacona the merchants and shopkeepers might complain about imperial taxes but ree had never heard of their taking a mans whole living ree remembered all the people tied up behind the soldiers and wondered if this grand duke just wanted to control everyone so he could have his own friends take the land and live off it without working for it like the bandit lords the traders talked about he must be dressing it in all this talk of tax garrad didnt look happy about it jem held his head down so ree couldnt see his expression when the long list finished the old man grunted go get them snow bear furs out of the barn lad jem left garrad leaning on his stick and rushed into the barn he didnt talk just picked up the three cured furs and carried them off snow bears hobgoblin critters the old man said with a shrug they look sort of like bears and they come down off the forests each winter since the magic storms the soldiers and the official looked startled when they saw the sparkling white fur piled high in jems arms pretty aint they garrad grinned fit for a king id reckon the official ran one hand over the fur how how many do you have we got three over from last winter garrad told him you want to go hunting em forests right there we only ever see em in winter and you cant tell theyre there till they attack something magic in the fur i reckon the official frowned and you kill them garrad snorted one of them comes at you you kill it or it kills you aint saying its easy now a few of the soldiers chuckled ree supposed they understood the man must have decided because he nodded then said that will suffice take the furs and secure them the boy joins us hell be trained and fight in my lords service garrads hands clenched tight and his breath caught hes weakly sick youll be the death of him but the officer ran an eye over jem and grinned strong enough for what he needs to do ree felt sick jem caught the old mans hands in his its all right granddad garrads eyes shut tight i lost one boy to the imperials son i aint losing you too youre not losing me granddad jem hugged garrad and whispered something ree couldnt hear itll be okay he turned to face the big bastard can i get changed and what can i bring with me his voice didnt waver at all ree stayed in the barn trying to be as brave as jem until he heard garrad say theyre gone son aint gonna be back in a while i reckon not with as much as theyve got to carry back to their damned grand duke fellow he looked worse than ree felt all gray and much older than hed been this morning even though ree didnt like to touch the old manit was just wrong him not being humanhe couldnt help wrapping him in a hug before they went back to the chores im sorry granddad i wish he shook his head there wasnt anything they could do he wished for jem back he wished for his humanity back he wished they didnt eat much that night and ree didnt think garrad slept any better than he did he kept thinking of jem and what might be happening to jem and his thoughts made him wake with his claws out and dug into the mattress jem had said garrad wouldnt be losing him were those just pretty words like it will be all right two days later ree saw smoke from three rivers wrong smoke the smoke of something burning once he was through with the milking he told garrad im going down to the village to see if they could use any help he managed a crooked kind of a smile dont worry granddad no ones going to see me unless i want them toill go through the forest and hurried out before the old man could object ree had to do something he couldnt stand just waiting and hoping the soldiers never came back and yet hoping jem did somehow the forest was so familiar it hurt ree had run through here with jem so many times he knew every tree and every meandering pathway he noted the deer paths the signs that there were more this summer than last which meant they might get more antlers this fall and maybe carve some needles and other tools from them there were plenty of burrows too foxes and rabbits and other animals it seemed as though everything was recovering from the horrible year after the change circles and starting to live like normal again everything but the people or maybe it was normal for soldiers to come taking away peoples children and burning down their homes ree didnt know but he didnt think it could be right who would plow the fields and raise the animals and do all the things the cities needed but didnt have space to do themselves this grand duke must be very greedy or very stupid maybe both three rivers village wasnt there anymore ree stood at the edge of the forest looking down at what had been a neat little cluster of homes on the tongue of land where two rivers joined to become a third there was only smoldering ruins his nose twitched and his eyes stung it was far far too quiet as though everything else was scared by the smoke ree was scared too but somehow he found himself running toward the ruins his toe claws digging into soil and hummocky grass and his chest aching not a single house stood vegetable gardens wilted from the heat and all the village animals were gone either taken by soldiers or run away from the burning there were bodies in the street charred things that ree couldnt recognize and didnt want to he shuddered he should never have come had jem seen this done he couldnt think jem would have helped but if jem stayed with them long enough his heart felt cold and shrunken within him like a small thing trying to hide around him cooling timbers creaked and settled the smoke was now more charred wood than charred meat and he was glad for that he shuddered again and his stomach lurched toward his throat the hazy air stung his eyes and made them burn and tear someone whimpered ree followed the sound to one of the ruined houses he edged toward it it had been a big house the thatched roof was gone and the walls had fallen in on themselves in a tangle of wood and sundried brick all of it charred and stark the cellar doors heavy wooden things with metal strapping were still intact although the wood was badly burned someone was crying in the cellar ree hauled the doors open and scurried down into the dark ashysmelling air below he could see the mess of everything that had fallen in from the house but there was a small clear space and a girl of about six huddled by the wall she was trying to cry quietly and not really succeeding theyve gone ree said softly youre safe now she looked up staring at him soot smeared her face and her eyes were wide and full of fear you youre old garrads goblin yep ree didnt go into the town ever only watched from the cover of the forest when jem was there but people had caught glimpses of him and people always talked you think hed keep something dangerous just as the kitten had she watched him with big eyes trying to decide if he was dangerous he thought of the burned bundles in the street and of jem taken away by the people whod done this and he wasnt sure he couldnt be very dangerous he had to do something but what mama put me here so the soldiers mama she cried big wrenching sobs ree sighed and picked her up she didnt weigh much and hed carried jem before and he was stronger than someone his size should be but hed hurt if he had to carry her far she buried her face in his shirt and kept right on crying in the end those damn kittens calmed the girl down three of them had crept into her lap purring and tumbling and shed calmed enough watching them to tell ree and garrad her story she was the youngest child of the village mayor and named amelie like her mother mama had put her in the cellar because she thought her being so pretty might tempt the soldiers but the soldiers had taken everyone and burned everything and mama shed eaten some stew petted those damn kittens and finally fallen into an exhausted sleep ree and garrad had gotten her into a makeshift bed under the eaves then come back to sit by the fire all of em garrad asked softly ree nodded jem he said his hands clenched his claws extending and digging into his palms he saw it hell see it hell get used the old man nodded and sighed i dont know what to do son he closed his eyes seems like no matter which way we turn theres damn soldiers in the way yeah ree might be able to survive in the forest but not as a person here he belonged hed helped make that chair and the matching one where he sat there was new plaster in the bedroom that hed put on and the roof was weathertight because of the many times hed been up there fitting new shingles and looking for ones too old and dried out to use any more his humanity was tied to these and to jem in the kitchen cooking and to garrad making jokes about teaching jem to shave because he couldnt call both of them fur face why didnt one of the bad hobgoblins like the snow bears go after the soldiers and kill them all and let jem escape back home but that wasnt right if they were grabbing boys like jem that meant a lot of the soldiers were boys like jem and besides if there was one thing ree knew all the way from jacona before the changes it was that you didnt sit around waiting for someone to solve your problems for you that reminded him of the way hobgoblins were hunted how much they scared people in the city where they had guards and soldiers to protect them wouldnt people out here be even more scared of creatures like him granddad you remember when we arrived here garrad looked away from the fire and gave him a sharp look it had to irk the old man to remember how helpless hed been you were scared of me because im a hobgoblin right and you couldnt stop me he remembered garrads frightened eyes a little life crept back into the old mans face i remember all right how scary do you think a hobgoblin could be at night garrad laughed that short harsh bark of a laugh that seemed to dare the world to argue with him pretty damn scary i reckon ree crept toward the soldiers camp his heart and chest tighter than a misers pocket his fur prickled with every hint of breeze he moved by animal instinct stealthily hed never thought thered be a day when hed thank the little gods for being part cat and part rat hed taken off his clothes and hidden them in the forest not far from where the soldiers camped this was just himself and his claws and a lantern to use later one of the soldiers walked past boots stomping within inches of rees face he held his breath until the man moved on before he inched forward again every sound he made seemed unnaturally loud every rustle of grass and trickle of dirt like an avalanche his breath was like thunder to his ears but the soldiers didnt hear him and didnt see him he found jem lying pale faced and exhausted wrapped in a thin blanket ree guessed they worked the boys hard but there was no excuse for the big bruise darkening one side of his face and the way he lay huddled as if afraid he wasnt the only boy like that and the soldiers must have been scared theyd run away because they tied all the boys up at night the same as their prisoners soil and grass slid under rees stomach and tickled his nose just as well it was night because he could see much better than any human he hoped he could scare them so they ran all the way back to their fancy grand duke and never ever came back ree slid his way to jem and up alongside him carefully he started to untie jems hands the way jem started when he woke and bit back a scream made ree choke on anger ree jem barely breathed his name theyll kill you were leaving we all are when hed decided that ree didnt know but he wasnt leaving anyone for those bastards not even if he had to kill again he gestured with his head can you get them free jem nodded his lips went tight and his eyes narrowed he looked so like garrad that rees eyes burned good warn them about me what are you going to do ree grinned what do you think big terrifying hobgoblin come to eat them for dinner ree shielded the lamp before he lit it it was one of the old ones from when there was magic with glass behind the metal shutters and a lighter that you pushed to make a spark there wasnt any magic in the lamp but it had taken a mage to make the lighter the click of the lighter seemed awfully loud none of the soldiers heard it ree wiped his hands on his fur he was sweating and his skin prickled he had to scare the soldiers so much they left their captives where they were he cupped his hands to his mouth and let out a hollow roar that could have come from one of the snow bears soldiers stumbled up and moved a bit like bees only with torches and weapons and looking for something to kill ree caught the handle of the lantern with his claws and raced to the next place hed chosen a cluster of boulders not far from the woods he let loose a second roar before hed come to a stop then darted back into the woods to get to his third place another roar sounded this one from the other side of the soldiers rees heart jumped in his chest then he grinned jem must have decided to help the ruin of an old building was rees stage all that was left of it was half a wall that he could stand on he hung the lantern and unshielded the side he needed then stepped into its light the effect on the soldiers was better than hed dared to hope they cringed from his hugely magnified shadow a whole chorus of roars erupted some of themto ree anywaysounding like they came from little children ree breathed in deeply and bellowed making his voice big begone this is my territory he didnt expect them to break and run right then but they did maybe the shadows from the rest of the ruins made him look scarier or maybe it was all the howls and roars coming from everywhere around the camp there were a few screams too men not women or boys ree dropped back out of the light and shielded the lantern and tried to ignore the way his stomach knotted up if some of the people whod been chased out of their homes and hurt wanted to pay back some well it wasnt any business of his he leaned against the ruined wall shuddering this wasnt over not by a long way a shape loomed out of the shadows a meaty hand grabbed for rees throat he ducked aside gulping it was the big one the commander rees lips drew back in a snarl and he launched himself at the soldier the man wasnt in his armor just a shirt and pants but he had a sword in his right hand that wouldnt matter if ree was right up close he caught the mans shoulders digging his claws in while he arched his back so he could get his legs up and use the toe claws where it would hurt most the big bastard made a sound that might have been a scream and ree heard metal hit stone his nose wrinkled at the mans smell of sour beer and worse his toe claws got a grip dug in the man grabbed at rees chest trying to pull him away that let ree use his right hand to dig his claws into the mans eyes his throat the big mans choking scream died to a horrible gurgling noise and he pitched forward ree scrambled to pull away from him and bit back a yelp when he found the mans sword the hard way his feet might be tougher than a humans but they werent horn he stumbled away from the wall and loose stone and collapsed gasping his foot stung there he is ree halfscrambled upright before he realized it was jems voice a moment later boysor maybe young men ree wasnt suresurrounded him caring nothing for his fur or for anything but that he was hurt and that hed freed them the chatter while they unshielded the lamp and bandaged him made him want to be sick he hadnt thought it would be that bad theyll come back he said when the young men quieted down a little maybe not those ones but others those wont be back jem sounded grimly amused they dropped all their weapons people gathered now women and children and some older men who ree guessed werent fit enough to be put into the army they werent scared of him and they werent treating him like some kind of wild animal what happens when others come then ree demanded more of them because of the terrible army of hobgoblins that chased those away it didnt matter that the terrible army was a handful of youngsters making noises that wasnt what the grand duke would hear instead of fixing things hed made them worse jem frowned but he looked stubborn and determined not angry weve got their stuff all of it we can fix things so we can keep them away he smiled youll help ree right youll be the fearsome hobgoblin king for us ill help he couldnt say anything else really not when hed made sure thered be trouble granddads going to complain but i guess we can feed everyone until stuff can be rebuilt ree bit his lip maybe make walls out of the places they burned and traps and things well manage jem said with a nod come on lets go home it wouldnt be easy ree thought boys who were just about old enough to be men frightened women and children whod lost everything they knew no one was complaining though maybe they were just glad to be alive as he and jem had been that first night after escaping jacona it hadnt mattered then that they had nothing except each other now they had something to protect something to fight for but they still had each other ree caught jems determined look and jem smiled well look after them ree like we look after each other jem looked like a man like a young garrad men protected and helped those in need men cleaved to their friends and their promises yeah ree said his heart suddenly easy despite the danger ahead yeah we will matters of the heart by sarah a hoyt sarah a hoyt was born in portugal a mishap she hastened to correct as

number of short stories in magazines ranging from isaac asimovs science fiction magazine to dreams of decadence forthcoming novels include darkship thieves and more three musketeers mystery novels she currently lives with her family in colorado hello the house ree jumped when the unfamiliar voice bellowed outside the farm gates as a hobgoblin having got himself mixed up with a cat and a rat during change circle he was proscribed in most places here too though the people who lived near garrads farm had gotten used to him and didnt fear him in fact since hed helped them escape the soldiers who had come last summer and burned most of the farms around here ree had no fear of being seen except by strangers he dropped the shovel hed been using to muck out the goat stalls and pushing aside the goats walked out of the stall locked it then walked out of the barn and across the farmyard to where he could get a view of the gate last weeks snow coated the ground in a thin brittle shell that crackled under the new boots that hid rees nonhuman feet the air had a cold dry taste tinged with the smell of wood fires that meant it was going to stay below freezing even if the sun was out rees breath steamed and he wrapped his arms close around his body the new wall protecting the farm was about seven feet tall too tall to see pastit was taller than jem and topped with sharp bits of stone and metalbut the iron gate the village ironmonger had done for them in gratitude was big enough to let the donkey and cart through and they didnt go outside the farm or the forest without weapons or on their own any more it was also made of vertical shafts like spears and you could see between them and if you took care to stay kind of to the side of the wall as you looked no one could see you the three men outside the gate were definitely strangers all of them on horses good horses too which to ree were horses no one in the region could possibly affordtall of leg and sturdy the man at the front wore fancy armor the kind ree remembered imperial officers wearing and had what looked like a brand new red cloak over his shoulders he looked about forty blond and bearded with that hardened look all soldiers got sooner or later and he looked angry who is it ree jem whispered hed come running from where hed been near the chicken coop and skidded to a stop near ree hed gotten a bit taller since last summer but mostly hed put on muscle filling out to match his height sometimes ree felt like a child beside him even though ree was older but then no one knew how ree was supposed to grow he was a hobgoblin after all part cat part rat and part human changed by the magic storms jem might treat him like a human and garrad the old man whose farm this was and whod become a kind of grandfather to both of them and who looked enough like jem to be his real grandfather even little amelie whom ree had found after soldiers burned three rivers last summer and whose parents had been killed treated ree like a human but no one else did they accepted him even were grateful for the way hed scared off the soldiers but his fur and the tail he kept tucked in his pants and his claws and cateyes made him different too different to be one of them three soldiers they dont look like the other ones that came last year ree whispered back as jem leaned into him partly trying to see around him and partly probably instinctive protection against the bitter cold he indicated the gate but theyre not happy and blondie out there is getting ready to break things if he doesnt get an answer soon jem nodded he narrowed his eyes at the gate listened to the way the big man was bellowing and got what ree thought of as his garrad look it was the stubborn no one makes me do anything look and it usually meant trouble ree had seen it a lot while they helped keep people fed and rebuilt three rivers and put a wall around the village so soldiers couldnt easily burn it out again jem had been a scared little thing when ree had saved his life on the streets of jacona just about three years ago but he was almost a man now and while he would help those who needed it he did it on his own terms and refused to be pushed around no matter how much bigger or older those doing the pushing might be granddads plucking the old rooster jem said his voice slightly louder hell be out as soon as hes done meanwhile ill deal with them he walked up to the gate as calm as if he were going to talk to young men from the village the blond fellow didnt wait for jem to speak the moment he could see someone he demanded where is garrad and who are you jem folded his arms on his chest tilted his head up and gave the blond a frosty look until you tell me who you are its none of your damn business who i am or where he is stranger ree heard the sharp catch of breath and the creak of leather that meant the mans massive fists were clenched tight enough to strain his gloves get this thing open now before i break it down jem smiled a little the blacksmith had put special care into the lock and into the forging of that gate and had told them that it would withstand a small group of soldiers go right ahead and try jem ree garrads came from behind them with the short breath that meant hed been running ree turned to see the old man hurrying toward them his walking stick the one jem had carved for him two years back thumping into the ground with every step he really didnt need the stick most of the time but the cold made the ground slippery and garrad was all too aware of what falls could do at his age when theyd met him hed been rendered helpless by one such fall whats going on out here ree had been looking at the blond and thought he noticed a startled jump at their names but it was nothing to the way blondies face seemed to melt out of its harsh lines and his voice softened at the sight of garrad father father it could be the old mans son had been conscripted by the emperors army years ago garrad rocked on his feet and ree raced to steady him while jem kept on giving the blond man his coldest glare lenar garrad waved ree offwith the walking stick so ree had to jump out of the wayand scurried to the gate gods be praised it is you he fumbled with the lock that held the locking bar down and nodded to jem get the gate open and let him in lad ree helped jem with the gate lifting the heavy bar while jem hauled it open the blond man lenar gave them a disdainful look and the other two men got closer to the blond and started to draw their swords when they saw ree but they looked at lenar before they drew them out all the way lenar didnt even see them look he jumped off his horse and hugged garrad so hard he lifted the old man off his feet if garrads eyes were a bit too bright well ree didnt have to say hed seen it not that garrad would ever admit to it anyhow jem caught the horses reins while ree closed the gate behind the other two men having his back to them made his skin itch and his fur try to rise but if this was garrads son then this farm was his it wasnt up to ree to be inhospitable to lenar or his guards not so close now youll break something garrad protested and he disguised his wavering voice with a cough now come on inside and tell me whats brought you back home and all that happened to you all these years lenar sounded grim when he said not so fast father what are you doing with a hobgoblin and some other brat here who are they ree got the gate barred and turned in time to see lenar posed just as jem had been shortly before trading glares with garrad garrad grinned grimly as though this were a game he was used to boys you get them horses looked after you hear the rest of you come on inside out of the cold and then well talk taking all the gear off the horses and stacking it neatly near the barn door took a while and rubbing the horses down and getting them fed and watered took longer jem didnt say anything and ree couldnt think of anything to say theyd never talked about it but ree had always figured garrad assumed his son had died hed never expected anyone to come back and jem made a kind of a replacement he wondered where the sons return left them oh jem looked enough like garrad to really be his grandson but they didnt know and ree wasnt anything anyone would want he was useful maybe but that was all a tame pet garrads goblin and little amelie was just another one of their group of waifs that garrad looked after and tolerated shed lightened up some since ree had brought her here but men scared her and a harsh word from anyone except garrad got her tearing up and clutching at her skirts as though someone were going to do something horrible to her any time ree had only ever seen her smile around the damn young catsthey were too big now to be damn kittens although he suspected next spring thered be more damn kittens to make garrad grumble were all of them surplus now that garrads lost heir was back as if thinking about them was a cue ree felt a brush of air then a solid thump on his shoulder he winced and bit down on a yelp when claws dug in the young damn cats never could remember that his fur wasnt as thick as theirs the horse he was brushing down didnt seem to care that it now shared its stall with a hobgoblin and a cat or that the cat was complaining to ree in a thoroughly put out tone yes yes ree said hurriedly your mama doesnt catch enough rabbits and mice are boring that doesnt mean you have to complain so much the damn young cat added rees indifference to the list of complaints and ree paused long enough to pluck it from his shoulder and set it on the floor of the barn it was the gray and white one hed rescued from a tree last summer of all the damn young cats this one was the one that got into the most trouble and had to be rescued most often jem came into the stall grinning damn cats he said anyone would think you enjoyed having them climb all over you ree finished with the horse and gave the animal a friendly pat before he left the stall yeah i know portable tree for damn cats thats me jem was worried for all he tried to hide it and ree didnt think he was hiding things any better wed better go protect amelie jem caught rees hand for a moment in his now larger calloused hand dont worry ree whatever happens weve always got each other and when have we ever needed anyone else it seemed to ree the house was colder inside than it was out in the snow what with lenars two companionsguards actually since he was an officer and hed been given a title and enough imperial gold to buy an estate anywhere he likedwatching ree as if they expected him to try to eat someone and lenar glaring at jem ree and amelie ree didnt understand why the damn cats made it worse but they did and lenar practically accused garrad of having gone soft in the head letting those damn cats have the run of the house to which garradwho complained about the cats all the timehad responded that the cats were homey and friendly and got rid of vermin a treat even the fact that jem was doing the cooking quietly getting smoked meat from the cellar to supplement what had been planned as a simple meal of bread and vegetable soup seemed to set lenar off it appeared that cooking was womans work and garrad should have hired a wench from the village and not have this boy do such things to which garrad had boomed that jem cooked better than any wench hed ever met it was true but hardly a point to argue over stubborn and loud sure did run in that family cmon amelie lets get beds made up for our guests ree said poor kid had been sitting in the corner clutching a damn cat and was white and terrified she ran to him putting a sweaty hand in his and sniffling back tears might as well get her away from what would be a huge fight garrads lips were set and thin and he had the full stubborn on him without the beard lenar would have been just like him only younger and jem was as bad as both of them together cutting into the smoked meat and glaring at lenar as if he wished he were hacking into the soldier amelie clutched rees hand until they were out in the main room and she needed both hands to climb up the ladder to the loft her room was up there tucked in under the eaves but ree figured hed make up the other bed in the room he shared with jem anyway amelie would feel safer downstairs with lenar and his guards in the house he pulled out quilts and sheets and blankets from the chests in the bedrooms enough to make up three beds and tossed them up to amelie then climbed up after her what do you think mama melie should we give them straw beds or make them sleep on the floor she brightened a little showing the prettiness her mother had tried to protect when shed shoved her in the cellar to escape the raid of the soldiers at six she should have been too young to be in danger but theyd learned no one was too young they should have proper beds ree amelie wagged a finger at him it wouldnt be right to make them sleep cold he grinned and winked sides if we make them nice comfy beds theyll sleep all night and theyll only wake you up when they curse about having to go to the outhouse she covered her mouth with her hands almost as if she were scared to smile dont we have a spare pot for three of them we dont have one big enough there was always fresh straw up here keeping it fresh was one of the jobs that was never finished the straw in the loft kept winter cold from seeping in through the roof and stuffed the mattresses and cushions it got used for kindling as well they kept what they werent using at either end of the house farthest from the chimney in the middle of the loft and since amelies arrival ree and garrad had partitioned off a room for her near the chimney ree saw no reason not to put the mens beds as far from amelies room as they could even if amelie wouldnt be sleeping there though it meant bringing a lantern around so they could see to pull the straw together and tuck sheets around it so each man had a more or less comfortable bed the thick sheets would stop any straw poking through and with blankets and quilts they should sleep warm the room was amelies and he didnt want them wandering into it by accident not that she had much there just a couple of cloth dolls and the few shifts theyd found in the ruins of her once prosperous home good enough do you think he asked when he and amelie were done she nodded but she looked scared and her hands were plaiting her little pinafore tell you what ree said you sleep in our room tonight all right in the other bed ill make it up for you with strangers in the house and the way jem was looking nothing untoward was going to happen in that room tonight anyway ree saw the relief in her eyes and wondered she had told him she spied through the cellar lock onto the destruction of her home but he didnt know what had happened her father and brothers had been killed her mother had been killed too but it probably hadnt been that simple amelie might carry the scars her whole life he felt toward her as to a little sister or perhaps a daughter though that was an abomination of course as he could never have children and certainly not human children hobgoblins didnt they lived wild until someone or something killed them most of the ones ree had seen were alone the only things like them except for the snow bears of course maybe several bears got caught in the same magic circle and then bred but there seemed to be lots of those there was a kind of wolf creature that bred too and hunted in packs ree hoped theyd never see any of those again they were nastier than the snow bears and there were more of them but most of the hobgoblins were the only ones and couldnt breed with anything even if they wanted to he didnt want to all he wanted was jem and they already had amelie to look after after a dinner eaten in silence while garrad lenar and jem traded cold looks ree excused himself and left to put amelie to bed he made up the spare bed with fresh sheets and obligingly turned his back while she changed out of her day clothes into a nightdress of soft wool that jem had bought her once she was tucked in he folded her clothes for her and set her boots at the foot of the bed then blew out the lantern he and jem knew the room well enough to come in here without any light at all and it wasnt that dark rees cateyes could see everything from the patched plaster to the chests of bedding he closed the door softly and padded toward the kitchen hed just tell garrad good night and go to bed but halfway through the great room he heard jems voice not going to put it down it is ree and hes saved all our lives ree froze as lenar growled backsounding like garrad when he was angry or hurt that thing isnt safe damn it none of them are they turn on their owners or you find dead men in alleys with their throats torn out for a moment ree couldnt breathe dead men in alleys with their throats torn out the memory returned to him gods above hed only been trying to protect himself and then hed found jem and realized what the bastard had been doing he couldnt regret killing that man it had brought jem into his life and jem had called back the human part of him and stopped him from being all animal some men hurt and kill other men for fun jem said in that cold voice that meant he was so angry he was shaking you dont kill every man because of it you dont kill every dog because someone tormented or starved one until he turned its not a man and its not an animal lenar said stubbornly its a magicmade unnatural thing sos that lamp up there son garrad said you going to destroy it too lenar made a sound of disgust sure it hoodwinked you too no wonder theyre talking about hobgoblins ruling here and making the people their slaves ree didnt know whether to laugh or cry the trick hed used to scare the soldiers away using everyones fear of hobgoblins to make them think he was a terrible creature who was ready to eat them right there had stopped other people trying to bring soldiers in and it made garrads son think hobgoblins were secret lords here i aint hoodwinked boy ree has lived here for two years hes as human as you and i fur face or not lenar didnt get a chance to answer because jem started his voice tight with fury you think your fathers an idiot you think hed let something dangerous stay with him he was on a right tear and he was going to say what he thought no matter what gods above i love ree ree and i were closer than brothers and always will be hes never hurt me and hes gotten hurt for me im no idiot and i dont think anyone could be that close to someone for more than two years and not know who they really are and if animal or man rees throat tightened and his chest hurt his eyes burned so much he had to blink to keep them clear jem couldnt know what he was saying or how a man like lenar would react he couldnt his pride in their love made his heart want to burst but he was afraid now theyd both be thrown out into the cold night lenar made a choked sound then a disgusted one what do you know about love boy that is not only male its not even human youd better believe rees human jem snarled hes better than damn near all men ive ever seen jem stomped from the kitchen in full high and mighty temper very pointedly not slamming the kitchen door and walked past him not seeing him in the dark of the great room after the light of the lantern in the kitchen before ree could speak jem opened the door to their bedroom and went inside closing the door softly behind him ree closed his eyes he should go to bed too the chores would still be there tomorrow and no matter what garrads son thought about him stalls still needed mucking out and cattle needed milking garrad would probably be kept busy with his son so it would be ree doing the milking and he doubted lenar or his fancy guards would do any of it so theyd better think twice about throwing him or jem out or amelie for that matter garrads voice echoed calmer and full of dry amusement you aint making a good showing of yourself son lenar sounded as though he felt a bit guilty when he said i know father i shouldnt he cleared his throat the thing is i think your jem might be my son i thought he might be garrad said your byblow or my brothers only my brother was never that much interested in women you know ree raised his eyebrows wondering how lenar would respond to that but lenar just sounded resigned i got married in jacona nearly seventeen years ago now i thought i was going to be posted there until i was old enough to retire i was already an officer i was going to bring her to see you as soon as i got leave pretty little merchants daughter myrrine he made a sound half sob half laugh she was expecting when my division was sent south to deal with a minor uprising we were going to call my son jem after her late father we were gone nearly five years and when i came back i couldnt find her there was real pain in his voice real anguish nothing i did i thought she must have died and the baby it was a miracle for him to get here somehow and hes attached himself to that thing how can he be happy with that how can he not want a family children of his own he paused do they do they sleep together theres two beds in that room garrad said and they use one but it aint none of my business and its not yours either son leastways unless they tell you garrad just sounded matteroffact when he said they aint said much about it but i reckon ree saved jem from a lot worse than just dying back in that city theres a look jem gets sometimes and when hes sick he talks in his sleep and some of what he says would curdle your blood a short silence as though garrad shrugged and when jem talks in his sleep and calls his mama sometimes he says myrrine then he is mine lenar said hes all i got he cant live with thatthatill never have grandchildren and youre all i got and i thought you were dead garrads dry amusement came back did you have him because you wanted to have grandchildren no i was young i youre still young son and even if you werent it dont justify making jem into something he aint sides ree and jem ree brought jem in and jem was dying of consumption ree risked getting killed so he could bring jem in to get help and then he helped me too id tripped and fallen on that damn rug your mother made and ree nursed me and jem both then they both worked hard as any ten men to get the farm back working again fact is if you were to kick them out tonight id have to sell most of my animals and give them the money they bought those animals with the furs of the creatures they killed in the forest and they never asked for anything its not right father lenar insisted its just not i mean its not like i didnt see enough of it in the army but with an animal ree aint an animal ree couldnt listen any more there was too much and all it made him think was that lenar was right who knew when the animal would take over he padded across to the bedroom and slipped inside jem sounded like he was asleep and amelie too the old painting on the wall of garrad and his brother when theyd been young made ree think about families and how he couldnt have one not of his body nor would jem as long as they were together the two young men in the old picture looked happy and relaxed and so like jem it hurt ree felt as if something inside him had frozen carefully he removed his clothes all of them even the boots with their warm felted lining jem belonged here it was ree who was in the way ree who would be a problem for them all the time ree who would make jems life difficult he touched jems face where it curved in the moonlight and felt the closeshaved blond beard the idea of never touching jem again never seeing jem again made him hurt deep inside but it was just him he was a hobgoblin they had no real feelings not like people ree get in bed jem said and smiled a little but he didnt wake up not fully he didnt move as ree left the room ree had forgotten how miserable cold he could get even through his fur he ached with it and his feet hurt with each step on the frozen ground instead of going far into the forest he curled in one of the abandoned burrows near the farm he shivered and dozed till first light and then he thought he should hunt a rabbit he thought they were sort of a fuzzier smell than cats and not musky like foxes he was starving but he remembered how nasty raw rabbit was and it made his stomach clench and bitter bile come to the back of his throat some wild hobgoblin he was hobgoblins did not use fire they were animals but his stomach refused to believe him and he knew better than to force it later when he was hungry enough hed managed before hadnt he there wasnt any reason he couldnt do it again let garrad and lenar and jem be a family without him in the way there were enough places to hide and not be seen if anyone came looking for him his feet were so cold they hurt and he felt every stone and fallen branch underfoot his toe claws kept catching on frozen ground until he thought hed wrenched them and no matter how hard he told himself it was better for everyone this way and hed get used to living wild he couldnt make himself believe it he already missed jem it was a relief when the long lonely day faded to darkness and he could find an empty burrow and try to sleep a scream sounded startling ree awake someone was in trouble ree scrabbled from the burrow and raced toward the scream he ran blindly through the trees then stopped lenar was ahead of him fighting something something invisible a snow bear ree approached carefully he wouldnt be able to see it unless he was right up close or it got in front of something dark though lenar knew how to use his sword the creature was bigger and stronger than he was and would kill him and eat him it took two people to kill snow bears he and jem hunted together as he thought this he had launched himself toward the creatures back ree scrambled to climb up digging his finger and toe claws into the snow bears fur while it swung wildly trying to dislodge the annoyance blood sprayed over the snow shockingly red against white he wrapped one arm around the creatures head going by feel to get his claws into its eyes it howled in agony rearing to its full height lenar struck his sword went all the way into the snowbears chest and came out the back nearly skewering ree as well ree jumped off and rolled to the side while the creature collapsed in the time it took him to climb to his feet and shake snow off his fur lenar had pulled his sword free and was staring at the snow bear with a grimace he glared up at ree damn fool old man was out at first light chasing after you he said if theres more like this hes probably got himself killed and that damn stubborn young pup with him lenar wiped his sword on the snow bear i came looking for them both he gave ree another sharp look that thing was waiting for me they do that ree looked around hoping that there would be tracks something he could use to find jem and garrad you cant even smell the damn things it was too confused here with the snowbears musk and blood but a little farther on he saw the rounded hole of garrads walking stick and two sets of footsteps this way lenar didnt say anything else but he didnt argue with ree leading only gave him more of those long searching looks youre like no hobgoblin ive seen he said no ree said you see jem thinks im human he i think he made me human hes so stubborn it sounded dumb but ree didnt really care what lenar thought he had to find jem and garrad and get them home safe when he heard snarls in the distance he started to run it didnt sound like snow bears more like the wolf things that was bad lenar kept up with him ree couldnt run too fast over the rough ground lenar didnt answer when ree told him about the wolf things and how the best way to stop them was to kill the queen bitch because she ruled the pack and theyd be lost if she died the queen bitch was always the biggest one sometimes twice as big as the others and she was usually all white where the rest of the pack were gray and white jem and garrad were back to back jem using a pitchfork and garrad his walking stick to keep the pack off them the pack was playing still wearing them down for the kill ree slammed into the pack throwing one of the smaller wolf creatures aside the smaller ones were maybe hip high at the shoulder long and lean with jaws that could crack bones and wicked curved teeth the queen was almost as tall as ree and more muscular than her packmates that didnt stop ree from jumping on her and holding on with his knees and toe claws while he scrambled for her eyes with one hand and her throat with another he had gotten a good hold when one of the creatures crashed into him and they all went tumbling ree felt flesh tear under his fingers and at the same time he realized that his back and side hurt the damn wolf goblin must have clawed him it wasnt moving now though the pack ran fast deep into the woods theyd be harmless until they found another queen it took him a while to pull himself free what with his claws tangled in the pack queens fur and flesh and trying not to get the other hobgoblins claws any deeper into him when he moved ree shuddered he forced himself to look at jem and garrad they werent hurt garrad stood and leaned on his walking stick breathing heavily while jem and lenar made sure that the wolf queen was indeed dead garrad glared at him what possessed you to run off like that ree ree swallowed i dont belong it was harder than he thought to say that i jem should have children he doesnt need me youre a stubborn proud young cuss is what you are seems to me that kind of stubborn is right at home in my family garrad sounded more like his normal self now what about jem then do you know how much he missed you just one day did you ask him if he needed you but youve got your family now why would you want me why would anyone want him really he might turn bad forget being human even though he didnt want to youre going to tell me who my family is now boy garrad asked looking stubborn youre family if i say you are and now lenar was glaring at him he still looked furious but somehow it was all different familys people who look after each other and fight for each other too he shook his head and i guess love each other he pushed jem toward ree help your young man son he needs to get those wounds seen to as jems arm came around him supporting him ree could swear jem said under his breath my damn stubborn young man it was the best thing hed ever been called nothing better to do by tanya huff tanya huff lives and writes in rural ontario with her partner fiona patton and nine cats one more and they officially qualify as crazy cat ladies her twentyfifth novel the enchantment emporium a standalone urban fantasy was recently published by daw books in her spare time she practices barre chords instead of painting the bathroom jors stiffened in the saddle head cocked he could hear bird song the wind humming in the upper canopy leaves and twigs rubbing together as percussion small animals moving in the underbrush chosen gervais turned to stare back over his shoulder with one sapphire eye i thought i heard a baby crying out here it was a good question they were more than a days ride from harbert on a path that would lead by the end of the day to a new settlement set up by three foresting families whod been given a royal charter to harvest this section of the wood besides the usual responsibilities of a herald on circuit jors had specific instructions to make sure they werent exceeding their charter jors had never met one of the near legendary hawkbrothers wouldnt actually mind meeting a hawkbrother and had less than no desire to meet a hawkbrother because a forester had gotten greedy and begun cutting outside the territory theyd been granted hed grown up in such a settlement his family still lived in one and he knew exactly how tempting it could be to harvest that perfect tree just on the edge of the grant and then the tree just beyond that go far enough just beyond in this particular corner of valdemar and problems became a lot more serious than reestablishing the boundaries between feuding families an infuriated shriek pulled jors from his reflections and sent a small flock of birds up through the canopy wings drumming against the air there did you hear it given that i havent gone deaf in the last ten paces yes chosen i heard it but that didnt sound like an infant no jors had to admit it did not whatever it is it sounds furious and if theres also a baby as gervais picked up his pace jors readied his bow he was reasonably proficient with a swordhe wouldnt be riding courier if he werentbut even the weapons master agreed there were few currently in whites who could match his skills as an archer it came from wanting to eat while growing up as foresters depended on the woods for most of their meat small game large by the time gervais had appeared outside the palisade with twigs tangled in his mane and an extraordinarily annoyed expression on his face jors had learned to place his arrows where theyd do the most good but there were predators in the woods as well and it wasnt unusual for the hunters to find themselves hunted by something just as interested in a meal i smell smoke jors flattened against the pommel as gervais took them off the main track onto what might have been a path might have been a dry water channel either way branches had not been cleared for a man on horseback he could smell the smoke now too but it wasnt the heartstopping scent of leaves and twigs and deadfall going up it was more pungent slower familiar charcoal burner he said just as they emerged into a clearing there the expected cone of logs over the firepit there the expected small well in all honestly hut was probably the kindest description a little unexpected to see three scruffy chickens in a twig corral by the hut but eggs were always welcome completely unexpected to see the halfnaked toddler straining to reach the firepit held back by a leather harness around his plump little body and a rope tied to a cedar stake the toddler turned to face the herald and his companion tiny dark brows drew in muddy fists rose and he shrieked in rage well gervais said after a long moment its a baby im not i dont he sighed and swung out of the saddle the toddler stared at him in what could only be considered a highly suspicious manner and shrieked again hey there little fellow jors kept his voice low and nonthreatening as he would when approaching a strange dog and hed rather be approaching a strange dog two strange dogs a pack of strange dogs hed know exactly what he had to do to rescue this child from a pack of dogs he just wasnt sure what he was supposed to do with a child alone i doubt hes going to bite jors realized the fingers on his outstretched hand were curled safely in but you dont know that for sure he muttered as he uncurled them its okay little guy were not going to hurt you were here to help blue eyes widened as the toddler stared past him leaning against the support of the harness he scrambled around about twenty degrees of the circle the rope allowed him until he faced jors hands reaching out and grabbing at the air ossy ossy glancing back jors thought gervais looked as confused as he felt ossy horsey he thinks youre a horse the shrieking picked up a distinctly proprietary sound interspersed with something that could have been me or could have been random eee noises jors wasnt sure come a little closer and see if hell quiet down the noises changed to happy chortling as gervais moved slowly and carefully close enough for the toddler to throw himself around one of the companions front legs it wasnt exactly quiet but it was definitely quieter hes sticky is that normal jors wondered heading for the hut how should i know the young stallion sounded slightly put out and then a little panicked chosen where are you going to look for his parents they cant be far if they were jors intended to have a few official words with the sort of people whod wander off leaving their child tethered to a stake in the deep woods might as well tether out a sacrificial goat and speaking of goats as he came up to the hut he could see a bored looking nanny staring at him from the back of the chicken corral jaws moving thoughtfully around a mouthful of greenery the fodder in the pen still green and unwilted suggested the parents were he froze one hand on the stretched hide that covered the opening to the hut chosen i heard moaning he found the charcoal burner no more than ten feet out from the clearing pinned to the ground by the jagged end of a branch through his chest jors could do a field dressing as well as any herald maybe better than a few as he spent so much time out on the road but not even a full healer present when the accident happened could have changed the outcome with the branch in the wound the charcoal burner died slowly pulled free hed bleed out instantly looking up jors could see the new scar where the deadfall had finally separated from the tree the charcoal burner had probably passed under it a hundred times forgot it was up there if hed even noticed it at all it wasnt easy to see a branch hung up in the high canopyjors had lost an uncle to a similar accident when he was eight could remember the tears on his fathers face as he carried his brothers body back in through the palisade the charcoal burner was older than jors expected midthirties maybe allowing for the rough edges of a hard lifealthough it couldnt have helped that hed been slowly dying since the branch had pinned him when jors knelt by his side he opened startlingly blue eyes the knowledge of his imminent death was evident in the gaze he locked onto jors face as he fought to drag air into ruined lungs torbin he wheezed my son hes fine take to sister rab bit hole a callused hand batted weakly at jors knee leaving smears of red brown against the white prom ise my word as a herald i will put your son in your sisters arms he held jors gaze for a long moment then closed his eyes and sighed he didnt breathe in again the only evidence of a woman inside the hut was a faded ribbon curled up on a rough shelf jors set it on the pile of the charcoal burners possessions wrapped them in the more worn of the two blankets on the pallet and tied the bundle off without a muleand mules were more trouble than they were worth in the deep woodshe couldnt carry much more than his own gear but torbins inheritance from his dead father and his missing mother was so tiny he didnt feel right leaving any of it behind while jors buried his fatherthe soft deep loam making an unpleasant job significantly easier than it might have beentorbin had fallen asleep curled up against gervais side still secured by the rope for safetys sake herald and companion both had agreed he was too young to get any sort of closure from seeing the body although given that their combined experience with small children could be inscribed on a bridle bell with plenty of room left over for the lyrics to sun and shadow jors could only hope theyd made the right decision as he stepped out of the hut torbins head popped up from under the other blanket he blinked sleepily and screamed hes hungry how can you tell he sounds hungry he sounded furious as far as jors could tell what do i feed him the goat needs milking he looked from the goat who continued to chew on the last few bits of fodder to his companion how do you know shes leaking jors had never milked a goat but hed been around and hed seen goats milked and how hard could it be after all goats producing milk wanted to be milked although he couldnt prove that by this particular goat as torbins screams increased in both volume and duration jors finally managed to tie the goat to a hook on the side of the hut and get the small pail hed found hanging from the hook more or less in position under the leaking udder but it wasnt until gervais moved close enough to catch the nannys gaze and hold it that he actually managed to get his hand around a teat im beginning to think the collegium needs to add a few more practical courses the companion said thoughtfully as jors decanted the frothy milk into a mug with a carved wooden spout id have been willing to lose an hour of instruction in court etiquette jors admitted handing the mug to torbin hed found the mug in the hut and had to unpack it from the blanket bundle the child clutched it with both hands sat down on his bare bottom and began to drink with torbin occupiedand blessedly quietjors dealt with the fire pit and released the livestock will they be safe id put that chicken up against a changelion sucking at a bleeding triangular wound pecked into his left thumb jors dug a travel biscuit from his saddle bags and handed it to torbin just as the child put down the now empty mug and opened his mouth to scream i think im getting the hang of this we need to bring the goat with us we what we were a day from the settlement when we rose this morning and it is now past midday the child will need to be fed again before you can give him over to his aunt i was figuring id tuck him up in front of me and wed concentrate on speed rather than safety torbins possessions having been secured with his behind the high cantle jors took a moment to beat his head gently against the saddle gervais was right alone he might risk a gallop in poor lighting along a rough track bracketed with branches ready to slam the unwary to the ground but he couldnt risk it while holding a child if it were later in the day hed suggest they stay the night but it was high summer and he hated the thought of wasting the five maybe six hours of daylight remaining if we move as quickly as possible and make no stops we should get there before full dark i really dont want to camp while responsible for this child agreed chosen the child is leaking still gnawing happily on the travel biscuit torbin now sat in a spreading puddle there had been two square pieces of cotton spread out on bushes behind the hut jors hadnt realized what they were for until it became obvious that as practical as it was to allow torbin to run half naked around the clearingor more specially around the part of the clearing his lead line gave him access toit was significantly less practical to have him up on the saddle in that condition releasing him from his harness jors carried the child over to the half full water barrel and scooped some of the sunwarmed water over his muddy bottom torbin stared at him for a moment in shock let loose a sound that would have shattered glass had there been any glass in the immediate neighborhood and made a run for it given the length of his legs he was surprisingly fast once caught he objected loudly to having his bottom covered this is ridiculous jors muttered holding the struggling child down with one hand and securing the folded cloth with the other i mean its not that i have an inflated idea of my own importance but there has got to be someone better qualified to do this than me you are the only one here torbin screamed ossy again and with both arms up and reaching for the companion he actually lay still long enough for jors to tie off the last piece of rope chosen that looks yeah i know there must be a trick to it but as unusual as it looked it seemed to be holding so jors lifted torbin up into his arms then tried not to drop him as one flailing foot caught him squarely in a delicate place getting into the saddle while holding a squirming child away from further contact with that delicateand bruisedplace ranked right up there as one of the more difficult things jors had ever accomplished tucked securely between the herald and the saddle horn legs sticking straight out torbin bounced once and twisted around to look back behind them as gervais moved out of the clearing jors barely managed to catch him as he tried to fling himself from the saddle paah your papa is dead but his last thought was of you and i promised him id take you safely to your aunt was a bit complex for a child of torbins age what do i say to him jors demanded holding the struggling child close his ears ringing he does not want to leave his father yeah i got that you cannot explain you can only comfort one hand rubbing small circles on torbins back the other hanging on for dear life jors murmured a steady stream of nonsense into the soft cap of tangled curls until torbin reared back and still screaming slammed his forehead against jors mouth i dont think this is working jors admitted leaning out to spit a mouthful of blood down onto the trail try a lullaby hell never hear me not with his ears hell hear you with his heart after twentyone repetitions of the only lullaby jors knew torbin finally cried himself to sleep his eyelashes tiny damp triangles against his flushed cheeks jors sent up a silent prayer to whatever gods might be listening that the exhausted child would sleep until they reached the settlement and as he stayed asleep while gervais steady pace ate up the distance jors half thought his prayers might actually have been answered what is that smell head up jors turned his nose into the breeze which weirdly seemed to lessen the impact okay thats strange torbin squirmed and giggled nearly pitching forward as he reached out to grab a double handful of gervais mane the odor got distinctly stronger the companion stopped walking i think he began but jors cut him off yeah i know the smear of yellow brown on the thigh of his whites was a definite clue i bet thats going to stain it was amazing how much poop one small body had managed to produce jors distracted torbin through the extensive clean upinvolving most of their water half a dozen handfuls of leaves saddle soap and his only other shirtby feeding him slices of dried apple every time he opened his mouth he buried the soiled cloth by the side of the trail you know if we carried this with us we could probably use it to keep predators away from the camp at night gervais snorted it would keep predators away from this whole part of the country but im not carrying it smiling in spite of everything at the tone of his companions mental voice jors patted down the final shovel of dirt and turned to see wheres torbin hed left the child tucked between gervais front feet chewing on a biscuit hes right gervais turned in place his hooves stirring up little puffs of dirt he was right here you were supposed to be watching him i was watching him jors swore and dove for his sword as a patch of dog willow by the side of the trail shook and cracked and torbin shrieked gervais used his weight to force the thin branches apart then jors charged past him and nearly skewered the goat who had followed them from the clearing and was currently being fed the remains of a slobbery biscuit by a shrieking toddler apparently sometimes the shrieking was happy shrieking it became distinctly less happy when jors attempted to remove torbins arms from around the goats neck only gervais intervention kept him from being bittenby the goat although torbin had teeth he wasnt afraid to use are you hurting him no im not hurting him he managed to pry one handful of goat hair out of the grubby fingers but it was almost impossible to hold that hand and pry open the other ossy thats right torbin horsey is is wise to lie to the child chosen its not a lie its a simplification torbin do you want to ride on the horsey ide ossy then you have to let go of the goat the goat aimed a cloven hoof at jors ankle as he bounced the toddler and made clucking noises that didnt sound remotely like a companions hooves against hard packed dirt but the combination was enough to convince torbin ossy releasing the goat he squirmed out of jors grip and wrapped himself around gervais front leg hes still sticky practice made getting up into the saddle this second time a little easier fast as you can heartbrother were down to half a canteen of water one cloth and ow why does he keep hitting me there perhaps he wants to make certain you never have children of your own gervais sighed as he lengthened his stride they reached the settlement just as dusk was deepening into dark like all family compounds in the deep woods it was surrounded by a strong palisade designed to protect against both wild animals and bandits who might consider that isolation meant easy pickings the gate was already closed but jors wasnt too concerned he was not only a herald he was a herald holding a small child followed by a goat steadying torbin with one hand he rose in the stirrups and hailed the settlement he caught a quick glimpse of a blond head over the wall by the gate then his entire attention was taken up by the sudden need to stop torbin from crawling up gervais neck to chew on his ears at least he assumed that was the intended destination as ears seemed to be one of the words being shrieked during the struggle by the time he managed to pay a little more attention to his surroundings gervais had entered through the palisade the gate was swinging shut behind them and a middleaged woman was plucking torbin from the saddle saying oh the poor wee mite no wonder hes unhappy hes wet usually jors muttered dismounting besides the dried blood left on his knee by torbins father he had yellowbrown smears on one thigh various fluids drying on his shoulder vomitedup apple on one boot and his lap was distinctly damp and unpleasant smelling he felt weirdly smug when torbin still shrieking and now clearly furious tried to launch himself out of the womans arms and back to his he felt understandably relieved when the woman competently prevented the launch and said ill just get him straightened out and quiet and you can explain whats happening when youre all clean and fed there was apparently a trick to making oneself heard over a screaming child i assume she continued that theres no emergency requiring more immediate attention when jors assured her that there was notmostly with a combination of sign language and facial expressionsshe left him to the care of her brothers who just as competently showed him where he could tend to gervais wash and change into his other distinctly cleaner uniform he had to borrow a shirt the deep woods settlements didnt have waystations as sleeping outside the palisades ranged from being a bad to a suicidal idea depending on how long the settlement had been in place since most were singlefamily dwellings spread over a number of buildings it was difficult for anyone to claim favor if heralds bunked down with their companions either in the communal barn if the weather was bad or outside it if not some of the older settlements had built a heralds corner that offered a little privacy but this one young enough that some of the logs in the palisade were still leaking sap was still concentrating on getting a secure roof over everyones head before the cold weather came with gervais unsaddled brushed down and settled with water food and three little girls who stared at him in adoration jors headed off to the male side of the communal showers dumped a hide bag of sunwarmed water over his head scrubbed himself down with a bar of soap and a soft brush and felt a lot better his ears had almost stopped ringing ah dylan he got broke a bit when he lost tiria allin the older of the brothers leaned back against the wall and scratched at the edge of his beard was a fine fellow before s why we agreed to let him set up on the edge of our grant got to say im not surprised he ended like you found him though herald all alone out there like he was heartbroken no one to watch his back loved his boy though helena added glancing over to the pallet where torbin lay asleep with a child close to his own age and a large orange cat i expect hed have come back to people when the boy got a bit older its one thing to mourn while rocking a baby its another thing entirely when that babys running you ragged then he shouldve been heading for people a couple of months ago jors sighed im sure you did your best herald helena smiled as she refilled his mug but what do you know about babies a young man like you and your companions a stallion too isnt he never mind my grandsons near enough to torbins age as to make no difference and wed be happy to take him in all his instincts said these were good people and jors knew torbin would be happy here he could get on with doing what hed been trained to do except i promised his father that id take torbin to his aunt in rabbit hole dylan wanted him sent to mirril did he makes sense she was as near broke up when tiria passed as he was girls grew up together it occurred to jors as he finished his bowl of stew that it was good thing these foresters knew torbins aunt had they not he could have spent days trying to find her wandering around rabbit hole looking for a woman related to a dead charcoal burner with very blue eyes well maybe not days rabbit hole wasnt that big but it was still going to be a lot easier going in with a name and facing another two days on the trail with torbin jors was looking for all the easier he could get theres a spring where youll be stopping so chill any milk you have left in it overnight and it should be good until he drinks it all theres six hard boiled eggs in the pack as long as the shells dont crack theyll be fine for two days but it probably wouldnt hurt to chill them in the spring as well lets see what else helena frowned bouncing torbin on one hip oh yes ive put six cloths in the pack but let him spend as much time without anything on his bottom as possible its just baby poop she snickered as jors failed to prevent a reaction after he goes take the cloth off him and pay attention if he starts to pee dismount or point him out over the trail allin added that got a laugh from most of the gathered adults and a delighted shriek from torbin although he couldnt have understood he was the subject of the discussion after checking the girth one last timeany further checking of his tack would start to look like a deliberate delayjors swung up into the saddle ill return when ive placed him safely with his aunt theres no hurry herald do what you have to ready gervais shook his head hed had his mane braided the night before and the early morning sunlight painted ripples into some of the strands as ready as i am capable of being ossy all right deep breath hand him up jors spread the sixth cloths out over the bushes and hoped at least one of them would be dry by morning hed done his best but there was a limit to how much he could get out with spring water and a stick point him over the trail he muttered heading back to the camphed moved downhill to do torbins laundry in the hope of avoiding contamination it might be as helena had said just baby poop but as far as he was concerned there was no just about it how is it possible for him to expel more than hes taken in are you counting vomiting during one of their stops torbin had eaten a handful of leaves hed ripped from a bush by the trail and some dirt and a bug a little further down the trail hed brought them all back up again jors had been happyby certain specific definitions of the word happythat hed changed back into his stained uniform gervais had insisted they stop immediately and clean his mane chosen hed have never heard an actual verbal call over the shrieking arriving at the campsite at a dead run jors found torbin straining against gervais hold on the back of his smock the companions teeth gripping a fold of the fabric as the child fought to get to the spring he ate another bug ossy jors scratched at a welt across his bare chest and sighed at least hes not a fussy eater wrapped up in the fluffier of the two blankets jors had taken from the charcoal burners hut thumb tucked deep in his mouth eyelashes a dark smudge against the upper curve of chubby cheeks torbin looked as though he would never consider trying to throw himself off a companions back causing that companions herald to temporarily stop breathing as though hed never try to poke his own eye out with a stick as though hed never drop a halfdead cricket into someone elses supper jors settled another log on the fire and leaned back against gervais shoulder to watch torbin sleep why are we doing this again he sighed you gave your word to his father i know but he dug another bit of mashed egg out of his ear this isnt exactly what heralds do is it yes yes jors repeated wondering if hed heard correctly given the egg he might not have yes it is exactly what heralds do how do you figure he asked stroking one hand along the companions silky side the heralds not only protect valdemar as it is but by their actions valdemar as it will be this child is the future of valdemar it doesnt matter if he is chosen or he becomes a charcoal burner like his father here and now he is not only himself he is the potential for everything he could be without him there will be no future in valdemar so yes you are doing exactly what it is heralds do there is nothing more important you could be doing that helps i thought it might you have to admit though he certainly puts something like a diplomatic mission to karse into perspective it is unlikely that you and i would be sent to karse not diplomatic enough not even close still a mission to karse would likely involve less vomiting there is that rabbit hole was not exactly a bustling metropolis and the second person jors asked was able to direct him to mirril the charcoal burners younger sister had married the son of a wheelwright and they lived in the family complex surrounding the work yard she had her brothers bright blue eyes torbin tried to stick a finger into one of them but he didnt shriek when she cuddled him her tears falling to gleam against his curls so maybe jors thought maybe he knew this was home at least dylan didnt die alone theres that he had a herald with him mirril blinked away tears and managed a watery smile he used to tell me stories about heralds when we were growing up she frowned suddenly at the long white hairs torbin was clutching in one hand oh no tell her he may keep them chosen when jors passed on gervais remark she blushed and tucked the hair into her apron pocket i could braid them into a bracelet for him he wouldnt eat them then i wouldnt count on it jors told her he likes to eat he likes travel biscuits and egg and goats milk oh and helena at the settlement said that the next time they bring a load of lumber out shell pay you for torbins goat she followed us to the settlement torbin reached out a hand and jors pretended to grab it and eat the fingers making him shriek with laughter he likes to run and he seems to have no idea of self preservation but hes a tough little guy and a big believer in picking himself up and getting on with things when he falls he doesnt talk a lot i dont know if thats usual for his age but he says no and ride horsey and papa but jors didnt add that out loud hes pretty good at making his wants known ossy she was smiling now and shaking her head we need to get back on the trail so uh it was harder to say goodbye than hed expected he planted a kiss on the dimpled knuckles and released torbins hand be a good boy for your auntie ossy thank you for everything youve done jors thought of torbins father i wish i could have done more he turned then turned again do you think i mean would you mind if i stopped by to visit him if im in the area i wouldnt be checking up or anything i just had stains all over his uniform and the smell might never leave his saddle bags and it was entirely possible he still had egg in his ear would i mind if a herald came by to visit my brothers son why would i ever mind that why would anyone but why would you mirrils cheeks were flushed and she ducked her head in embarrassment i mean you have so much more important things to do ossy with an ease that came from three days of intensive training jors caught the future of valdemar as he threw himself out of his aunties arms shrieking ossy actually he said letting torbin slide to the ground and wrap himself around one of the companions legs i dont not really hes still sticky gervais sighed the thief of anvils close by fiona patton fiona patton was born in calgary alberta canada

anvils close is the second valdemar story featuring havens dann family it was a beautiful autumn afternoon in haven the kind you remembered long afterward warm and brightly sunny with just enough breeze to sweeten the air with the heady aromas of baking bread and standing on the crowded threshold of the iron street watch house sergeant hektor dann took a deep breath his eye tightly closed and meat pies he smiled every year from the very first day his mother had allowed him to bring his father and grandfather their dinners at age six to the day he was named first watchhouse sweeper then runner then finally constable the autumn breeze had carried the same scents on the breeze he could almost feel the clothwrapped pot of warm stew against his chest the worn wooden broom handle in his hands the cold cobblestones against his bare feet the scratch of the brand new uniform tunic against his wrists hek hektor i mean sergeant almost but not quite he opened his eyes his youngest brother elevenyearold padreic newly made watchhouse runner rocked to a halt in front of him breathing like a forge bellows his face was red with exertion but his eyes shone with importance and just a hint of mischief that hektor instantly mistrusted runner youre wanted on anvils close his brother panted ignoring his older brothers attempt at a stern expression at edzels shop he added in a meaningful voice whos wantin me edzel or one of his neighbors edzel well thats somethin anyway leastways there wont be a public nuisance complaint or an assault charge last month master blacksmith edzel smith had thrown an andiron at a farrier whod though his concerns were funny edzel was a lot of things but he was never funny there might still be padreic disagreed his breath back and the look of importance growing on his face as he savored the information he possessed that his older brother didnt hes throwin a right barny this time he embellished rantin and ravin like a fits on him says someones been thievin his goods edzel always thinks someones been thievin his goods hektor turned to see their oldest brother corporal aiden dann standing behind him an unimpressed expression on his face this time hes worse aiden padreic assured him cause this time he might be right hm aiden glanced at hektor well sergeant he said giving the brand new stripes on hektors sleeve a sharp prod you goin or you gonna stand there actin like youre still afraid of a crazy old blacksmith im goin only only hektor gave his older brother a helpless look and aiden shook his head in disgust fine ill go with you thanks aiden thanks corporal his brother prompted yeah thanks corporal anvils close lay just off the iron market entrance gates a narrow neatly cobblestoned street it was made up of small forges and iron shops where the citys blacksmiths and their families sold everything from wrought iron railings and window grills to surgical tools and musical instruments anything that could be fashioned out of metal an older woman dressed in a stout leather apron leaned out the door of the first shop as they passed by well well sergeant dann she said with a wicked smile havent you just gotten all grown up an promoted ismy wouldnt know you to look at you now hektor kept his expression as neutral as possible although he could feel his neck turning red above the collar of his blue and gray watchmans uniform hello judee he replied crazy old foolll bring on a fit if hes not careful she noted jerking her head down the close best get yourself over there double quick afore he does his heart a mischief hektor nodded and carried on at once but aiden paused for a moment ive a buckle that needs mendin judee you got time she nodded send it over with paddy ill have it done by your shifts end thanks as he made to follow his younger brother her expression turned serious really aiden get that old fool sorted out will you his rantins bad for business an not just for him for the whole close we will you tell him hes scarin his grandbaby that might do it he nodded catching up with hektor as he madewith some reluctancefor the small iron shop across the street and three doors down like most businesses in this part of haven it was little more than eight feet wide with two horizontal shutters at the front the top was supported on tall posts to provide an awning for the bottom which supported on two shorter posts acted as a display counter for tools nails hinges handles and whatever other bits of ironwork the proprietor thought might lure a customer inside the brightly painted sign depicting a bell flanked by two ornate candlesticks above a decorative anvil declared the owner to be a master smith capable of crafting more refined objects than mere horseshoes and hammers but what had always set edzels shop apart from the others and what had kept hektor aiden and many of the boys their age coming in and braving the smiths legendary temper was that in his prime edzel smith had made toys of extraordinary skill tops and jacks metal whistles tin flutes and polished iron marbles lead guardsmen with arms and legs that actually moved and tiny beautifully crafted heralds and their companions painted a heavy enameled white hektor remembered saving his pennybits for months just to be able to afford a single articulated watchman no bigger than his forefinger when hed been nine years old edzels daughter ismy had given him another when he was twelve he glanced down to the end of the close where it opened up onto saddlers street before loud shouting issuing from edzels shop jerked him forcibly from the memory i tell you im bein thieved from edzel smith stood in the middle of the shop shaking his fists in rage a squat heavyset man in his late sixties his gray hair thinning on top and gray beard covering a jutting and belligerent chin years of forge work had bent his back and twisted his hands but his arms and shoulders were still covered with thick corded muscle and his temper was as volatile as ever dont you try an shush me boy he continued his face turning a dangerous purple i know when im being thieved from dont you try an tell me otherwise i had thirteen thimbles thirteen on that there back worktable and not a one less i had a full box of lath nails thats twentyfour exactly an now there be naught but nineteen the boy he was shouting at his son tay a tall broad man of almost thirtyfive and a full smith in his own right did his best to look if not believing then at least respectful as edzel stomped about shaking his fists in near apoplectic rage usually at work at the forge behind the shop tay entered this world of crammed shelving and angry fathers as seldom as possible but with the rage on him edzel was more than tays long suffering wife trisha who helped him run the shop could handle boggles maybe tay suggested trying without success to lighten his fathers mood bollocks its boggles edzel shouted back i know boggles i seen a boggle when i was a little walkin home from the forge at twilight one summer an it aint them its her i tell you he spun about to shake one fist out the open doorway thats who it is that heartless thievin stepmother of yourn an ill have the watch on her see if i dont now da tay said trying to keep his voice reasonable you know judee haint been near the shop since she moved out two years ago his fathers face darkened still further you mean since she took half my hardearned brass an opened that spiteful ratinfested trap she dares call an iron shop with your ungrateful halfwit of a brother you mean is that what you mean edzel demanded his voice turning even more shrill tay sighed in the nearly twenty years since his mothers death his fatherd had three other women in his in their lives and each one had finally been driven away by edzels unpredictable temper made worse now since age and arthritis had driven him from the forge and into the shop full time judeed lasted longer than most long enough to give tay and his younger sister ismy a halfbrother before she too had left them but this time shed gone no farther than along anvils close to open up a rival iron shop of her own with their brother ben whod just gotten his blacksmiths papers and whose business was doing much better than theirs if truth be told tay admitted he glanced around the shop it wasnt that it was small or cramped or dirty it was roughly the same size as any other shop in the close with a tiny back room for small repair jobs and a front room laid out neatly with a long sandalwood table in the center and sturdy iron shelving on three of four walls with the larger goods on the bottom and the smaller on the upper the more valuable were locked in an actual glass and ironbarred case behind a wide golden oak counter that edzel polished every morning with ferris oil until it shone and it wasnt that their goods were particularly expensive their prices were comparable to any other shop in haven no tay told himself for the hundredth time as he watched a customer step just inside the door listen for a few moments to his fathers language then carefully back out again it was the shop owner himself they had to do something about edzel before the business failed entirely and a few misplaced thimbles were the least of their worries but he had no idea what the something should be tay turned as trisha came in from the tiny back kitchen alcove her expression exasperated i tried to get him to go in for some tea she said in a strained voice but he wont have it tay nodded we need to fetch zozo he said trying to hide the strain in his own voice shes the only one that can calm him down now she frowned meegan brought her by first thing this mornin she said doubtfully shell be at judees for the rest of the day now i know but hell rant himself into a fever if he keeps on like this ask judee will you just for a few minutes for me please ask her ive sent for the watch his father continued to no one in particular an dont you think i wont call the guard too if that shiftless lot up at the iron street station house dont get here soon i told that dann boy to fetch sergeant thomar hell get her sorted out in a hurry tay turned thomar danns retired da he said gently then hell fetch egan instead egans dead he died in the iron market fire last month remember hell probably get egans son hektor he just made sergeant you remember hektor da edzel glared at his son with a malevolent expression course i remember him he shouted i chased him away from ismy when he were thirteen an gave him a damn good thrashin to boot i dont care if that boy fetches hektor dann or the monarchs own herald i want someone here and i want em here now mornin edzel as one both smiths whirled about to see hektor and aiden standing in the shop doorway edzels expression never changed bout time you two showed up he snarled as trisha made her way past them with a sympathetic expression get in here an do your job i could be missin half my shop for all the protection i get ill call the actual guard an have them do your job for you if you dont give me satisfaction right this very minute he fixed hektor with a rheumyeyed glare see if i dont hektor nodded struggling to remember that he was twentyone and not thirteen and trying to keep as neutral an expression on his face as possible so what exactly are you missing sir he said using the noncommittal but respectful tone hed learned from generations of danns in the iron street watch it did not mollify edzel i told that brother of yourn when i sent him he snarled back i had twelve silver spoons in that there locked cabinet he said thrusting a gnarled thumb behind him i was giving em a good cleanin last night now theres naught but eleven you just go look and see hektor squeezed behind the counter to peer into the cabinet in question three shelves contained a collection of delicate metalwork including eleven silver spoons about to ask if edzel was sure hed put all twelve away last nighta question that would certainly have caused another round of shoutinghe was interrupted by aiden didnt know you worked in silver edzel his older brother said absently studying a long handled toasting fork with a discerning eye i dont edzel snapped snatching it away from him tays makin em a locked case to protect em against fire but theres more whats gone walkin too thimbles nails one stylus two boat hooks he said counting each one off on his fingers a diagonal a rounded bill an anvil swage two hot punches a driver an adze blade an awl an edge shave three whole palm irons a seat wheel a cleave an nine pair of arms and legs the long list of unfamiliar words ending in arms and legs caused both hektor and aiden to stare at him and edzel spat at the floor in disgust for lead soldiers you idiots what else would they be for an dont you go lookin at me like i lost my wits neither i done a full inventory just last week an i know my stock all them things is missin at that moment trisha returned with a small girl of around three years old in her arms the child caught sight of edzel and threw her own arms out nearly hurling herself from trishas in the process ganther the smiths entire demeanor changed his wrinkled face split into a huge grin and he snatched her up at once twisting her around until she sat precariously perched upon one bent shoulder here now whats all this then my little zo zo bird he chortled his recent ill temper completely forgotten thort you was at your grannys for your afternoon nap my grandbaby zoe he explained almost pleasantly in answer to the watchmens questioning expressions now where was i oh yeah he waved a warning finger at hektor you do sommat about this thievin or ill be up to your own granthers myself retired or no hell light a fire under your he paused as the child began to bounce up and down on his shoulder well you just mind you do he finished he glanced over at aiden with a withering expression an youve got a buckle there what needs mendin whats the watch comin to it wouldnt a been allowed in thomars day he turned the child still on his shoulder tay youve a moment to fix yon buckle sure da as his son came forward aiden shook his head its nothin it can wait no need to wait edzel said waving a dismissive hand at him the boy can manage that kinda work at least its not like its fine work you have that off an hell fix it up a twinklin but tay just gave him a strained smile sall right aiden just come on in the back ill be naught but a moment they all made for the workroom as aiden struggled to remove the buckle zoe threw her hands out toward an ornate iron cage on a shelf beside the worktable lillbit edzel chuckled lillbits right there all safe an sound jus like you left him earlier he assured her reaching over he unlocked the door and a small gray creature dove from the cage and clambered up the old mans arm towards her aiden started in surprise thats a rat both edzel and zoe turned equally indignant expressions on him as the child caught the creature up cupping it protectively in her hands my lillbit she shouted lillbits her pet edzel snarled zozo tamed him up her own self just this summer an hes still a little himself so dont you dare think about doin him any mischief aiden dann a rat you let your granddaughter play with a rat aiden looked so horrified that zoe immediately began to cry yes a rat edzel shouted not that its any of your business as zoe continued to cry he caught up a leaf hammer brandishing it at aiden with one hand while he frantically patted zoes hair with the other now get out youre upsettin my grandbaby get out get out get out out out out zoe echoed as aiden retreated shaking his head edzel whirled on hektor an you find that thief you hear me he shouted his earlier rage returning i pay my guild fees an i have the right to protection if i dont get it ill call the guard ill call the heralds theyve a proper court an that truth spell of theirsll sort you all out good an proper he almost slammed the shop door on them both as they left across the close judee gave them an ironic salute with a ceramic tea cup before disappearing into her own shop as well you want us to guard edzel smiths iron shop all night hektors two middle brothers jakon nineteen and raik seventeen had served as night watchmen since being taken on as full constables it worked well for the danns since they could use the smallest of the familys bedrooms during the day and hektor and padreic could use it at night but it also meant that neither of them were used to taking orders from their new sergeant now they both just stared at him youre joking jakon protested no im not what does the captain say about it hektors expression hardened the captains left it up to me im the sergeant youre the day sergeant hek raik replied yeah an the day sergeant posts the shifts hektor reminded him so heres your shifts one at the entrance to anvils close one at edzels shop door take it in turns if you like but youre takin it for how long a few nights likely how manys a few as many as i say it is get seen let any possible thieves know were on the job therell be a couple posted durin the day too jakon shook his head in disgust you dont really think someones been thievin off edzel do you hek i mean hes always been a suspicious old bugger glarin at everyone who comes near his place its a wonder he has any customers at all hes off his head raik agreed maybe but it makes no matter hes paid his guild fees like he said so youre for edzels shop until i say different get used to it constables yes sergeant hektor chose to ignore both the tone of voice and the sarcastic salutes of his younger brothers merely turning and stalking away the next morning they made their report with equally sour expressions it had rained all night and theyd spent a cold wet and uneventful shift guarding nothing no one had come near the close never mind the shop as far as they were concerned no one was going to padreic however had a different report to make an youre sure the settins were right here moonstones an all no the moonstones werent here moonstones are rare edzel said angrily thumping his fist on his work table behind the main shop the moonstones got locked up good and proper when i was finished with em the iron settins were fine work twenty year ago but they aint so rare they have to be locked up too they was right here on this very table and now two of ems gone hektor peered down at the three clawed bits of metal used edzel had told him stiffly to affix gems to sword and dagger hilts then turned to trisha standing just inside the door did you see em he asked hopefully she shook her head sorry hek edzel was bent over em till long past when tay an me went to bed she answered i didnt see how many he had then nor later i had five edzel sputtered i already told you five only the presence of zoe playing happily in the corner with lillbit kept his voice down to a dull roar but hektor could see a vein in his forehead throbbing dangerously could someone have come in the back way through the forge he asked or through one of the windows above maybe the forge is closed up tightern a drum at night an my window locks are the best in haven i cast em myself the roof paw my granther build that roof an its a sound as the day it went up sides this ones a right light sleeper edzel said jerking a thumb at trisha shes up half the night shed have heard if anyone was creepin about up there trisha nodded tay snores she explained i tell you who it twas it was that woman edzel continued she had that ungrateful son of ours make a shop key afore she left thats what she did an she snuck over here in the dead of night your lot must have fallen asleep on duty hektor felt his face flush angrily but he refused to rise to the accusation ill talk to judee he said stiffly so lemme get this straight crossing her arms over her amble bosom judee looked more amused than indignant your askin me if i have a key to edzels shop hektor just nodded she chuckled no boy i dont an even if i did do you really think i could sneak about at night at my age with my girth in the rain so as to hide from two grown constables what spent the entire night moanin an complainin about the weather till the wee hours hands on hips she almost dared hektor to say something then turned as trisha crossed the street with zoe in her arms cmere darlin she crooned comen see your granny catching the child up in her arms she chucked her under the chin now you left lillbit behind yeah to keep your granther company cause you know your grannys not fond of rats in her shop an gingerd just as likely eat him as look at him zoe nodded happily bouncing up and down in her grandmothers arms much as shed done in her grandfathers gantherll keep him safe she said happily thats good judee turned back to hektor edzels losing whats left of his wits she pronounced nobodys thievin from him at all hes either imaginin hes got more stockn he has or hes misplacin it all himself its a waste of a constables time if you ask me but you go right ahead an post your brothers on my very own door if that make you happy sergeant dann but i should warn you she said with a snicker its gonna rain again i dont think we need to do that he replied gravely refusing to rise to the bait but one on edzels door an one inside his shop might calm him down some neither jakon nor raik took the order at all well aiden finally had to step in and threaten to knock their heads together and it was with some acrimony that the two of them headed off for their shift after supper that evening as the rest of the family settled into the small sitting room hektor threw himself down next to his sister and grandfather tucked up next to the flats small coal stove he glanced down at the pigeon cupped in thirteenyearold kasiaths hands with a questioning look peachwings ailin again he asked struggling to keep his tone of voice light some she admitted mites again his grandfather sniffed and shes sad cause the autumns endin kasiath added solemnly listening to the sound of rain pelting against the sitting room window there wont be such nice flyin when the snow comes that wont be for a while yet though will it peachwing figures itll be afore the end of the month hektor peered down at the bird who peered myopically back up at him from the protection of his sisters fingers dont know how you can know what shes thinkin he said with a touch of admiration in his voice the girls always been right smart when it comes to feathered creatures their grandfather agreed but i think she a bit batty myself thomar their mother admonished looking up from where she and aidens wife sulia were stitching a piece of embroidered cloth together kasiath just shrugged sall right ma granthers just teasin she stroked the birds head with one fingertip dont know that she is thinkin exactly she admitted to hektor ignoring their grandfathers wink its more like a feelin really she gets all pouty layin down in her feathers an i just know its cause she can feel the snow comin an she hates it on her wings but i just sit with her a while and then she feels better kassies always known how to do that ever since she were a little their grandfather added proudly as kasiath gently tucked peachwing into a small wooden box at their feet best birder i ever knew my granddaughter its a gift she has with em they takes to her right outta the egg tamed up her first one when she were no moren three years old you remember jemmee their mother nodded i remember bird droppings all over my table she said with a smile that belied the sour tone in her voice and i remember tellin you both that my kitchen was no place to tame up a wild creature huh sounds like zoe and her pet rat aiden said from the other side of the room where he was playing with his own children threeyearold egan and sixmonthold leila before they went to bed im amazed meegan lets her keep such an animal at all sulia noted with a frown zoe keeps it at edzels hektor replied but thats even stranger what with him dotin on her so much youd think hed be scared it would bite her ages addled his wits aiden pronounced just cause a mans gettin on in years dont mean any such a thing their grandfather said sternly pulling the ends of a wellpatched shawl more tightly about his shoulders he thinks judees creepin in an stealin his goods granther padreic said looking up from the pigs bladder ball he was perpetually mending an i asked along the whole close hektor added no ones seen anyone suspicious about or lost anythin themselves sides who steals one silver spoon from a set of twelve or five iron lath nails aiden added rising he scooped up both children under his arms and headed out the sitting room door amidst shrieks of laughter hes right granther hektor said i think edzels losin his wits his tempers gettin worse an worse the whole closes gettin sick of it thomar just sniffed edzel was a fine craftsman in his day he answered one of the best for small delicate goods as i ever saw he might a made a fine jeweler or even an artist if hed come from a different family the arthritis is what made him so sour it robbed him of his craft thats enough to turn anyone ugly he fell silent staring at the stove until jemmee glanced up youd best be off to bed now paddy she said you too kassie take peachwing back to the coop now yes ma gnight granther night darlins thomar accepted a kiss each from his youngest grandchildren a few moments later jemmee and sulia headed off as well with a warning to thomas and hektor not to sit up too late mornin shift comes early hektor dann his mother admonished as she snuffed out the rooms few candles an you need your sleep ill be along soon ma he promised but once they were alone he glanced speculatively at his grandfather do you miss watchhouse duty granther he asked thomar just shrugged sometimes he admitted but ive got my birds and young kassie to pass my knowledge on to you lot as well if it comes to that he added as long as i can pass on what i learned from my watchhouse days im happy enough problem with edzels that he aint got that the shops not for him he never were too good with folk just iron when his own littles were young he could teach em what he knew but they havent exactly followed in his footsteps two of his boys are blacksmiths granther hektor reminded him gently sure but neither one of em has the same skill with small things an that was what he was always the most proud of dunno maybe when zoe gets older he can teach her to make toy soldiers an whistles or somethin the two of them sat in silence for a long time until thomar gave his grandson a speculative look of his own asked along the whole close did you he asked hektor nodded all the way to the end yeah why no reason thomar stretched his hands towards the fire little leilall be walkin soon sulia says an you know what that means dont you um no it mean your mall be anglin for another grandbaby soon from who his grandfather just shrugged werent you sweet on young ismy smith once hektor raised an eyebrow you sure it aint you anglin for another greatgrandbaby granther maybe but you was sweet on ismy once yeah hektor nodded cautiously and thomas prodded and she married a saddle maker two years ago and and he died hektor admitted reluctantly last winter and and nothin nothin nothin hm thomar hunkered down into his shawl pity that she were a nice girl he glanced about the flat with an innocent expression i hear lorin potter an his family from downstairs are movin in with his wifes da next spring oh yep that leaves a flat empty sulia says she an aiden might think about takin it theres even an extra room for jakon an raik to help em out with the rent we figure thatd give us plenty of room here should someone else maybe get interested in havin a family now that hes bringin in a sergeants pay an all whos we hektor asked both amused and a bit annoyed at the same time me an your ma his grandfather answered easily an sulia an paddy paddy sure hes bringin in a proper wage as runner he figures he can put in some to help out now i spose he can hektor stared at the tiny flickering flames behind the stove door not sure ill be bringin in a sergeants pay for long though he said after a moment dont think im suited to it aiden woulda made a better choice i never shoulda been promoted above him im no good at tellin folk what to do whatever the captain says bollocks his grandfather scoffed aidens too bad tempered just like your uncle reed your da got promoted above him an they worked it out just fine it aint me an aiden granther its me an jakon and raik his grandfather snorted unsympathetically theyll come around keep doin what youre doin stick em out in the rain until they mind you he pulled his shawl more tightly about his shoulders again now you best be off to bed afore paddy gets too comfortable with all them covers go on now ill head off myself in a bit hektor nodded gnight granther gnight boy his brothers report the next morning was much the same as the day before theyd taken it in turn to guard the shop inside and out and once again no one had come near jakon made it clear that as far as he was concerned any more time spent on anvils close was a waste of time as the day wore on and there was no word from edzel hektor began to believe they were right just before his shifts end he pushed aside the mountain of reports that being a sergeant seemed to involve and headed out to see for himself the shop seemed strangely quiet when he arrived trisha was wrapping a piece of string around a set of fire tongs for a customer and zoe was playing happily with lillbit behind the counter when he stepped inside where is everyone he asked trisha shrugged tay an edzel are at a guild meetin she said in a resigned tone of voice edzel wants em to hire a force of private guards for the close since he says he got thieved from again last night hektor blinked youre joking she shook her head apparently one of his moonstones is missin now edzel just about went off his head this morning when he found out but at least he aint blamin judee no more she an ben are at the meetin too so its just me an zoe here all by our lonesome today aint we zo zo zoe nodded happily ill just go an check on our tea trisha continued you an lillbit watch the shop for me all right we will zoe glanced up at hektor with a sunny smile lillbits glad its tea time she pronounced cause e

pointed towards the back lillbit can get inside if i ask im too but auntie trisa dont like im in there cause e gets is feet inna butter cause e knocks the lid off hes that smart is he she nodded lillbit can get inta all sorts a cupboards an cases you talk to him then yeah an e talks back a chuckle made hektor glance up to see trisha standing in the kitchen doorway holding a tray lillbits zozos special friend she said emphasizing the word special isnt he zozo yeah i kinda had one of em too hektor admitted when i was a little only no one else could see him except me no one else can hear lillbit except zoe trisha agreed will you stay for tea hek were havin biscuits an jam an butter zoe prompted an butter a course hektor shook his head i should be gettin back i got reports to file he said woefully watching as zoe set lillbit carefully onto her shoulder before lifting a loose floorboard up with practiced ease and depositing something shiny beneath it he frowned zoe whatcha doin there he asked lightly tidyin up shop she answered granther says ye should always tidy up shop when ye close even for tea is that your shop then she nodded lillbits an mine when we get big were gonna run granthers shop maybe grannys too can i see your shop she nodded setting the floorboard to one side she pointed into the cavity below we gots goods an tools jus like granther she explained but we dont gots a sign yet we will though real soon the toolsre um she screwed her face up in concentration hundred pennybits an the goodre four hundred hektor leaned over the counter to see a number of small unfamiliar tools lined up neatly beside two boat hooks one thimble a silver spoon two iron settings five nails a handful of lead arms and legs and a moonstone cradled in a piece of cloth beside him trishas eyes widened in exasperated surprise so it was his own grandbaby thievin his goods back at the watchhouse jakon gave a loud guffaw bet edzel felt like a right fool when he found that out

immediately changed from aggrieved to interested but when he simply jerked his chin toward the door they obeyed him with minimal grumbling once they were gone he carefully straightened the pile of reports then his uniform tunic then the reports again then finally left the tiny sergeants office as he headed down iron street he took in a deep breath of the crisp autumn air tasting the familiar aromas of baking bread and meat pies before heading down anvils close at the door to edzels shop both zoe and her grandfather totally ignored him but both judee and lillbit gave him equally knowing expressions before trisha called them all inside to their own supper twice blessed by judith tarr judith tarr has written many novels and several friends of valdemar stories under her own name as caitlin brennan she writes novels about horses especially the lipizzan horses she breeds and trains on her farm in arizona nerys and kelyn were born on the same day in the same town to mothers who were cousins as well as the best and closest of friends their fathers were partners nerys father bred and raised sheep that were famous for the softness and richness of their wool and kelyns father turned the fleeces to a fine and subtly dyed fabric that had even clothed the queen in haven everyone had hoped one of the children would be a boy so that the two families could unite in marriage as well as in business and friendship when both turned out to be girls they were universally expected to be companions in childhood and friends and allies when they grew to womanhood that was a lovely dream the reality manifested when they were barely old enough to sit up nerys challenged kelyn for a doll that happened to be identical to the one she herself had and kelyn fought back with singleminded ferocity they had to be separated by force and carried off to their respective nurseries ah well nerys mother said theyre only babies theyll grow out of it kelyns mother wondered about that but then she chided herself all these children had ever known was love what could either of them know of its opposite however they had learned it nerys and kelyn disliked each other on sight age and maturity did nothing to improve their mutual antipathy it was one of the very few things they ever agreed on that they could not stand one another everything with them was rivalry they vied with each other for friends for prizes in contests even for marks in school if nerys wore the latest fashion kelyn had to set a completely new one if one entered a race at the fair the other had to enter it too and fight for every stride it was like a curse but no one in emmerdale could imagine what or who might have laid it their families had enemies of course prosperity always attracted envy but none of those had the resources or the knowledge to cast a spell of perpetual discord on a pair of children some tried to blame it on the wizards wood that touched the western edge of the town but nothing had come out of that in time out of mind except truffles and the occasional wild boar for nerys and kelyn it was simply the way things were their families tried everything from gentle remonstrance to outright whipping with complete lack of success they never stopped trying and nerys and kelyn never stopped detesting one another it was an epic battle in its way as much a part of life in emmerdale as the sheepfolds and the woolen mill nerys and kelyn shared one other thing besides mutual loathing a lifelong fascination with the queens heralds and their magical companions from the time they were old enough to understand they never tired of hearing about companions when i am grown nerys said i shall be chosen oh no you wont said kelyn i will and you will see me riding my companion all bright and shining in my whites and tear out your hair in rage nerys laughed at her but with an edge of unease nerys had beautiful hair long and shining so black it shone blue and she was very vain of it kelyn whose hair was slightly less straight but otherwise exactly like it had no reason for envy but it made a useful weapon in their endless war when nerys was old enough to ride her father gave her a beautiful white pony with a long silken mane naturally kelyn had to have one too but hers had blue eyes though they were not the deep clear blue of a companions they were close enough to keep a child happyuntil nerys mocked them glass eyes how ugly she looks as if shes been dead in the water for days kelyn reared back knotted her fist and knocked nerys flat it was the one and only time in all their enmity that either struck a blow against the other kelyn stood over nerys where she lay sprawling and said perfectly calmly leave my horse alone to everyones amazement nerys did their war went on but people and animals were exempt it was entirely and exclusively personal one splendid summer morning a few days after her thirteenth birthday nerys galloped her pony up the steep track to the highest sheep pasture it was not a track to be galloping on and her errand was only mildly urgent but nerys was out of patience with the world in honor of their unfortunately mutual birthday kelyn had received her first silk gown and had been allowed to put her hair up nerys mother had given her a necklace of amber beads a fine wool cloak and a new saddlecloth for her pony those were excellent gifts and under any other circumstances nerys would have been delighted but kelyn had outdone her and nerys parents would not hear a word about it theres time enough for you to play at being a woman her mother said it was small consolation that kelyn spilled barley beer on her dress before she had been in it an hour and it was not even nerys fault the dress was still silk and fit for a woman grown nerys was still being treated like a baby in the back of her mind nerys knew she was being unreasonable that was hardly enough to stop her so she pushed her pony hard up the steep and rocky track and trusted him not break either of their necks the pony might be small and growing smaller for nerys by the year but he was surefooted and quick he brought them both safely to the high pasture the sheep were grazing peacefully in the clear morning sunlight the shepherds big white dogs stood guard looking like sheep themselves unless they moved the shepherd was not in her hut or anywhere on the mountaintop she could not have gone far nerys had brought fresh bread and honey sweets and the first small hard apples of the season as gifts from her mother she left them in the hut where the shepherd could see them the message she had to deliver that some of the ewes had been sold and should come down off the mountain within the tenday could wait all day if it had toand so could nerys a whole day to herself was a rare and wonderful thing now she was almost a woman the almost barely stung up here where the air was thin and clear and the world seemed far away nerys pulled the saddle and bridle off the pony rubbed him down and turned him loose among the sheep he paused to drink long and deeply from the stream that ran through the pasture and then set to grazing on the rough scrubby grass nerys thought briefly about swimming in the stream but it was as cold as snow even in the dead of summer she walked along it instead hunting for the sweet scarlet berries that hid in the grass and eating those that she found the stream wound into a grove of windstunted trees they stood in a circle almost as if planted the space inside had always seemed to nerys to be larger than the space without when she was younger she had played games in and around the grove pretending that it was the companions grove and that magic grew there by moonlight or starlight once when a ewe give birth to a late lamb in the shelter of the trees nerys called the little ram groveborn until willa the shepherd boxed her ears to teach her respect nerys had kept her dreams to herself after that but to her the grove had always had a certain sacredness about it when she could she visited it just to sit and be to listen to the wind in the leaves and breathe the sweetness of the flowers that bloomed in the grass today she had grievances to nurse she was not sure she wanted the calm the grove could give still the day had grown warm and the shade under the trees would be blessedly cool she wandered in nibbling a handful of sweet berries the cool green smell and the soft shade wrapped around her she yawned suddenly and powerfully sleepy under her drooping eyelids in sight blurred by warmth and sleepiness she saw that some of the sheep had taken refuge in the grove a moving cloud of whiteness it drifted toward her she braced for the jostle of woolly bodies around her knees warm breath blew in her face sweet with the scents of grass and flowers she looked down at silver hoovessingle not clovenand up into the deepest bluest most breathtakingly beautiful eyes that had ever been hello the shimmering white creature said the voice nerys heard in her head was warm and deep with a faint musical lilt it was the most beautiful voice she had ever heard with her ears or otherwise hello she answered politely as her mother had taught her my name is nerys mine is coryn the companion said of course that was what he was he could not possibly have been anything else part of nerys was dancing wildly and part was telling itself to calm down stop being an idiot she was only dreaming but it felt as real as it could possibly be she stretched out a hand she was prepared for the vision to vanish or for her fingers to tangle in sheeps wool his neck was as smooth as water his mane was long and waving and as fine and soft as the fringe of her mothers prized silk shawl he was warm and solid and very much alive he had a smell sweet like his breath but with a hint underneath of the horse smell she loved he was real he was talking to her she was chosen she looked at him asking permission he dipped his beautiful white head he was much taller than her pony but he lowered himself to his knees for her she gripped that silken mane and swung her leg over his broad back when she was settled and comfortable he rose smoothly erect tossed his mane and pawed her heart fluttered a little companion or no chosen or no he was a tall and powerful stallion and she was used to riding an opinionated but thoroughly safe pony gelding she felt as much as heard his snort of amusement at least you can ride he said more or less that stung her pride she forgot her fear and dug her heels into his sidesremembering just a fraction too late that a companion was not all appearances to the contrary a horse he was kind he bucked her into a bush instead of hard ground or stony creek or the thicket of brambles that was covered with green fruit the second time she mounted she was moving stiffly but she was not about to back off please she said will you walk simple intention will do he replied and a little encouragement from your seat he had not moved while he spoke to her it dawned on her that she was supposed to follow instructions companions nothing she muttered they ought to call you tyrants his amusement was all the answer she got she glowered at him then she willed him to walk and bumped with her backside not exactly he said but just this once ill accept it his walk was huge it was as big and swooping as her ponys best canter it made her clutch his mane and try her best not to clutch his sides it was alarming and exhilarating and more than she could ever have imagined she would never have dared to ask him to trot he gave it to her of his own will and that was even bigger and almost as smooth when he flowed into a canter in spite of all her fear and fret she was grinning like a fool it was glassy smooth yet deeply and subtly powerful he circled the whole of the high pasture catching her pony on the way and sweeping him in their wake it was better than any dream she had ever had when he stopped she burst into tears he waited out the storm and offered no commentary as she wiped her eyes in fierce embarrassment when she was as composed as she was going to be he said i have to go now for a while be patient go on about your tasks tell no one that i came to you i promise i will come back all her high joy collapsed into bafflement and something like grief youre going away how can you do that i thought just for a while he said that is a promise she tried to argue but he deposited her neatly on the grass beside her pony ruffled her hair with his breath turned and vanished into the dazzle of sunlight and sudden tears kelyn had won this round of her long battle with nerys and she was proud of it but her hair felt odd and tight in its pins and braids and her long skirts were heavy and made it difficult to stride out as for riding her blueeyed pony that was hardly a womanly thing to do a woman had more than enough to occupy her between keeping the house overseeing the servants and making sure that the menfolk were fed clothed clean and content and now that she was a woman kelyn had to consider her duty to the family and the business to find a husband who would help them both to prosper it is a pity margits child was a girl her mother sighedas she did almost every day she never added the other thing the thing that mattered so much to so many people in the town that margits child and alis daughter hated each other with such singleminded intensity kelyn felt guilty about it as often as not but she simply could not stand the girl just being near her made kelyn want to hit somethingpreferably nerys on that particular day of summer while her womanhood was still fresh and uncomfortable like a new pair of shoes kelyn finished all her tasks early and won an hour to herself in this new life she was expected to fill it with needlework or study or else with dreaming about her future husbandif she had had any candidates which she did not the face that came to her when she closed her eyes was long and white with glassy pale eyes and it was buried in the grass of its paddock her pony was growing fat already with lack of exercise he needed to get outand so did she her old childish clothes were still in the press tucked under the stiff new skirts and petticoats she put them on with a kind of shamed relief they were so much more familiar than the gowns she wore now so much softer and more comfortable they were freer too she could move in them raid the kitchen for provisions groom and saddle a pony mount and slip out through the gate in the back garden and ride up the hill toward wizards wood no one in emmerdale remembered why the forest of pine and fir was called that it had the magic that all forests have of sweet scents and dappled shade and green silences but no wizard had ever come out of it and while the mage storms raged none had touched either emmerdale or the wood kelyns mother who sometimes startled people with the things she said had observed once that maybe the storms passed the town by because of the wood no one had paid any mind emmerdale was a perfectly ordinary perfectly unmagical place sometimes kelyn regretted that no one from emmerdale had ever been chosen and no mage had ever come from there her dreams of magic and of companions were only dreams as she rode under the trees following a path that led to the heart of the wood she rejected that thoughtfiercely almost angrily even if she was a woman now she was not done with dreams there was magic in the world she would see it feel it even touch itsomeday the woods heart was a low hill with a ring of stones on the summit whatever or whoever had put them there was long gone and whatever power the builders had had or meant to raise was gone with them grass grew there now and flowers that the children of emmerdale plaited into chains and strung from stone to stone why they did it or what purpose it might serve none of them could have said it was just what one did if one was in the circle no one else was there on this warm bright afternoon though there must have been at least one visitor earlier a string of daisies fluttered in the breeze wound around and around the tallest stone the flowers were barely wilted their yellow centers bright against the pitted grey rock kelyns pony snorted then did the most embarrassing thing she knew how to do she flipped her tail over her back and squatted kelyn slapped her neck hard you idiot theres no stallion here kelyn was wrong as it happened there was he had not been there an instant ago standing between two of the tall gray stones he was as white as snow and his eyes were pure and luminous blue his long mane rippled in the breeze that played around the hilltop his nostrils flared at the sharp scent of the mares longing but he was a great deal more than a stallion he dipped his head to her respectfully yet made no move to claim what she offered there was a hint of regret and apology that he must disappoint herall in the glint of an eye and the turn of an ear kelyn loved him for that suddenly and completely thank you she said you are welcome he answered everyone thinks shes just a pony kelyn said but shes a person i suppose you get a lot of that too occasionally he said his voice in her head was dryly amused your herald must get tired of setting people straight she said i can see that you do said the companion kelyn started to answer but then she stopped it had dawned on her belatedly that there was no one in whites standing near him then she realized what exactly he had said she went perfectly still inside and out the world around her was supernaturally clear she could hear every rustle of the wind in the grass and see every glint of sunlight on the stones and count each flower that sprang around the companions silver hooves she wanted to remember everything every breath every fraction of this moment you are kelyn he said and i am coryn and ive come for you will you sit on my back the pony offered no objection when kelyn slid out of the familiar saddle and tied up the reins so that she could graze if she chose for all the stallions attractions the grass to her mind was sweeter kelyn patted her neck a little sadly because a womans clothes had changed little after all but this changed everything the pony tilted an ear otherwise ignoring her the grass was delicious and she was hungry ponies were as unsentimental as living creatures could be kelyn turned away from her toward the being she had dreamed of since she was small he was waiting for her for her and no one else she sprang onto his back it was a long way up but she was agile and strong her only regret was that there was no human there to see it nerys would die of jealousy that brightened kelyns mood beyond measure coryn carried her from one end of the wood to the other striding long and smooth with power that made her heart sing he was wide through the back and barrel too which she would have to get used to but she would she had the rest of her life to do it she had expected to gallop into emmerdale in a blaze of glory but his circle took him back to the ring of stones and her pony dozing peacefully in the light of the westering sun there he halted and made it clear that she should dismount but she said i thought i know coryn said and you will i promise go home now keep this as our secret in a little while the world will know that i have chosen you and then youll have your dream thats not what any of the stories say kelyn said she should not have been so stubborn but she could not help herself every story is different the companion said this is yours and it is wonderful not if i have to go home without you she said its not for very long he said gentle but firm now hurry your mother is looking for you that was a shrewd blow kelyn glared but she gave way youd better come back soon she said tomorrow promise soon the companion said her companion who had chosen her that would keep her warm inside even if she could not tell anyone except maybe not even your mother said coryn youre worse than she is kelyn muttered she doesnt read my mind his laughter filled the circle and melted into sunlight when the dazzle faded from her eyes he was gone she was alone with her pony and her temper and the best secret she had ever had or hoped to have the next day was market day in emmerdale kelyn and nerys had duties there kelyn in her fathers shop among the bolts of wool and nerys in the livestock market where she kept the records of the sheep as they were bought and sold it was pure coincidence that the sheepfolds and the cloth market were at opposite ends of the square but it had served their families well over the years the white horse came trotting down the middle of the market at the stroke of noon his coat was dazzling in the sun his mane and tail streamed in the wind of his passage more than one young and not so young person reached out to catch hold of his bridle or tried to bar his way he never seemed to veer from his path nor did he slow or stop he simply was not there for those who hoped to make him choose them the center of the market was a fountain that had not run in living memory the well that fed it was dry as the companion came to a halt in front of it water bubbled up in the bowl filled it and spilled over into the basin below he lowered his chiseled white head and drank while the market watched in spreading silence two voices at once broke that silence from opposite ends of the square coryn nerys and kelyn ran toward him neither saw anything or anyone but the companion until they reached to embrace him in front of everyone and found themselves face to face instead the shock was as sharp as a slap it struck the words out of them and left them staring too shocked even for hate that came next so strong and so perfectly matched that no one who watched could have said who sprang first there would have been blood or worse if the companion had not set himself quietly and immovably between them they climbed up and over him yowling like forest cats his head snaked around and plucked first nerys and then kelyn off his back dropping them to the ground and looming over them until their yowling stopped it was kelyns mother alis who spoke for them both and for the whole town too they cant both be chosen we arent nerys cried i was chosen he came to me in the high pasture and he told me he came to me kelyn shouted over her i was in the stone circle in the wood and he the companion lifted his head and let out a ringing peal it sounded like laughterand from the girls expressions that was exactly what it was you cant do that they sang in chorus except it seemed he had the trouble with success herald egil said is that everyone expects you to succeed all over again his companion ignored him she had found an unusually succulent patch of grass and was savoring each leisurely mouthful she was all too obvious about it egil sighed and leaned back against a tree it had been an easy ride out from haven but there were still according to his map and herald bronwen another two days of it bronwen had ridden ahead she had little patience with what she called egils elderly waysthough he was hardly more than twice her ageand her companion fussed if he had to walk or trot all day they would be back by the time egil was ready to go meanwhile he was glad of the time to himself egil was a quiet person and a solitary one he had managed to evade the better known duties of a herald for years until an emergency and a dearth of available heralds had forced him out at the queens command he had done well on that errand put an end to a dangerous if inadvertent working of magic and saved a valley from spelling itself into nothingness unfortunately he had done so well that people had noticed now he had to go on another and equally peculiar errand just when he was getting comfortable again in his familiar place and space in egils perfect world he would never ride outside the collegium at all he would live his life between the classroom and the library and leave the heralding to those with more of a taste for it bronwen for example she came galloping back down the road mounted on her fiery companion like every childs dream of the queens own she was tall and slim and elegant her wheatgold hair plaited down her back and her seablue eyes flashing as rohanan reared to a halt directly in front of egil plain brown egil looked calmly up at the tall companion and the equally tall herald already he said the message was urgent bronwen said also odd arent you curious no worlds will end if we arrive an hour later than we planned egil said maybe not she said but a pair of chosen may have killed each other before we get there so were led to believe egil said he rose reluctantly and stretched and brushed at his whites there was a grass stain of course or two or three bronwen who was always immaculate visibly refrained from commentary the message must have been garbled it cant be one companion and two chosen somehow two companions showed up in the same town and chose a pair of enemies now theyre at each others throats and their families are at wits end that would be the logical conclusion wouldnt it said egil bronwens eyes narrowed you dont think well see soon enough he said its impossible she said how would it work would they ride double would they bring a remount is one supposed to kill the other and the survivor gets the companion its preposterous egil let her babble on while he mounted cynara and set out on the road to emmerdale bronwen was as different from egil as a human creature could be he did not particularly like her nor did she like him left to themselves they would have crossed paths seldom if at all certainly they would never be friends and yet somehow when they worked together it worked friction cynara said like flint and steel alone theyre nothing alike and they have little in common together they spark fire there was truth in that egil was dull gray flint bronwen was sharp and shining steel do you think he asked cynara he had no need to finish the thought she snorted softly youll see she said for the first day or two after coryn showed himself in the market kelyn could hardly see or think or even breathe she was so furious she alternated between storms of tears and fits of icy rage she so alarmed her family that they locked her in her room and put her under guard when she could shape a coherent thought which was not often she saw the wisdom in it if she got out if she had even the slightest chance she would hunt nerys down and kill her shut inside familiar walls under the unrelenting stare of her mother or her father or one of her many burly cousins she calmed slowly her anger was no less strong but her thoughts were clear again she began to feel other things besides rage shock disappointment and as the hours stretched into days a sensation that she could only recognize as grief he was always there she was too angry to speak to him but she felt him white and shining in the back of her mind she looked when she could stand to for the taint of nerys that must be on him but there was nothing only the whiteness and the warmth and the sense of rightness that stung like salt in an open wound by the fifth day kelyn knew what she had to do her watchdogs were as vigilant as ever but she saw a way around that she only had to wait a little longer and then she could act a herald was coming from haven to sort the confusion nerys was not supposed to know but her ears were keen and people were talking she knew that kelyn was locked in her house nerys could not go anywhere without a pair of her fathers apprentices in tow but she was allowed out she reckoned she had won this contest for what good it did either of them she could even have visited the companion if she had wanted to he was stabled in the best inn in emmerdale in the best stall and by all accounts was getting the very best of care she wished him well of it it hurt inside to keep her mind and body closed off from him but it hurt worse to think of sharing him with kelyn better for everybody if she pretended he had never come let alone pretended to choose her its not a pretense he said she shut him out so ferociously that she gave herself a crashing headache the pain was worth it she told herself he was gone she hoped his head was pounding as badly as hers the herald was due to arrive tomorrow people said they were all expecting him to decide which of the chosen was the real one then take her off to the collegium to earn her whites in her calmer moments nerys was sure she would be the one kelyn had put her hair up and submitted to the tyranny of skirts she could find herself a husband and get to work making heirs for both families it was logical and elegant and perfectly practical it also meant that nerys need never set eyes on kelyn again it should have felt wonderful and yet it did no such thing it felt like a blow to the gut this is wrong nerys said she was alone for once shut in her room like kelyn only she had locked herself in and could go out if she chose she had left dinner early pleading an indisposition that was only half feigned a choosing should have been a wonderful and joyous occasion not this stomachwrenching confusion the herald would resolve it but what if he did not what if he decided that kelyn was his chosen what then nerys would have to live with it except that she was not sure she could never to see coryn again never to hear his warm deep voice in her head or feel his warmth in her heartshe would die she would not want to live maybe that was the answer it was a terrible thing but she had never shrunk from anything that frightened her she had to think about it the herald was coming tomorrow whatever she did she should do it before he came that left her with little timebut it ought to be enough egil and bronwen rode into emmerdale in good time in spite of her fretting it was a little after noon on a beautiful summer day neither too hot nor too cold a few clouds drifted in the sky but none of them carried a burden of rain emmerdale was an unexpectedly pretty town it nestled amid green fields at the foot of a mountain range so small it barely rated a name to the west of it was a stretch of forest it reminded egil somehow of the pelagirs and yet it seemed as peaceful and empty of fear as a forest could be egils senses came to the alert the last such place had turned out to be under a dangerous and deadly spell but this one lacked a certain something foreboding maybe the deep hum of magic running underneath it all there was no ill magic in emmerdale egil would have laid a wager on it if he had been a wagering man the only strangeness here was basking in the sun in the field that belonged to the best inn the companion was a stallion and while he was not as tall as rohanan he was more substantially built his chosen should have been hanging on him unable to let him out of her sight or their sight if the message from emmerdale told the truth he was alone and he seemed content maybe he hasnt chosen anyone yet egil wondered aloud oh he has cynara said egil could not tell what she thought of it or of the stallion either her tone was unusually bland as if she had no opinion at all that egil could not believe cynara always had an opinion he glanced at bronwen she stood with her companion in a crowd of townspeople basking in their admiration they seemed to have forgotten that egil was there in spite of his whites and the shining coat of his companion that suited him admirably but bronwen was too hemmed in with people to either catch his glance or hear him if he asked the question that was in his mind he asked cynara instead and rohanan is he as noncommittal as you cynara did not trouble to answer egil had known she would do that he drew his breath in sharply as close to a fit of pique as he ever came fortunately for his peace of mind bronwen asked the other question the one that had brought them here pardon my impatience but your message was urgent there is a problem with the companions chosen the man who answered was no older than egil but he carried himself with an air of easy authority there is he said it seems hes been unable to make up his mind hes chosen two of our young women my daughter and hanses daughter i gather theyre not friends bronwen said both fathers rolled their eyes that they were friends was unmistakable which made it odder that their daughters were not they hate each other hanse said the other nodded theres no sense or reason to it it just is nothing ever just is bronwen said then maybe you can find out why they were born like that said hanse he sounded more tired than skeptical egil was in full sympathy with the man when bronwen did not ask the next and essential question egil did it for her where are they then sirs they started a little at the voice that to them must seem to come from nowhere hanse recovered first enough to answer secure under lock and key he said grimly well said the other more or less pitar hanse said by the powers you trust her i trust my daughter said pitar somewhat stiffly to do nothing foolish while under the watchful eyes of my apprentices so you hope said hanse people started to rumble around them some spoke for one some for the other a low growl of division that made egils nape prickle he had felt something like it before long ago while he was still a trainee within the hour there had been a riot egil interjected politely but firmly i think wed best begin our inquiry which of them would be closer that would be kelyn said hanse his voice and face were tight with a last glance at the companion who had done this baffling thing egil followed both pitar and hanse down through the town kelyn was not in her room the cousin who had been guarding her was almost in tears which was disconcerting he was head and shoulders taller than egils middle height and as broad as a barn door the tiny woman who had reduced him to a quivering wreck whirled on hanse in such a fire of fury that even egil fell back a step she went to the privy the woman said biting off each word two hours ago rickard only began to worry he tells me after an hour because every girl takes forever to do what she will do and then she said he was afraid to tell anyone i can hardly blame him for that said egil mildly the woman bridled then transparently remembered what his white uniform meant herald she said with prickly respect thank the powers youve come the girl has bolted if shes not with the companion someone had better make sure nerys is still home and safe pitar muttered something that sounded like a curse spun in the doorway and ran nerys was nowhere to be found either the apprentices who should have been shadowing her had fallen for the same ruse as kelyns cousin egil was not quite ready yet to find a pattern there but from what he was seeing and hearing he was inching toward a conclusion cynara he said in his mind since she was still out by the fields taking the opportunity to dine on sweet grass and be adored by a gaggle of children their companion must know where they are her reply was somewhat delayed and redolent of grass he says theyre not choosing to enlighten him he also says theyre not together how can he not egil broke off companions had a notorious habit of not telling their chosen everything they knew it could drive a herald mad egil did not intend to lose his sanity nor was he about to lose these two childrennot at least until he knew why one companion had chosen them both bronwen he said in the middle of the milling and expostulating that had taken over this part of the town he spoke softly but his heraldintern heard him they wont have gone far enlist some of the locals and go after nerys ill find kelyn time was when bronwen would have argued simply for the sake of arguing in this long warm summer afternoon she nodded and set about doing the sensible thing mind you egil thought if she decided my orders werent sensible shed perfectly well disobey them we are surrounded by obstreperous youth cynara said it was all egil could do not to break out in painful laughter as it was one or two townspeople looked at him oddly he pressed them into service tell me where kelyn would most likely go there were many opinions as to that but kelyns mother glared them all down there is one place where she goes when she needs to think she doesnt know anyone knows about it i wont betray your secret egil assured her the woman nodded brusquely called over one of the boys who had been hanging about staring at the heralds whites and said take him to the wizards wood to the stone circle maybe it would be best if you simply told me where to go egil said since shes likely to run if she sees anyone she knows she might her mother conceded well enough then galtier will take you to the edge of the wood stay on the track and dont let yourself be tempted to wander off it it will lead you to the circle thats clear enough egil said and i thank you he added a brief bow because she was worthy of respect that flustered her into a scowl go on she said before she gets all her thinking done and runs off the powers know where escape was almost too easy kelyn kept looking for pursuit but she had made it as far as the wizards wood without anyone seeing her they were all off gawping at the heraldsfor there were two of them coryn made sure she knew two heralds two companions kelyn hoped he felt the full force of her bitterness over that it seemed to trouble him not at all she shut him out once more diving into the solitude of her own mind that was not the most pleasant place to be such plan as she had was to ride her pony through the wood then keep on riding as far and fast as she could until coryn was no more than a memory a large part of her would rather stay and fight for him but kelyn had been raised to be practical it simply did not make sense for a companion to choose two heraldstobe she should be that one not nerys by the powers never nerys and yet as she endured the days of waiting for the herald to come kelyn had seen and felt what this unprecedented choosing was doing to emmerdale all her life she had done her best to outrun and outride and outsmart her rival this was the greatest contest of alland she was running away from it she hated nerys but she loved emmerdale more at last after so many years people were choosing between them lines were being drawn emmerdale was splitting down the middle half of its people convinced that nerys should be the chosen and half contending that kelyn deserved it more kelyn had never wanted that watching it happen tore at her heart coryn was a dream emmerdale was real whatever grief or pain it cost to her to rip herself away from the companion the thought of emmerdale splitting apart over it was worse it was the hardest thing she had ever done and the most necessary she kicked her pony into a canter down the familiar track in the whisper of pine boughs and the duskanddazzle light of the wood nerys had no time for anything but to throw a bridle on her pony and turn his head toward the mountain the pony had been pent up for days he was more than glad to burst out of the gate at a flat run nerys was not running away exactly she needed to think there was no chance of doing it in town with everyone in such an uproar and not just one but two heralds come to muddle what little sense anyone had left the last people she ever wanted to see were heralds who were truly chosen who had not been mocked with a false and bitter choosing its not false coryn said she refused to hear him he might be lurking in the hidden corners of her heart but she did not want him there or anywhere if a companion wanted her let him choose hernot force her to share with her worst enemy she more than half expected him to take issue with that but he seemed to have gone she refused to be disappointed let alone sad good she thought good riddance the track up to the high pasture seemed unusually long and arduous today nerys realized as she rode that she never had given willa her mothers message when she was there last coryns appearance had driven it straight out of her head that gave her an excuse at least ill get some use out of the whole sorry mess she said her pony slanted an ear at her bunched his hindquarters and sprang up the last and steepest part of the trail he paused on the pastures edge blowing hard nerys was breathing a little fast herself she slid off his sweaty back and led him the rest of the way taking her time until his breathing slowed and his body cooled she took her time rubbing him down too then washed him off and rubbed him again until he was respectably cool by that time willa should have come out of the hut or else come toward her from the edge of the pasture where the sheep were grazing but there was no sign of the shepherd that might not have meant anythingwilla did like to wander on occasionbut she had been gone half a tenday ago too and it felt odd the hut was cold inside with an air about its emptiness that said it had been abandoned for days the hearth was swept clean and willas few belongings were neatly stowed except for a halffilled water jar on the table and the last quarter of a loaf of bread gone rockhard and stale beside it willa never wasted food if she had left the bread there she had meant to eat it while it was fresh nerys started off running toward the sheep but she remembered just in time that neither the sheep nor their guardian dogs would respond well to human panic she made herself take a deep breath relax her body as much as she could and walk slowly and easily toward the cluster of woolly white bodies they were all well and all accounted for as far as nerys could tell the dogs did their own hunting they could survive a whole season on their own if they had to but willa was gone nerys told herself it had to be nothing the shepherd was out hunting or visiting her daughter over the mountain except she would never leave the sheep for more than a day and she would have taken the bread with her to eat nerys knew a little bit about tracking much of which she had learned from willa it was not much good on grass and after half a tenday she did not want to think about what that meant if willa had had a fall or been attacked or taken ill she would have been alone and abandoned for days it was all too likely she had not survived it no nerys said im not going to think like that shes somewhere she cant get out of but shes alive ill find her ill bring her back the sheep ignored her one of the dogs pricked its ears at the sound of her voice but she was neither a sheep nor a predator she did not matter in its world she stood still taking long calming breaths willa could be anywhere on the mountain but there were hunting runs she favored and nerys knew the way to willas daughters village she had gone there with the shepherd more than once that might be the easy and therefore the wrong way but it was a start if something had happened with luck willas daughter had been expecting her mother and when she did not appear had gone searching herselfand willa was safe in highrock maybe with an ague or a sprain or at worst a broken leg nerys paused to fill a waterskin and carve off a wedge of strong sheeps cheese from the wheel that hung in the hut she found a net bag of fruit too that were soft but still good with water and provisions and a firm refusal to panic nerys set out on the path to the village she left her pony behind he was tired and the path was narrow and steep she could search it better and faster on foot under the best conditions it took most of a morning to climb and scramble and occasionally stroll to highrock usually willa stayed the day and the night and came back the next morning though when nerys had been with her she had gone both ways in a day nerys concentrated on finding the path and then keeping her feet on it with no little guilt she realized she was glad to do this it was a distraction it kept her from having to think about what waited for her in emmerdale maybe she should spend the rest of her life hunting down the missing the world must be full of them it was like being a herald in a way she could still be a herald somehow if she wanted i dont want it she said she had come to the summit of the first of three ridges the track was narrow here and slippery with gravel and scree a little ahead the cliff dropped away sheer plunging down to a narrow valley and a ribbon of river there was no sign of willa herenot on the track and not broken on the rocks below nerys did not know whether to be relieved the rest of the way was less perilous but it was steep and stony and parts of it tended to wash away in storms a little way past the cliff nerys paused to rest and breathe and sip from the waterskin the leathery taste of the water made her think of other times she had traveled this way somehow without quite understanding why she felt tears running down her cheeks willa would say she had filled her cup of troubles and now it was running over if she closed her eyes she could hear the warm rough voice and feel the shepherds presence close by her just a little warmer on her skin than the sun nerys had always been able to feel things and people when they were nearby or when they were thinking about her she had never thought of it as magic especially since kelyn had it too it was just a thing they could do up on top of the world she knew all torn with confusion over coryn and kelyn and willas disappearance nerys felt as if she had walked right out of her skin she knew where willa was she could feel it smell it taste it it was stone and running water and the whisper of wind in leaves there was nowhere like that on this track and yet it felt as close as the next turn when nerys tried to focus on it the thought that came to her was like a fold in fabric but the fabric was the world maybe the mage storms had touched her part of the world after all if they had and if willa had fallen into the strangeness that they left nerys was no mage she knew nothing of magic she would panic when she knew for certain she needed her eyes for the path but she focused her mind as much as she could following the sense and the memory of willa it could be a trap her gut insisted it was not it was hard to travel in two worlds to keep from tripping and falling on her face even while she held fast to the thread of sensation that was all she had to guide her another presence slid beneath her lifted her up and held her steady it was coryn and he neither asked nor expected permission the simple arrogance of it made her breath catch but she was not a complete idiotshe needed all the help she could get then something else came into focus in and through him something clear and bright and clean that sharpened all her senses and made her immeasurably stronger it was as if she had lived in a fog all her life and now suddenly she could see the sun she could not afford to go all giddyor to realize what and who must be doing this willa was trapped in a slant of sunlight in a bend of the path that did not exist in the world she had thought she knew the key was in nerys hand and heart but the way was only open while the sun was in the sky among these tumbled ridges and sudden cliffs night came fast and early it had been after noon when nerys left the pasture the sun had sunk visibly since she had to hurry which on that track was no easy thing she found the place where the trap had closed it looked like nothing a sharp bend among many on the steep path and a sudden drop where the track had washed away a trickle of water seemed to run there out of nowhere and into nowhere the sun sparkled on it steady coryn said with that echo behind him hold fast to me dont let go she knew he was not physically there but he was present in every way that mattered the other beyond him made a chain and that chain bound her to the world she stepped through the suns door into madness egils guide left him as instructed with a clear track ahead of him and alis admonitions still ringing in his ears a small needling voice kept insisting that he had followed the wrong one but bronwen was well capable of handling whatever she found in the sheep pasture egil needed to be here the path was well traveled egil occupied himself and entertained cynara by inviting her to dance down it she did love the dance of horse and rider and under the trees in and out of sun and dappled shade it was a wonderfully pleasant way to spend an afternoon it cleared his head splendidly when the sunlight spread wide over the hill with its crown of stones he was calm and focused and ready for whatever he might find it seemed at first to be nothing remarkable a slim darkhaired girl sat on a white pony inside the circle the pony grazed peacefully the girls eyes were closed and her face was turned to the sky she looked like her mother even at rest she had a hint of alis fierce edge as cynara halted in front of the pony kelyns eyes snapped open her companionfor he was that egil could not mistake itstepped delicately past egil and presented himself for mounting no she said i dont want you he tossed his splendid white head and stamped kelyns face set in adamant refusal the pony bucked her off on that thick turf the damage must have been more to her pride than her backside she stared up at the traitor in utter disbelief they always side with companions egil said in wry sympathy get up now and do as he tells you do you know what hes asking she demanded not specifically he said will you enlighten me ask her the girl snapped jutting her chin at cynara egil had to admit that her complete lack of awe was refreshing it was also not unheard of in the newly chosen in those first heady days it was hard to see or hear or think about anyone but the magical white being who had come only and purely for them in this case of course that was not true egil did not need to ask cynara it was in every line of the girls body nerys is in trouble he wants you to help worse said kelyn she looked ready to spit he wants me to stop hating her and start facing the reason why because youre exactly alike egil said everything you hate in her is everything you hate in yourself everything you love about yourselfin someone else it grates horribly that makes you wonder and then it makes you twitch its enough to drive a person out of her mind is that where she is gone mad not yet she said he says theres a rift in the fabric of the world another of those plaguebegotten storm remnants and shes gone through it to save a life or maybe a mind hes not exactly clear egils lightness of mood such as it was evaporated he held on to his calm because he was going to need it ah he said i see he bent his gaze on the girls companion coryn cynara said coryn said egil with an inclination of the head which the companion returned if you will take us to her no time said kelyn its leagues away and the sun is going down the sun keeps it open once its gone egil eyed her narrowly cynara he said aloud with the courtesy of heralds is that true it is true cynara said egil nodded oblivious to kelyns glare i did wonder if my worst enemy were about to wink into nothingness i might not be terribly inclined to do something about it she is not my enemy kelyn burst out i just cant stand her i dont want her dead either she turned on coryn i get your pointall of you ill help get her out of there but im not your chosen i wont be anybodys second best she is not cynara said from kelyns expression coryn had said the same kelyn did not look ready to believe it but she pulled herself from her ponys back to coryns and for all her resistance she could not keep herself from running her hand down his neck she drew herself up with a visible effort he needs you to help she said to egil shes on the other side of thewall i think he means rift something he can guide her out but he wants to open the rift here in order to do it its a stronger place he says and safer to stand on with you and the other herald and your companions he thinks hell almost have enough strength egil opened his mouth to point out that bronwen and rohanan had gone the other way but before he could speak they cantered into the circle bronwen looked ruffled and out of sorts the way she always did after she had lost an argument rohanan says we need to be here she said you do said egil hes told you what happened she nodded are we doing another dance they had helped a quadrille of riders to close a much larger rift not so long ago by performing a spell that was framed in the movements of the equestrian art but this was different well follow his lead egil said tilting his head toward coryn bronwen sighed faintly as if she would have preferred the quadrille egil most certainly would her companion came to stand on the other side of coryn gently nudging the pony out of the way coryn raised his head on his back kelyn had closed her eyes again she held out her hands bronwen took one egil took the other it was thin but strong and it trembled slightly the child was either furious or terrified egil would have wagered on both were ready he said theyre ready said coryn in the midst of howling nothingness the only solid thing in all that incomprehensible place was an honest miracle nerys had fallen on top of a warm and yielding object that protested in willas voice the shepherd was alive apparently sane and profanely glad to be found nerys wrapped her arms around the tall and substantial body willa stiffened then closed the embrace if nerys closed her eyes she could almost stand to be here the screaming that was not wind and not voices at least not human or animal or anything of earthstill battered at her but she could focus on the soft voice in her mind and almost after a fashion shut out the ungodly clamor coryns voice led to something else it was like an image in a mirror or another part of herself she and kelyn were cousins people said they could be sisterstwins even what with having been born on the same day what if they were more than that they could not be the same person that was impossible if each had half a soul she certainly did not feel the lack maybe it was that they were meant to be something new something larger than either of them something that fit perfectly through a companion washed in the white light that was coryn kelyn did not grate on her nearly as badly he softened the raw edges he muted the dissonance that had always clanged between them the fragment of it that was left gave her a foothold in this hideous notplace the stabbing of irritation helped her focus coryns presence was a light and a guide through it she saw the world she belonged in and the person she belonged withkicking screaming protesting but in the end neither of them could escape it there was a wrenching a tearing a rending of mind and soul and substance all the way down to the core of her she had never felt such painnor had the companion nor kelyn whose will and strength were all that kept nerys mind and body from shattering the nothingness tore asunder nerys fell forever down and down into endless light the rays of the setting sun slanted through the standing stones out of one fell a large and amorphous shape that resolved into a slim girl with a glossy black braid and a broadshouldered massive woman who levered herself to her feet looked about her and said thank the powers i was afraid wed end up in a sorcerers lair would i lead you that far astray nerys demanded but there was no mistaking the affection in her tone she faced the heralds and the companions and last but never least her rival thank you she said for both of us egil moved to respond but kelyn was already speaking youre welcome she said stiffly youre not hurt either of you were well now were out of that place nerys said she shuddered what was it gone coryn answered you really do think like a horse said kelyn he does nerys agreed that felt strange kelyn was not sure she liked it listen she said ive made up my mind you can have him go be a herald i dont need the glory and my family needs me here and mine doesnt said nerys go ahead keep him you know thats all youve ever wanted what we think we want isnt always what we ought to get kelyn said she had always thought her mother was a sour and cynical woman for saying so but in that moment in that place she understood perfectly she slid down off coryns back though it was brutally hard even harder than closing a rift in the fabric of the world goodbye she said i dont know why you did this but were done now its one chosen to one companion we all know that not here coryn said think said nerys what will we do ride double well kill each other take turns on patrol whats the point in that just choose one of us and be done with it i wont die if its not me i might want to but i wont no coryn said why kelyn demanded why are you so stubborn why do you hate her so much i just do kelyn said that was not exactly true it used to be but now instead of the itching and crawling that had always beset her when she was near nerys she felt nothing she looked at her old enemy and through habit wanted to hate her but it was as if the rift had swallowed up all the hate no said nerys following her thoughts through corynarguing as always that was still the same its him coryn hes doing it i still dont like you kelyn said but i can stand to look at you heralds dont have to like each other herald bronwen said her eyes were on egil their expression made perfect sense to kelyn they just have to be able to work together with the same companion asked kelyn how are we supposed to do that it was nerys who answered i dont know but i think were supposed to try i think so too egil said look at what you did the three of you you saved a life and disposed of a powerful threat thats what heralds do you did it as its never been done before two together with the companion between it wouldnt have been possible if there had been just one of you he was right kelyn had to admit it its allowed then if we can stand it im not riding double nerys said id rather walk we can take turns said kelyn and take our ponies for the rest of the time at least i will im not leaving brighteyes behind you think id abandon cloud no kelyn said i dont think you would its settled then said egil he shook his head gods and powers help us all that they will said coryn the other companions nodded dipping their beautiful white heads it was a blessing and a promisewith a spark of mirth whatever the humans might think of it all the companions were inordinately pleased with it kelyn would not go that far her heart was beating hard and she was dizzy caught between joy and terror but mostly what she felt in spite of everything was joy be careful what you wish for by nancy asire nancy asire is the author of four novels twilights kingdoms tears of time to fall like stars and wizard spawn wizard

cats and two vintage corvairs they still followin us doron rose in his stirrups and looked dont see nobody he said settling down into his saddle and letting his winded horse rest maybe they gave up ferrin ferrin snorted likely he was a big man was ferrin tough as they come as leader of this small band he radiated authority an authority accompanied by a big right fist if necessary doron turned to the man at his left and grimaced jergen was pretty much the opposite in all ways from ferrin slender sandy hair always falling in his eyes he never had much to say but when he did the rest of them tended to listen damn pack horses slow us down jergen grumbled letting their lead ropes go slack only got two and wed be farther away ifn we didnt have em aint no cure for that chardo another big man rode to dorons right doron nodded no cure for that for sure behind them theyd left a merchants caravan in disarray two of its guards dead or wounded enough theyd hardly pose a problem the other three were the danger the chase hadnt lasted long vomehls skill with the bow keeping their pursuers at bay maybe we bit us off a little bit moren we could chew doron thought gerran lay dead behind them taken in the neck by a lucky swordstroke he offered a brief prayer to vkandis sunlord that gerran might find a better life in the hereafter so now they were only five ferrin jergen chardo vomehl and himself with the element of surprise on their side it had seemed a fairly sure thing five of the merchants guards and six of them didnt turn out that way truth be told the caravan guards were obviously better fighters and now that the son of the sun a female son of the sun had repealed many of the laws that had governed karse for generations and had reined in the worst of the offending priests things were changing here on the border between valdemar and karse theyd even heard rumors solaris had hired mercenaries from the guild to hunt down bandit bands and had plans to arm villagers if that was true their future could turn out to be a very bleak one so chardo asked what dwe do next ferrin was silent doron watched his leader from the corners of his eyes this raid hadnt gone well and ferrin was smarting over it the bandit chief shrugged guess we aint got no choice he responded lifting his reins make for yonder grove and we can see what these packhorses carry he glanced at doron dont think those caravan guards will keep after us now only three of em and we outnumber em and we know the land round here they dont doron relaxed somewhat now that ferrin was making decisions again things were righting themselves the grove was a resting place for the band somewhere they could make camp before returning to their stronghold in the hills if fortune smiled the contents of the packs theyd snatched from the caravan would prove enough to keep them in food clothing and supplies for some time to come unless of course the rumors were true and the guild came looking for them tomar had been this way before only going in the opposite direction yet the land he rode through looked the same smelled the same brought back memories in a rush the setting sun seemed right to him it had always seemed a bit out of place in haven too far to the south it had taken some getting used to after he and his family had fled karse years back for the safety of valdemar and all because of his witch powers which would have doomed him to the fires yet his gift was slight and he knew it a small power of empathy the ability to put folk at ease to lower mental barriers and encourage them talk to him when otherwise they would have been reticent to say much of anything a gift nonetheless chosen mindspoke keesha one cannot change what one is born with and your gift has proven itself numerous times dont sell yourself short tomar leaned forward and stroked his companions neck warmth filling him as always when sharing thoughts with her im not dismissing it keesha its just that he let the thought die sometimes it was hard to watch those other heralds who had gifts far more powerful than his yet he knew he would not have been chosen unless he had something of value to offer the world companions did not make mistakes in their choosing and lest you think yourself all that unimportant keesha continued a herald who was born in karse who knows the land the language and the customs can be invaluable in the coming days truth if what had recently happened in karse with the election of a new son of the sun whose very existence as a woman ruler was earthshaking and if the potential alliance between valdemar and karse solidified there would be need of heralds who spoke fluent karsite even more valuable those who had been born in karse keesha snorted softly not needing mindspeech to tell him he was thinking straight well i suppose youre right as usual tomar admitted he glanced to the west at the sun sinking closer to the horizon were going to have to find a place to camp for the night if i remember theres a sheltered grove with a clearing in it not all that far ahead has a stream for water and the trees offer some protection lets make for it keesha and let tomorrow take care of itself once theyd reached the grove doron and jergen had hobbled the horses and now stood watching ferrin sift through the packs theyd stolen from the merchants caravan doron hunched his shoulders feeling unease in the group rising what theyd hoped would be goods they could barter in return for food and clothing turned out to be books books as if any one in this area of karse cared for books even if they could read he could read and cipher some his parents had sent him to what passed for a village school in these parts not that he was all that interested in sitting down and plowing his way through a thicket of words or numbers his parents had held lofty expectations for their only son perhaps he could become a scribe who traveled from village to village writing down various agreements between villagers to be sanctioned later by local priests so much for that wish his parents had died of a winter flux and he at the awkward age of twelve became an orphan all that schooling and he didnt know a damned thing about farming his aunt and uncle had taken over the little farm with the intent of keeping it in the family their attitude toward doron had been much the same as if theyd been caught out in a violent storm with no cover handy for several years theyd tried their best to make a go of it but having little experience farming theyd finally sold the land to a neighbor now sixteen and finding himself cast adrift hed tried to live on what little money his aunt and uncle had granted him from the sale hed done odd jobs here and there but when his money ran out and no one seemed likely to hire him hed joined ferrins band of outlaws choosing that life over starving to death they had become his family been so for nigh on five years books damn it to all the hells ferrin exploded who be interested in books we could always use em for fuel chardo ventured burn right nice i think ferrin growled something wont get us no food chardo or dyou think you can eat words chardo subsided doron shifted uneasily as ferrin opened the packs from the second horse well now what we got here ferrin lifted something and held it up for inspection his big hands tore open the bindings by all the demons below he bellowed paper books and paper doron cringed and for this gerran lay dead behind them could be worse jergen said village priests always need paper they might even find somethin to use in them books there ferrin angrily jammed the paper in the pack you best hope that be so he snapped or we may go hungry real soon least we got waybread to eat tonight chardo said gettin sick of that stuff myself doron offered in a conversational tone glad we got some supplies waitin for us when we get home ferrin muttered something vile under his breath at least he hadnt lashed out at dorons comment it was just bad luck real bad luck how was anyone to guess the merchant would be carrying items that werent in demand out here on the border nothing anyone could do about bad luck wish things been different chardo said wish we couldve got somethin worth while sudden noise made them all turn theyd left vomehl at the edge of the grove bow in hand to serve as sentry in case the caravan guards had followed or vkandis forbid some of the guild had turned up vomehl rode into the clearing by the stream his face hard to read in the dusk someone comin he said tethering his horse to a tree seen im a ways off doron stiffened his hand automatically going to his sword recognize im ferrin asked no light not the best but i could see enough white horse and white rider a chill ran down dorons spine white horse white rider that could only be a herald a herald from valdemar what in vkandis name was a herald doing out in this part of the borderlands a demonrider on a hellhorse chardo shuddered in an automatic response to fear you sure trust my own eyes vomehl said be headed our way ferrin straightened a look of anticipation crossing his face our lucks turned comin in from behind you vomehl nodded then we be lessn charitable not to welcome im to our fire ferrin said with a nasty grin doron you and jergen hide left of the trail chardo me and you wait to the right vomehl you and that bow of yours make this demonrider and his hellhorse wish theyd never come this way now move tomar rode toward the grove deep in thought though fairly new to his whites he had asked for and been granted leave of absence to seek out kin in karse as far as he knew he still had aunts uncles and cousins living near the edge of the border between valdemar and karse and for years he had wanted to seek them out tomar always wondered what had happened to the relatives they had left behind when he and his family fled his father mother and sister had settled into a fairly normal existence in valdemar made all the more secure because of tomars gift now after attaining a position none of them had ever dreamed of his heart had turned to the rest of his family with the possible normalization between karse and valdemar it seemed a good time to make the journey you dont think this is a stupid idea do you keesha he asked why should i think that chosen family is always important and this gives you a chance to see your homeland again tomar smiled he looked ahead at the large stand of trees just about where he remembered it from his earlier days in karse the light was fading fast and the sooner he and keesha found a place to camp the better he would feel he had seen no one on his journey through the borderlands thus far only a remote farm or two aside from that he imagined they would encounter few people he still felt it a bit risky to be riding as a herald into a country that had been an enemy for so long despite all the reforms of the son of the sun and yet given the choice of venturing into his native land disguised and riding a horse of no distinction he had been unwilling to leave keesha behind oh keesha could ghost after him but the physical closeness of companion and rider was one thing tomar did not want to lose nor do i keesha said it would have been lonely without you on my back the warmth of their bond filled tomars heart with joy how could anyone be more fortunate than to have been chosen by such a being as keesha wiseso very very wiseelder partner in all he did she filled an inner space he had not realized lay empty reaching the edge of the trees he rode a bit to his left then cautiously urged keesha forward down the trail he found the light was getting chancy enough that he did not want to risk a fall on uneven ground it grew darker under the trees and he radiated his concern to his companion do you think chosen keeshas mindspeech was suddenly urgent horses ahead we need to get out of this place this could be very bad for us tomar came alert in an instant he reined keesha around where keesha screamed it was a scream of both a horse and the mental cry of a companion tomar grabbed for the saddle as keesha reared a heavy weight tore him from her back he landed hard on the ground partially smothered by two large men who pinned him down his last view of keesha was of his companion racing off toward the edge of the grove he heard the thrum of an arrow being released as a searing blow of pain ripped across his consciousness blackness filled his mind doron stared at the bound herald who lay unconscious by the fire vomehl had returned his head hanging and a sour look on his face hed loosed several arrows but he knew hed hit the hellhorse only once hellhorse doron grimaced the son of the sun had said there were no hellhorses no demonriders most everyone in karse would be slow to change longstanding beliefs about the heralds of valdemar and their unnatural mounts but change they must because it was the will of vkandis spoken through the son of the sun ferrin sat next to the herald a calculating expression in his dark eyes chardo and jergen had passed out waybread and everyone had settled down to eat doron kept glancing at the herald there was something familiar about the man but doron couldnt place it chewing the last bit of waybread he washed it down with a cup of water from the stream damn what was it why was this herald so familiar what you goin tdo with im vomehl asked what dyou think ferrin answered ransom im magine his folk will pay a pretty price to get im back again doron wiped his nose to keep his expression hidden oh yes a pretty price and just who could they find whod negotiate that the herald groaned slightly and stirred as best he could bound as he was with stout ropes ferrin leaned over grasped the man by his hair and lifted his face to the firelight what you be doin here he demanded think he understands you asked jergen dont know ferrin growled throwing an icy look in jergens direction maybe and maybe not ferrin hissed something under his breath and let the heralds head fall back but in that short time doron suddenly realized why the herald seemed so familiar it was his face the set of his eyes his chin his cheek bones take away the passage of time that changed the features of anyone who survived childhood and what was left he could swear hed seen this man before years back when both of them were young when hed escaped the fires himself because his own witchpowers hadnt grown strong enough for the priests to notice the small birthmark over the heralds right eye convinced him vkandis protect this man was his cousin tomar opened his eyes and winced in pain from the blow to the back of his head firelight flickered across the features of those who had ambushed him sitting directly next to him was a big man whose face was unforgiving as a slab of rock the other men were of all sorts tall short lighthaired and dark one and all they went clad in roughspun clothes their boots scuffed and worn but their weapons were clean and appeared well cared for he closed his eyes again tried to ignore his headache and the anxiety twisting his heart keesha youre hurt did they the response he received from his companion melted the ice in his soul ill be fine chosen im in a little pain but all right the arrow grazed the top of my neck i was very lucky that the archers aim was a little off and you bound head hurts there are five of them but you know that bandits i suppose where are you wry amusement filled keeshas reply close sneaking around in the trees unfortunately there are too many of them for me to be of much help getting you out of there the man who wounded me is no mean shot well have to think of something else the big man sitting next to tomar said something in karsite dont let them know you speak the language keesha said play ignorant that could aid us in the long run tomar nodded inwardly easy enough maybe just maybe he could change their attitude toward one they had always considered an enemy perhaps they had yet to hear the words of the son of the sun that heralds were not demons or they had and their ingrained superstitions still held them fast yet he might be able to use his gift to ease them from their hatred and fear to make them comfortable in his presence im going to try it keesha im going to project what gift i have it could turn things around enough for them to let me go ill be watching dear heart and ill never be far away thats not a bad idea i wish you luck with it ferrin gave up trying to get a response from the herald doron frowned ferrins reaction wasnt what he was used to seeing in the past he would have tried to beat his victim into talking sometimes merely to take out his frustrations but ferrin only sat staring at the herald a somewhat puzzled expression on his face now what we goin to do asked jergen he dont speak our language ill think of somethin ferrin said doron sat frozen shaken by the knowledge his cousin lay tightly bound by the campfire when hed seen the birthmark that was all he needed to be convinced the herald was tomar it had been a sad day for doron when hed learned tomar and his family had fled karse all those years ago not that they were all that close though they had become friends farms hereabouts lay far enough apart that folk seldom got together unless it was to help each other during harvest but those days still remained fresh in his memory he and tomar had played together had wound up in the trouble young boys could so easily find when tomar began to exhibit his witchpowers doron had first reacted in fear he wasnt afraid of tomarwell not exactly no he was more fearful tomar would be given up to the fires if any priest recognized what he might become and now doron faced a terrible conflict he couldnt let his longlost cousin be harmed yet his loyalty to his companions was all he had left in the world they were what passed for family had been for years an odd feeling of ease stole through his mind he glanced at jergen and chardo and saw theyd relaxed some werent as edgy as before even vomehl had set his bow aside no longer keeping it trained on the herald dorons own inner power reacted to something he couldnt place a name to he felt certain however tomar was its source you said our lucks changed vomehl said how be that ferrin we got ourselves a demonrider with nowhere to take im i said id think of somethin ferrin said rubbing his stubbled chin who we goin to take im to chardo asked maybe one of the priests could arrange for ransom jergen suggested dont think so jergen vomehl said likely his fellow demonriders will come lookin for im and then where will we be i said id think of somethin ferrin repeated doron blinked in amazement not even a moonturn before ferrin would have backhanded the man foolish enough to question him now all ferrin could say was hed think of something it been your idea chardo complained we couldve just brought im down and left he wouldnt have knowed what hit im my idea now some heat entered ferrins voice damned right chardo aint none of the rest of you had any bright ideas lately doron shook his head no group of men living close as they did could go day after day week after week without some minor quarrels but this reminded him of times when hed seen strong drink lower inhibitions when men would say things theyd normally keep locked behind their teeth our lucks turned you said vomehl stared into the fire so what we got ourselves now got us a demonrider and nowhere to take im since you be the one with all the ideas ferrin come up with one for this situation doron cleared his throat calm down everyone we aint got no choice we got im and we got to figure out what to do with im vomehl you think maybe you killed the heralds horse no dammit and i be a better shot than that cursed hellhorse mustve dodged at the last moment doron tried to sound utterly reasonable then how bout we leave im bound here and ride out at first light why dyou say that ferrin demanded growing more belligerent than ever because doron said keeping his voice level if his horse ran off hard tellin where it went to perhaps to get help you want to face down a group of angry heralds dorons right jergen sat up straighter been a mistake to capture im to begin with whole damned bunch of you gettin weakwilled ferrin snapped we got im and im goin to make somethin of it we got nothin but books and paper and it aint sure we can barter that least we can try to get a ransom out of im doron looked away so much for his attempt to help his cousin now ferrin would be calling all the shots at least that was normal it was not easy projecting his gift while suffering from a splitting headache what was nearly second nature now became an effort tomar tried to concentrate harder but that only made his head hurt worse however from what he could tell the bandits were responding their mental defenses lowered enough for them to start arguing among themselves he could only hope this was not normal behavior if he could just keep trying he might be able to convince them nothing would be served by keeping him captive he looked at each man in an attempt to see who his gift had affected the most certainly not ferrin obviously chief of this band the bowman who had wounded keesha had grown peevish as had the two men named chardo and jergen tomar thought he had the best chance of influencing the fifth man who had suggested leaving him behind the fifth man the one who seemed oddly familiar but whose name was quite common in karse he listened to the bandits snipe at each other aware he had loosened control over their tongues they probably never confronted their leader this way even outlaws needed discipline especially when away from their stronghold its hard keesha he mindspoke aware without looking that his companion lurked unseen somewhere in the trees and brush my head feels like its splitting open i know chosen i can feel it keep trying theyll have to sleep sometime maybe then you i doubt it theyll take turns watching through the night theyre away from their base and they wont rest easy until they get home tomar sighed even if all of them slept keesha would be hard pressed to take down the entire group and he was bound tightly of no help whatsoever he glanced around the fire at the outlaws who still argued among themselves the fifth man kept silent eyes glinting in the firelight who was he nothing about him stood out to tomar he could have been any number of men from this area of karse but aside from being familiar it was as if he had power of his own though it lay banked hidden from all but the most intrusive probes keesha i think ive got an idea these outlaws possess a lot of buried animosity instead of making them trust me as ive been able to do with people in the past ive lessened their inhibitions to the stage theyre quarreling what would happen if my gift was stronger if i could lay bare the injustices they feel their anger at each other over slights in the past then what chosen youre hoping theyd come to blows and possibly wound each other if i could do it thats a possibility and if i succeeded there might be fewer of them for you to immobilize he swallowed heavily but my gift isnt that strong and i cant stand to see you hurt again then lets try this keesha responded ill add power to yours and between us we could be more than one alone tomar inwardly nodded in assent he felt the touch of keeshas mind intensify on his own added to the familiar warmth that came with the connection and then as if he had taken some stimulant strength poured into him from keesha augmenting his gift lets see how they deal with this he said to keesha its worth a try and it could work doron felt tension mounting again only this time on the verge of explosion his own thoughts clamored in a jumble he remembered times when hed been pushed aside when his opinions had been overlooked just because he was the youngest didnt mean he should be he shoved his anger aside not that what he remembered was untrue but hed always had better control over himself than this he glanced at tomar at the odd expression on the heralds face maybe that came from the blow to his head or something else entirely and whyd you decide to attack that particular caravan jergen asked staring at ferrin five men guarded it you be the one who always said we only go after forces much smallern us six aint all that much of an advantage greedy chardo muttered always wantin more and more and more ferrins eyes nearly popped from his head shut your mouth you useless piece of call me a useless piece hey ferrin member the time you left me behind in our last raid vomehls chin jutted out oh youll be all right you said got that damned bow of yours and what bout you chardo jergen growled always runnin your mouth nearly got us in trouble last village we stopped in who elected you captain chardos hand drifted to the hilt of his dagger you be more insultin than ferrin betimes insultin ferrin stood ill show you insultin chardo he glared at the men around the fire only reason i put up with you is we be stronger together than alone i be bettern the whole lot of you smarter faster and chardo jumped to his feet think you be so tough ferrin i could take you down and not breathe hard after you treat me like i be stupid or somethin stupid you be moren that twice stupid most like doron buried his head in his hands everyone seemed to be losing control he glanced up in time to see ferrin and chardo stalking each other knees slightly bent circling the fire the dagger in chardos hand glittered in the firelight jergen turned to vomehl and keep your hands off that bow dont want to end up with an arrow in my gut spose i aint thought of that many a time vomehl snapped you act like you be the only voice of reason in the whole wide world like none of us got sense the god gave a goat to figure things out doron felt sweat start on his forehead a fight between ferrin and chardo could leave one of them wounded or dead the anger he sensed between jergen and vomehl could also spark into violence in no time at all he needed to do something but he was afraid of what he could do his witchpowers gave him a solution but he was half afraid of using them chardo struck out nearly knifing ferrin in the side that settled it doron stood backed off into the darkness clamped his jaw tight and concentrated the grove suddenly filled with the sound of neighing horsesmany horses their own mounts snorted and shifted nervously vomehl and jergen glanced around their faces gone tight in fear distant shapes appeared off in the gloom eyes gleaming in the darkness hellhorses jergen shouted they be comin for us ferrins hand snaked out and grabbed chardos knife hand stop you idiot that damned horse gone and got himself friends jergen and vomehl scrambled to their feet i aint waitin around to find out jergen yelled stay here ifn you want too many to shoot run for it chardo looked off into the night oh crap he sheathed his dagger and crashed off into the brush and trees following jergen and vomehl for a long moment ferrin stood rooted by the fire the sound of the approaching horses grew even louder he aimed a kick at the bound herald missed and sprinted off after chardo hidden in the brush doron sought to keep the illusion as real as he could possibly make it when he could no longer hear his outlaw companions he crept forward circling around so he approached tomar from behind he drew his dagger and began sawing at the ropes binding tomar fast your horse be waiting for you somewhere close he said you aint got much time now get out of here tomar theyll be back soon as i lower the illusion the heralds eyes grew round as an owls go dammit i cant keep this up forever tomar struggled to a kneeling position sensation flooding back into his arms as the ropes fell away the face of the man before him settled at last into recognizable features he blinked in the firelight not trusting what he was seeing doron he said his voice cracking cousin is that really you it be me keesha im here chosen tomar glanced over his shoulder as his companion edged into the clearing dried blood stained the utter whiteness of her neck but aside from that she appeared untouched he looked at doron who slowly backed away unease in every move he made keesha wont hurt you tomar said in fact shes fallen in love with you what you saved me and she thinks youre wonderful i wont be ifn you dont get on that horse and leave ferrin and the rest of em wont stay off in the woods til morning and i cant maintain my illusion forever sure enough the sound of uncanny creatures shrilling their anger still filled the grove only now seeming to follow the fleeing outlaws but how did you escape the fires tomar asked scrambling to his feet he rubbed his stiff arms and ankles to get the circulation flowing again came late to my witch powers and managed to avoid the priests tomar threw both arms around keeshas neck in a brief hug then gently traced the bloody track the arrow had left behind come back to valdemar with me doron youll be safe there doron shook his head cant dont force what cannot be keesha said her mindspeech tinged with regret its his decision chosen maybe in the future tomar retrieved his sword and dagger from where ferrin had dropped them he met and held dorons eyes aunt chalva uncle lomis where are they his parents doron winced slightly dead winter flux nearly died myself uncle branno and aunt savia took me in tried to keep the farm goin couldnt so they sold it left me with next to nothin joined ferrin and the rest when i was starvin he spread his hands dont you see tomar they be all i got they be my family now cant leave em he licked his lips not yet least wise but tomar please get out of here i be losing my hold on the illusion cant keep it going much longer hes right keesha interposed im amazed he can divide his attention like this but his strength is weakening you dont want to throw away the help hes given you do you a flood of sorrow washed over tomar he reached out and clasped hands with the cousin he had set off to visit in a world he had erected in his own mind a world that could never be save in memory all right but remember this doron theres a place in valdemar waiting for you and for what you did i cant find enough words to thank you he set foot in stirrup and mounted keesha if you ever tire of life as a bandit come to valdemar when you get there ask for me theyll find me and ill do anything to get you settled in a new home go tomar promise me he watched doron closely by the god by vkandis sunlord i promise now get out of here tomar touched hand to forehead in a salute reined keesha around and rode out of the grove looking back over his shoulder one last time he saw his cousin standing by the fire his own hand lifted in farewell totally drained doron fell to his knees his body feeling as though hed been badly beaten his mind stretched to a thinness hed never experienced before it had been a long time since hed used his powers and he was amazed he still knew how to cast and hold an illusion that strong the grove lay silent now no neighing horses no crashing in the brush and trees ferrin and the rest of the band would be returning before long he stood knees shaking and slipped off into the darkness wouldnt be good if they found him sitting by the fire as if nothing had happened he sat down beneath a tree crossed arms on knees and stared into the darkness tomar the cousin he thought hed lost all those years ago could be if life proved different from what it was now he just might take a journey north hed heard about valdemar how couldnt he living so close to the border life was change and tomar had given him good reason to think about a different existence his bandit companions well theyd survive somehow right now so would he with them in place of the mother and father hed lost but he had family in valdemar real family life was not only change it was choices to be made he heard rustling in the brush and stood ferrin and the three others were cautiously returning to the clearing now that the danger had passed he drew a deep breath squared his shoulders and slipped back into the clearing to wait for them interview with a companion by benjamin ohlander ben ohlander was born in south dakota and grew up in colorado and north carolina after completing high school he enlisted in the marines before attending college in ohio upon graduation he was commissioned as an officer in the army reserve he has been mobilized three times and is currently serving in afghanistan in the intervals between deployments he works as a software consultant for ibm and writes as time permits he lives in southwest ohio with his wife three stepsons two cats and a mechanical parrot named max the cats are generally tolerant of his writing and encourage all of their staff to have outside interests dave matthews no relation pulled his aging chrysler off the twolane road to consult his map kentucky was full of twisty roads anyway and lexington more so horse farms predated roads here and cutting up perfectly good bluegrass to put in a straight rightofway was not only pedestrian it was downright tacky the google map was pretty clear five miles north on across four miles left turn at mountebank one and half miles past the bridge near the old barn come alone okay he was there he dug into the aging knapsack that combined computer bag and lunch sack and pulled out the digital recorder it took him a few seconds to figure out where the batteries went and another several minutes to read the instructions that of course was only after trial and error failed june here at tribridge to meet a source with inside information on purging techniques used by jockey to make weight he played it back and listened to himself not newsy enough he turned the recorder back on here at tribridge to get the skinny on the jockeypurging scandal snap much better the meeting out here in the middle of nowhere seemed perfectly rational for a source with inside information even if middle of nowhere was maybe twentyfive minutes from downtown lexington the scene fit but no one who looked like a source no one at all in fact he looked back toward the old barn some fifty yards away and on the far side of the white rail fences that were required in horse country there was a girl working in the barn but no sign of anyone who fit the profile of a source he checked her out she looked slim enough with the youngishcolt look of so many of the women in this part of kentucky he tried to guess how many millihelens she was but from the distance he could tell little other than she was slim and lithe given his last date had been sometime last year that was enough to launch a navy of six or seven hundred ships right there still no source he checked his watch he was still a minute or so early but he thought there ought to be some sign this was his first source but he was pretty sure they were supposed to be on time he looked back the way hed come nothing there and nothing on the opposite side of the road except a shiny white horse the horse was heavier than the whippetlike thoroughbreds they were breeding up these days not a racer at all maybe a showhorse done all in white a show horse standing on the far side beside a split rail fence in central kentucky not odd a show horse standing next to a golf bag in central kentucky very odd the horse stared at him ears perked forward brown eyes on his their eyes met through the streaky windshield he took a second look at the golf bag okay definitely odd a horse and a golf bag standing by the side of the road sounded like the lead in for a joke he opened the car door and looked down the drivers side swung over a small drainage ditch that ran alongside the road he stepped across the ditch and walked around to the front of the car to peer up and down the road he glanced at his watch then tipped his baseball cap back on his head in the distance a crop duster puttered biplane momentarily silhouetted against the sky the horse stood calmly looking at him then dipped his head into the golf bag and nosed his way between the woods sticking out each with its own embossed horseshoe cover when his head came up dave saw a golden apple between solid shiny white teeth dave blinked horses with big yellow choppers he had seen these were the sort of teeth usually bought on credit the horse crunched the apple thoughtfully still looking at dave it was he thought an uncommonly odd feeling being stared at by a horse he looked back at the barn the girl obviously mucking out had a large wheelbarrow full of fun that she pushed around the side of the barn and out of sight he glanced back at the road then stared at the horse as it dipped its head into the bag again rooted between some irons then came up with a carrot which it chewed like a cigar the green stalk flopped back and forth a cricket chirped he flexed his feet listening to his tennis shoes squeak he stared at the horse the horse stared at him the biplane puttered just on the horizon dropping a long cloud of pesticide hot day he said to the horse middlin hot said a voice what the f dave spun around who said that over here by the golf bag said the voice dave whipped his head around the horse stared at him then slowly and deliberately winked the eyes the ones he had thought were brown now shone a bright sapphire blue dave took two shuffle steps backward startled beyond thought the second ended in profanity as he stepped into the little ditch alongside the road and went down knee deep his new recorder bought for the occasion went glunk in the only water for thirty feet in any direction what the f he repeated stepping out of the ditch and into the road had there been any traffic he would have been in someones oncoming lane you came here to get inside information from a source said the voice you dont get more inside than this what the gotta say it straight from the horses mouth the horse did something with its hooves and the sound was a mix of rimshot and silver bells dave shook his head and began looking for a portable loudspeaker feeling now that hed been badly put on some jerk out there with a camera filming him for a sucker and conning him into talking to a horse so youre a talking horse like the one on tv names ed or that mule dave milked it as best he could playing along until he could find the speaker system he zeroed in on the golf bag he was such a putz so obvious dont be an ass dave said the voice are my lips moving in fact are you really hearing it that stopped him cold the horselips not moving no sound issuing it was the voice in his head that disturbed him it wasnt his inner monologue the sort that slipped up when hed been drinking and checking out pretty girls and got him into trouble it was a deeper masculine voice the sort that sounded as though it ought to be coming from outside his head except it wasnt outside maybe its cancer he said maybe im just hearing things did you read the books i sent the horse replied changing the subject my sister used to read those as a kid i tried a couple chick fic the horse rolled his eyes really rolled them the whole head tossing okay mr pulitzer just how many stories have you published umm well im working this angle jockey drinking milk with ipecac chasers aint exactly news monkey boy next youll be doing an expose that models are anorexic umm how about a real story okay i may be losing it but im talking to a horse telepathy what telepathy you are speaking to me and i am answering you telepathically oh i thought it was called something else so you have read the books okay one or two when i was in college i was broke i wont tell the other guys you were reading pastel pony stories the horse actually grinned i know it would get you thrown out of the club its called mindspeaking by the way why not telepathy well we talked to our publicist about it and agreed that calling it telepathy was too sciencefictiony miiiiiiiiiiiiiiiindspeeeeeach conveys the same idea and keeps it in the fantasy canon dave grasped the only part that made sense horses have a publicist yes a woman in oklahoma takes our history dresses it up a bit and resells it makes an okay living at it the horse looked long and hard at him what you call chick fic pays pretty well not as well as romance of course but better than puking jockeys or space guns look we need to get down to business here got your notebook dave looked back at his voice recorder continuing to do its uboat impression no way best buy was going to take that back he dug out his analog recordera notepad and pen somewhere in the back of his mind he realized he had accepted that he was talking to a real live horse talking to maybe not totally unusual but one talking back in slightly accented english was way way out there okay lessee where to start you are a companion from valdemar yes and youve misspelled it its not comapnian sorry im a little out of my league here and you are here in kentucky obviously but why vacation dont they call this horse heaven maybe this is where we rest up between gigs the companion shifted a number wood a little to take another apple from the golf bag dave stepped closer is that a a nicorette patch dont worry about it the horse the companion sounded genuinely peeved what goes to kentucky stays in kentucky okay okay okay sorry im a reporter then do you want a story or not umm sure once i figure out how im going to sell my editor that ive had a conversation with a horse sorry companion that i communicate with telepathically who has given me news that is fit to print thats a bit cynical why dont you just let it play out and see where it takes us maybe something will suggest itself that you can use lets start on background and well work up from there the companion looked up and down the road then crossed one hoof in front of the other it was the hoof that sold dave once and for all it wasnt silverish or silver painted it was real silver real solid silver with the deep luster that only the best had and that hed spent many hours polishing as a child he didnt know much but he did know his silver no sh this is for real youre a real com panion again obviously ask some questions pretend youre a reporter dave fumbled for a place to start on background good idea whats magic the companion took a deep breath that was original ok stock question deserves a stock answer we are surrounded by energy everyone is all the time sun heat light magnetic called leylines for magnetic flux lines easiest to see and tap most of it is ambient but its like catching a cup full of drizzle easier to grab magnetic flows as they go past some people can tap that energy adapt it to their needs and alter it by force of will please dont say just like the force because it isnt then who can use this energy not sure at least part is genetic a mutation in the hippocampus or hypothalamus one of those h words happy yeah i guess dave paused okay then the timeline spans two thousand years so why dont things progress much well you have to understand that magic and technology are fundamentally incompatible the focus in valdemar early on was to expand and improve magic which is fine for small tasks but it fails miserably at the big stuff easier to take a crew and pave a road than to magic the dirt to repel water so instead of learning physics and how to make things the mages focused more and more on magic its no accident that all of these books have just enough technology to string a sword together or mash up some armor there is some effort in selenays time to go the other way but its a late start that made some sense to dave but the publicist bit had him going okay then what about the stories about the elves making the aluminum cars down in daytona thats magic and technology savannah actually theyre all friends of mine okay so now there are elves sure why not straightup darwin adapt or die even for the fey some haul pizza others carry messages a few make racecars the companion saw daves incredulous expression look until twenty minutes ago youd never had a conversation with a telepathic avatar horse with nifty silver hooves either had you so why not elves in la dave had the sense this was all getting way ahead of him so if thats true then what about the ones about the witch the one who hunts ghosts and stuff naw thats pure fiction why does that have to be fiction when the rest of it isnt i mean come on ghosts and demons preposterous dave shook his head glanced at his notebook it gave him a moment to steady himself that seems a bit arbitrary sos life next question so then just what happened to the herald mages two factors came together magery was a distraction its hard enough to be a good herald heraldry is a fulltime job by itself magecraft is a fulltime job as well one that doesnt tolerate very many mistakes most of the heralds who tried both were either not very good at either or had serious control problems more than a couple blew themselves up or lost control at the wrong moment in your world it would be like having a nuke incredibly powerful but one that you were pretty sure the safety worked mostly sure what about vanyel oh i see never mind magery was going away anyway in valdemar at least vanyel was the hot mash after the rubdown as we companions say he tossed his head at daves obvious confusion for a guy who writes about horses you dont know very much the cherry on the sundae then i write about horse racing im an investigative reporter the companion looked at his pos car so hows that working out for you then you were talking about vanyel he was wired tighter than a banjo and losing it on all sides he lasted as long as was needful but only just his companion was all that was holding him together at the end the magic requires a wildness inside that just doesnt mesh well with the discipline that is required to be a really good herald most herald mages never mastered the level of discipline needed to be good heralds but got too much to really embrace the wildness they were the battle cruisers of our world a compromise design that didnt work very well thats from world war ii firepower of a battleship speed of a cruiser looked great on paper german sub killed one with one shot it was the bismark actually sank the hood british battle cruisers got roughly handled at jutland in the first go but the brits didnt learn the lesson for another war figured that just because the idea hadnt worked didnt mean it wasnt still a good idea hmmm that might be a bit obscure for my readers maybe the windows me of valdemar no thats not right either the hms worked it was the internal contradictions that they couldnt resolve ok how about like a spork compromise design that works okay but not outstandingly and does two mutually contradictory things hmmm let me think about that one vans going to be spinning like highspeed lathe in his grave to be compared to an eating utensil but i guess it does sort of capture the essence of the idea vanyel the most powerful herald mage to ever come down the pike as a spork the companion considered it a moment okay spork it is it was the obvious question so dave asked it how do you know so much about our world i read a lot how i mean how do you turn the pages the companion gave him a very long look ebook next question dave looked at his notes momentarily off stride umm yeah lessee okay but magic eventually came back right it never really left we just sort of locked it out of valdemar until we were ready until our hands were tipped anyway magic had grown more wild and more dominant among people who were wild anyway and didnt care about consequences so we brought it back in a way that shaped it as a tool we could use it was a tool a weapon but secondary to the heraldcompanion team that remains the core of what we bring to the fight the wildness of the magic brought under the control of the herald under discipline not competing with it you said there were two reasons yes with the herald mages underfoot we had an internal elite it got to the point where being a herald wasnt quite good enough there was something a notch higher a herald mage that you were either born with or not a lot of people thought it was descended from the male line so every hm who peed standing up was hip deep in noblewomen ready to breed their own mageling on the spot and not a few noble husbands looking the other way it created real problems within the heralds and not the least when the sovereigns saw their magecraft dim those that had them there were even whispers among the nobility that not only should heraldry be a condition of sovereignty that magery should be as well we were well shut of it now its good enough to just be a herald those that have magecraft now have an extra weapon but thats all umm okay then internal elites let me write that one down dave tapped his pencil against his jaw the way he had seen reporters do when they were going to ask a thoughtful question okay then what about all of the bratty nobles every book has at least one arent they an elite same deal really valdemar is an oldfashioned monarchy common people nobles honcho garden variety none of that constitutional business the sovereigns is absolute but is subject to outside interests the nobility forms the foundation of the power of the sovereign and that foundation can shift when interests diverge oh thats crass dave said its pragmatic the companions are the mortar that holds the foundation of the kingdom together there isnt a noble family that cant count exactly the number of heralds in their ancestry and exactly how many the other noble families have had so if someone gets crosswise with the monarchy then no more heralds not exactly more to say that if you stray too far from the ideals of baron valdemar but its sufficient that the major houses are unlikely to take the chance so it amounts to the same thing wow good old fashioned interest politics is there any other kind now whos being cynical think it through where does succession lie dave considered a moment walked back to the car and opened the trunk he pulled out a markedup daw copy out of the cardboard box that served as his filing cabinet he tucked his notepad into his pants pocket he riffled through pages sovereign and consort are both heralds and the only way your family gets a shot at being in the royal bed is to be a herald yes the system is very stable sovereign to heir to sovereign to heir all in neat succession with the distaff side coming usually from the noble houses so each major family has an equal shot no pun intended okay so much for the heroics then its all about maintaining social order thats one reason why is called being chosen dave and not being random every choosing serves a larger purpose okay then ill bite whats with all the orphans sneak thieves and wretched refuse that get pretty ponies well dave its one part literary convention who wants to read about a bunch of rich kids who get all the prizes you can get that on the news i thought you said it was history of course dave the woman has to eat and pure history is pretty dry why not sex it up a bit doesnt take much some literary conventions are pretty darned universal noble falling on his fundament and getting his comeuppance usually at the hands of poor but proud girl who flummoxes him all before they fall in love and get married snooty rich girl meets poor guy with heart of gold same tale reverse the genitalia for equalitys sake half of all the stories ever sold used it as a theme this is being sold as fiction you know dave refused to be knocked off stride and plowed ahead so then every scullery maid every farmers daughter every he flipped the book a few more pages holderkin girl of a certain age has to be dreaming that a white horse is going to sweep in and take her away from her cinderellaashes and to a life of cinderellaprincess how do they fit in dave trailed off the companion actually managed to look a little embarrassed umm well there is also a practical side the orphaned the poor kids arent conflicted you see they are typically so happy to be there and just so darned lucky that they dont count the cost and are just happy to be in haven the rich kids know they are important sometimes the nobles are divided loyal to both house and sovereign in the moment of truth sometimes heralds have to lay it all on the line easier in that moment for it to be someone whose only care is to sovereign and crown dave blinked so the lower classes are cannon fodder the companion shook his head silvery mane flying not at all companions are too great an investment to spend willynilly but the hardest missions often go to those with the least to lose its never phrased that way but the sovereign has to balance considerations losing a key connection that diminishes a major house may hurt the realm it good to have some people around where you dont have to balance those considerations one is whether a moments hesitation a moments pause means failure and death its better to send someone whos already chosen pun intended thats a harsh pun its a harsh business to be fair and answer your question its mostly the commoners who excel at the spying our noble heralds do better at the raids and upclose combat or riding circuit and meting judgment most are superb circuit riders they understand and care about law and work with their companions to mete justice many have too strong a sense of themselves to make good sneaks however it just isnt in them the confidence the sureness soldiers turn to it in battle hup hup head to the front follow the shiny white coat but for a spy you need a street rat the poorer kids have had their lives torn up and have had to adapt themselves make themselves over to survive become someone something else to survive they get hazed once they hit the academy its a harsh change for them harsher than it seems but it is necessary once they are broken down a mentor comes and lifts them up that mentor is close to the state linked to the sovereign the mentor will take the newer herald and will become teacher confessor and sometimes yes even lover but the purpose is to attach the loyalty of that herald to that group who is bound only to the sovereign no conflict with lineage or house honor dave blinked taking it in i remember a war correspondent telling me a similar thing about how commandos are trained just how many heralds make it to retirement the companion shufflestepped most times most now with the wars maybe a third get sent out to pasture the ranks got thinned during the tedrel wars a few for hardorn but now that its gotten worse there is some serious attrition training standards have slipped as bodies are needed in the field so losses go up for those loyal only to crown its higher the queen has to measure carefully how many of the noble heralds she spends still in the white coats mostly yes the heraldry is a symbol and the symbol is white a few get into mufti but for most the heraldry is what we are skulking about is all very good for alberich and it works for those who came from outside the system but surrendering the whites is surrendering who we are going to grays is a surrender of sorts that we have to hide who we are what we represent well do it of course but its really hard even for the street kids sometimes they out white the nobles out white play the orthodox herald more vigorously than the nobles then their companion has to find a creek somewhere and drop them in it to shrink their heads why so far youve described it as a prop for an oligarchy with some pretty hard nosed ideas about who gets killed in the line of duty baron valdemars bargain was to create someplace special a rallying point a beacon in the night he was an idealist of course but a realist as well he realized that you can create something special but sustaining it would need help so he committed himself his children and his childrens children to standing against the forces that threaten all free peoples everywhere always the agreement was simple to provide a haven against the dark to stand as a beacon to succor all in need and to rise in defense when no one else would the companions are the visible tangible sign that the bargain is being honored valdemar delivers up idealists some noble some common none of whom ride cheerfully into the cannons mouth but who will ride nonetheless if there is no other choice dave dropped the book back in the cardboard box he closed the trunk hard using the heel of his hand to get it going the latch stuck of course bouncing the lid back an inch or two he leaned his hand down on the trunk trying to hold it closed while he fumbled for the piece of wire that was his backup for when the trunk latch failed which was most of the time it took two tries to get it threaded through the trunk latch he released it and watched the trunk open again and stop about an inch free he pulled his notepad out of his pocket now we get to it so then what exactly are the companions then angels sent by god hrmmm human concepts are so limited lets try this in my universe there is a manifestation a great creator a great maker if you will humanity can only touch a portion of that concept and then only imperfectly so that flawed understanding is what gets interpreted locally in different ways shaped by different cultures and different experiences in karse vkandis is a very real god very male oft given to showmanship and with a blisteringly large ego he is definitely his own man err god but he is also at the same time a part of the manifestation we are also part of that manifestation not unlike the firecats who are of vkandis shaping but as part of the bargain we represent all the gods and so are truer to being the agents the avatars of the manifestation itself so kind of like an angel then asked dave the companion tossed his head impatient now there is no way im going to take a stab at that your world is caught in enough killing over whose version of peace and love is the right one im not going to toss any more theological fuel on the fire what we are works for valdemar translating it into your world isnt going to help you understand lets just stick with avatarsdamned stylish avatars if you will lets move on shall we got enough background okay i think so i still dont see a story then ask the right question all right then why are you here i get that you like the grass but im not buying the vacation bit if a horse could smile the companion conveyed the sense its not an accident that many heroes even in your world have ridden on white steeds your george washington of course a paragon among men who willingly handed over the reins of power lest he be thought a king do you have any idea how rare that is how astonishingly vanishingly rare that is how often does anyone today in your world willingly voluntarily relinquish power much less when there was no precedent for it youre saying he had a companion he had a conscience to help him be who he already was a voice to steady him in the darkest watches of the night when he was afraid or most in doubt a friend when he was most alone there were others a few a man in spain who set the conditions for the world to change to break through and become when it was ready to be born in modernity much tragedy and millions of lives would be lost in the birthing spain ummm spain white horse el cid very good thanks liberal arts education any others girl in france thought she was talking to god rode a white horse the maid of orleans joan of arc yes her inspiration created the idea of the nation of france set the stage for the rise of the modern state and began the end of the idea that land and king were one others general in your civil war led the southern armies in the east and whose graciousness in defeat set the tone for knitting the country back together once it was done and his nemesis because the rebel had to lose both were needed in their essential roles that war made the country that followed possible brutally hard for those at the time lee and grant but neither of their horses were white traveler was a chestnut was he are you sure interesting choice of names isnt it no im not sure now that i think on it ill have to look it up wikipedia has a good entry try that and like our chosen we can go in mufti when needful good to know any others hrmm okay general in greece opened up the east and west great tragedy in his wake but made possible the rise of the west and the linking of the world the silk road alexander but he wasnt greek he was macedonian whatever so just how many companions in this world a few for critical people at a nexus in time where one persons single choice will decide the fate of millions for those few we are a quiet voice a nudge here a suggestion there we are companions to our chosen we suggest we recommend we aid but compared with here valdemar is lousy with them the companion drew himself closer to the fence the voice in daves mind lost its humorous edge and became all business the chosen are chosen by fate david we become their companions to help them fulfill that fate were an expensive line item silver hooves and all so we go where the need is most so then youre here to choose someone yes david he looked up and down the road no one was in sight he began to get an odd warm feeling in the of his stomach no david that role is not yours there is always a bard to record the history to document the story of the chosen for all ages it will be your story if you choose to write it he felt a surge of bitter disappointment in an instant hed seen hed read the flash of sublime joy at being chosen and it was gone so then a job as a sidekick great he made no effort to hide the hurt what about the woman in oklahoma this is beneath you dave she can tell our story as fiction but i will not be in this story except as steed my story is told elsewhere this will be the chosens story the one who changes the future the companion glanced towards the golf bag would you get my clubs the woods are calloways but even good clubs cant fix a tendency to slice i have an appointment the companion turned toward the barn the girl the girl who changes the world want to write the story dave thought about it for almost a minute sure
