harry turtledove in at the death i b rigadier general clarence potter crouched in a muddy trench north of atlanta overhead us bombers flew through what looked like flak thick enough to walk on potter saw smoke coming from a couple of enemy airplanes but the airplanes went on about the business of pounding the hub of the confederate states of america flat most of the bombs fell behind potter in the heart of atlanta as usual the united states were going after the railroad yards and the factories that made the capital of georgia so vital to the csa as far as potter could tell the latest bombardments were overkill by now atlantas importance was gone with the wind the locals those who hadnt refugeed out or been blown sky high seemed stunned at what had happened to their city disasters to them were for other places new orleans had suffered the indignity of capture in the war of secession louisville had been lost in that war wrecked in the second mexican war lost again in the great war and spent an embarrassing generation as a us city afterwards richmond had been battered in the great war and was taking it on the chin even harder now but atlanta atlanta just kept rolling along except it didnt not any more bombs were falling closer now working their way north potter had seen that happen before the lead airplanes in a formation would put their bombs about where they belongedor where the bombardiers thought they belonged anyhow bombardiers farther back would use those early explosions as targets but being human the bomber crews didnt want to hang around any longer than they had to so they released their bombs a little sooner than they might have work that all the way back through a bomber stream and and im liable to get killed by mistake potter muttered he was in his early sixties in good hard shape for his age with irongray hair and cold gray eyes behind steelrimmed spectacles his specialty was intelligence work but he commanded a division these daysthe confederacy was running low on capable or even incapable line officers his cynical cast of mind either suited him for the spymasters role or came from too many years spent in it even he didnt know which any more general potter a soldier yelled you anywhere around general potter no doubt for his own ears alone he added where the fuck you at general potter here i am potter shouted back not a bit abashed the runner dove into the trench with him why are you looking for me potter asked crisply youre general potter our general potter the young soldier didnt seem convinced despite potters dirty butternut uniform and the wreathed stars on either side of his collar afraid i am son potter knew why the runner was dubious too back before the great war i went to college up at yale i learned to talk like a damnyankee to fit in and it stuck now quit dicking around whats up sir general pattons on the telephone and he needs to talk to you bad the kid replied oh joy potter had no trouble containing his enthusiasm no matter what george patton imagined he needed potter knew he didnt need to talk to patton but patton commanded an army not just a division he headed all the forces trying to keep the usa away from atlanta potter knew damn well he had to render unto caesarnot that patton thought julius caesar or anyone else his equal all right field telephone still at the same old stand uh yes sir then you stay here no point getting both of us blasted just because general pattons got the galloping fantods thank you sir the runner gaped at him potter hardly noticed he scrambled out of the trench getting more tomatosoup mud on his uniform fall had been wet a good thing too he thought without the rain and the mud the damnyankeesd probably be at the atlantic not atlanta he knew he exaggerated he also knew he didnt exaggerate by as much as he wished he did he scuttled over the cratered landscape like a pair of ragged claws who was the crazy englishman who wrote that poem he couldnt come up with the name bombs whistled down from above none did more than rattle his nerves the field telephone was only a couple of hundred yards from where hed sheltered when bombs started falling the soldier with the ungainly apparatus and batteries on his back huddled in a foxhole barring a direct hit that was fine potter wished he hadnt thought of the qualifier the operator held out the handpiece to him thanks potter said and then yelled potter here fieldtelephone connections were generally bad and bombs going off in the background definitely didnt help hello potter this is patton the army commander also shouted no one was likely to mistake his rasping voice for anybody elses even over a field telephone potter supposed the same was true of his own that turned out not to be quite true for patton went on if the damnyankees capture a telephone they can put on one of their men claiming to be you and talk me out of everything i know heh potter said dutifully he was sick of being suspected and twitted because of the way he talked what do you need sir the runner said it was urgent hes right patton answered im going to send the corps that your division is half of against the us forces between marietta and lawrenceville youll go in by way of chamblee and doraville and cut off the yankees east of there once we drive them out of lawrenceville or destroy them in place there we reopen communications from atlanta to the northeast sir do you really think a onecorps attack will shift the us forces in that area potter tried to ignore the sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach pattons answer to every military problem was to attack hed won great triumphs in ohio and pennsylvania in and but not the one in pittsburgh that might have knocked the usa out of the war and his counterattacks against us forces in kentucky and tennessee and georgia this year had cost the confederate states far more men and matйriel than they were worth we need to reopen that route now general patton replied even if that werent obvious to anyone with a map i have orders from the president what jake featherston wanted jake featherston got the only thing the president of the csa wanted that he hadnt got was the one hed needed most a short victorious war even getting a war the country could survive didnt look easy any more speaking carefully potter said sir the yankees already have more force in place than we can throw at them if you try to knock a brick wall down with your head you hurt your head worse than the wall its not so bad as that potter general patton insisted they offer us their flank we can go through them like a ripsaw through balsa wood potter admired him for not saying like a hot knife through butter patton had his own way of speaking as he had his own way of doing things for better and for worse he was his own man right now in potters view it was for worse if thats their flank its not soft sir potter said and they have lots of artillery covering the approach as soon as we start moving well get plastered two bombs burst close enough to rattle him hell were getting plastered now weve had this argument before farther north patton said heavily yes sir i have to say the results up there justified me too potter said i dont agree and i dont have time for your nonsense either not now as i say my orders come from the president and leave me no room for discretion patton said you will attack or i will relieve you and put in someone else who will do i have the courage of my convictions potter wondered to his relief he discovered he did youd better relieve me then sir he said im sorry for the men youll throw away but i wont be a party to it you son of a bitch patton said you yellow son of a bitch fuck yousir potter said sorry but you wont get to pin the blame for your mistakesand the presidents mistakeson me brigadier general russell will go forward to take your division patton said dont wait for him you are relieved effective immediately come back here to central headquarters at onceat once do you hear me well see which shelf the war department decides to put you on after that on my way sir potter answered and hung up before patton could say anything else he shouted for a driver his yells attracted a captain on his staff before they got him a motorcar whats the commotion about sir the officer asked ive been relieved potter said bluntly the captains jaw dropped potter went on brigadier general russell will take over for me hes going to send you northeast to try to cut off the damnyankees in lawrenceville i dont think you can do that but give it your best shot when i told general patton i didnt think you could he pulled the plug on me orders from the president are that youve got to try i wish you luck he meant that this wasnt the first time hed got caught between loving his country and looking down his nose at the man who ran it he had time for a handshake before a command car showed up the driver didnt seem happy at being out and about with bombs falling potter wasnt happy either what could you do they made it they took longer than they would have without all the air raidsbut again what could you do atlanta had taken a nasty beating one little diner had a jaunty message painted on the plywood that did duty for a front window open for business while everything around us goes to hell what did you dowalk patton growled when potter strode into headquarters which were in an ugly building on block place just west of the cratered remains of the railroad yard might have been faster if i did potter answered patton muttered potter wasnt contrite enough to suit him most men seeing their military career going up in smoke would have flabbled more i spoke with the president patton said oh boy potter said patton muttered some more potter wasnt impressed enough to suit him either of course potter had had more to say toand aboutjake featherston than patton ever did theres an airplane waiting for you at the airport patton ground out youre ordered back to richmond so the damnyankees can shoot me down on the way potter said why didnt featherston order me executed here i wondered if he would patton retorted maybe he wants to do it personally any which way get moving youll find out what he has in mind when you get thereif you do i hope you sweat all the way now get out always a pleasure potter said and flipped patton a salute in lieu of the bird atlantas airport was at hapeville nine miles south of town the airplane was a threeengined transport an alligator so called because of its corrugated aluminum skin us transports were bigger and faster but alligators got the job done the confederate states had had to rebuild their military from scratch in the s not everything got fully modernized too much to do too fast most of the time slow obsolescent transports didnt matter too much if however a us fighter got on your tail cussing patton under his breath potter did sweat till the alligator which also carried several other officers and a nondescript civilian who might have been a spy got well away from atlanta the airplane wasnt out of the woods yet he knew that us aircraft from kentucky and tennessee raided western north carolina and virginia but his odds had improved he started sweating again when they neared richmond which vied with paris as the most heavily bombed city in the world they got down just before sunset two hardfaced men in freedom party guard camouflage uniforms waited for potter come with us one of them growled as soon as he got off having no choice he did and wondered if he was going for his last ride w ithout much modesty false or otherwise lieutenant michael pound reckoned himself the best platoon commander for barrels in the us army he also would have bet he was the oldest platoon commander for barrels in the army hed been learning armored warfare ever since most of his counterparts were born right now things were pretty simple the confederates were pushing north and east out of their defenses in front of atlanta if they broke through they would cut off and probably cut up a lot of good men michael pound didnt think they had a chance in church of breaking through he stood up in the cupola of his greengray barrel to get a better look around than the periscopes could give him his shoulders barely fit through the opening he was built like a brick he neededand hatedreading glasses these days but he still saw fine at a distance his barrel sat under the pines near the edge of a wood the crew had draped branches over the glacis plate to help hide the big bulky machine the other four in the platoon sat not far away in the best cover their ingenious commanders could find soggy fields of red mudwhich looked unnatural to someone from close to the canadian border like poundlay to the south if the confederates wanted to try coming this way they couldnt very well fool anybody which didnt mean they couldnt get fooled from behind pound could see trenches and foxholes and machinegun nests from in front most of those would be camouflaged he could see the signs marking the borders of minefields too the enemy wouldnt spot them till too lateunless the sappers whod laid the mines wanted them seen to channel cs attacks more us infantry waited among the trees with the barrelsand pounds platoon was far from the only armor on hand if the bastards in butternut figured this was an exposed flank theyd get rapped on the knuckles in a hurry and they did they must have artillery started screaming down on the fields and on the pine woods michael pound ducked into the turret and clanged the hatch shut he felt sorry for the poor bloody foot soldiers theyd get bloodier in short order air bursts were very bad news for troops caught under trees shells fused to burst as soon as they touched branches showered sharp fragments on the ground below no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than fragments clattered off the barrel they sounded like hail on a tin roof which only proved you couldnt go by sound lord help the infantry said sergeant mel scullard the gunner he managed to put up with having a longtime gunner set over himat least he hadnt tried to brain pound with a wrench while the platoon commander slept i was thinking the same thing pound replied it does even out some though nobody fires antibarrel rockets or armorpiercing rounds at them goddamn stovepipe rockets scullard said if i caught a confederate with one of those things id shove the launcher up his ass and then light off a round and that by god would be that my my how the boys in the striped pants who put together the geneva convention would love you pound said the gunners opinion of the geneva convention and its framers was blasphemous scatological and almost hot enough to ignite the ammunition stowed in the turret laughing pound wagged a forefinger at him scullard used a different finger a different way pound peered through the periscopes set into the cupola had he been standing up he could have used field glasses for a better view another rattle of sharp steel against the barrels armored skin reminded him there were times to be bold and times to be smart and this sure as hell looked like a time to be smart and he could see enough if not quite everything he wanted theyre coming all right he said infantry firstprobably probing to find out where the mines are and whether weve got any weak spots and when they find some thats where the barrels will try and get through let the goddamn barrels come scullard said theyll regret it in the first year and a half of the war us forces were sorry more often than not when they came up against cs barrels confederate machines had bigger guns stronger engines and thicker bettersloped armor but the newest us models finally got it right their ѕinch guns outclassed anything the enemy used and their powerplants and protection also outdid the opposition with problems elsewhere the confederates were slow to upgrade their barrels some of the machines advancing now werent barrels at all but squat ugly assault guns pound a purist looked down his nose at them but throw enough of them into the fight and something would probably give quantity had a quality of its own whats the range to those bastards he asked scullard checked the rangefinder more than a mile and a half sir even a hit at that range isnt a sure killtheyve got thick glacis plates take a shot at the lead machine anyway pound said if you do kill it way the hell out there the rest of them will know right away theyve got a tough row to hoe ill do it sir the gunner answered then he spoke to the loader armorpiercing i thought youd never ask joe mouradian said and handed him a long heavy cartridge with the nose painted black scullard traversed the turret a little to the left he peered through the rangefinder again raised the gun peered once more muttered and brought the cannon up a hair farther pound wouldnt have hesitated so much he had uncommon confidence in himself he wasnt always right but he was always sure he was sure he ought to keep quiet now scullards style was different from his but the gunner usually hit what he aimed at if he didnt hit here pound intended to say not a word it was long range even for a gun that fired on a fast flat trajectory like the ѕincher boom inside the turret the noise wasnt too bad right outside it would have seemed like the end of the world michael pound looked through the periscopes hoping he could see the shot fall if it missed but it didnt the lead confederate assault gun suddenly stopped greasy black smoke spurted from it a hatch in the side opened somebody bailed out more smoke belched from the hatch good shot good shot pound thumped scullard on the back now kill the next one the others will think twice about coming on after that ill try sir the gunner said and then ap again mouradian right the loader slammed another round into the breech scullard traversed the turret to the right he fired again then swore that was a miss pound swore too he saw no puff of dust to mark where the shot came down the wet weather complicated lives all kinds of ways scullard tried again this time the shot went home the assault gun slewed sideways and stopped a track knocked off its wheels the enemy could probably fix it but that would take a while in the meantime it was out of the fight a sitting duck odds were somebody would blast it before it got fixed other us barrels opened up more cs assault guns and barrels got hit others stopped to return fire having expended three rounds from this spot pound figured it was time to move they would have a good idea where he was the same as if hed lit three cigarettes on a match he ordered the barrel back and to the left to a secondary firing position hed marked out ahead of time nobody ever said the confederates lacked guts they pressed the attack hard pound could see only his little part of it like any soldier at the front thanks to the mines and the machine guns and the barrels and the fighterbombers that swooped down on the enemy the men in butternut never made it across the open ground and into the pine woods they tried three different times which only meant they paid a higher price for failure than if theyd left well enough alone after the first time when they sullenly pulled back late that afternoon pound said we ought to go after them we might be able to walk right into atlanta easy to walk into atlanta sir scullard said if we do though how many of usll walk out again pound grunted having seen what the fighting in pittsburgh was like he didnt want to wind up on the other end of that but watching the enemy get away went against all his instincts then rockets started screaming down on the open ground in front of the woods and on the trees as well blast made even the heavy barrel shudder on its tracks the confederates were doing everything they could to discourage pursuit he feared the foot soldiers were catching it hard even sothey wont take lawrenceville away from us like that he said no sir scullard agreed well likely try a flanking move from there i bet if we can make them leave atlanta without us going in and taking it away from them that sounds goddamn good to me to me too pound said the cheaper the better the order to move forward came early the next morning the axis of the advance was southeast not straight towards atlanta but deeper into central georgia that warmed the cockles of michael pounds heart it also told him that general morrell whom hed known for many years still had what it took morrell was all but inviting the confederates in atlanta to strike at his flank again if they did he would give them lumps they didnt watching their first counterattack fail must have taught them something pound didntwouldntbelieve theyd lost too many men and too much equipment for another try theyd counterattacked again and again all the way down from the ohio riverusually before they should have and it had cost them a lot more than standing on the defensive and making us forces come to them would have done maybe they were finally wising up but if they were it was liable to be too late if they didnt come out of atlanta men and barrels in greengray would curl around and cut them off from the east and south as well as from the north and what would stop irving morrells armor from slashing across the rest of georgia to savannah and the atlantic and cutting the confederacy in half nothing second lieutenant pound could see here and there the confederates still fought hard the freedom party guard units in their mottled uniforms had the best gear the csa could give them and a vicious determination to use it they took few prisoners and mostly didnt let themselves get captured and their fanatical resistance got them not very much jake featherston didnt have enough guard outfits to go around he didnt come close in between the towns they defended and the strongpoints they manned layagain not very much most confederate soldiers like most soldiers most places werent so enthusiastic about dying for their country militias of beardless boys and old men mixed boltaction tredegars from the last war with hunting rifles and shotguns some of them were brave it hardly mattered they didnt have what they needed to fight a real army mel scullard machinegunned a kid who was running up to the barrel with a featherston fizz the youngster fell the burning gasoline from the bottle made his last minutes on earth even worse than they would have been otherwise with cold eyes the gunner watched him die you want to play against the first team sonny you better bring your best game he said thats about the size of it pound agreed and most of their first team is in atlanta and its doing them less and less good the longer it sits there in the meantime by god well just clean up their scrubs c assius began to think he might live through the war black guerrillas who took up arms against the csa and the freedom party always hoped to live of course but hoping and believing were two different things sooner or later hed figured gracchus band would run out of luck then hed either die on the spot or go to a camp the way his mother and father and sister had quick or slow it would be over nowmaybe just maybe it wouldnt hed already watched us fighterbombers stoop on a truck convoy the negroes stalled with a land mine planted in a pothole what followed wasnt pretty which didnt mean he didnt like it oh noit meant nothing of the sort and the rumble and growl of artillery in the northwest wasnt distant or on the edge of hearing any more now it grew into an unending roar louder by the day and as impossible to ignore as a toothache whenever the guerrillas camped for the night the same phrase was on their lips damnyankees comin soon they wanted the us soldiers to get there soon they would likely die if the us soldiers didnt they called them damnyankees anyhow there as in so many other things they imitated confederate whites they found yellow women prettier than brown ones and much prettier than black ones they liked straight hair better than kinky sharp noses better than flat in all of that they were typical of the confederacys negroes the main way they werent typical was that they were still alive not far away trucks rattled through the darkness bringing cs troops forward to try to stem the us tide the guerrillas let most convoys go they couldnt afford to get into many real fights with real soldiers gracchus had enough trouble scraping up new recruits as things were except for the scattered harried rebel bands not many negroes were left in the georgia countryside suppose the damnyankees come cassius said spooning up beans from a ration a mexican soldier would never open now suppose they come an suppose they kill the confederate sojers an the ofays who put on white shirts and yell freedom all the goddamn time gracchus was gnawing on a drumstick from a chicken liberated from a white mans coop then we wins he said swallowing then we starts puttin our lives back the way they was fo all this shit happen in a way that sounded wonderful in another wayhow how we do dat boss cassius asked all the yankee sojers in the world aint gonna give me my ma an pa an sister back again they aint gonna bring back all the niggers the ofays done killed we is like ghosts of the folks what used to be here but aint no more gracchus scowled as he threw the leg bone aside we aint ghosts he said the ones who got killed theys ghosts i bet this whole country have more hantsn you kin shake a stick at this war finally done cassius didnt exactly believe in hants he didnt exactly not believe in them either hed never seen one but so many people were sure they had he had trouble thinking they were all crazy or lying he did say hants aint slowed down the ofays none might be even worse without em another negro said how cassius asked and nobody seemed to want to answer that he didnt want to take the argument with gracchus any further he didnt want the guerrilla chieftain to think he was after that spot himself as far as cassius was concerned gracchus was welcome to it but even if he kept quiet he still thought he was right blacks in the csa had had a vibrant life of their own much of it lived right under the white majoritys noses with so many negroes dead how would the survivors ever start that again how could they even live alongside the whites who hadnt tried to stop freedom party goons from stuffing them into trains for oneway journeys to camps whod often cheered to see them disappear what could they be but a sad reminder of something that had once been alive but was no more and if that wasnt a ghost what was it the next morning a scout came back in high excitement the mexicans theys pullin out he said they aint goin up to the front to fight gracchus asked you sure sure as is standin here the scout replied theys marchin south they aint here to fight the damnyankees cassius said they is here to keep us in line francisco josйs men were less enthusiastic about going after negroes than white confederates were but their being here let the confederacy put more men in the field against the united states they did inhibit the rebel bandssome if theys buggin out fo true they must reckon the confederate army cant hold the yankees back no mo gracchus voice rose with excitement do jesus i hope theys right the black guerrillas got another surprise the next day a confederate captain approached a scout with a flag of truce the scout blindfolded him and brought him into camp no one offered to take the blindfold off once he got there either that didnt seem to faze him i have a proposition for you people he said go on say your say tell your lies gracchus answered no lies what i ask is very simple leave us alone while we fight the usa the cs officer said you stay quiet we wont come after you well even give you rations so you dont have to plunder the countryside put rat poison in em first i reckon gracchus said if you agree i will come back as a hostage and food taster the captain said dont jog our elbow thats all we want you tell us no youll get the stick instead of the carrot i promise you that shoulda started leavin us alone a hell of a long time ago cassius said shrugging the soldier said maybe youre right maybe youre wrong too late to worry about it now though its water under the bridge easy fo you to say ofay some of gracchus rage and hatred came out you aint got no dead kinfolks hell i dont the captain said and cassius realized he hated them at least as much as they hated him damnyankee bombs blew up my mother and father and sister another sisterll limp forever on account of em and youre helping the usa far as im concerned we ought to feed you rat poison and better than you deserve but i dont give those orders i just follow them you got nerve gracchus spoke now with a certain reluctant admiration i told youive got orders the confederate said so whatll it be will you back off and let us fight the united states or do we come in here and clean out all of you raggedyass coons gracchus didnt answer right away he wasnt an officer with a chain of command behind him and the automatic authority to bind and to loose he couldnt order his fighters to obey a truce if they didnt want to cassius knew he didnt he spoke to the captain you coulda done that reckon you wouldve a long time ago you dont get it boy the white said and never knew how close he came to dying on the spot he continued before you were just a reararea nuisance but if you think well let you fuck with us when the fronts so close you better think again maybe he had a point of sorts but even if he didwhat happens when the yankees push you outa here cassius ground out you reckon we aint got us a lot o bills to pay you reckon we aint gonna pay em soon as we git the chance that got home the cs captain bit his lip all the more reason for us to get rid of you now he said you kin try gracchus seemed to have made up his mind yeah you kin try but i dont reckon you kin do it when the war started you coulda got what you wanted from us easy all you had to do was leave us alone well you didnt do nothin like that you know what you done like my friend here sayhe named no nameswe owes you too much to set it down we takes you back to your own folks now aint got nothin left to say to each other no more as the scout led the blindfolded officer away cassius found himself nodding gracchus had nailed that probably better than he knew all across the confederate states of america whites and negroes had nothing left to say to each other reckon we better get outa here gracchus said after the white man in butternut was gone they aint gonna wait around soon as he tell em we say no they gonna pound the shit outa where they thinks wes at he proved a good prophet artillery started falling not far from their camp inside of half an hour a couple of asskickers buzzed around overhead looking for targets they could hit the negroes stayed in the woods till nightfall you reckon they come after us from the same direction as that captain cassius asked gracchus mos likely the guerrilla leader answered maybe we oughta rig us an ambush then cassius said thatll learn em they cant run us like we was coons an they was hounds we is coons gracchus said with a grim chuckle he clapped cassius on the back but yeah you got somethin there we see what we kin do next morning right at dawn close to a company of confederate soldiers approached the woods where the guerrillas sheltered cassius and a couple of other negroes fired at them then showed themselves as they scurried away that was dangerous a fusillade of bullets chased them but nobody got hit shouting and pointing the confederates pounded after the fleeing blacks down deep the ofays still thought negroes were stupid and cowardly they wouldnt have pursued us soldiers with so little caution the machine gun opened up from the flank and cut them down like wheat before the scythe the confederates were brave some of them tried to charge the gun and take it out with grenades they couldnt work in close enough to throw them the white soldiers broke off and retreated they did it as well as anyone could leaving not a wounded man behind we done it cassius whooped we fuckin done it gracchus was less exuberant we done it this time he said ofays aint gonna make the same mistake twice next time they dont reckon its easy that struck cassius as much too likely gracchus moved his band away from the ambush site as fast as he could artillery and bombs from above started falling there a few minutes laterprobably as soon as the beaten confederate soldiers could send back word of where they ran into trouble armored cars and halftracks began patrolling the roads around the guerrilla band the negroes got one with a mine but the vehicles trapped them and hemmed them in making movement deadly dangerous before long they started getting hungry the rations the confederate captain had promised in exchange for quiet seemed better to cassius every time his belly growled reckon we kin hold em off when they come again he asked gracchus hope so the guerrilla leader answered which was a long way from yes cassius made sure his rifle was clean he didnt want it jamming when he needed it most how much good it would do him against a swarm of confederates supported by armorhe tried not to think about then one night the northwestern sky filled with flashes manmade thunder stunned his ears the cs attack the guerrillas were dreading didnt come the confederates needed everything they had to hold back the us forces hitting them and everything they had wasnt enough soldiers and vehicles in butternut poured back past and through the guerrillas little territory they werent interested in fighting the blacks they just wanted to get away wounded men and battered trucks and halftracks floundered here and there the negroes scrounged whatever they could and then cassius spotted an advancing barrel painted not butternut but greengray it had a decal of an eagle in front of crossed swords on each side of the turret he burst into unashamed tears of joy the damnyankees were here at last a fter capturing camp determination and the vast mass graves where its victims lay major general abner dowling had trouble figuring out what the us eleventh army should do next hed handed the united states a huge propaganda victory no one could deny any more that the confederates were killing off their negroes as fast as they could some of the locals were horrified when he rubbed their noses in what their country was up to the mayor of snyder texas and a few of its other leading citizens killed themselves after forced tours of the graves but others remained chillingly indifferent or worse convinced the negroes had it coming only coons and goddamn troublemakers were phrases dowling never wanted to hear again he scratched at his graying mustache as he studied a map of west texas tacked on the wall of what had been the mayors office snyder under military occupation was doing without a mayor for now what do you think major he asked his adjutant where do we go from here major angelo toricelli was young and handsome and slim none of which desirable adjectives fit his superior amarillos too far north he said judiciously we dont have the men to hold the front from here to there dowling eyed the map if that wasnt the understatement of the year it came in no worse than second runnerup abilene then he said it was the next town of any size and it didnt lie that far east of snyder i suppose so if major toricelli was eager to go after abilene he hid it very well dowling knew why too even if the eleventh army captured abilenewell so what taking it wouldnt bring the usa much closer to victory or do anything more than annoy the confederates with a sigh dowling said weve pretty much shot our bolt havent we unless theyre going to reinforce us yes sir his adjutant answered ha dont hold your breath dowling said hanging on to the men eleventh army had was hard enough maybe youll get a new command sir major toricelli said hopefully sure maybe theyll send me to baja california dowlings voice overflowed with false heartiness his adjutant winced the usa had tried to take baja california away from the empire of mexico during the last war tried and failed this time around the united states seemed to have succeeded and having taken baja california away from mexico what did the usa have baja california and that was all miles and miles and miles of the driest most godforsaken terrain in the world holding baja california mattered for only one reason it let the united states sit over the confederates in sonora us ships could block the outlet to the gulf of california us airplanes in baja california could easily strike the cs port at guaymas of course confederate aircraft in sonora could hit back at the warships and the air bases they could and they did the luckless brigadier general in charge of that operation was welcome to it as far as abner dowling was concerned with what youve done here you ought to get a command closer to the schwerpunkt major toricelli said how about sequoyah dowling asked innocently that was closer to the center of things than west texas which didnt mean toricelli didnt wince again anyhow sequoyah was a bloody mess and probably would go on being one for years thanks to a large influx of settlers from the usa it had voted not to rejoin the confederacy in al smiths illadvised plebiscite but the indian tribes in the east whod prospered under confederate rule hated the us occupation and most of the oil there lay under indianheld land the oil fields had gone back and forth several times in this war whoever was retreating blew up what he could to deny the oil to the enemy when the united states held the oil fields confederate raiders and their indian stooges sabotaged whatever wasnt blown up that led to us reprisals which led to bushwhacking which led to hell in a handbasket about the only thing we could do to make sequoyah work would be to kill all the redskins in it dowling sighed and if we do that how are we any better than the goddamn confederates those indians really are fighting us toricelli said sure dowlings chins wobbled as he nodded but if you listen to confederate wireless you hear all the stories about the terrible wicked black guerrillas some of thats got to be bullshit sure but not all of it because we both know the war department helps the guerrillas when it can major toricelli looked unhappy but he nodded one of the reasons dowling liked him was that he would look facts in the face even when they were unpleasant as if on cue a soldier from the signals unit stuck his head into the office and said sir we just got a message that needs decoding ill take care of it toricelli said and hurried away dowling wondered what was going on eleventh army wasnt important enough to receive a lot of encrypted transmissions the confederates were welcome to read most of the usual messages it did get well dowling asked when his adjutant came back fortyfive minutes later well sir were ordered to step up air attacks against abilene toricelli had the look of a man whod gone hunting in the mountains and brought home a ridiculous mouse we can do that dowling allowed he even understood why the order was codedno point to letting the confederates haul in more antiaircraft guns to shoot down us bombers but after what he and toricelli were talking about the order felt anticlimactic to say the least colonel terry defrancis was one of the youngest officers of his rank in the army he was also one of the better ones his fighters had established us dominance in the air over west texas pound the crap out of abilene he said when dowling told him about the new order sure we can do that sir ill step up the recon right away so we know what were up against step up the recon over other targets too dowling said no use advertising what were up to will do sir defrancis promised youre sneaky you know that well i try dowling paused to light a cigarette no two ways about itraleighs and dukes beat the hell out of anything the usa made and confederate cigarsreluctantly dowling brought his mind back to the business at hand thats one thing i had to pick up on my own general custer never much went in for being sneaky what was it like serving under him colonel defrancis asked it wasnt dull ill tell you that he always knew what he wanted to do and he went ahead and did it dowling nodded that was true every word of it it was also the sanitized denatured version of his long association with the man who was by his own modest admission the greatest general in the history of the world dowling suspected hed kept custer from getting sacked several times he also suspected hed kept himself from getting courtmartialed at least as often but terry didnt need to hear about that was he as much of an old tartar as everybody says defrancis had already heard something then wellyes dowling couldnt say no without making himself into a bigger liar than he wanted to be but he won the war pretty much he got the job done morrell was under his orders when he used that armored thrust to roll up the confederates and take nashville thats true dowling gave a reminiscent shiver custer and morrell had gone against war department orders to mass their barrels dowling himself had lied like ananias writing reports that denied they were doing any such thing had philadelphia found out he was lying or had the attack failedthe aftermath wouldnt have been pretty and it wasnt a sure thing not ahead of time a lot of custers straightahead charges at the enemy failed and failed gruesomely dowling knew how nervous he was before the barrels crossed the cumberland if custer had any doubts he never showed them you know colonel he really is the hero of the last war in an odd way hes the hero of the whole first part of this century dowling said he knew what he wanted to do and he found a way to make it work we just have to go and do the same thing then defrancis said i expect we can he saluted and hurried off abner dowling stubbed out his cigarette he didnt have george armstrong custers relentless drive or even terry defrancis he was a sane man in a business where the crazy and the obsessed often prospered he hoped his ability to see all sides of a problem gave him an edge over commanders with tunnel vision he hoped so but he was a long way from sure it did major toricelli stuck his head into the office sir theres a local who wants to see you his name is jeffries falstaff jeffries he runs the big grocery on the edge of town has he been searched dowling didnt want to talk to a people bomb or even a fellow with a pistol in his pocket but his adjutant nodded so did dowling all right send him in you know whats eating him no sir but i expect hell tell you falstaff jeffries didnt live up to his name he was short and skinny and somber nothing like shakespeares magnificent clown he did have the virtue of coming straight to the point where am i going to get more food general where were you getting it dowling asked from farther east thats where everything comes from out here jeffries answered except now im on the wrong side of the line folksre gonna start getting hungry pretty damn quick unless somebody does something about it i dont think anyone will starve dowling said plenty of rations if it comes to that the storekeeper looked at him as if hed just ordered no presents at christmastime rations jeffries made it into a swear word how in blazes am i supposed to run a business if you go around handing out free rations a minute ago you were talking about people going hungry dowling reminded him now youre flabbling about where your moneys coming from thats a different story and its not one i care much about thats on account of you dont have to worry about feeding your family falstaff jeffries eyed dowlings expanse of belly you dont worry about feeding at all do you i told younobodyll starve dowling said tightly not you not your family and not me either but my storell go under jeffries wailed theres a war on in case you didnt notice dowling said youre alive youre in one piece your familys all right count your blessings jeffries muttered something under his breath dowling wouldnt have sworn it was damnyankee but he thought so the grocer rose well i can see i wont get any help here if you think ill open our lines so your supplies can get through youre even crazier than i give you credit for and thats not easy dowling said jeffries took a deep breath then seemed to remember where he was and to whom he was talking he left without another word which was no doubt wise of him abner dowling hadnt acted like a military tyrant in the west texas territory eleventh army had conquered but the temptation was always there and if he felt like it so was the power l ieutenantcolonel jerry dover was not a happy man the confederate supply officer had had to pull back again and again and hed had to wreck or burn too much that he couldnt take with him his dealings with the higherups from whom he got his supplies always touchy approached the vitriolic now what do you mean you cant get me any more antibarrel rounds he shouted into a field telephone coming out of the restaurant business in augusta he was much too used to dealing with suppliers who welshed at the worst possible time what are the guns supposed to shoot at the yankees aspirins i got plenty of those i cant give you what i dont have replied the officer at the other end of the line not as much getting into atlanta as there ought to be these days dover laughed a nasty sarcastic laugh well when the us soldiers come marching in buddy youll know why have fun in prison camp this is nothing to joke about goddammit the other officer said indignantly whos joking dover said only reason they havent gone in yet is they dont want to have to fight us house to house but if you dont get out pretty damn quick theyll surround the placeand then you wont get out general patton says that wont happen the other officer told him as if patton had a crystal ball and could see the future yeah well when a guy wants to lay a girl hell say hell only stick it in halfway you know what thats worth dover said you want to keep the yankees away from your door get me those shells i dont have any i can release aha jerry dover pounced a minute ago you didnt have any at all cough up some of what youre holding out on me or youll be sorrywill you ever if i do that theyll put my tit in a wringer the officer in atlanta whined if you dont youll get your ass shot off dover said and ill tell all the frontline soldiers youre holding out on me you can find out if our guys or the yankees get you first doesnt that sound like fun you wouldnt the other officer sounded horrified damn right i would i was in the trenches myself the last time around i know how much real soldiers hate it when the quartermasters dont give em what they need to fight the war ill report your threats to general pattons staff yeah and so dover said cheerfully if they put me in the line maybe im a little worse off than i am here but not fuckin much if they throw me in the stockade or send me home im safer than you are why dont you just send me the ammo instead dont you reckon its easier all the way around instead of answering the supply officer in atlanta hung up on him but dover got the antibarrel ammunition as far as he was concerned nothing else really mattered if the other man had to tell his superiors some lies about where it went well that was his problem not dovers even with that shipment the confederates east of atlanta kept getting driven back too many us soldiers too many greengray barrels too many airplanes with the eagle and crossed swords if something didnt change in a hurryif something doesnt change in a hurry weve got another losing war on our hands dover thought hed never been one who screamed freedom at the top of his lungs and got a bulge in his pants whenever jake featherston started ranting hed voted whig at every election where he could without putting himself in danger but he had some idea what losing a second war to the usa would do to his country he didnt want to see that happenwho in his right mind did following featherston was bad not following him right now jerry dover figured would be worse he stepped away from the field telephone shaking his head not liking the tenor of his thoughts how could anybody in the confederacy have thoughts he liked right now you had to be smoking cigarettes the quartermaster department didnt issue to believe things were going well or you had to read the official cs army newspaper a quartermaster sergeant named pete handed dover a copy of the latest issue it was fresh from the press he could still smell the ink and it smudged his fingers as he flipped through the armored bear if you looked at what the reporters there said everything was wonderful enemy troops were about to get blasted out of georgia a shattering defeat that will pave the way for the liberation of tennessee and kentucky the paper called it the armored bear didnt say how or when it would happen though soldiers who werent in georgia might buy that jerry dover would believe it when he saw it the armored bear spent half a column laughing at the idea that the damnyankees could threaten birmingham this industrial center continues to turn out arms for victory some uniformed reporter wrote a year earlier the idea of us soldiers anywhere near birmingham really would have been laughable cs troops were battering their way into pittsburgh they went in yes but they didnt come out now the story sounded more as if the writer were whistling his way past the graveyard had the yankees wanted to turn on birmingham it would have fallen dover was sure of that they thought atlanta was more important and they had the sense not to try to do two things at the same time when they could make sure of one photos of nightfighter pilots with gaudy new medals on their chests adorned the front page the story under the photos bragged of air victories over richmond atlanta birmingham vicksburg and little rock that was all very well but why were us bombers over all those towns and another story bragged of longrange rockets hitting washington philadelphia pittsburgh not a word about the great battle there the year before and nashville not a word that nashville was a confederate city either there is no defense against these weapons of vengeance traveling thousands of miles an hour they strike powerful blows against the yankee aggressors the paper said soon improved models will reach new york boston indianapolis and other us centers that imagine themselves to be safe confederate science in the cause of freedom is irresistible jerry dover thoughtfully read that story over again unlike some of the others it told no obvious lies he hoped it was true if the confederates could pound the crap out of us targets without wasting precious pilots and bombers they might make the enemy say uncle it struck him as the best chance they had anyway on an inside page was a story about a football game between guards and us pows down at andersonville south of atlanta a photo showed guards and prisoners in football togs dover thought the piece was a failure so what if the guards won if they were healthy enough to play football why the hell werent they healthy enough to fight maybe that wasnt fair and maybe the guards had pull that kept them away from the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune dover knew which way hed bet the story almost pissed him off enough to make him crumple up the paper and throw it away almost but not quite one thing in chronically short supply was toilet paper wiping his butt with the footballplaying guards struck him as the best revenge he could get later he asked if pete had seen the story about the andersonville football game the noncom looked disgusted oh hell yes he answered closest those bastards ever get to real yankees aint it looks that way to me dover said i wondered if you saw things the same usually some pretty good stuff in the armored bear pete said shitheads who turn it out fucked up this time though maybe he imagined soldierssergeants like himself saysitting around a table deciding what to put into the army newspaper dover would have bet things didnt work like that the writers likely got their orders from somebody in the department of communications maybe in a soldiers uniform but probably in a party one everything in the paper was professionally smooth everything made the war and the news look as good as they could or a little better than that no amateur production could have been so effectivemost of the time but when the truth stared you in the face what a paper said stopped mattering so much reckon we can stop the damnyankees pete asked if we dont seems like were in a whole peck o trouble looks that way to me too dover answered if they take atlantawell thats pretty bad we should have stopped them in front of chattanooga he thought glumly now that theyre through the gap and into georgia they can go where they please the paratroop drop that seized lookout mountain and missionary ridge from the confederates and made them evacuate chattanooga was a smart gutsy operation dover admired it while wishing his side hadnt been on the receiving end when night fell he slept in a tent with a foxhole right next to it us bombers came over at night even more often than in the daytime the heavy drone of engines overhead sent him diving into the hole even before the alarm sounded bombs burst with heavy thuds that reminded him of earthquakes hed never been in any earthquakes but he was sure they had to be like this antiaircraft guns thundered and lightninged filling the air with the sharp stink of smokeless powder dover listened hopefully for the concussive thud of stricken bombers smashing into the ground but in that he was disappointed fewer bombs fell close by than he expected from the number of airplanes overhead which didnt disappoint him a bit then something fluttered down from the sky like an oversized snowflake and landed on top of his head he grabbed the sheet of cheap pulp paper the flash of the guns showed him a large us flag printed in full color with text below that he couldnt make out in the darkness and without his reading glasses more propaganda he murmured with a sigh of relief if the damnyankees wanted to drop their lies instead of high explosives he didnt mind a bit had that been a bomb falling on his head he stuck the sheet into a trouser pocket and forgot he had it till the next morning only when it crinkled as he moved did he remember and take it out for a look confederate soldiers your cause is lost it shouted and went on from there it urged him to save his life by coming through the lines holding up the picture of the stars and stripes maybe us soldiers wouldnt shoot him if he did that but it struck him as a damn good recipe for getting shot by his own side if his own sides propaganda was bad the enemys was worse look at the disaster jake featherston has led you into dont you want true freedom for your country it said all jerry dover wantedall most confederates wantedwas to see the yankees go away and leave his country alone they didnt seem to understand that if the sheets falling from the sky meant anything they thought they were liberators my ass jerry dover said as if he had a us propaganda writer in the tent with him the united states had invaded the confederate states four times in the past eighty years if they thought theyd be welcomed with anything but bayonets they were even bigger fools than dover gave them credit fornot easy but not he supposed impossible and if the confederates wanted to change their government they could take care of it on their own all the bodyguards in the world wouldnt keep jake featherston alive for long if enough people decided he needed killing no yankees had to help dover started to chuck the propaganda sheet then changed his mind my ass he said one more time now happily and put it back in his pocket as with the story in the armored bear he could treat it as it deserved n ovember in the north atlantic wasnt so bad as january or february but it was bad enough the josephus daniels rode out one big swell after another on the destroyer escorts bridge sam carsten felt as if he were on gods seesaw up and down up and down up and down forever you still have that hydrophone contact he shouted down the speaking tube to vince bevacqua yes sir sure do the chief petty officer answered coming in as clear as you can expect with waves like this all right then lets give the submersible two ashcans sam said thatll bring it to the surface where we can deal with it he shouted the order over the pa system the launcher crew at the josephus daniels bow sent the depth charges flying into the ocean one at a time well ahead of the ship they were set to detonate not far below the surface sam felt the explosions through the soles of his feet something rude came out of the speaking tube had my earphones on when the first one burst bevacqua said thatll clean your sinuses from the inside out he paused then went on the subs making noises like its blowing water out of its dive chambers ought to be coming to the surface well be ready for anything carsten promised and the destroyer escort was both fourinchers bore on the submarine when it surfaced so did several of the the ships twin mm antiaircraft guns and hercaliber machine guns a swell washed over the subs bowand almost washed over the conning tower too this weather was tough to take in the josephus daniels it had to be ten times worse in a submersible sailors ran up a flag on the sub the white black and red jack of the imperial german navy sam breathed a sigh of relief this is the one were supposed to meet all right he said so it would seem sir lieutenant myron zwilling agreed sam wished he had more use for the exec zwilling was brave enough and more than willing enough but he had all the warmth and character of an old soursmelling rag men obeyed him because he wore two stripes on his sleeve not because he made them want to the submersibles signal lamp started flashing morse wehaveyourpackage sam read slowly he knows english then good he handled the destroyer escorts blinker himself will approach for pickup he sent back come ahead be careful in these seas the sub signaled sam wished pat kelly were still aboard but his old exec had a ship of his own a newer faster ship than the josephus daniels he was probably showing his whole crew what a demon shiphandler he was sam wasnt and never would be neither was zwilling since he wasnt sam kept the conn himself as he steered closer to the submersible he ordered bevacqua to keep paying close attention to any echoes that came back from his hydrophone pings the cpo laughed mirthlessly oh im on it skipper dont you worry about that he said its my neck too after all good sam said long as you remember german subs werent the only ones prowling the north atlantic plenty of us boats were out here too more to the point so were british french and confederate submarines the odds against any one of them being in the neighborhood were long but so were the odds against filling an inside straight and lucky optimists did that every day in both the great war and this one us admirals and their german counterparts dreamt of sweeping the british and french fleets from the north atlantic and joining hands in the middle it hadnt happened then and it wouldnt happen this time around either the enemy kept the two allies apart except for sneaky meetings like this one near enough the submersibles captain signaled but sam steered closer anticipating the next swell with a small motion of the wheel the subs skipper waved to him then seeing that he knew what he was doing he lifted one hand from the wheel to wave back throw a line came the flashes from the ugly deadly ruststreaked boat is the package waterproof sam asked ja the submersible skipper answered sam knew more german than that his folks had spoken it on the farm where he grew up he ordered a line thrown a german sailor in a greasy pea jacket and dungarees ran along the subs wet hull to retrieve it sam wouldnt have cared to do that not with the boat pitching the way it was but the man grabbed the line carried it back to the conning tower and climbed the iron ladder nimble as a barbary ape the german skipper tied the package whatever it was to the end of the line then he waved to the josephus daniels the sailor whod cast the line drew it back hand over hand when he took the package off it he waved up to sam carsten on the bridge after waving back sam got on the blinker again we have it thanks and good luck likewise for you the german answered he lifted his battered cap in salute then he and the other men on the conning tower disappeared into the dark smelly depths of the submersible the boat slid below the surface and was gone a moment later the sailor brought the packagewhich was indeed wrapped in oilskins and sheet rubber and impressively sealedup to the bridge here you go sir he said handing it to sam and saluting thanks enos carsten answered the sailor hurried away now into the safe the exec asked thats what my orders are sam agreed wonder why the brass are making such a fuss about it said thad walters the yranging officer beats me sam answered with a grin they pay me not to ask questions like that so im going to lock this baby up right now mr zwilling come to my cabin with me so you can witness that ive done it mr walters you have the conn having a witness was in the orders too hed never had anything on board before that came with such tight security requirements aye aye sir the execs voice stayed formal but he sounded more pleased than otherwise red tape was meat and drink to him he would have done better manning a desk ashore and counting turbine vanes than as secondincommand on a warship but the navy couldnt fit all its pegs into the perfect holes you did the best you could in the slot they gave youand if you happened to be the skipper you did the best you could with the men set under you if they werent all the ones you would have chosen yourselfwell there was a war on sams cabin wasnt far from the bridge it wasnt much wider than his own wingspan but it gave him a tiny island of privacy when he needed one along with his bedwhich he didnt get to use enoughhe had a steel desk and a steel chair and the safe he shielded it with his body as he spun the combination so the exec couldnt see it more orders the metal door swung open i am putting the package in the safe he intoned and did just that the seals are unbroken sir i have observed you doing so myron zwilling said like a man giving responses to a preacher in church and i confirm that the seals are unbroken all right then im closing up sam did and spun the lock once more to keep it from showing the last number now we go back to boston the exec said just as fast as our little legs will carry us sam replied zwilling gave him a look of faint distaste sam sighed silently if the exec was born with a sense of whimsy hed had it surgically removed as a kid and the josephus daniels legs were indeed little she couldnt make better than about twentyfour knots far slower than a real destroyer the only reason that occurred to carsten for picking her for this mission was that she was one of the most anonymous ships in the navy the enemy wouldnt pay much attention to her if he didnt command her he wouldnt pay much attention to her himself as they left the cabin sam added i am locking the door behind me yes sir zwilling said youre also supposed to post two armed guards outside until you removewhatever it isfrom the safe go get two men serve them out with submachine guns from the arms locker and bring them back here ill stand guard in the meantime sam said if jake featherstons hiding under the paint somewhere ill do my goddamnedest to hold him off till you get back with the reinforcements eryes sir the exec seemed relieved to get away this time sam sighed out loud pat would have sassed him right back instead of taking everything so seriously well what could you do before long the armed guards took their places in front of the door to the captains quarters sam went back to the bridge i have the conn he announced as he took the wheel from walters i am changing course to we are on our way back to boston he rang the engine room all ahead full all ahead full aye aye sir the response came back through a speaking tube the black gang would wring every knot they could from the josephus daniels the only trouble was she didnt have many knots to wring every mile sam put between himself and the spot where hed met the uboat eased his mind that it also meant he was one mile closer to his own country did nothing to make him unhappy either he wanted nothing more than to getwhatever it was out of his safe and off his ship he didnt like having men with automatic weapons outside his door at all hours of the day and night were it up to him he would have been much more casual about the mysterious package but it wasnt so he followed orders he also followed orders in maintaining wireless silence till he got within sight of cape ann northeast of boston a couple of patrolling us seaplanes had already spotted him by then and he supposed sent their own wireless signals but nobodyespecially not his execwould be able to say he hadnt done everything the brass told him to do two coast guard cutters steamed out from rockport and escorted the josephus daniels across massachusetts bay as if she had royalty on board sam didnt think the germans could have dehydrated the kaiser and stuffed him into that flat package but you never could tell when a pilot came aboard to steer the destroyer escort through the minefields outside of boston harbor sam greeted him with the powers that be wont like it if you pick the wrong time to sneeze the pilot had flaming red hair ears that stuck out like jug handles and an engagingly homely grin my wife wont like it either sir he answered and that counts a hell of a lot more with me sounds like the right attitude sam allowed myron zwilling clucked like a fretful mother hen yes he worshipped at authoritys shrine they got through the invisible barricade and tied up in the boston navy yard as soon as they did a swarm of marines and highranking officers descended on them one of the captains nodded when he saw the guards outside sams door as per instructions he said yes sir sam said and when was that ever the wrong answer everybody waited impatiently till he opened the safe and took out the package he wondered what would happen if he pretended to forget the combination odds were the newcomers had somebody who could jigger the lock faster than he could open it with the numbers here you go sir he handed the package to a vice admiral any chance ill ever know what this is all about no the man said at once but then he unbent a little not officially anyhow if you can add two and two you may get a hint one day even that little was more than carsten expected all right sir he said officially of course none of this ever happened the vice admiral went on we arent here at all how am i supposed to log that sir possessed by ghostssummoned exorcist sam said the vice admiral laughed so did sam who was kidding on the square ii c amp humble wasnt perfect but it came as close as jefferson pinkard could make it the commandant probably had more experience with camps designed to get rid of people than anybody else in the business one thing hed learned was not to call it that or even think of it like that reducing population was a phrase with far fewer unpleasant associations that mattered it mattered a surprising amount guards who brooded about the things they did had a way of eating their guns or otherwise doing themselves in if you gave it a name that seemed innocuous they didnt need to brood so much back at camp dependable outside of alexandria louisiana guards had actually taken negroes out into the swamps and shot them that was hard on the mennot as hard as it was on the negroes but hard enough things got better when jeff thought of asphyxiating trucks then the guards didnt have to pull the trigger themselves they didnt have to deal with blood spraying everywhere and with screams and with men who werent quite dead all they had to do was take out bodies and get rid of them that was a hell of a lot easier and the poisongas chambers hed started at camp determination in west texas were better yet they got rid of more blacks faster than the trucks did and saved on fuel besides the prairie out by snyder offered plenty of room for mass graves as big as anybody could want everything at camp determination would have been if not perfect at least pretty damn good if not for the damnyankees pinkard muttered god fry the stinking damnyankees in their own grease who would have figured the us army would push into west texas one of the reasons for building camp determination way out there was that it was the ass end of nowhere the enemy hadnt seemed likely to bother a camp there but the freedom party underestimated how much propaganda the usa could get out of the camps and earlier this year the united states had attacked everywhere they could all at once not seriously but hard enough to keep the csa from reinforcing the defenders in kentucky and tennessee where the real action was and it worked kentucky and tennessee were lost and georgia was in trouble and camp determination was lost too the united states had bombed the rail lines coming into the camp so it couldnt reduce population the way it was supposed to and theyd also bombed the crap out of snyder jeff thanked god his own family came through all right the confederate defenders finally had to pull back so now the yankees had all the atrocity photos they wanted and jefferson pinkard had camp humble humble texas just north of houston lay far enough east that the united states wouldnt overrun it unless the confederacy really went down the drain the usa had a much harder time bombing the rail lines that came through here too so negroes came in they got into trucks that took them nowhere except to death or they went into bathhouses that pumped out cyanide instead of hot water after that they went up in smoke literally pinkard scowled the crematorium wasnt up to snuff the outfit that built it had sold the csa a bill of goods the smoke that billowed from the tall stacks stank of burnt meat it left greasy soot wherever it touched sometimes bits of real flesh went up the stacks and came down a surprising distance away you couldnt very well keep camp humbles purpose a secret with a thing like that stinking up the air for miles around somebody knocked on the door to jeff s office its open he called come on in a guard with a worried look obeyed guards who came into the commandants office almost always wore a worried look they wouldnt have been there if they didnt have something to worry about well jeff asked sir we got us a nigger says he knows you the guard said and you waste my time with that shit pinkard said scornfully christ on a crutch mcilhenny it happens once a trainload either these coons know me or theyre asshole buddies with the president one like anybodyd be dumb enough to believe em sir this here niggers named vespasian mcilhenny said says you and him and another coon named uh agrippa used to work together at the sloss works in birmingham reckon hes about your age anyways well fuck me jeff said in surprise hes telling the truth the grayuniformed guard asked i reckon maybe he is jeff said the last war they started using niggers more in factory jobs when white men got conscripted i did work with those two hell with me if i didnt we didnt send him on right away mcilhenny said wanted to find out what you had in mind first you want we can get rid of him or if you want to see him we can do that too vespasian jefferson pinkards voice was far away he hadnt thought about vespasian in years sometimes the years hed put in at the steel mill seemed to have happened to someone else or in a different lifetime but he said yeah ill talk to him he wasnt a bad niggernot uppity or anything and he worked pretty hard we were gonna put him in a truck the guard said if they had vespasian wouldnt be seeing anybody this side of the pearly gates he looked apprehensive asphyxiating somebody the commandant really knew wouldnt do wonders for your career well im glad you didnt pinkard heaved his bulk out of the chair behind his desk a lot of fat padded the hard muscles hed got working in the foundry he grabbed a submachine gun off a wall bracket and made sure the drum magazine that fed it was full if vespasian had some sort of revenge in mind he wouldnt go on a truck after all instead hed get ventilated on the spot take me to him he in the holding area sure is sir the guard answered camp humble had one to give the guards the chance to deal with prisoners who were dangerous or just unusual you searched him jeff took nothing for granted some of the people who worked for him were dumb as rocks but the guard nodded sure did sir up the ass and everything he made a face he aint got nothin all right then jeff said it sounded as if the men in gray were on the ball this time when they got to the holding area he found two more guards aiming assault rifles at vespasian one of them blinked be damned he said this mangy old coon wasnt blowing smoke then vespasian wasnt exactly mangy but he was only a shadow of the burly buck whod worked alongside jefferson pinkard half a lifetime earlier he was grayhaired and scrawny and looked like a man whod been through hell if his train ride from birmingham to camp humble was like most he had a powerful stench clung to him he hadnt washed in a long time and hadnt always made it to a toilet or a slop bucket either he nodded to jeff not as one equal to another but as a man who knew another man anyhow really is you mistuh pinkard he said his voice desertdry and rough been a hell of a long time aint it sure as hell has jeff answered he turned to the guards get him some water reckon he can use it do jesus you right about that vespasian croaked when the water camein a pail not a glasshe drank and drank how long had he gone without days plainly and when he said that was mighty fine he sounded much more like his old self what ever happened to that noaccount cousin of yours or whatever the hell he was jeff asked you know the one i meanthe guy they threw in jail what the hell was his name you mean leonidas vespasian said and jeff nodded the black man went on they let him out after the las war was overdecided he werent no danger to the country or nobody else he kept his nose clean afterwards got married had a couple chillun died o tb a little befo the new war start how about that jeff said i plumb lost touch with birmingham lately he hesitated then waved the guards away ill be all right dammit he told them i got a gun and he aint dumb enough to give me no trouble they didnt like it but the man who made the rules could break them too when the guards were out of earshot jeff asked vespasian ever hear what happened to that gal i used to be married to yes suh vespasian nodded she went downhill pretty bad got to drinkin an carryin on with men aint heard nothin bout her in a while though dunno if shes alive or dead huh jeff s grunt was more selfsatisfied than anything else run around on him would emily whatever she got after he cut her loose served her right as far as he was concerned bitch he muttered under his breath probably had a goddamn taxi meter between her legs vespasian either didnt catch that or had the sense to pretend he didnt he lifted the pail to his mouth again pinkard tensed if he threw itbut he set it down and wiped his mouth on his filthy sleeve ask you somethin now suh go ahead jeff told him what you do with me now that im here you give people trouble now mistuh pinkard you know i aint like that vespasian said reproachfully i sure do jeff nodded i told mcilhenny the same thing when he said you were asking for me so you just stay in the barracks and do like the guards tell you and everythingll be fine sure werent fine comin here vespasian didnt sound as if he believed a word of it he was nobodys fool evidently jeff knew what kind of lies he was telling he didnt have anything against vespasian as a man but he didnt have the kind of affection for him that would have made him want to keep his former coworker around in defiance of the rules the rules said the confederacy needed to get rid of blacks they caused the country more trouble than they were worth from everything jefferson pinkard had seen that was the gospel truth and it was just vespasians hard luck that hed finally wound up at camp humble so jeff shrugged and spread his hands and went right on lying i am sorry about that honest to god wish it couldve been better but theres a war on that was the handydandy excuse for anything these days aint no reason to leave a man in his own filth aint no reason to have people die on the way to this here place vespasian said whats gonna happen to us all now that wes here fear and apprehension roughened his voice you got to remember this is nothin but a transit camp jeff saidone more lie piled on all the others youll get some food youll get cleaned up and well send you on the way again and so they would on a journey from which vespasian wouldnt come back then youll sit out the war somewhere else once were done licking the damnyankees i reckon youll go on back to birmingham well sort all that shit out then i got to wait till we lick the usa reckon ill be at that other camp forever vespasian said the gibe held much more truth than jeff wished it did it also played on his own fears he tried not to show that but he did call the guards back take him off to the barracks thats scheduled for the bathhouse next he told them once he gets cleaned up well go from there yes sir the guards chorused one of them nudged vespasian come on you heard the boss get moving away vespasian went did he know jeff had just ordered him liquidated pretty soon hed go up the crematorium stack one more smudge of soot in a system that didnt work as well as advertised jeff might have found a lesson there had he been looking for one since he wasnt he didnt worry about it he had a job to do and he aimed to keep at it till it was done c ongresswoman flora blackford was sick to death of war she didnt know of anyone in the usa who wasnt but she also didnt know of anyone except a few fools and lunatics who wanted to make peace with the confederate states and jake featherston thered been more doubt and disagreement during the great war had the european powers patched up a peace then odds were the usa and csa would have done the same nowthe one thing featherston had done was unify the united statesagainst him no arguments about workers solidarity now not even from the hardcore wing of the socialist party getting rid of the enemy came first her secretary stuck her head into floras inner office the assistant secretary of war is on the line congresswoman she said thank you bertha put him through flora said she picked up the telephone on her desk even before the first ring finished hello flora franklin roosevelt boomed how are you this lovely morning flora looked out the maskingtaped window it was pouring rain and the weatherman said there was a chance of sleet tonight winter hadnt got to philadelphia but you could see it coming roosevelts office down in the bowels of the war department was only a few blocks from hers have you been down there so long youve forgotten its not july any more she asked he chuckled merrily well you can see when you come over telephone lines coming out of the war department and the congressional office building were supposed to be the most secure in the usa saying too much over them wasnt a good idea anyhow roosevelt had something interesting though flora was sure of that on my way she told him and hung up had the weather been halfway decent she would have walked as things were she flagged a cab even the short ride showed her a couple of hits from the new confederate rockets they were aiming at the center of government but werent especially accurate they fell all over philadelphia no warning was possible the only thing you could do to stay safe was to be somewhere else when they came down aint they terrible aint they wicked said the cab driver a middleaged woman how come we dont got nothin like that i expect were working on them flora wasnt exactly giving away military secrets by admitting that we shoulda done it first the cabby said blow them confederate bastards to kingdom come without our boys gettin hurt that would be good flora thought of her own son joshua was in basic training now pretty soon if the war didnt end first theyd give him a rifle and turn him loose on the enemy the enemy unfortunately had riflesamong other thingstoo flora paid the driver opened the cabs door opened her umbrella and splashed up the broad stairs to the entrance to the war department she didnt get very wet but she didnt exactly stay dry either at the entrance soldiers examined her id with remorseless care before letting her in she didnt get very far in even then not at first a hardfaced woman frisked her in a sandbagged revetment that could blunt the force of a people bomb only then did a private with peach fuzz escort her down down down to franklin roosevelts office you look like something the cat dragged in the assistant secretary of war exclaimed can i fix you a drink purely medicinal of course of course flora said deadpan thanks id love one the medicinal alcohol turned out to be some fine scotch confiscated from a british freighter roosevelt explained i arranged for a friend of mine in the navy department to get some good tennessee sipping whiskey and this is how he scratched my back nice to have friends flora said i like scotch better too i still owe him a little something or maybe not such a little something roosevelt said the navys been nice to us lately has it flora said when roosevelt nodded she went on does that have something to do with why you called me over he beamed at her i knew you were smart it sure does a few days ago one of our destroyer escorts met the u somewhere in the north atlantic the navy and the germans worked out just where it doesnt matter anyhow except that they did meet the skipper of the submersible passed a package to the skipper of the josephus danielsthats the destroyer escort our ship brought the package in to boston and now weve got it what is it flora asked something to do with uranium unless im crazy right the first time franklin roosevelt agreed we finally managed to talk the kaiser into letting us know just how far along the germans are and and theyre ahead of us well no surprisemost of the top nuclear physicists come from germany or austriahungary and bohr from denmark is working for them too roosevelt said but this will speed us up i dont know all the details yet our people are still trying to figure out what the details are if you know what i mean its good news though sounds like it flora said have we got any good news about these confederate rockets not much roosevelts jaunty smile slipped when it did she could see how worn and weary he was he looked like a man busy working himself to death she couldnt even say anything because he was far from the only one doing the same thing he paused to light a cigarette and suck in smoke through the holder he liked to use about all we can do is bomb their launchers and theyve made them portable so the damn thingsexcuse mearent easy to find and in the meantime we sit here and take it flora said can we bomb the factories where they make the rockets when we find em well bomb em roosevelt promised i wish the confederates would paint rocket factory on the roof in big letters it sure would make reconnaissance a lot easier we do keep plugging away im so glad flora murmured which made roosevelt laugh what about the town where theyre working on uranium are we still giving it the onceover every chance we get he replied theyve got antiaircraft fire like you wouldnt believe all around lexingtonoops pretend you didnt hear that pretend i didnt hear what flora said and franklin roosevelt laughed again yeah the flak is thick enough to land on the pilots say he continued and they put night fighters in the air too theyve quit pretending its not important they know we know it is and theyre doing their best to keep us away i take it their best isnt good enough the assistant secretary of war shook his strongjawed head not even close were punishing themthats the only word for it i happen to know their boss researcher went to richmond not long ago to squall like a branded calf i wish i would have found out sooner i might have tried to arrange to put him out of action for good you have people in richmond who can arrange that flora asked with faint or maybe not so faint distaste the confederates made a policy of rubbing out us officers they found dangerous turnabout was fair play but even sowar is a filthy business it sure is and the only thing worse than a war is a lost war two of those a lifetime ago almost ruined the country forever roosevelt said so yes there are people who would have tried to make sure professor soandso never stood up in front of a blackboard again no guarantees of course but we would have had a go at it would killing him make that much difference to the confederate war effort no way to be sure but we think so he gets almost anything he wants when it comes to money and equipment they know how important a uranium bomb is for them if they get it first they can still lick us if they dont well knock them flat and then well start kicking them alevai flora said roosevelt looked quizzical no reason he should know yiddish she explained it means something like hopefully or god willing hed better be willing if hes not hes as sleepy as elijah said baal was roosevelt said they need licking dammit that camp determination turned out to be even worse than you said i hadnt imagined it could but there you are what general dowling found would gag a maggot it really would flora resisted the impulse to shout i told you so she had over and over again but it was too late to do anything about that now instead she said its not the only camp theyre running theyve got plenty more from east texas to alabama if we can wreck the rail lines going into them we slow the slaughter anyhow were doing some of that roosevelt said its not our top priority i admit beating the enemy in the field is but were doing what we can he clicked his tongue between his teeth with all the effort the confederate states are putting into the camps i think featherston would just as soon kill off his negroes as beat us if thats not insane its certainly strange depends on how you look at things flora replied even if they lose the negroes will still be gone for good and the freedom party thinks it is good if they lose the freedom party is gone for good i dont think theyve figured that out yet roosevelt said grimly if they lose chances are the confederate states of america are gone for good too im sure those goons havent figured that out yet what do we do with them flora asked can we occupy everything from the border of alaska all the way to the rio grande can we not roosevelt returned and she had no good answer for him what we got from the germans really will help us build our bomb she said he was bound to be right about one thing winning came first the physicists say it will theyre right more often than theyre wrong seems like theyd better be anyhow roosevelt said i just pray some british or french sub hasnt carried papers like that to the confederacy oy that dismayed flora into yiddish again that would be terrible it sure would roosevelt said and the confederates have something to trade for it too i bet the english and the french would just love to shoot rockets way into germany oy flora repeated what can we do about it sink all the submersibles we can and hope we get the one thats packed full of secret plans roosevelt answered and yes i knowwhat are the odds but we cant very well tell the enemy not to help their allies that would make them more likely to do it not less im afraid youre right flora said after thinking it over she sighed when we broke into georgia i thought the war was as good as won but itll come right down to the wire wont it maybe not maybe well just knock them flat the assistant secretary of war said but theyve got some rabbits they could pull out of the hat well do everything we can to steal the hat or burn it but if they hang on to itlast time around we could see wed win months before we finally did not so easy to be sure now thats not for public consumption of course officially everythings just fine officially everythings always fine officially everything was fine when the confederates were driving on lake erie to cut us in half flora said cant go around saying things are bad and were losing people might believe us why they dont believe us when we tell them everythings just fine by now they must figure we lie to them all the time flora listened to herself with something approaching horror had she really turned so cynical she feared she had t he british ambassador is here to see you mr president jake featherstons secretary announced thanks lulu send him in the president of the csa said lord halifax was tall and thin with a long bald head and a pinched mouth and jaw he reminded jake of a walking thermometer bulb uppermost no matter what he looked like though no denying he was one sharp bird mr president he murmured in an accent almost a caricature of an upperclass englishmans good to see you your excellency featherston held out his hand halifax shook it his grip wasnt the dead fish you would expect the president waved him to a chair have a seat glad you came through the last raid all right our embassy has an excellent shelter indeed these days the shelter is the embassy more or less halifax said the chaps who stay on im afraid draw hazardousduty pay you cant stop the united states from bombing the crap out of your capital that was what he meant even if he was too much the diplomat to come out and say it yeah well i hear the germans and austrians up in philadelphia get bonuses too jake said they may be hurting us but were still in it in meetings like this words were smoke screens concealing what lay behind them indeed halifax said which might have meant it could be or just as easily my ass im hoping your country can do more to keep the canadians fired up against the united states jake said believe me mr president were doing everything we can this being in our interest as well lord halifax replied the naval situation in the atlantic remaining complex however we cannot do as much as we would wish and events on the continent naturally influence other commitments of scarce resources jake had no trouble translating that into plain english the germans were pushing england and france back the limeys didnt have so much to spare for adventures on this side of the atlantic as theyd had when things were going better closer to home what the damnyankees arent using up there theyre shooting at us featherston said if we go under they aim everything at you how long do you think youll last if they do they had a generation earlier and the united kingdom didnt last long chances were it wouldnt now either and lord halifax couldnt shoot that one back at him the usa could go after britain in a big way if the csa went undercould and would but if britain went down germany wouldnt care about the confederacy the confederate states were no threat to the kaiser not till they got a uranium bomb when they did the whole goddamn world needed to watch out i said we were doing everything we could mr president and i assure you i meant it most sincerely the british ambassador said we appreciate the csas importance to the overall strategic picture believe you me we do our task would become much more difficult if the united states was prosecuting the atlantic war with all their energy and resources you are tying the damnyankees down for us again halifaxs words were pretty straightforward he had to figure jake could see that much for himself and jake could he leaned forward across his desk toward the limey fair enough he said his rasping voice and harsh halfeducated accent contrasting sharply with halifaxs soft elegant tones now we come down to it if you need us in the war if you need us to lick the usa for you why the hell wont you tell us what all you know about uranium bombs weve got our own project goingyou can bet your bottom dollar on that but if you give us a hand it helps you and us both sooner we start blowing the damnyankees skyhigh the happier everybodyll be except them i mean halifaxs bony face never showed much he would have made a dangerous poker player but his eyebrows rose a fraction now maybe he hadnt expected jake to be so direct if he hadnt he didnt know the president of the confederate states as well as he thought he did uranium is an extremely delicate subject he said at last tell me about it featherston exclaimed even so you think the united states arent working on a bomb of their own suppose they get it before we do theyll blast richmond off the map and new orleans and atlanta assuming atlanta hasnt fallen by then halifax said fuck you charlie featherston almost said it and diplomacy be damned at the last instant he bit his tongue what he did say was yeah well suppose they knock us out of the war then what how long before london goes up in smoke about as long as it takes to get a bomb across the ocean lord halifax looked physically ill the united states arent our only worry on that score he choked out i know damn germans started this whole mess somebody shouldve strangled that einstein bastard when he was a baby jake scowled too late to get all hot and bothered about it now look i dont even know how far along you guys are maybe were ahead of you the british ambassador winced ever so slightly ah that got him jake thought with an internal grin the mere idea that backward halfcolonials across the sea could get ahead of the high and mighty lords of creation on their own foggy island had to rankle to make sure it did jake added after all were a long ways ahead of you when it comes to rockets ask the yankees if you dont believe me halifax winced again more obviously this time jake featherstons internal grin got wider quite halifax muttered a oneword admission of pain reckon we can work a swap jake asked well tell you what we know were not afraid of our allies if you want to shoot rockets at the germans more power to you blow em to hell and gone i wont shed a tear and you can bet yourbackside on that an interesting proposal the ambassador said i am not authorized to agree to it but i shall put it to the prime minister if he deems it feasible we can proceed from there how long will that take my dear sir lord halifax spread his hands thats in winstons court im afraid not mine i will say he is not a man in the habit of brooking delay featherston wondered if they really did speak the same language he thought he understood what the british ambassador meant but he wasnt sure hoping he did he answered hed better not wait around youre in trouble and so are we the more we can help each other the better our chances right one could hardly disagree halifax said fair enough but jake wasnt smiling he was scowling thing youve got to remember is this cuts both ways you want what we know about rocketsany fool can see you do you want to get but you dont want to give and im here to tell you your lordship sir that aint gonna fly lord halifax was a diplomat if featherstons bluntness offended him he didnt let on i assure you mr president i intend to make your views plain to the prime minister what happens after that is up to him jake knew perfectly well he would have the hide of any confederate ambassador who exceeded his authority in fairness he couldnt blame winston churchill for feeling the same way but his definition of fairness was simple if he got what he wanted that was fair anything less and the other side was holding out on him most of the time he admired churchill like him the prime minister had spent much too long as a voice crying in the wilderness in a way churchill had a tougher job than he did britain needed to worry about fighting both the usa and the german empire but britain hadnt been invaded the last time around she hadnt been disarmed and had to start over all shed lost was irelandand the way the irish felt about their longtime overlords meant she might be better off without it with ireland gone the british didnt have to worry about keeping the lid on a country where a third of the population hated the guts of the other twothirds ireland was under british control now to keep the usa from using it as a forward base but military occupation had a whole different set of rules the limeys werent as tough on the micks as the freedom party was on confederate negroes but they didnt take any crap either tell him not to wait around thats all jake said for his sake and ours winston is a great many things but not a ditherer he may from time to time find himself mistaken he hardly ever finds himself unsure halifax said i do not know what his answer will be i am confident you will have it in short order good anything else jake was no ditherer either the united states are making a good deal of propaganda capital from that camp they captured in texas lord halifax said did you have to be quite so open in your destruction of the colored populace you know what your excellency i dont give a shit how much the damnyankees squawk about that jake wasnt being truthful but he didnt care he had to make the limey understand what we do inside our own country is nobodys business but ours weve had a nigger problem for hundreds of yearseven before we broke away from england now im finally doing something about it and i really dont care who doesnt like that were going to come out of this war niggerfree or as close to niggerfree as i can make us your solution isheroic halifax said jake liked that better than the british ambassador probably intended he felt like a hero for reducing the csas colored population i keep my campaign promises by god he said no one has ever doubted your determination lord halifax got to his feet if you will excuse me he left the presidents office when lulu looked in after halifax was gone jake featherston asked whos next mr goldman sir send him in send him in saul goldman had grown bald and pudgy in the twentyodd years jake had known him that had nothing to do with anything the little jew still made a damned effective director of communications because he did he could speak his mind to the president or come closer than most of the gladhanding yesmen who surrounded featherston i dont know how i can present any more losses in georgia he said now people will know im whistling in the dark no matter what i say then dont say anything jake answered just say the yankees are spewing out a pack of liesand they areand let it go at that goldman cocked his head to one side considering it could workfor a while but if atlanta falls sir its a propaganda disaster if atlanta falls its a fucking military disaster and the hell with propaganda featherston said i dont think thatll happen any time soon he hoped he wasnt whistling in the dark the news from georgia was bad and getting worse despite the fall rains you know more about that than i do im not a general and i dont pretend to be goldman said dont know why the hell not jake told him seems like every damn fool in the country wants to tell me how to run the war why should you be any different he held up a hand i know whyyou arent a damn fool i try not to be anyhow goldman said you do pretty well half of being smart is knowing what youre not smart at jake said plenty of folks reckon that cause they know something they know everything and that aint the way it works i never said it was goldman answered primly yeah i know jake said you make one a s far as irving morrell knew he was unique among us generals with the possible exception of a few big brains high up in the general staff his colleagues thought about winning battles after they won one if they did they worried about the next one morrell was different he thought about smashing the confederate states of america flat to him that was the goal battles were nothing in themselves they were just the means he needed to reach that end back when the csa still had soldiers in ohio hed drawn a slashing line on the map one that ran from kentucky through tennessee and georgia to the atlantic that was where he was going now he aimed to cut the confederacy in half once he did he figured the confederate states would do what anything cut in half did they would die the question uppermost in his mind now was simple could he go on to the ocean without bothering to capture atlanta first would the enemy die fast enough afterwards to make the risk worthwhile he pondered a map the chart was tacked to the wall of what had been a dentists office in monroe georgia more than fifty miles east of atlanta he would have used the mayors office but a direct hit from a left it draftier than he liked monroe had had a couple of big cottonprocessing plants both of them now rubble it had had a couple of fine houses that dated back to the days before the war of secession both of them now burnt war had never come to this part of the csa before it was here now and it made itself at home reluctantly morrell decided atlanta would have to fall before he stormed east again it gave the enemy too good a base for launching a counteroffensive against his flank if he ignored it too many roads and railroads ran through the place he couldnt be sure enough his air power would keep them all out of commission to ignore it taking chances was one thing taking stupid chances was something else again he didnt want to charge right into the city he aimed to envelop it instead that way the confederates couldnt do unto him as the usa did unto them in pittsburgh an attacking army that took a city block by block put its own dick in the meat grinder and turned the crank no help would come to atlanta from the north or the east and the bulk of the csas strength lay in those directions the confederate states were like a snail they had a hard shell that protected them from the united states once you broke through though you found they were soft and squishy underneath how much could they bring in from florida or alabama not nearly enoughor morrell didnt think so anyhow back when he first proposed his slash the general staff estimated it would take two years not one when chattanooga fell hed hoped to prove them wrong he might yet but racing ahead for the sake of speed wasnt smart then dont do it he muttered and headed out of the office on the floor lay the dentists diploma from tulane university the glass in the frame shattered morrell wondered whether the man was still practicing in monroe or had put on a butternut uniform and gone up toward the front two black men carrying rifles stalked along the street they wore armbands with usa on them white civilians fell over themselves getting out of their way they waved and nodded to morrell not quite salutes but close enough he nodded back the negro guerrillas made him nervous too but they scared white confederates to death which was good and they knew more about what was going on here than us troops did which was even better sometimes they shot first without bothering to ask questions later morrell was sure theyd killed a few people who didnt deserve killing but how many negroes who didnt deserve killing were dead all across the csa a little extra revenge might be too bad but morrell didnt intend to lose any sleep about it except for guerrillas not many negroes were left in and around monroe or anywhere us armies had reached white people seemed to suffer from a kind of collective amnesia more often than not they denied thered ever been many blacks close by in kentucky they said the negroes mostly lived in tennessee in tennessee they said the negroes mostly lived in georgia here in georgia they pointed two ways at once towards alabama and south carolina was that selective blindness a guilty conscience or both morrell would have bet on both young man a confederate dowager swept down on him i need to speak to you young man morrell almost looked over his shoulder to see whom she meant hed passed fifty a couple of years before and his weatherbeaten features didnt seem young even to himself but her gray hair and the turkeylike wattles under her chin said she was some distance ahead of him what can i do for you maam he asked as politely as he could young man i know you come from the united states and so are ignorant of a good deal of proper behavior but i must tell you that colored people are not permitted to go armed in this country she said he looked at her he did his best to look through her they are now by whose authority she demanded mine he tapped the stars on his shoulder strap you should be ashamed of yourself in that case she said of itself his hand dropped to the he wore on his belt lady i think you better get lost before i blow your stupid head off he said you people did your best to murder every negro you could catch and you have the gall to talk to me about shametheres not a word low enough for you the nerve the matron flounced off reality hadnt set in for her he wondered if it ever would or could over in texas general dowling had taken local big shots through the confederate death camp and into the mass graveyard so they could see with their own eyes what their country had done some of them had the decency to kill themselves afterwards others just went on the way they had before morrell wished he had one of those camps to show the locals then they wouldnt be able to shrug and pretend thered never been that many negroes in this part of the csa but he feared the matron wouldnt be much impressed afterwards she was one of those people for whom nothing seemed real if it didnt happen to her somebodyd painted yanks out on a wall morrell grabbed the first soldier he saw get some paint and grab a couple of these assholes and have em clean this shit up he told the man in greengray if they give you a hard time do whatever you have to do to get em to pay attention yes sir the soldier said and went off to take care of it with a grin on his face artillery rumbled off to the northeast morrell cocked his head to one side listening gauging those were confederate guns the enemy was still trying to blunt the us attack and drive morrells forces back he didnt think featherstons men could do it before long counterbattery fire or air strikes would make those cs gun bunnies sorry theyd ever been born and even sorrier theyd tried messing with the us army from what morrell had seen the only thing confederate civilians were sorry about was that their army hadnt done a better job of keeping the damnyankees away somehow that left him imperfectly sympathetic general another woman called to him this one was young and blond and pretty pretty enough to remind him how long hed been away from agnes she also looked mad enough to spit nails yes hed give her the benefit of the doubt as long as he could those niggers of yours she snapped what about em morrell didnt want them getting out of hand and raping all the women they could catch he could understand why theyd want to he could sympathize too but he wasnt running a mob he was running an army or trying to they looked at me they leered at me the grinning apes the blond woman said you ought to string them up and horsewhip them morrell needed a moment to realize she was dead serious when he did he almost wished the negroes had dragged her into an alley and done their worst thats not how thingsll work from here on out so youd better get used to it he said nobody gets whipped for looking heck im looking right now youre worth looking at no offense well of course as pretty women often did she took her good looks for granted but i dont mind it from youtoo much youre a yankee but youre not a nigger if they touch you and you dont like it you can complain if anybody touches you and you dont like it you can complain morrell said but they can look as much as they want you mean you wont do anything about it the blond woman sounded as if she couldnt believe her ears she looked disgusted almost nauseated thats what i said morrell told her you damnyankees really are animals then she pursed her lips perhaps getting ready to spit at him if you do anything stupid he said youll find out just what kind of animal i am you wont like iti promise he didnt shout and bluster that had never been his style he didnt need to he sounded like a man who meant exactly what he said and for a good reason he was the local woman stopped looking like somebody saving up spit she did look a little deflated then she gathered herself flung niggerlover in his face instead of saliva and stalked off fury gave her a fine hip action morrell admired it he was sure the negro auxiliaries had too up till now he hadnt had much use for negroes few whites in the usa did had he seen a couple of black men staring at a white womans butt on a street corner in say indianapolis that might have offended him in monroe georgia no in fact he smiled the enemies of his enemies were his friends all right after dark confederate bombers came over monroe and dropped explosives on the us soldiers in and around the townand on their own people a thin layer of low clouds hung above monroe so the confederates might as well have been bombing blind they couldnt come over by day not unless they wanted to get slaughtered in their shoes morrell supposed he would have preferred bombing blind to not bombing at all too he had a few minutes warning from yranging gear that spotted the approaching bombers and sounded the alarm before they started unloading us night fighters were also starting to carry yranging sets so far those sets were neither very strong nor very easy to use but they were already making night operations more expensive for the csa pretty soon electronics might make nighttime raids as risky as daylight ones crouching in a trench with bombs crashing down around him morrell could see a day where neither side on a battlefield would be able to hide anything from the other how would you fight a war then you could be so strong youd beat your enemy even if he did see what you had in mind you could yes but it wouldnt be easy or economical or you could make him think all your fancy preparations meant one thing and then go and do something else instead morrell nodded to himself if he had his druthers he would play it that way if the enemy kept staring at the cape he wouldnt see the sword till too late you saved your own men and matйriel that wayif you could bring it off the allclear warbled morrell got out of the trench and went back to his cot he didnt know how much damage the confederates had done probably someprobably not a lot without a doubt theyd screwed a lot of us soldiers out of a nights sleep that counted too though no civilians who hadnt got up groggy after an air raid would think so morrell yawned his eyes closed air raid or not the confederates didnt screw him out of more than fortyfive minutes j onathan moss had been on the run ever since a tornado let him break out of the andersonville pow camp joining spartacus band of negro guerrillas had kept the confederates from getting him it had also kept the guerrillas from shooting him and nick cantarella but joining them also ensured that he stayed on the run us forces werent far away now the rumble of artillery and the thud of bursting bombs came from the north by day and night running off to the troops from his own side would have been easy as pieif not for god only knew how many divisions worth of jake featherstons finest between him and them we gots to sit tight spartacus told his menagain and again a sure sign they didnt want to listen to him we gots to pretty soon the yankees they comes to us then we is free men fo true we is free at las moss and cantarella caught each others eye moss doubted it would be so simple by the new york infantry officers raised eyebrow so did he and however much they wished they werent they turned out to be right for a long time the countryside a hundred miles south of atlanta had been a military backwater peanut farms and cotton fields patrolledwhen they were patrolledby halfhearted mexican soldiers and by militiamen whose stamina and skill didnt match their zeal good guerrilla country in other words no more with the us irruption into northern georgia with the threat to atlanta southern georgia suddenly turned into a military zone encampments and supply dumps sprouted like toadstools after a rain truck convoys and trains brought supplies and soldiers up toward the front all that gave spartacus band and the other black guerrillas still operating chances theyd never had before if they mined a road and delayed a column of trucks if they sprayed machinegun bullets at a tent city in the middle of the night they really hurt the confederate war effort from everything jonathan moss gathered from the news and rumors he picked up the confederate states couldnt afford even fleabites on their backside they already had too much trouble right in front of them the enemy seemed to feel the same way when spartacus guerrillas did strike the men in butternut went after them with a ferocity they hadnt seen before if spartacus hadnt been fighting in country he knew better than the enemy did the confederates would have wiped out his band in short order as things were his men scrambled from woods to swamp half a jump ahead of their pursuers moss developed a new appreciation for possum and squirrel and turtle the negroes called one kind of longnecked terrapin chicken turtles presumably because of how they tasted moss couldnt see the resemblance he didnt spend much time bitching though any meat in his belly was better than none looking down at what was left of himself one weary evening he said back before the war i had a potbelly one of these days id like to get another one some of the shit we eat makes army rations look good nick cantarella agreed dont know that i could say anything worse about it amusement glinted in spartacus eyes as he looked from one white man to the other is mighty sorry to inconvenience you gentsmighty sorry he said if n you knows where we kin git us some ribs and beefsteaks sing out steak jesus cantarella started to laugh i even stopped thinking about steak what the hells the point how about confederate rations spartacus asked the mockery gone from his voice hearing the change in tone moss grew alert what do you have in mind boss he asked spartacus smiled he liked hearing the white men in his band acknowledge that he outranked them they got that new depot over by americus he said think we can hit it cantarella asked hope so anyways spartacus answered i got me a pretty good notion where they keeps the ration tins too see heres what i got in mind he sketched on the muddy ground with a stick he wouldnt have done so much explaining for the other negroes but he thought of the escaped us soldiers as military professionals and valued their opinion with nick cantarella that was justified moss knew it was a lot less so for him he listened to spartacus and tried to look wise cantarella sure as hell had a couple of suggestions that made the guerrilla leader nod in admiration yeah we do dat spartacus said we sure nough do dat featherstons fuckers dey dont know which way dey should oughta run thats the idea cantarella said if they go in a bunch of wrong directions the right one gets easier for us the guerrillas struck at night they stayed under cover while the sun was in the sky doing anything else would have asked to get slaughtered a negro threw a grenade into the depot from the north while another black banged away with a tredegartrying to stir up the anthill they did it too whistles shrilled men shouted soldiers boiled out after the negroes moss hoped the guerrillas had splendid hideyholes or quick legs as soon as the confederates were well and truly stirred the guerrillas machine gun opened up from the west nick cantarella had finally persuaded the gunner to fire short bursts and not squeeze off a belt of ammo at a time it made the weapon much more effective and much more accurate somebody inside the supply dump yelled lets get those coons goddammit they come around here they give us the chance to wreck em we better not waste it shouted orders followed the officerhe plainly was oneknew what he was doing and how to get his men to do what he wanted a scream said at least one machinegun bullet struck home the confederates fired back they also started moving against the machine gun a few black riflemen posted near the guerrillas heavy weapon discouraged that they were more mobile than the machinegun crew and gave the cs attackers some unpleasant surprises but the big surprise the guerrillas had in mind came from the far side of the supply depot as soon as the confederates were well engaged to the west spartacus whistled to the rest of the band and said lets go as it always did when he went into action jonathan moss heart pounded he clutched his tredegar and loped forward cutters snipped through the strands of barbed wire around the depot the supply dump was new and in a rear area the confederates hadnt had the time or energy to protect it the way they would have closer to the front no shootin here remembernot unless you got to spartacus called quietly in an out fast as you can like you was screwin with her pappy asleep right beside you from the way some of the negroes chuckled theyd done things like that most of them carried rifles or pistols or submachine guns three or four though pushed wheelbarrows instead moss couldnt imagine a homelier weapon of war but a man with a wheelbarrow could move much more food than someone who had to carry a crate in his arms or on his back what the hell a confederate calledthe negroes werent quiet enough to escape all notice were on patrol here moss said doing his best to imitate a southern accent why the devil arent you chasing those damn niggers uhon my way sir moss heard rapidly retreating footsteps he knew hed better not laugh out loud in his own ears he hadnt sounded much like a confederate at all but he had sounded like a white man and the soldier never dreamt hed run into a damnyankee here to him anybody who sounded like a white had to be on his side and anybody who sounded like an authoritative white had to be entitled to order him around how dyou like being a confederate officer nick cantarella whispered fine except the bastards dont pay me moss whispered back hell they dont spartacus said wes at the payoff now in there boysgrab an git the negroes rushed into the tent that sheltered crates of rations from the elements soft thumps announced that several of those crates were going into the wheelbarrows the guerrillas emerged their grins the most visible thing about them then a shot rang out jesus god we got chicken thieves a confederate screamed one of the chicken thieves shot him an instant later scram spartacus saidsurely the most succinct order moss had ever heard it was also just right for the circumstances firing as they went the guerrillas withdrew from the depot men with rifles and submachine guns covered the wheelbarrows retreat when a bullet struck home with a wet slapping sound a hauler dropped nick cantarella grabbed the wheelbarrow handles and got it moving again they made it out of the supply dump and back into the woods moss greatest worry was that the confederates would pursue hard but they didnt shit they already did more than i figured they would cantarella said theyre rearechelon troops clerks and stevedores in uniform if they wanted to mix it up theyd be at the front i guess moss said im not complaining believe me cantarella gave him the ghost of a grin didnt think you were that was smart what you did there to keep the one asshole off our ass thanks praise from the other army officer always made moss feel good it made him feel like a real soldier not a pilot stuck in the middle of a ground war he didnt understandwhich he was once the guerrillas got clear of the depot spartacus abandoned the wheelbarrows his men grumbled but he held firm gotta do it he said otherwise them wheels show the butternut bastards every place we been trails a lot harder to get rid of than footprints moss and cantarella took their turns playing pack mule along with everybody else white skin gave them no special privileges here if theyd tried to claim any they wouldnt have lasted long moss wondered whether confederates caught in like circumstances would have been smart enough to figure that out after some of the things hed seen in georgia he wouldnt have bet on it his back grumbled at luggingtoting they said down herea heavy crate he was the oldest man in the guerrilla band spartacus whod been a confederate noncom in the great war was within a couple of years of him but spartacus was the co nobody expected him to fetch and carry after what seemed like forever the negroes and the us soldiers theyd taken in got back to the swampy hideout from which theyd started and thento the victors went the spoils lets eat spartacus said and they did cs military rations were nothing to write home about in truces to pick up wounded men confederate soldiers traded tobacco and coffee to their us counterparts for canned goods made in the usa and us rations as moss knew too well wouldnt put the waldorf out of business any time soon but greasy hash and salty stew filled the belly moss had rubbed up against his backbone too often lately he was amazed at how many tins of meat he could bolt down before he even started getting full man i feel like i swallowed a medicine ball nick cantarella said after a while yeah me too moss said i like it he lit a cigarette the way he might have after a fine meal in a fancy restaurant hed had plenty to eat and nobody was shooting at him right this minute how could life get any better c incinnatus driver wanted to strut through the streets of ellijay georgia strutting wasnt in the cards when you walked with a cane and a limp but he felt like it anyway how could a black man from the usa not want to strut in a little town his country had taken away from the confederacy here i am he felt like shouting what are you ofay bastards gonna do about it and the whites of ellijay couldnt do one damn thing not unless they wanted the us army to land on them with both feet the hamlet seemed pleasant enough with a grassy town square centered on a rock fountain groves of apple and peach trees grew nearby cincinnatus had heard the trout and bass fishing in the nearby stream was firstrate ellijay probably made a nice place to livefor whites whenever the locals saw cincinnatus though the way they acted gave him the chills they stared at him as if he were a rare animal in a zooa passenger pigeon come back to life say they hadnt thought any negroes were left in these parts and didnt bother hiding their surprise whatre you doin here a grayhaired man in bib overalls asked around an enormous chaw drivin a truck for the united states of america cincinnatus answered proudly helping the army blow all this confederate white trash to hell and gone he thought the georgian would swallow the cud of tobacco you cant talk that way you ought to be strung up you know that along with his cane cincinnatus carried a submachine gun some confederate soldier would never need again he gestured with it you try uncle an its the last dumb thing you ever do uncle uncle that pissed the white man off as much as cincinnatus hoped it would it was what confederate whites called negroes too old to get called boy throwing it in the locals face felt wonderful you cant speak to me that way ill talk to your officer by god and hell teach you respect cincinnatus laughed in his face youre the enemy uncle and we done beat you we dont need to waste respect on the likes of you muttering under his breath the local stomped off cincinnatus hoped he did complain to an army officer that would serve him rightwouldnt it just cincinnatus tried to imagine what the officer would tell him he couldnt not in detail but it would boil down to tough shit buddy now fuck off and leave me alone he was sure of that technically cincinnatus wasnt even in the army the us navy accepted negroes but the army didntthough hed heard talk that that might change if it did it would matter to his son but not to him he was both overage and not in any kind of shape to pass a physical but he could still drive a truck a lot of drivers were overage civilians many of them with not quite disabling wounds from the great war they freed up younger fitter men to go to the front and fight and when confederate bushwhackers hit them they showed they still knew what to do with weapons in their hands too when cincinnatus first volunteered to drive after getting back to us territory hed carried a he patted the ugly functional submachine gun with almost the affection he might have shown his wife elizabeth had got him out of some tough spots and so had the captured confederate piece and it didnt talk back us s north of ellijay thundered to life somebodya spotter in a light airplane maybemust have seen confederates up to something with luck the guns would disrupt whatever it was before long confederate artillery would probably open up too and maim or kill a few us soldiers always plenty of fresh meat on both sides in war us forces might push farther east from ellijay but they were unlikely to go farther north soon they held this part of georgia mostly to keep the enemy from bringing reinforcements down towards atlanta they didnt want any more of itthey were shield not sword the drivers guarded their own trucks several men who werent on sentry duty sat around a liberated card table playing poker soldiers probably would have sat on the ground but it wasnt comfortable for geezers with old wounds and assorted other aches and pains green us bills and brown cs banknotes went into the pot they had goodnatured argumentsand some not so goodnaturedabout what confederate money was worth right now in the drivers highly unofficial rate of exchange one green dollar bought about in brown paper call hal williamson said a moment later cincinnatus friend swore as his three sevens lost to a ninehigh straight come to papa the other driver raked in the pot williamson got to his feet well thats about as much money as i can afford to lose till uncle sam gives me some more he said one of the kibitzers sat down in the folding chair hed vacated and pulled out a fat bankroll of green and brown im not here to lose money he announced im gonna win me some more emils here we can start now another poker player said the guy with the roll flipped him off the other man turned to cincinnatus how about you buddy got any jack thats burning a hole in your pocket nope cincinnatus said dont play often enough to get good at it dont like playin enough to get good at it so why should i throw my money down the toilet on account of i got grandkids who need shoes suggested the man sitting at the card table we need suckers in this here gamebesides emil i mean youll see whos a sucker emil said youll be sorry when you do too if youre no good at somethin why do it cincinnatus said well theres always fucking the other driver replied which got a laugh maybe you aint no good at that cincinnatus said which got a bigger one me though i know what im doin there thats telling him williamson said cincinnatus answering grin was crooked even his buddies seemed surprised when he held his own in banter or didnt turn cowardly when he got shot at or generally acted like a man instead of the way they thought a nigger would act it might have been funny if it werent so sad these were us citizens men from a country where negroes mostly had the same legal rights as anybody else and they thoughtor at least felt down deep somewherehe ought to be a stupid buffoon what about white people in the confederate states his mouth tightened the grin disappearing altogether he knew the answer to that knew it much too well they thought negroes were so far below ordinary human beings that they got rid of them without a qualm and what would the local in overalls say about that hed probably say the confederacys negroes had it coming fuck him too cincinnatus muttered who dolf there williamson nodded toward the poker player whod gone back and forth with cincinnatus whatd he do to you no not dolf this peckerhead redneck i was talkin with in town cincinnatus answered not even noticing he was tarring the confederate with the same kind of brush whites in the csa used against blacks he reckoned i was uppity if i was really uppity i wouldve plugged the son of a bitch probably no great loss williamson said were gonna have to kill a lot of these confederate assholes to scare the rest into leaving us alone again confederate whites might have talked about negroes the same way the next morning soldiers loaded crates of mm shells into the back of cincinnatus truck the convoy of which he was a part rattled north to replenish the guns that had been firing at the confederates the day before the artillery position was only a few miles away even so a halftrack and three armored cars came along with the trucks no one inside ellijay seemed eager to take on the assembled might of the us army but things were different out in the countryside it seethed with rebellion two bushwhackers fired from the undergrowth that grew too close to the side of the road before the convoy got halfway to where it was going one bullet shattered a trucks windshield another flattened a tire the armored cars sprayed the bushes with machinegun fire cincinnatus hadnt seen any muzzle flashes he would have bet the soldiers in the armored cars hadnt either one of those cars stayed behind to help the truck driver with the flat change his tireand to shield him from more bullets while he worked cincinnatus hoped the driver would be all right he had to keep going himself he wished a barrel with a flail were preceding the convoy that way it would probably blow up any land mines before they blew up people as things were as things were they didnt run intoor overany cincinnatus figured the convoy was lucky he also figured it had no guarantee of being lucky again on the way back who could guess what holdouts or stubborn civilians were doing while nobody in a greengray uniform could see them gun bunnies unloaded the crates well give em hell one of them promised cincinnatus nodded but the artillerymen couldnt do anything about the enemies likeliest to hurt him he wished he could stay by the gun pits bushwhackers didnt come around here but then as he was driving back towards ellijay he heard thunder behind him a glance in the rearview mirror told him the artillerymen were catching it wherever you went whatever you did the war would reach out and grab you and bite you snipers fired a few shots at the trucks on the way back to the depot when they got there one of the drivers said you guys are gonna have to help me out of the cab they got me in the knee jesus gordie how come you aint screamin your head off another driver asked how the helld you make it back gordie started laughing to beat the band on account of i lost that leg in he answered fuckers ruined the joint in my artificial one but thats about it howd you work the clutch without your knee joint cincinnatus asked grabbed the leg with my hand and mashed down on the sucker gordie said wasnt pretty dont figure i did my gear train any good but who gives a damn i made it back course the legs just a piece of junk without that joint better find me a wheelchair or some crutchesi aint goin anywhere without em cincinnatus had a lot of parts that didnt work as well as they should have he wasnt outandout missing any though and he never would have imagined that losing a leg could prove lucky for anybody if theyd already got you there once they couldnt do it again the supply dump stocked both wheelchairs and crutches that didnt surprise cincinnatus although it saddened him maimed men were a byproduct of war the powers that be understood as much gordies leg went out for repairs technicians who dealt with such things were also necessary when it came back the amputee was full of praise feels like i just got new spark plugs on my ford he said joints smoother and easier to work than it ever was before i think quieter too he still walked with a rolling gait like a drunken sailors but so did anybody whod lost a leg above the knee the roll locked the joint till the next step cincinnatus also thought the artificial leg was quieter now than it had been except for harassing fire as he drove his routes everything seemed pretty quiet hed drifted into a backwater of the war part of him wanted to be doing more the restthe larger portionthought that part was out of its tree iii g eorge enos jr liked being back on the east coast when the josephus daniels came in to the boston navy yard for refit or resupplyor even to deliver a packagehe had a chance for liberty a chance to see his wife and kids unlike a lot of sailors he preferred getting it at home to laying down money in some sleazy whorehouse and lying down with a girl who was probably more interested in the current crossword puzzle than in him that didnt stop him from lying down with a whore every once in a while it did leave him feeling guilty whenever he did that in turn meant he drank more on liberty than he would have otherwise he couldnt get drunk enough to stop feeling guilty which didnt keep him from trying when he came into boston he didnt have to worry about it he could go to bed with connie with a clear conscience and being away so much he felt like a newlywed whenever he did most of his married buddies werent lucky enough to have caught a warm willing pretty redhead either i wish you didnt have to leave she said clinging to him with arms and legs the night before he was due back aboard his ship when she kissed him he tasted tears on her lipstick wish i didnt have to go too he answered but itd be the shore patrol and then the brig if i tried to duck out theyd bust me down to seaman third too you fight the navy youre fighting out of your weight i know she said but she didnt go on or need to but covered bombs and torpedoes and mines and everything else that could mean this was the last liberty george ever got she clung to him tighter than ever he found himself rising to the occasion once more which told how long it had been since his last liberty in his thirties he didnt do that as automatically as he had once upon a time hey babe he said hey ohh connie said when he went into hermore a sigh than a word he wasnt sure he could come again so soon after the last time but he did a moment after she gasped and quivered beneath him but then she started crying all over again i dont want you to go i dont want to either but ive got to he stroked her hair and kissed her in the hollow of her shoulder all of which made things worse instead of better finally after she cried herself out she reached for a tissue and blew her nose good thing the lights are out she said i must look like hell you always look good to me he said and that started her crying again he wasnt very far from blubbering himself but he didnt he did fall asleep a few minutes later connie couldnt tease him about that because shed already started to breathe deeply and slowly herself she fed him an enormous plate of bacon and eggs the next morning the way the boys stared at it said how unusual it was they ate oatmeal as they got ready for school connie ate oatmeal too and drank coffee that smelled like burnt roots rationing that bad george asked well its not goodthats for sure his wife answered better for us than for a lot of folks i know people at t wharf so i can get fish for us were tired of it but its better than going without sure george remembered his mother talking about doing the same thing during the last war all over the country no doubt people were doing what they could to get along what george could do was shoulder his duffel bag kiss connie and the kids goodbye and head for the closest subway station when he came up again he was on the other side of the charles half a block from the boston navy yard he and the duffel got searched before the guards let him in all rightyoure not a people bomb one of the men said has that happened here george asked not here at the yard no but it sure as hell did in new york city twice the guard answered jesus george said nobodys safe anywhere any more id rather put to sea at least out there i know whos on my side and who isnt with a nod the guard waved him on armorers were bringing crates of ammunition aboard the josephus daniels they were eloquently obscene creatively profane george had heard that before among men with especially dangerous trades it gave them a safety valve they couldnt find any other way he paused not just to give them room but also to admire their invectives hed thought hed heard everything but they showed him he was wrong he was almost sorry when they finished and walked down the pier permission to come aboard he called as he set foot on the destroyer escorts gangplank granted answered thad walters who had officerondeck duty after the formal response he unbent enough to ask liberty good yes sir george said kids are growing like weeds connie pisses and moans about the rationing but shes sure keeping them fed he turned to salute the flag at the stern well thats good the grin on the oods face said he knew george and connie didnt spend all their time talking about rations he was younger than george himself chances were he didnt spend all his time thinking about yranging gear either he went on well stow your gear below and get used to the ship again youd betterwe put to sea tomorrow morning early andhe looked at the cloudy skynot too bright aye aye sir after his own apartment the accommodations belowdecks were a rude reminder that he was back in the navys clutches everything was cramped and smelly instead of a bed to share with his wife he had a hammock in a compartment full of snoring farting sailors if he tried to roll over hed fall out some kid was bragging about how many times hed done it in a whorehouse only a couple of guys were even half listening to him and they mainly seemed interested in telling him what a liar he was george thought the same thing anybody who boasted about what a great lover he was had to be lying even if he didnt always know it chow was another disappointment some kind of hash and lumpy mashed potatoes connie would have been ashamed to put slop like that on the table no matter how bad rationing got the coffee was better than hers though the navy and the army got most of the real bean that came into the usa civilians had to make do with ersatz maybe because hed gone without real coffee for a couple of days and it hit him harder when he drank it again maybe because his own mattress had spoiled him he had a hell of a time going to sleep that night he knew hed stagger around like a zombie in the morning but he lay there in the hammock staring up at the steel ceiling not nearly far enough above his head a pilot had brought the josephus daniels in through the minefields shielding boston harbor from enemy submersibles another one took her out again a small patrol boat followed the destroyer escort to pick up the pilot and bring him back george stayed at his mm mounts till well after the pilot was gone the powers that be had installed the guns to shoot at airplanes but they could also do dreadful things to subs forced to the surface we have ourselves a new assignment sam carstens voice blared from the loudspeakers george still thought it was bizarre that hed met the man now his skipper when he was a kid in boston carsten went on were heading for bermuda and then for the central atlantic were going to try to find convoys bringing food up from argentina and brazil to england and france and when we do well sink em or capture em excitement tingled through george this was the work his father had done in the last war it was what finally made britain decide shed had enough and it was the work that cost his father his life some of you poor devils are polliwogs the skipper boomed when we get to the equator king neptune and the shellbacks aboard will take care of that george laughed hed been initiated into the shellbacks when he crossed the equator for the first time he could hardly wait to give the new fish a taste of what hed got and he had another reason for wanting to get down by the equator the north atlantic was kicking up its heels he had a strong stomach and hed known worse seas than this in a fishing boat that made the josephus daniels seem as sedate as a fleet carrier that meant he kept down what he ate it didnt mean he enjoyed himself and using the heads was rugged because a lot of guys were desperate and werent neat some of them didnt make it to the heads the skipper had cleaning parties out all the time they almost kept up with the sour stink almost here as in so many places was a word nobody really wanted to hear the ship approached bermuda from the northeast that made for more time at sea but lessened the chance of meeting cs bombers or seaplanes on the way in no liberty here carsten announced as they tied up in the harbor sorry guys we dont have time on the way back to the usa ill give you the best blowout i can and thats a promise by the way the oldtimers on the destroyer escort nodded the skipper kept promises like that george wasnt surprised keeping them seemed in character for carsten being a mustang he knew what ratings liked better than most officers with annapolis rings did and one of the things they liked was officers who delivered on their promises because of the threat from the confederate mainland the crew spent the night at battle stations four hours on four off a handful of bombers did come over bermuda had yranging gear far more powerful than the set the josephus daniels carried sirens started shrieking before the destroyer escort picked up the bombers and even after the ship did the gunners were firing by earsight hoping to get lucky or to nail a bomber caught by the blazing searchlights ashore yellow and red tracers crisscrossed the night sky us night fighters were up over bermuda too george wondered if they had their own yranging sets if they did it didnt seem to do them much good he heard the harsh crump of bombsnone very closebut saw no bombers going down even after the allclear sounded ships and landbased guns kept throwing shells around george was glad he had a helmet on shrapnel clattered down from the sky like sharpedged hail it could kill the people whod fired it even if it didnt do a damn thing to its intended targets boy i enjoyed that he said when the other gun crew relieved him and his comrades you be able to sleep his opposite number asked fuck yes i dont care if the confederates come back and the noise starts up all over again ill sleep and some time in the wee small hours the confederates did come back they couldnt take bermuda away from the usa but they could make sure the united states didnt enjoy holding it george opened his eyes when the shooting started again then closed them and began to snore louder than ever the josephus daniels sailed the next morning her tanks topped off and ammunition replenished the atlantic was a changed beast as the destroyer escort steamed south the ocean went from tiger to kitten the sun shone warm and bright the air turned sweet and mild george was reminded of the weather in the sandwich islands it didnt get any better than that british submersibles french submersibles confederate submersibles misguided us submersibles confederate seaplanes maybe even bombers and torpedocarriers from a prowling british carrier this part of the atlantic was like the sandwich islands in more ways than the weather it was also full of danger standing by the breech of the twin mm george hoped he wouldnt follow in his fathers last footsteps as hed already followed in so many d r leonard odoull watched sergeant vince donofrio chatting up a wellfed blond georgia farm girl with a mixture of amusement and exasperation the senior medic seemed to try his luck with everything female from fourteen to fifty this oneher name was billie jeanfell toward the lower end of the range but not so low that she didnt have everything a woman needed she also had an inchlong cut on her left index finger which was what brought her to the us aid station in the first place donofrio had given her a shot of novocaine and put a couple of stitches in the cut in odoulls professional opinion it needed nothing but a bandage but donofrio had motivation beyond the purely professional i never reckoned yankees could be so kind and helpful billie jean said which showed the sergeant had made some progress anyhow im a medic we help everybody on both sides donofrio turned to odoull for support aint that right doc thats our job odoull could hardly deny itit was true he said it himself somewhere between once a day and once a week here though he wished he werent agreeing with the horny sergeant hed never sewn up a pretty girls wound in the hope of getting into her pants then he shook his head and started to laugh when he sutured a cut on lucien galtiers leg up in quebec that put him in the good graces of the man who became his fatherinlaw it didnt hurt him with nicole either still he wasnt inclined to look at vince donofrio and billie jean whoozis and intone bless you my children as if vince cared can i walk you home sweetie he asked billie jean frowned odoull gave her points for that i dont know she said some of the guys here they dont like it if they see a girl walkin with a yankee at least she didnt say damnyankee like i said im a medic donofrio said i dont give trouble and i dont want trouble he had a on his hip just in case so did odoull he also had the gift of gab even though his boss was the irishman he talked billie jean into letting him tag along and he talked odoull into letting him go which was harder you be back in an hour you hear me odoull growled and i dont mean an hour and one minute either i dont see you here in an hours time i send a search party out after you and you wont like it when they find you i promise doc the senior medic crossed his heart billie jean laughed ten minutes later corpsmen brought a soldier with a hand wound into the aid station hed passed out or he would have come in under his own power one look at the injury told odoull the hand would have to go he hated to do it but he didnt see any way to save the mangled remnants he wished vince were there to pass gas but he could act as his own anesthetist what happened to the guy eddie he asked as he put the ether cone over the wounded mans mouth and nose do you know this is about as ugly a hand wound as ive ever seen i thought the same thing doc the corpsman answered he was by a boulder when we found him and the boulder had blood all over it im guessing but id say a big old chunk of shell casing mashed his hand against the rock odoull nodded sounds reasonable but hell have to make do with a hook from here on out i hope he wasnt lefthanded thats all didnt even think of that eddie looked and sounded surprised the amputation went as well as an operation like that could the cutting was over in a hurry patching things up as usual took longer at last odoull said well thats about all i can do poor bastard wont like it when he wakes up any other doc wouldve done the same thingonly not as well chances are eddie said theyd worked together a long time thanks odoull said wearily id like a drink but i think ill settle for a cigarette he stepped outside the aid tent to light up hed smoked the raleigh almost down to the butt when he happened to look at his watch an hour and five minutes had passed since vince donofrio decided to walk billie jean home and he wasnt back odoull swore in disgust he didnt care if vince had got lucky the medic wouldnt think he was by the time odoull got through with him finding soldiers for a search party was the easiest thing in the world he waved to the first squad he saw coming up the road and told them what he needed the army had made him a major so he could give enlisted men orders right said the corporal in charge of the squad so what do we do if we catch him laying this broad throw cold water on him pull him off and haul his sorry ass back here odoull replied angrily which made the soldiers grin they went off with a spring in their step and a gleam in their eye when they werent back in half an hour or soand when donofrio shamefaced or not didnt show up on his ownodoull started to worry he almost welcomed a man with a leg wound patching it up let him think about other things besides the medic and why he might be missing why the devil had he let donofrio go but he knew the answer to that because vince would have sulked and fumed for days if he hadnt and life was too short but if life turned out to be literally too short by the time another hour went by odoull began to dread what would happen when the search party came back then they did one look at the corporals face told him he hadnt wasted his time worrying what happened he asked both dead the noncom said grimly beaten stomped kickedyou name it they got it the guy and the gal both we found em in a field not far from the side of the road the medics holster was empty so his pistols gone some goddamn confederates got it now jesus odoull felt sick hed never been responsible for a mans death like this before plenty of wounded soldiers had died while he was working on them but he was doing his goddamnedest to save them here one wordnowould have saved vince donofrio it would have but he hadnt said it he forced out the next question what now sir ive already talked to a line officer the squad leader said we beat the bushes for the motherfuckers who did it we take hostages we put out the call for the guilty bastards to give themselves up then we blow the fuckin hostages heads off he sounded as if he looked forward to serving in the firing squad jesus odoull said again how many people are going to die because vince thought billie jean was cute she wasnt cute when we found her sir the corporal said theywell shit you dont want to hear about that but she wasnt neither was he odoull crossed himself i shouldnt have let him go but he liked her looks and i didnt think anything would happen this time so you never think anythingll happen this time the corporal said only sometimes it does yeah sometimes it does odoull covered his face with his hands heres one ill carry on my conscience the rest of my life yes this was much worse than losing a patient on the table well get em the corporal said or if we dont well get enough of the bastards who might have done it to make the rest of the assholes around here think twice before they try anything like that again fat lot of good any of that will do vince odoull said sir im sorry as hell about that its part of the war around these parts the corporal said sooner or later i expect well put the fear of god into the confederates that wouldnt do vince donofrio any good either odoull didnt say sowhat was the use the noncom saluted and led his squad away eddie came up to odoull not your fault doc he said you just did what anybody else wouldve done i guess so odoull said but if it went wrong when somebody else did it itd be his fault right so how come its not mine you couldnt know hed run into bushwhackers the corpsman said no but i could knowhell i did knowhe might and i let him go anyway shit odoull wanted to get into the medicinal brandy but he didnt think he deserved it he wished a wounded man would come in so hed be too busy to brood about what had happenedhe could drown his sorrows in work as well as alcohol but the poor slob whod have to stop something so he could get busy didnt deserve that after a while deserving or not a soldier with a smashed shoulder came in acting as his own anesthetist again odoull did what he could to clean out the wound and fix it up eddie assisted long on willingness but not on skill have to get a new senior medic odoull thought hed worked with granny mcdougald for a couple of years with vince donofrio for only about three months now somebody else would have to figure out his quirks and foibles the local commandant wasted no time soldiers seized hostages that afternoon they gave the men whod ambushed vince and billie jean fortyeight hours to surrender if notwell if not it was a tough war all the way around has anybody ever given himself up odoull asked major himmelfarb whod sent out the ultimatum it does happen once in a blue moon the line officer answered some of these bastards are proud of what theyve done theyre willinghell theyre eagerto die for their country he shrugged we oblige em no one came forward to admit to killing vince donofrio and the girl whose finger hed sewn up major himmelfarb asked odoull if he wanted to watch the hostages die he shuddered and shook his head no thanks i see enough bullet wounds every day it wont bring vince back either thats a fact major himmelfarb looked as if he wanted to call odoull soft but didnt think he could instead he went on maybe it will keep some other dumb horny us soldier from getting his dick cut off we can hope so anyway right odoull said tightly wishing the other officer hadnt told him that sometimes you found out more than you wanted to know he hoped the medic was dead by then us custom was to assemble the people from the nearest townhere it was loganville georgiato witness hostage executions and with luck to learn from them nobody in the csa seemed to have learned much from them yet odoull listened to one flat sharp volley of rifle fire after another in the middle distance twentyfive in all before they got to the last one he did dip into the brandy it didnt do a damn bit of good he kept wondering if billie jeans father or brothers or maybe even husband had she worn a wedding ringhe didnt remember and vince wouldnt have cared would show up at the aid station then he wondered if those people were part of the crowd that had got the girl and the medic would they have lulled them into a false sense of security before springing the trap he never found out eddie stayed in the aid tent as his first assistant for three days then the replacement depot coughed up a new senior medic a sergeant named of all things goodson lord he was tall and blond and handsomehe really might have been gods gift to women unlike poor donofrio who only thought he was odoull greeted him with a fishy stare how hard do you chase skirt he demanded not very much sir lord answered something in his voice made odoull give him a different kind of fishy look did he chase men instead well if he did hed damn well know he had to be careful about that queers didnt have an easy time of it anywhere make sure you dont not around here was all odoull thought he could say the guy youre replacing did and they murdered him for it sergeant lord nodded without another word of his own when a us soldier came in with a bullet in the hip lord proved plenty capable he knew much more than eddie and probably more than poor vince had the aid station would run just fine that was odoulls biggest concern everything else took second place and a distant second to boot a rmstrong grimes and his platoon leader crouchedsprawled reallyin a shell hole northeast of covington georgia armstrong was wet and cold a hard nasty rain had started in the middle of the night and showed no signs of letting up the confederates had a machine gun in a barn half a mile ahead every so often it would fire a burst and make the us soldiers keep their heads down wish we had a couple of barrels in the neighborhood armstrong said theyd quiet that fucker down in a hurry even a mortar team would do the trick well its not that youre wrong sergeant lieutenant bassler replied but what weve got isus were going to have to take that gun out too we leave it there it stalls a battalions worth of men yes sir armstrong said resignedly it wasnt that bassler was wrong either but approaching a machine gun wasnt one of the more enjoyable jobs infantry got for once the rain helps bassler said bastards in there wont be able to see us coming so well yes sir armstrong said again he knew what that meant theyd be able to get closer to the gun before it knocked them down you take your squad around toward the back of the barn bassler said ill lead another group toward the front we ought to be able to work our way in pretty close and then well play it by ear yes sir armstrong said one more time he didnt have anything else to say not here bassler wasnt just coming along hed given himself the more dangerous half of the mission you wanted to follow an officer who did things like that all right then ill give you ten minutes to gather your men well move out atbassler checked his watchat and ill see you by the barn yes sir see you there armstrong scrambled out of the hole and wiggled off toward the men he led the machine gun opened up on him but halfheartedly as if the crew wasnt sure it was really shooting at anything he dove into another hole then came out and kept going password that was a us accent remembrance armstrong said and then its me squidface yeah i guess it is sarge the pfc answered come on whats up we goin after that fuckin gun is the pope catholic armstrong said our guys go to the right the lieutenant goes to the left and when we get close whoever sees the chance knocks it out will you take point squidface was little and skinny and nervoushe made a good point man and a good point man made everybody else likely to live longer but even the best point man was more likely to get shot than his buddies he was there to sniff out trouble sometimes by running into it yeah ill do it squidface didnt sound enthusiastic but he didnt say no who you gonna put in behind me ill go myself armstrong said zeb the hat after me then the rest of the guys or do you have some other setup you like better no that oughta work squidface said if anything works i mean if the guys at the gun decide to go after us yeah were screwed in that case armstrong agreed you got plenty of grenades need em for a job like this i got em squidface said dont worry about that good we move at armstrong gathered up the rest of his squad nobody was thrilled about going after the machine gun but nobody hung back either at on the dot they trotted toward the barn the rain had got heavier armstrong liked that not only would it veil them from the gunners the drum and drip would mask the noise they made splashing through puddles somewhere off to the left lieutenant basslers men were moving too maybe itll be easy armstrong thought hopefully maybe the guys at the gun wont know were around till we get right on top of them maybe the gun started hammering despite the rain armstrong had no trouble seeing the muzzle flashes they all seemed to be aimed right at him he yipped and hit the dirthit the mud rather nobody behind him screamed so he dared hope the burst missed the men he led too he peered ahead he didnt see squidface on his feet but nobody with his head on straight would have stayed upright when the machine gun cut loose he hoped the platoon commander and his guys were taking advantage of all this they could be getting close then the hateful gun started up again this time it was aimed away from armstrong and his squad up he shouted get cracking he splashed forward and there was squidface up and running too armstrong breathed a silent sigh of relief hed feared he would lope past the point mans corpse theyd got within a couple of hundred yards when the machine gun cut off once more down squidface yelled and suited action to word armstrong threw himself flat too three seconds later a bullet snarled through the place where hed been standing that made the hair on the back of his neck stand up somebody behind him yowled like a cat with its tail in a rocking chairwhitey he thought his mouth shaped the word fuck three or four guys from lieutenant basslers group opened up on the machinegun crewthey could see the confederates better than armstrong and his squad could then another machine gun farther back opened up on them this time armstrong said fuck out loud he might have knownand bassler might have known toothat the confederates would have one gun covering another once the men in greengray knocked out this one they would have to stalk the next and if they didnt take more casualties doing it god would have doled out a miracle and he was as niggardly with them as a quartermaster sergeant was with new boots as soon as the gun in the barn swung back to lieutenant basslers men armstrong and his squad rushed it they hadnt given themselves away by firing so the gun farther back didnt know they were aroundand the men they were attacking didnt realize how much trouble they were in till too late squidface threw the first grenade armstrongs first flew at the same time as the pfcs second the confederate machine gunners howled the gun got off a short burst this time two bullets came closer to armstrong than they had any business doing another grenade knocked the machine gun sideways the soldiers in butternut who could still fight grabbed for their personal weapons none of them fired a shot armstrongs men made sure of that turn the gun around armstrong said well let the assholes at the next position farther back know their turns coming up none of his men was a regular machine gunner but if you could use a rifle you could use a machine gun after a fashion theyd all practiced with them in basic training and the cs weapon was about as simple to use as a machine gun could be squidface aimed the gun while zeb the hat gathered fresh belts of ammunition you know squidface said as he squeezed off a burst this goddamn thing has a bipod too we could take it off the tripod mount and bring it along with us are you volunteering armstrong asked yeah ill do it squidface said why the hell not we sure get a lot of extra firepower and we can probably liberate enough ammo to keep it fed its yours then armstrong was all for extra firepower if squidface wanted to carry the machine gun instead of a lighter rifle that was fine with him the confederates back closer to covington realized what machinegun fire coming their way was bound to mean they returned it armstrong flattened out like a nightcrawler under a barrel the confederates shot a little high so nobody got hit way to go lieutenant basslers voice came out of the rain shall we stalk these next assholes too a gungho lieutenant was good a lieutenant who got too gungho wasnt because hed get people killed sir i have one man wounded maybe two armstrong answered lets round up a mortar team and see if we can drop shit on the bastards instead when bassler didnt say yes right away armstrong got a sinking feeling the platoon commander was going to tell him no that machinegun crew up ahead would be waiting for the us soldiers to come at themnot a chance in hell for surprise armstrong didnt want an oakleaf cluster for his purple heart but before lieutenant bassler could issue what might literally have been a fatal order a couple of confederates fired short bursts from their automatic rifles in the direction of the gun armstrongs squad had just captured nobody got hurt but the us soldiers hit the dirt again armstrong jammed an index finger up against the bottom of his nose to kill a sneeze wouldnt get a purple heart for pneumonia he thought but id sure as hell end up in the hospital with it the extra gunfire convinced bassler hed had a bad idea theyve got a regular line up there he said that guns not just an outpost the way this one was no point slamming our faces into ita mortar teams probably a better plan good thinking sergeant uhthank you sir armstrong answered when was the last time an officer told him something like that had an officer ever told him anything like that damned if he could remember squidface winked at him teachers pet yeah well up yours charlie armstrong replied you want to charge a machinegun nest when featherstons fuckers are waiting for you go ahead dont let me stop you no thanks squidface said already got my asshole puckered once today thats plenty hell thats once too many twice too many zeb the hat said why aint we twenty miles back of the line eatin offa tablecloths an screwin nurses cause were lucky armstrong said which drew a chorus of derisive howls and cause no nurse ever bornd be desperate enough to screw you zeb huh shows what you know sarge zeb the hat launched into a story that was highly obscene and even more highly unlikely it was entertaining though almost entertaining enough to make armstrong forget he lay sprawled in cold mud with an enemy machine gun not nearly far enough away a few minutes later mortar bombs started bursting somewhere near that cs gun through the driving rain armstrong couldnt tell how close they were coming hey you guys at the gun fire off a burst lieutenant bassler said lets see if they answer ill do it if you want sir squidface said but if i was a confederate id sandbag and see if i could lure us in fuck me bassler said yeah youre right maybe wed better sit tight for a while wait till reinforcements come up armstrong liked that order just fine he drew back into the barn and lit a cigarette it wasnt so bad in here it was drythough the roof drippedand nobody was shooting at him right this minute what more could you want a horny nurse he thought and then yeah wish for the moon while youre at it j orge rodriguez had a stripe on his sleeve making pfc meant he got another six dollars each and every month it meant he got to tell buck privates what to do and it meant the confederate army didnt care that he was a greaser from sonora hed convinced the people above him that he made a pretty decent soldier sergeant blackledge treated him no different on account of his promotion blackledge treated everybody under him like dirt all the time and not just people under himthe sergeant had threatened to shoot general patton if he didnt quit slapping a soldier with combat fatigue as far as jorge was concerned that took more guts than bravery against the damnyankees hey sarge gabriel medwick called as jorge sewed on his stripe how come i dont get promoted too he sounded more than half jokinghe and jorge were buddies he was tall and blond and handsome the freedom party ideal jorge was none of the above they got on well anyhow next time we need a guy i reckon you will blackledge answered in the meantime dont get your balls in an uproar you cant buy moren a couple of extra fucks on a pfcs pay so if you get too horny to stand it in the meantime just pull it out of your pants and beat it that made jorge snicker but it shut gabe up like a gagand turned him sunsetred too he was as innocent as if hed been born into the previous century jorge wondered if hed heard about the facts of life before the army grabbed him girls would have fallen all over him too hardly any of the girls in georgia wanted to look at jorge much less do anything else he wasnt a nigger but he wasnt exactly white either georgia girls might not think he was good enough to lay them but they thought he was plenty good enough to keep the damnyankees away he crouched in a muddy foxhole on floyd street in front of what had been the usher house he gathered it had been a local landmark before the war came this way but us artillery and air strikes had accomplished its fall half a dozen columns had stretched across its front now theyand the house timberswere knocked every which way like gods game of pickupsticks orders were to defend covington to the last man sergeant blackledge had some lewd remarks about orders like that jorge understood why too the veteran noncom had no problems about killing yankees hed done a lot of it he was much less happy about the prospect of getting killed himself who wasnt but jorge could also see why the powers that be issued those orders us forces were curling down from the northeast every town they took cut off one more route into and out of atlanta every advance they made brought more roads and railroad lines into artillery range if they kept coming atlanta would fallor else they would just strangle it and let it wither on the vine the confederacy had to stop them somewhere why not covington rising screams in the air made jorge duck down low and fold himself up as small as he could he didnt need the shouts of incoming to know artillery was on the way most of it came down in back of the positions his squad was holding in a way that was a relief it meant there was less risk of a rounds butchering him right this minute but it left him worried about what was coming next were the damnyankees trying to cut the town off from reinforcements if they were did that mean theyd try to smash through soon barrels somebody shouted jorge could have done without such a prompt answer to his question if the us soldiers thought they could waltz into covington they had to change their minds in a hurry a rocket took out the lead us barrel and an antibarrel cannon set two more on fire confederate artillery pounded the poor damned infantrymen loping along with the barrels the rain kept jorge from seeing them but he knew theyd be there us attacks worked about the same as the ones his side used enemy fire eased taught em a lesson that time gabe medwick said sн jorge nodded now what kind of lesson they gonna try and teach us he had a sonoran accent but his english was good theyve gotta know they cant drive us outa here as easy as they want to his pal said sн jorge repeated and he nodded again but they dont always gotta drive us out to make us move huh medwick might be blond and brave and handsome but there were good and cogent reasons why nobody had ever accused him of being bright that was probably a big part of why jorge had a stripe and he didnt jorge didnt try to explain things to gabe life was too short if he was lucky he was wrong in which case the explanation would only be a waste of time anyhow he just said well we find out and let it go at that more us artillery came down on covington a lot of it landed up toward the front line yes the yankees were annoyed that the defenders didnt lie down and quit before long the shelling eased up again and a us officer approached under a flag of truce what the hell you want sergeant blackledge yelled you fought well the lieutenant answered your honor is satisfied throw down your weapons and surrender and youll be treated well if you keep fighting though you dont have a chance we cant answer for what will happen to you then blackledge had to wait for a confederate officer to answer that it wasnt his place after a couple of minutes somebody did were ordered to hold this position we dont reckon you can drive us out if you want to try come ahead the lieutenant in greengray saluted you asked for it now youll get it he turned around and went back to his own lines hunker down boys hunker down tight sergeant blackledge yelled we went and pissed the damnyankees off an theyre gonna try and make us pay for it jorge pulled his entrenching tool off his belt and went to work with it what he could do to improve his foxhole wasnt much though what us guns could do to wreck it was liable to be a lot more and the enemys cannon wasted little time before they started trying to knock covington flat again jorge swore in english and spanish when he heard gas shells gurgling in and people shouting out warnings gas wouldnt do as much in the rain as it would on a clear day but he still had to put on his mask raindrops on the glass in front of his eyes made him seem to peer through streaked and splattered windows could he shoot straight if he had to he had to that was all barrels that shout filled him with fear because even with an automatic rifle he couldnt do anything about a barrel he had to depend on others to take care of that part of the joband if they didnt he was dead even though he hadnt made any mistakes but they did that antibarrel cannon knocked out two more us machines in quick succession the rest pulled back instead of charging into covington you cant answer sergeant blackledge jeered you aint got the balls to answer you stinking yankee cocksuckers talking through the mask he sounded as if his voice came from the far side of the moon that made him seem more scornful not less no more barrels drew within range of the gun us infantry didnt swarm forward either machine gunners and riflemenand the artillerymade the confederates keep their heads down some of the machine guns were captured cs weapons jorge knew the difference when they fired his own sides guns spat far more rounds per minute than the ones the usa made like blackledge he thought the us lieutenant was trying to bluff the defenders of covington out of a position from which they couldnt be forced the truth turned out to be less simple with all those shells landing close by he didnt want to stick up his head and look around but before long he had tohe could hear something going on to the south because of what the rain was doing to the lenses on his gas mask he couldnt see very far but things werent going well outside of town though his ears told him more about that than his eyes could barrels were moving forward thereforward from the us point of view that is they had plenty of artillery and smallarms support too what kind of line did the csa have south of covington jorge didnt know up till now he hadnt worried about it he realized that maybe he should have heavy fire came from a little east of due south after a while it came from due south after another little while it came from west of due south you didnt have to be a professor with frizzy uncombed hair and thick glasses to figure out what that meant the damnyankees had tried to force a breakthrough there and it looked as if theyd done it the next interesting question was what they would do with it they didnt keep anybody waiting long for an answer shells and machinegun bullets came into covington from the south as well as from the east and north there was also firing from southwest of town which wasnt good if the defenders held their ground much longer theyd be hanging on to a surrounded town those stories didnt have happy endings other soldiers saw the same thing they must haveotherwise why would they start slipping out of covington to the west and why would sergeant blackledge watch them slip away without ordering them to stop or just as likely shooting them in the back we gonna get orders to pull out sarge gabriel medwick asked beats the shit out of me blackledge answered if we dont though well spend the rest of the war in a pow campif the yankees bother taking prisoners if they dont well be lucky if they waste the time to bury us jorge didnt worry much about what happened to his body once he was done using it but he wasntnowhere close and dying to keep a thirdrate town out of us hands for a few extra minutes struck him as a waste of his precious and irreplaceable life when you gonna go sarge he called pretty damn quick blackledge said this place aint worth throwin myself down the crapper for unless somebody orders me to stay im gone and if somebody did order him he might suddenly become hard of listening it wouldnt surprise jorge at all before long a worriedsounding lieutenant said wed better pull back if we dont theyre liable to cut us off would you believe it sergeant blackledge said boy if the officers can see it you know it must be obvious despite the noncoms sarcasm jorge felt better about pulling back with the lieutenants permission us forces didnt make it easy as soon as they realized the confederates were withdrawing from covington men in greengray pushed into the town from the northeast two mortar bombs burst closer to jorge than he cared to think about fragments hissed and snarled past him he felt a ghostly tug at his trouser leg and looked down to discover a new tear but he wasnt bleeding things got more dangerous not less when he left covington behind the yankees whod broken through to the south lashed the fields with gunfire jorge was glad to scramble into a truck and get out of there much faster than he could have hoofed it gabe medwick sat across from him we got to hold em somewheres or else we aint gonna keep atlanta he said he might not be bright but he had no trouble seeing that who would how can we hold they keep pounding on us like this jorge asked beats me his buddy shrugged but if we dont we wont just lose atlanta well lose the damn war you also didnt need to be bright to see that neither jorge nor any of the other wet weary soldiers in the truck tried to argue with him theyd got out of covington alive right now that seemed more than enough f irst sergeant chester martin looked at his companys new transport with a raised eyebrow command cars halftracks guerrillastyle pickup trucks with a machine gun mounted in the bedanything that could move pretty fast and shoot up whatever got in the way they were going to head east from monroe georgia till they ran into something tough enough to stop themif they did the great war hadnt been like this at all in those days both sides measured advances in yards not miles lieutenant boris lavochkin martins platoon commander didnt remember the great war or give a damn about it chester was supposed to ride herd on him as he had with other young lieutenants it wasnt easy with lavochkin who had a mind and a cold hard will of his own chester suspected lavochkin wouldnt stay a second lieutenant long he had higher rank written all over himif he didnt stop a confederate bullet but one of the things that marked him for higher rank was a propensity for going where enemy bullets were thickest chester would have minded less had he not needed to go along my platoonlisten up lavochkin said and it was his platoon which surprised chester martin more than a little were going to go out there and were going to smash up every goddamn thing we bump into were going to show these sorry clowns that their government and their troops arent worth the paper theyre printed on and were going to show them what war is like if they wanted one so bad lets see how much they want it when its in their own backyard a savage baying rose from the men lavochkin was an unusual leader he didnt make his soldiers love him he made them hate the other side instead and he left them no doubt that he felt the same wayor that hed make them sorry if they were soft or hung back nobodys going to mind if you bring back goodies either he finished lavochkins looters thats us theyll be howling from new orleans to richmond by the time we get through with em that got another fierce cheer from the men they liked the idea of making the csa pay for the war they liked the idea of lining their own pockets while they did it too chester caught captain rhodes eye they shared bemused grins captain rhodes was a pretty damn good company co but he didnt know what to make of the tiger now under his command either the soldiers piled into their motley assortment of transport martin would have liked to get into a command car with lieutenant lavochkin but lavochkin didnt want him that close at hand he climbed into a halftrack instead yes it was the lieutenants show all right nobody seemed to expect a us force to head east from monroe morrells troops had been using the town as a pivot point for the move to isolate atlanta they held off cs attacks from the north and that done wheeled around atlanta instead of trying to break in but with the main city in georgia still in confederate hands no one in butternut was ready for raiders to strike in any other direction every time the us soldiers spotted an auto or truck on the road they opened up with their machine guns whatcaliber slugs did to softskinned vehicles wasnt pretty what they did to softerskinned human beings was even uglier the shock from one of those thumbsized bullets could kill even if the wound wouldnt have otherwise and when lavochkins looters and the rest of captain rhodes company rolled into high shoals the first hamlet east of monroeit would have been funny if it werent so grim the locals greeted them with waves and smiles it didnt occur to them that soldiers from the other side could appear in their midst without warning lieutenant lavochkin showed them what a mistake theyd made he sprayed bullets around as if afraid hed have to pay for any he brought back to monroe women and children and old men ran screaming those who didnt fall glass exploded from the front windows of the blocklong business district and lavochkin howled like a coyote when he opened up everybody else followed his lead grenades flew a soldier with a flamethrower leaped out of a halftrack and shot a jet of blazing jellied gasoline at the closest frame house it went up right away high shoals had to be too small to have a militia of its own there were probably as many us soldiers as locals in the little town in moments though two or three people found old tredegars or squirrel guns and started shooting back chester spotted a muzzle flash there he yelled and pointed toward the window from which it came a machine gun and several rifles answered and no more bullets came from that direction the raiders hardly even slowed down leaving ruin and death and fire behind them they went on along the road toward good hope a town that was about to see its name turn into a lie good hope might have been a little larger than high shoals but the people there were no more ready for an irruption of damnyankees than their fellow georgians farther west had been in good hope all the us machine guns opened fire at once people fell shrieking and writhing and kicking they looked like civilians anywhere in the usa one of the women who caught a bullet was a nicelooking blonde waste of a natural resource chester thought and fired his rifle at a man with a big belly and a bald head with a white fringe of hair another round caught him at the same time as chesters he didnt seem to know which way to fall but fall he did when the shooting started some people came rushing out of houses and shops to see what was going on people always reacted like that it was the worst thing they could do but a good many did they paid the price for mistimed curiosity too lavochkin shot up the filling station that got a good blaze going in nothing flat he whooped as flames shot skyward from the pumps see how you like it you bastards he yelled hope your whole town burns in hell as in high shoals a few determined people in good hope tried to fight back bullets came from upstairs windows and from behind fences overwhelming us firepower soon silenced the locals rifles and pistols but one alert and determined man drove his auto sideways across the street to try to keep the greengray vehicles from going any deeper into georgia he paid for his courage with his life a fusillade of bullets not only killed him but flattened three of the tires on the motorcar and in the end he delayed the us column only a few minutes a halftrack rumbled forward and shoved the hulk out of the way good thing we didnt set the son of a bitch on fire chester said then we wouldve had to look for a way around screw it said the soldier sitting next to him we wouldve found one cmon sarge you think these sorry civilian assholes can stop us doesnt look like itthats for sure chester answered east of good hope the column bumped into a platoon of short swarthy soldiers in uniforms of a khaki yellower than the usual confederate butternut mexicans chester realized probably out chasing negro guerrillas like the locals the mexican troops took a few fatal seconds too long to realize the approaching soldiers werent on their side some of francisco josйs men waved and took a few steps toward the command cars and halftracks let em have it boys captain rhodes sang out everybody who could get off a shot without endangering us soldiers in front of him opened up the mexicans went down like wheat before the harvester a few tried to run a few tried to shoot back they got off only a handful of rounds before they were mowed down too a us corporal yowled and swore and clutched his shoulder chester thought he was the first us casualty of the day southeast of good hope lay apalachee rhodes ordered the us vehicles to stop about a mile outside of town lieutenant lavochkins broad features clouded over youre not going to let this place off easy are you sir he demanded thats not what were here for i know what were here for lieutenant keep your shirt on the company commander seemed to enjoy putting lavochkin in his place chester martin would have too but it wasnt always easy for a noncom rhodes went on mortar crewsout lets give them a few rounds from nowhere before we pay our respects that should make them good and glad to see us when we roll into town as the men with the light mortars set up and started lobbing bombs towards apalachee lieutenant lavochkin smiled a smile chester wouldnt have wanted to see aimed at him lavochkin pointed it toward the enemy where it belonged he gave rhodes the most respectful salute martin had ever seen from him apalachee might have been an ants nest that somebody had kicked when captain rhodes company came in people were running every which way wounded men and women screamed a few buildings had chunks bitten out of them a middleaged man in a business suit ran toward the lead command car the left arm of his jacket was pinned up he had no arm to fill it thank god youre here he yelled we got a call from good hope that there were yankees loose and then they went and mortared us how about that boris lavochkin took aim with the command cars machine gun uhoh the georgian said the last phrase that ever passed his lips he started to turn away which did no good at all lavochkins burst almost cut him in half people shrieked and fled bullets and grenades made sure they didnt get far wails filled the streets chester shot a man who was reaching into the waistband of his trousers did he have a pistol stashed there nobody except him would ever know now the bullet from the springfield blew off the top of his head this hardly seems fair said the private next to chester not like were fighting soldiers or anything theyre all the enemy chester answered working the bolt and chambering a new round if they cant find enough soldiers to keep us from getting at civilians what does that say i bet it says were winning the private grinned he had a captured cs automatic rifle and lots of magazines for it unlike chester he hardly bothered aiming he just sprayed bullets around some of them were bound to hit something i bet youre right chester martin shot a man who drove his auto into range at exactly the wrong time the fellow might not even have known us soldiers were loose in apalachee he didnt get much of a chance to find out either lieutenant lavochkin shot up another gas stationhe seemed to enjoy that this one rewarded him with a spectacular fireball had he been closer when he opened up the flames might have swallowed his command car whoa shouted the kid next to chester hot stuff yeah chester said were hot stuff and the confederates cant do much about it doesnt look like if we had enough gas i bet we could make it damn near to the ocean thatd be something the private said but things stopped being so much fun not long after they got out of apalachee an enemy barrel blew a command car into twisted burning sheet metal us soldiers leaped out of the vehicles that carried them and stalked the metal monster it wasnt a new model but it was plenty tough enough it wrecked another couple of vehicles and shot several soldiers before somebody clambered up on top of it and threw grenades into the turret that settled that the barrel brewed up fools boris lavochkin said scornfully they didnt have infantry along to protect it they probably didnt have any to spare chester said lavochkin thought that over then he smiled again any soldier in butternut who saw that smile would have wanted to surrender on the spot f lora blackford found a place to sit on the socialists side of the aisle congressional hall was always crowded during a joint session president la follette hadnt called many he seemed to think actions spoke louder than words oddly that made his words resonate more when he did choose to use them the speaker of the house introduced him ladies and gentlemen i have the distinct honor and high privilege of presenting to you the president of the united states charlie la follette took his place behind the lectern the lights gleamed off his silver hair along with everybody else in the hall flora applauded till her hands were sore la follette was an accidental president but he was turning out to be a pretty good one thank you ladies and gentlemen thank you he said i come before you todayi come before the people of the united states todayto help right a wrong that has continued in our country for too long we do not have a large number of negro citizens in the united states most negroes in north america have always lived in the confederacy this is partly our own fault as we have been slow to accept refugees from the oppression that has long existed there not caring for a man because of the color of his skin is one thing leaving him to die in a country that hates him is something else again it is a mistake a reprehensible mistake and not one we will continue to make any human being regardless of color is entitled to live free i will ask that legislation be introduced in congress to make sure this comes true and i fear we have committed another injustice for too long we have believed that negro men lack the courage to fight for their country we have never conscripted them into the army or even let them volunteer in the navy we let them cook food and tend engines but no more this is not right not if they are men like any others citizens like any others as if further proof were needed colored guerrilla fighters in the confederate states have shown beyond the shadow of a doubt that courage is not a question of black and white without their brave efforts our war against jake featherstons vicious tyranny would be even harder and more perilous than it is no law prevents the enlistment and conscription of negroes into the armed forces of the united states we have relied on longstanding custom instead i say to you that this custom will stand no longer by its dreadful example the confederacy shows us how evil prejudice of any sort is this being so i have today issued an executive order forbidding discrimination on the basis of race in the recruitment training and promotion of all us military forces he paused there perhaps wondering what kind of applause he would get flora clapped hard so did almost all the socialists and republicans listening to president la follette and so did most of the democrats in congressional hall flora was sure robert taft would have if a people bomb hadnt killed him he was a conservative yes but one with a strong sense of justice only a few reactionaries men who harked back to the days when their party dominated the states that became the csa and the attitudes that went with those days sat on their hands president la follette beamed out at congress he must have got a better hand than he expected sounding relieved he continued under the terms of the executive order negro men from the ages of eighteen to fortyeight will have sixty days to register for conscription at the center nearest their homes once registered they will be selected at random on the same basis as whitesand for that matter on the same basis as orientals and indians failure to register within sixty days will lead to the same penalties for them as for anyone else who tries to evade conscription flora wouldnt have talked about penalties right after lifting the bar of discrimination she didnt think al smith would have charlie la follette didnt have such sure political instincts if he did he might have got elected on his own hook instead of being chosen to balance the socialist ticket instincts or not though he was getting the job done if a bomb blew jake featherston to hell how would the confederate states fare under don partridge as far as flora could see the vice president of the csa was a handsome smiling brainless twit she suspected featherston chose him as a running mate because he was a nobody not a rival not a threat the previous confederate vice president had tried to murder his boss and by all accounts damn near succeeded nonentities near the center of things were safer as long as jake featherston survived it didnt matter his ferocious energy drove the csa but if he died wishing he would made flora miss a few words of president la follettes speech when she started paying attention again he was saying and is only two weeks away it will be the fourth year of the war but i pledge to you people of the united states it will also be the last this is our year of victory a great roar went up from the assembled senators and representatives they sprang to their feet clapping and cheering no one hung back not the most ardently revolutionary socialists and not the most hidebound democrats the only alternative to beating jake featherston was losing to him and he seemed to have gone out of his way to show the united states how horrid that would be the birthday of the prince of peace is almost here la follette said after the congressmen and women reluctantly took their seats again and we shall have peace that is my pledge to you we shall have peaceand on our terms he got another stormy round of applause if the united states won the war by this coming november he would get more than that he likely would get elected president on his own hook and he would have earned it too flora wondered whether he would threaten to rain a new destruction on the confederate states if they didnt give up the way the kaiser had warned britain and france but he kept silent there thinking about it flora decided it made sense jake featherston knew what the united states was working on he was working on the same thing himself if he got it first he might win yet every us bombing raid on the cs uranium project made that less likely but you never could tell the confederacys rockets warned that its scientists and engineers were not to be despised even if its leaders were north america must have peace was the way charlie la follette chose to finish four times now during one long lifetime war has ravaged our continent it must never come againnever i say before the war of secession the united states stood off england in the fight that gave us our national anthem and defeated mexico to plant our flag on the pacific coast we dominated the continent being the sole power at its heart and when this cruel war ends at last we shall do the same again there hed said it that was probably more important than obliquely warning the confederates about uranium bombs charlie la follette had declared there would be no more confederates no more csa when the war was over if he could go down in history as the great reuniter wouldnt he make people forget about abraham lincoln and the way the united states fell to pieces during his luckless term in office senators and representatives contemplating the end of the confederate states cheered even louder than they had before it wasnt given to many men to be in at the birth of something wonderful if you couldnt do that being in at the death of something foul was almost as good congressmen and women crowded up to congratulate the president as he stepped down from the rostrum flora started to but then changed her mind charlie la follette would know how she felt and she wanted to find out what jake featherston had to say about his opposite numbers speech she didnt think she would need to wait very long but when she got to her office bertha waved a message form at her mr roosevelt would like to see you as soon as you can see him congresswoman she said is he coming here or does he want me to go to the war department flora asked he called right when the president finished when i told him i expected you back soon he said he was on his way her secretary answered roosevelt got there about fifteen minutes later he wheeled himself into floras inner office and closed the door behind him whats going on franklin she asked well im afraid i have bad news and i wanted you to hear it straight from me the assistant secretary of war said the confederates landed raiders in washington statewe think by submersibleand they fired a good many mortar rounds at the uranium project gevalt she exclaimed how bad is it they did some damage damn them were still trying to figure out just how much roosevelt replied two or three mortar bombs hit one of the dormitories too we lost some talented people and they wont be easy shoes to fill how close are we can we go on without them franklin roosevelt shrugged broad shoulders we have to and were getting very close i dont know how much this will delay us im not sure itll delay us at all but im not sure it wont either he spread his hands we just have to see what about the confederate project are we delaying it if were not it isnt from lack of effort that town will never be the same and neither will that university but theyre burrowing like moles putting as much as they can underground thats delaying them all by itself they havent quit though i dont think that bastard featherston knows what the word means they wont get another chance to do this to us theyve already had too many flora said charlie made a good speech there roosevelt agreed i bet jake featherstons mad enough to spit rivets shall we see flora reached for the knob on her wireless set even after it warmed up static stuttered and farted as she turned the tuner to a frequency featherston often used the usa and csa kept jamming each others stations as hard as they could richmonds main transmitter though punched through the jamming more often than not sure enough the confederate president came on the air right away i dont need to tell you the truth on account of charlie la follette just did it for me featherston snarled the truth is he aims to wipe the confederate states clean off the map charlie la follette thinks hes abe lincoln turned out lincoln couldnt wipe us out old charliell find out the hard way he cant either i know the confederate people wont let the country down they never have they never will and charlie la follette will hear from us real soon now you bet he will so long he wasnt kidding at least a dozen longrange rockets slammed into philadelphia in the next few minutes one of them missed congressional hall by alarmingly little flora felt the jolt in the soles of her feet the rockets didnt announce themselves they flew faster than sound so the boom when they went off was the first and only sign they were on the way after the salvo ended roosevelt said he can annoy us doing that but he cant beat us and we can beat him on the ground and we are and we will but how much will be left of us by the time we do flora asked the assistant secretary of war stuck out his chin as long as we have one man standing after he goes down nothing else matters as long as the one man we have standing is my son nothing else matters flora thought but franklin roosevelt had a son in the navy maybe he was thinking the same thing iv m ajor toricelli stuck his head into abner dowlings office sir youve got a call from philadelphia do i dowling viewed the prospect without delight what do they think ive gone and done now calls from the war department in his copious experience seldom brought good news but his adjutant said i dont think its that kind of call sir its general abell shall i transfer it in here youd throw a fit if i said no so would he dowling said a moment later the telephone on his desk rang he picked it up abner dowling here john abell sir said the voice on the other end of the line and dowling recognized the brainy general staff officers cool cerebral tones i hope youre well tolerable general tolerable dowling replied yourself ill last out the war abell said which might have meant anything or nothing i have a question for you how would you like to come back to the east and command an army in what we hope will be one of the decisive attacks of the war how would you like to go to bed with a beautiful blonde whos passionately in love with you yes there were dumber questions but not many whats not to like dowling asked and john abell told him what there was not to like your armygroup commander would be general macarthur oh dowling said macarthur had commanded a division in george custers army in the great war while dowling was custers adjutant general when macarthur led an army in northern virginia this time around dowling had commanded a corps under him for a while the two men didnt get along wellwhich was if anything an understatement we could use you back in virginia sir abell said you have experience with aggressive offensive action and you have experience fighting freedom party guards youd do the country a service if you came back and what would i do to myself dowling asked brigadier general abell didnt answer he had to figure that out on his own who would take over for me here if i left he inquired still lots of work that needs doing we were looking at giving colonel defrancis a star and putting him in charge of eleventh army abell said he should handle it and his coming from the airoperations side of things would be an advantage on such a broad front or do you think im wrong is there anything about terry defrancis we dont know he meant no im sure hell do a bangup job dowling had to answer that quickly and firmly so abell would have no doubts hes a fine officer and he knows the situation here so he wont have to waste any time figuring out whats going on hes young to make general but wars do that so they do said abell who like dowling had waited a long time for stars ill see you here in philadelphia then as fast as you can come orders will be cut by the time you get to the airstrip outside of snyder take care he hung up without waiting for dowlings goodbye pack a duffel angelo dowling called to his adjutant were on our way to philly and then to virginia who takes over here toricelli asked terry defrancis dowling replied my guess is his telephones ringing right about now sure enough defrancis auto pulled up in front of eleventh army headquarters just as dowling and toricelli were ready to leave for the airstrip congratulations on getting back to the real war sir defrancis called as he jumped out congratulations to you general dowling said they shook hands ive got a hot transport waiting for you at the field defrancis said itll take you up to wichita i dont know what theyve got laid on for you after that but general abell sure sounded like he wants you in philadelphia fast as you can get there dowling and toricelli threw duffel bags with enough personal belongings to keep them going for a little while into a command car after one more handshake with defrancis dowling told the driver step on it yes sir the corporal needed no further encouragement he drove like a bat out of hellperhaps like a bat a little too eager to go back there the twoengined transport took off with an escort of four fighters terry defrancis hadnt mentioned that dowling was grateful all the same us air power dominated the skies in west texas but the confederates still got fighters up in the air every now and then even a hot transport was no match for a hound dog neither the texas panhandle nor western sequoyah had suffered too badly in the war the fighting in sequoyah was mostly farther east where the oil wells were where the oil wells had been rather the oil fields had changed hands several times during the war whenever they did the side pulling out blew them up to deny them to the enemy the conquerors would start making repairs and then have to retreat themselvesand carry out their own demolitions by now sequoyahs oil wells were some of the most thoroughly liberated real estate on the face of the globe in the last war sequoyah had started out as confederate territory cs cavalry raids terrorized kansas till the usa slowly and painfully overran that states southern neighbor these days though wichita was a backwater the arrival of a major general even if he was only passing through on his way somewhere else made airport personnel flabble your airplane is ready and waiting sir said the major in command of the field thanks dowling said where do i go from here uh st louis sir the major said didnt they tell you if they had would i be asking dowling asked reasonably he got into st louis just as the sun was setting that was a relief he wasnt sure they would have turned on landing lights for his airplane confederate bombers from arkansas came up often enough to leave blackout regulations tightly in place at the airport there they offered him the choice of a pullman berth on a fast train east or a layover and the first flight out in the morning he chose the layover a bed that didnt bounce and shake had its attractions he spent less time in it than he would have liked the confederates came over at eleven and then again at two instead of a bed that didnt bounce dowling got two doses of a chilly trench bombs whistled down and burst too close for comfort he wondered if he would be able to fly out the next morning he did the raid left the airport with a working runway and didnt hit the airplane waiting to take him east on the way he got a birdseye view of what the war had done to the united states only occasional craters showed on the ground till he flew over what had to be eastern indiana from there on it was one disaster after another deserted unplowed farmland with towns and cities smashed into ruins how long would repairing the devastation take how much would it cost what could the country have done if it didnt have to try to put itself together again he couldnt begin to guess that was a question for politicians not soldiers but a soldier had no trouble seeing the usaand the csa toowould have been better off without a war though dowling didnt see what had happened to the confederate states he knew that had to be worse than what he was looking at if they were smart they would have left us alone he said to major toricelli if they were smart they never would have elected that featherston bastard his adjutant replied dowling noddedthere was another obvious truth his airplane landed outside of pittsburgh to refuel as it spiraled down toward the runway he got a good look at what the battle had cost the city his first thought was everything but that wasnt an obvious truth smoke rose from tall stacksand from some truncated onesfrom steel mills that were either back in business or had never gone out of business nobody had bothered repairing shellpocked walls or sometimes roofs those could wait the steel that was a different story trucks on the roads trains in the railroad yards and barges on the rivers took it where it needed to go when he got out of the airplane to stretch his legs and spend a penny his nose wrinkled hed expected the air to be full of harsh industrial stinks and it was he hadnt expected the stench of death to linger so long after the fighting ended not as bad as the graves outside of camp determination toricelli said well no i dont think anything in the whole world is that bad dowling replied but this is what the great war battlefields were like most of the ones this time around arent so foul they move faster and cover more ground so there arent so many bodies all in the same place except here there are his adjutant said dowling nodded yeah except here there are philadelphia was another bombpocked nightmare of a city another place where factories sent up defiant plumes despite the destruction a greengray motorcar met dowling at the airport ill take you to the war department sir said the bright young captain who accompanied the enlisted driver how bad are these longrange rockets we hear about dowling asked as the auto picked its way through streets often cratered and rubblestrewn they sure arent good sir the captain answered first thing you know is they go boomand if youre there when they do then you arent any more that was convoluted but dowling got the message damage grew worse as the auto got closer to the center of town a lot of the rockets seemed to have fallen there dowling saw the finned stern of one sticking up and curved sheet metal from a couple of more the war department had taken lots of near misses but no direct hits dowling saw he had to show his id before they let him in even after he did they patted him down no one apologizedit was part of routine the captain took him down to john abells office good to see you sir abell said his usual bloodless tones sucking the warmth from the words and you dowling replied which wasnt entirely true but came close enough he pointed to a map of virginia on abells wall what are we going to do to them abell got up and pointed this is what weve got in mind dowling whistled well whoever came up with it sure didnt think small thank you abell said that made dowling blink the general staff officer was more likely to see what could go wrong than what could go right this scheme though definitely counted on things going right you really think theyre on their last legs dont you dowling said last leg john abell replied theyre standing on it in georgia if we hit them here too the bet is that they fall over it could be dowling hesitated then said the other thing he thought needed saying is general macarthur really the right man to knock them over if you want command of the army group sir you wont get it now abells voice was as icy as dowling had ever heard it which said a good deal no no no i wasnt asking for myself after a question like that i wouldnt take it if you gave it to me on a silver platter dowling said but if weve got somebody better than that scrawny bastard handy we ought to use him the general staff officer relaxed fractionally since you put it that waywell general morrell is busy in georgia which is also of vital importance and general macarthur is the man on the spot and familiar with conditions all right dowling said it wasnt not really but hed made the effort when were ready down there ill do everything i can c larence potter was so glad to get away from georgia and george patton that he almost didnt mind shuttling back and forth between richmond and lexington every few days president featherston couldnt seem to make up his mind whether he wanted potter to pick up his work in intelligence again or act as liaison with the uraniumbomb project either way potter figured he was better suited to the work than he was to commanding a division under patton as far as he could see the only things that suited a man to command a division under patton were a rhinos hide and an uncanny ability to turn off ones brain that probably wasnt fairpatton had grievances with him too potter didnt much care not dealing with patton was such a pleasure of course not dealing with the general meant dealing with the president of the csaand incidentally with professor fitzbelmont but potter had been dealing with jake featherston since the great war and he scared the living bejesus out of the professor he could handle both of those jobs without wanting to retread his stomach lining twice a day fitzbelmont was a man facing a problem all too common in the csa these days he was trying to do a key job without quite enough men or resources and with the damnyankees pounding the crap out of him from the air back before the united states found out what was going on there washington university had been a lovely leafy grassy campus potter remembered what a joy coming to lexington had been after the devastation visited on richmond lexington was making up for lost time these days everything except the uraniumbomb project had abandoned the university campus which looked like a realestate poster for a subdivision in one of the ritzier neighborhoods of hell the slagged and cratered earth might have caught smallpox ruins of what had been elegant graceful buildings many dating back before the war of secession offered a sorry reminder of better times only the square brutal simplicity of reinforced concrete ton upon ton of it had any hope of surviving the yankees nightly visits down below that concrete the pile was turning uranium into jovium which was what fitzbelmont had christened element enough jovium would go boom just like u making it go boom though wasnt so simple with u we could shoot a plug into a hole in a bigger chunk and then everything would go up fitzbelmont said why cant you do that with the jovium too potter asked our calculations show it would start going off too soon and get too deformed for a full blast the physicist answered well you seem to think you can make it go off potter said and henderson fitzbelmont nodded potter asked what looked like the next reasonable question how we have to slam a lot of pieces down into a spherethats what the math says fitzbelmont replied its harder than making a u bomb would be because its so much more precise but getting the jovium is easier because we can chemically separate it from the uranium in the pile my chemistry prof at yale told me transmutation was nothing but a pipe dream potter said mine told me the same thing fitzbelmont shrugged sometimes the rules change they did here transmutation isnt chemistryits physics it could be black magic and i wouldnt care potter said as long as we say abracadabra before the damnyankees do nothing else counts theyre doing their best to make sure we dont are we doing the same to them the professor asked what we can getting to washington state isnt easy for us and it got tougher after they went and grabbed baja california from mexico potter said henderson fitzbelmont looked blank he was no military man patiently potter explained it makes it much harder for us to get ships and subs out of guaymas but we did it not so long ago and we attacked their facility and fitzbelmont asked eagerly and past that i dont know potter admitted the attack went inthats all i can tell you for sure the united states keep real quiet about their project same as we keep quiet about ours we havent picked up any leaks to let us know what we didnone ive heard anyhow we cant hit them the way they hit us fitzbelmont said mournfully and it looks like they started work on this before we did potter had been worrying about those very things for quite a while now except for getting the latest strike at the yankee project started he couldnt do much but worry that means we have to be smarter he told the physicist were up to that arent we if we make fewer mistakes and dont get stuck in blind alleys we can still win youre as good as anybody theyve got right youd better be or were history yes i think so fitzbelmont replied they may well have more highly competent people than we do though and i worry about germany a good deal the kaisers physicists and the ones he can draw from austriahungary are the best in the world has the president been able to get any technical help from our allies if he has he hasnt told me potter said ill ask him next time im in richmond that was only a couple of days later traveling inside richmond was safer by day us airplanes mostly came at night confederate defenses and fighters still made daytime raids too costly to be common the bombers had taken a terrible toll all the same intact buildings stood out because they were so rare the streets were full of holes of all sizes the smell of death floated through the air the grounds to the gray house might have been hit harder than anything else in richmond the united states wanted jake featherston dead they wanted to avenge al smith and they thought the confederacy would grind to a halt without its leader potter feared they were right too which made him leery of plots against featherston after going underground after a couple of unpleasantly thorough searches he was escorted to the waiting room outside the presidents office and then into featherstons presence the presidents secretary sniffed as she closed the door behind him lulu doesnt much fancy you jake featherston sounded amused which was a relief she doesnt reckon you think im wonderful enough how right she is but saying that was impolitic the country needs you i know it potter could tell the truth without giving away his own feelings whats the latest from lexington featherston asked letting lulu go theyre doing everything they know how to do and the united states are trying to make sure they cant potter answered do you know what we did in washington state something the president answered theyve had repair crews in therei know that for a fact dont know much more though how did he know even that much a spy on the spot reconnaissance aircraft intercepted signals whatever the answer was the word hadnt come through potter how are things in georgia he asked the wireless didnt say much which was never a good sign were going to lose atlanta featherston said bluntly they didnt want to come in so theyre sweeping around they want to trap our army in there and grind it to pieces for gods sake dont let them potter exclaimed the president had thrown away one army in pittsburgh didnt he see he couldnt afford to do that again he must have for he nodded were pulling out were wrecking the place too they wont get any use from it when they get in he paused when patton challenged you to a duel did you really choose flamethrowers yes sir potter answered for a little while i thought hed take me up on it too that wouldntve been pretty would it the president said potter shook his head it would have been anything but featherston went on he was spitting rivets at you though let me tell you he was let him spit rivets at the damnyankees clarence potter said it would hurt em a lot more than some of the other things hes tried yeah i know featherston scowled but who have i got whod do better potter grunted that unfortunately was much too good a question he found a question of his own if we cant lick the usa no matter who weve got in the field why are we still fighting well for one thing they want unconditional surrender and ill see em in hell first jake featherston answered and for another the longer we hold on the better the chance fitzbelmont and the other sliderule boys have of blowing em a new asshole reluctantly potter nodded the confederate states had shown they were too dangerous for the united states to give them another chance to rebuild and try again it was a compliment of sorts but one the confederacy could have done without now as for the otherwhat if they get a uranium bomb first then were fucked featherstons response had at least the virtue of clarity then we dont deserve to win but that wont happen so help me god it wont we are going to lick those bastards right out of their boots you wait and see when he said it potter just about believed ita telling measure of how persuasive featherston could be but afterwards coming up aboveground once more seeing the devastation that had been a great city potter shivered how often lately had jake featherston taken a good long look at what had become of his capital and his country that afternoon potter and nathan bedford forrest iii walked through the disaster that was capitol square washingtons statue still survived not even a mountain of sandbags had saved albert sidney johnstons what the hell are we going to do the chief of the general staff saidquietly so no passerby could hear what the hell can we do potter answered were stuck between the yankees and jake featherston if we dump featherstonif we kill him i mean because he wont be dumpedthe united states land on us with both feet and if we keep fighting the united states land on us with both feet anyhow forrest finished bitterly they wont let us quit potter said they aim to wipe us off the map same as they did in the war of secession featherston never should have started this damn war nathan bedford forrest iii said oh cut the crapsir potter said his superior gaped not caring he went on you arent mad at him for starting the war you were all for it so was i so was everybody youre just mad because we arent winning arent you sure but at least i know why i clarence potter broke off what forrest said but then he heard it too the distant rumble of artillery suddenly picking up he frowned his eyes which were more like his famous greatgrandfathers than any other feature narrowed damnyankees havent done that much firing for quite a while they sure havent potter agreed i wonder if they think they can catch us with our pants down here because weve moved so much stuff to georgia i wonder if theyre right he didnt say that out loud nathan bedford forrest iii had enough to worry about and the same thought was bound to be going through his mind the chief of the general staff stood there listening his head cocked to one side after a minute or so he shook himself he might almost have come out of a trance id better get back to the war department find out what the hell theyre up to he said ill come with you potter said forrest didnt tell him no even though he didnt have a formal place there any more the gunfire went on and on halfway back to the war department building both men broke into a trot c assius and gracchus strode through the streets of madison georgia they both wore us army boots on their feet and greengray us militaryissue trousers only their collarless chambray work shirts said they werent regular us soldiersthose and their black skins of course even the shirts had starsandstripes armbands on the left sleeve the negroes were at least semiofficial gracchus carried a captured cs submachine gun cassius still had his boltaction tredegar both of them were alert for anything that looked like trouble madison had only recently fallen to the united states the whites here didnt like seeing their own soldiers driven away they were even less happy about negroes patrolling their streets a couple of days earlier somebodyd fired at one of gracchus men the guerrilla got his left hand torn up madison got a lesson a painful one the us commandant a coldeyed captain named lester wallace grabbed the first ten white men he could catch lined them up against a brick wall and had them shot without even blindfolding them first nobody fucks with anybody under us authority in this town he told the horrified locals in a voice like iron while the bodies still lay there bleeding nobody you hear jesus god it was only a nigger a woman shrilled anybody who comes out with that kind of shit from now on i figure you just volunteered for hostage duty wallace said far as i can see the black folks around here are worth at least ten of you assholes apiecei mean at least they didnt start murdering people for the fun of it you freedomyelling cocksuckers did we didnt know what happened to the colored folks who got shipped out an old man quavered yeahnow tell me another one you give me horseshit like that youre a volunteer hostage too captain wallace said you didnt know whered you think they were going you goddamn lying bucket of puke to a fucking football game cassius didnt know what hed thought yankees would be like this chilly ferocity wasnt it thoughhe was sure of that a lot of us soldiers hated the enemy with a clear and simple passion that shoved everything else to one side you know i never had much use for smokes a skinny corporal who needed a shave told cassius out of the blue one day but shit man if featherstons fuckers have it in for you you gotta have somethin going for you was that logical cassius wondered what his father would have thought of it but there was a brutal logic that beat down the more formal sort the enemy of my enemy is my friend that was working here it had a flip side the friend of my enemy is my enemy as cassius and gracchus patrolled madison cassius said aint never gonna be safe for niggers around here without yankees close by from now on reckon not gracchus said but how safe was it for us fore the damnyankees done got here that question answered itself his family hauled out of church and taken off to a camp his own life on the run ever since the precarious life black guerrillas led knowing there would be no mercy if they got caught well you got me cassius said they tramped into the town square a bronze plaque was affixed to a small stone pillar there somehow the little monument had come through the fighting that leveled half the town without even a nick gracchus pointed to the plaque whats it say he asked cassius had taught him his letters but he still didnt read well says its the braswell monument cassius said says in benjamin braswell done sold thirteen slaves after he was dead so they could use the money to educate white chillun says they raised almos thirtysix hundred dollars aint that grand sold niggers to help ofays thats how it goes sure as hell gracchus strode up to the braswell monument unbuttoned his fly and took a long leak show what i thinks o you mr benjamin fuckin asswell a couple of white women with wheeled wire shopping carts were hurrying across the square they took one look gracchus way and walked even faster they dont like your dark meat cassius said my meat dont like them neither gracchus replied i start fuckin white women i aint gonna start fuckin no ugly white women an they was dogs they hadnt been beautiful some negroes in us service didnt care they took their revenge on confederate women for everything confederate men had done to them a few us officers reacted as badly to that as confederate men might have not everyone in the usa loved negroes not by a long shot but most men who wore greengray uniforms hated the enemy worse than the blacks hed oppressed know what i feel like gracchus said as he and cassius resumed their patrol i feel like a dog that jus pissed somewhere to say this here place mine dunno if its yours or not cassius said sure as shit dont belong to the confederate ofays no mo as if to emphasize that the us troops had run up a barbedwire stockade just outside of madison to hold cs prisoners of war cassius wasnt the only negro drawn to that stockade as if by a magnet seeing soldiers in butternutand better still seeing freedom party guards in brownsplotched camouflageon the wrong side of the wire stuck inside a camp disarmed and glum while he carried a weapon was irresistibly sweet they gonna reduce your population a negro from a different band jeered at the pows they gonna put you on a train an you aint never gettin off some of the captured confederates looked scaredwho could know for sure what the soldiers on the other side would do some swore at the black guerrilla one stubborn sergeant said fuck you in the heart sambo they already put your nappyheaded whore of a mama on the train and she deserved it too a few seconds later he lay dead a bullet through his chest a us corporal hearing the shot came running jesus he said when he saw the corpse what the helld you go and do that for the confederates in the stockade were screaming and pointing at the negro whod fired the guerrilla was unrepentant he dogged my mother he said simply aint nobody gonna dog my mother specially not some goddamn ofay fuckhead christ im gonna have to fill out papers on this shit the noncom groaned tell me what the fuck happened several pows tried to they did their best to outshout the guerrilla whod killed the sergeant cassius weighed in to balance them if he could he said that to this guy the corporal said when he finished he sure did cassius answered shit on toast the noncom said he told me that i bet i woulda blown his fuckin head off the pows screamed at him too he flipped them off listen up assholessomething you better figure out you lost these guyshe pointed at cassius and the other negrothey won better get used to it or a hell of a lot of you are gonna end up dead and you know what else nobodys gonna miss you either we wont ever put up with bein under niggers a captive shouted thats right two or three more echoed him then i figure youll be underground the corporal pointed to the corpse take your carrion over to the gate well put him where he belongs he got more curses and jeers and ignored all of them after he went away the other negro stuck out his hand to cassius thanks for backin me im sertorius my names cassius cassius took the proffered hand as he had with gracchus he asked reckon we ever be able to do anything down here without the yankees backin our play no sertorius said calmly but so what yankees dont come down here fuckin confederate ofays kill us anyways they really did take my mama god damn them to hell an gone mine too an my pa an my sister cassius answered how come they miss you on account of i didnt go to church thats where they got everybody else i heard stories like that before sertorius said if theres a god he got hisself a nasty sense o humor reckon so cassius had wondered about god even before the ofays got his family hed always kept quiet because he knew his mother didnt want him sayingor thinkingthings like that he had the feeling his father was sitting on the same kind of doubts the older man never talked about them either one of these days the two of them might have had some interesting things to say to each other they never would now the black guerrillas had a camp alongside that of the us soldiers who guarded the pows and made sure the lid stayed on in madison they slept in us army tents and used us army sleeping bags those gave them better softer nights than theyd had most of the time on their own they got us army mess kits too and ate us army chow with the men from north of the masondixon line they didnt have to wait till the soldiers in greengray were served before they got fed they just took their places in line and the cooks slapped down whatever they happened to have sometimes it was good sometimes not but there was always plenty for cassius whose ribs had been a ladder that was plenty to keep him from complaining when he went into madison kids would ask got any rations got any candy no starve you little ofay bastards that was always the first thought that went through his head but hating children didnt come easy they hadnt done anything to him and some of them looked hungry he knew what being hungry was all about then one of them called hey nigger got any candy he didnt shoot the boy who must have been about eight that would have got him talked about he did say you call me a nigger brat you can damn well starve for all i care the kid looked at him as if he were crazy well what are you if you aint a nigger a colored fellow or a negro or even a black man cassius answered call somebody a nigger its an insult like youre a nigger all right an you suck the damnyankees cocks the brat squeaked he didnt get a handout from cassius or a lesson he also still didnt get shot but he came much closer to that than to either of the other two hed likely feel the way he did till the day he died so would countless others just like him in the face of hate like that what were the surviving negroes in the csa supposed to do after the war ended how could they settle down and make a living if us soldiers didnt back them how long would they last not longthat seemed only too obvious and if us soldiers did back them the white majoritymuch larger now than before the murders startedwould hate negroes more than everassuming such a thing was possible we is fucked cassius said sorrowfully we is so fucked what on account o that ofay kid gracchus said little shithead run his mouth like that he get hisself killed goddamn quick an nobody be sorry neither no not on account o him cassius said which wasnt exactly true on account of everything he started to explain then gave up what was the use once upon a time he would have found a place in augustanot the place he would have had if he were white but a place he would have fit in now now he carried a tredegar and he was ready to kill any white who got in his way that too was a placeof sorts c hester martin smoked a cigarette outside of monroe georgia and waited for the next raiding party to head east the companystrength expedition had proved what the brass thought beforethe confederates hadnt had anything worth mentioning to oppose a us thrust why not try it again in greater strength to chester the answer seemed obvious enough if you hit them there once wouldnt they get ready to make sure you couldnt do it again lieutenant boris lavochkin looked at himlooked through himwith those cold pale slavic eyes youre welcome to stay behind when we go sergeant he said you know i dont want to do that sir chester said but i dont want to get my tit in a wringer either not when i dont have to no guarantees in this business lavochkin said he wouldnt listen everything had come his way for a long time now he thought it would keep right on happening and he wasnt the only one the brass never would have signed off on a raid if they didnt think it would fly maybe they were right chester could hope so anyhow he did talk to captain rhodes who he was sure knew his ass from his end zone if theyre laying for us sir well be all dressed up with no place to go he said what do you think the odds are the company commander asked well sir we sure as hell wont take em by surprise twice martin answered no but how much can they do about it rhodes said dont know sir chester said i bet we find out though if i wanted to be a goddamn guinea pig i wouldve bought myself a cage that made captain rhodes grin but he didnt change his mind weve got our orders he said were going to go through with them if we run into trouble i expect well have backup but i think we have a decent chance to bang on through same as we did the last time around hope youre right sir chester didnt believe it nobody above him cared what he believed to the men in his platoon he was god the father to lavochkins son and rhodes holy ghost to the officers above him he was just a retread with a big mouth and the fellows with shoulder straps were the ones whose opinions mattered two mornings later the long muscular armored column rolled down the road from monroe to good hope the same road the smaller raiding band had traveled not long before chester thought that might surprise whoever was in charge of the confederate defenders they wouldnt believe anybody could be dumb enough to hit them the same way twice running chester had trouble believing it himself they didnt run into any traffic on the way to good hope they also didnt run into any ambushes for which chester was duly grateful maybe the cs brass really couldnt believe their foes would try the same ploy twice good hope looked like holy hell only a couple of people were on the street when the us command cars and armored vehicles rolled in the confederate civilians didnt think the greengray machines were on their side this time they took one horrified look screamed and ran for their lives maybe that did them some good maybe it didnt machine guns and cannon cut loose as soon as the us column came into the little town and didnt let up till it rolled through martin looked back over his shoulder after he was outside of good hope clouds of smoke announced that raiders were on the loose if the enemy had telephone and telegraph lines back up from the last assault people were already letting cs military authorities know about the new one if there were any cs military authorities in this part of georgiaperhaps there werent perhaps the confederate states really were falling into ruin chester could hope so anyhow trouble came between good hope and apalachee the road went through some pine woods the column stopped because a barricade of logs and rocks and overturned wrecked vehicles blocked it getting barrels up to knock the obstruction aside wasnt quick or easy not with trees of formidable size alongside the narrow badly paved road and as soon as the column bogged down cs troops in the woods opened up with automatic weapons mortars and stovepipe rockets chester didnt think there were a whole lot of them which didnt mean they didnt do damage several softskinned vehicles and a halftrack caught fire wounded men howled us soldiers hit back with all the firepower theyd brought along heavy machine guns and cannon on their vehicles along with the rifles and automatic rifles and submachine guns the men carried nobody could come close to the column and live which didnt help all that much when it wasnt going anywhere after half an hour or so us barrels did shoulder the roadblock out of the way the column went on minus the vehicles put out of action when the soldiers got to apalachee they tore into it even more savagely than they had at good hope not much was left of the hamlet when they came out the other side chester hoped they wouldnt duplicate the whole route from the last raid that would give the confederates more chances to bushwhack them and would also mean they were tearing up more stuff theyd already wrecked once he nodded in approval when they left the road and started crosscountry heading as close to due east as made no difference whenever they came to a farmhouse they shot it up if the people who lived there made it very plain they were giving upif they came out with hands highthe soldiers let them flee with the clothes on their backs if they showed fight or even if they just stayed inside they got no second chances a startling number of rural georgians seemed to think a few rounds from a squirrel rifle or a shotgun would set the us army running they paid for their education none of them would ever make that mistake or any mistake again often their families died with them thats kind of a shame sir chester said as a woman trapped in a burning farmhouse and likely wounded shrieked her life away think of it as survival of the fittest captain rhodes replied if theyre dumb enough to fire on us theyre too dumb to deserve to live she probably didnt have a gun martin said the company commander shrugged she was dumb enough to marry somebody who did we arent here to talk to these people sergeant were here to teach em that fucking with the united states is as dumb as it gets inside the farmhouse cartridges started cooking off the womans shrieks mercifully faded id say shes got the point sir chester said fat lot of good itll do her from here on out before rhodes could answer chester and he both heard airplane motors overhead they expected us fighterbombers to pound whatever lay ahead of them then a fearsome scream rose with the rumble chester had heard that noise too many times though not so often lately asskickers he yelled and threw himself flat anybody who could get to an automatic weapon opened up on the vulturewinged cs dive bombers the mules ignored the ground fire and planted their bombs in the middle of the thickest concentrations of vehicles they could find one landed right on a halftrack the fireball caught a couple of nearby soldiers and turned them into torches the asskickers came back again to strafe the us soldiers machinegun bullets stitched the ground much too close to chester he scraped away with his entrenching tool not that it would do a hell of a lot of good and then the dive bombers were gone captain rhodes looked around at the damage theyd done fuck he said softly you all right chester yeah martin scrabbled in his pockets for a cigarette boy i forgot how much fun that was me too rhodes said weve got used to dishing it out thats a lot more fun than taking it bet your assuh sir chester needed three tries before he could strike a match his hands were shaking then he held out the pack to rhodes the company commander didnt waste time trying to light one on his own he just leaned close to chester and started his the easy way lieutenant lavochkin came up we ought to push on sir he said we can do a lot more damage before nightfall he didnt care about the air attack all he wanted to do was keep hitting the confederates that was either admirable or slightly insane depending captain rhodes sighed and blew out a ragged plume of smoke well see to the dead and wounded and then well go on he said some of the dead didnt leave enough remains to bury maybe the confederates would tear up the graves the men in greengray quickly dug but chester could hope they wouldnt plenty of cs soldiers lay in us soil for the most part quietly when the war was over they would probably sort all of that out theyd done the same thing after the great war by all the signs this war was bigger and nastier than the one that had lasted from to what would they call it when it was done the greater war the worse war right now it was just the war commonly with an obscene adjective stuck on in front they did roll on after an hour or so and took a wouldbe confederate ambush from behind the enemy soldiers seemed highly offended at thatthose who lived through the encounter anyhow us soldiers took prisoners as much to keep their intelligence officers happy as because they really wanted to one of the men in butternut complained yall werent suppose to come where you did thats what she said chester answered which left his buddies laughing and the pow shaking his head home guards and mexicans tried to make a fight in stephens and hutchings two little towns in front of lexington they got blasted out of the way in short order in both places they were brave but bravery and small arms and a few mines didnt go very far against halftracks and barrels the two villages went up in flames lexington was a tougher nut to crack the defenders had a couple of quickfiring threeinch guns leftovers from a generation earlier for all chester knew theyd been sitting on the courthouse lawn ever since if they had somebodyd kept them well greased and some oldtimerprobably a guy a lot like me chester thoughtknew what to do with them shells rained down on the advancing us soldiers but the confederates didnt seem to have any armorpiercing ammunition those threeinchers werent made for barrel busting anyway they did hurt some men on foot and in softskinned vehicles but that was enough to make the soldiers in greengray angry without being enough to stop them as the december sun went down lexington got the same treatment as the two smaller towns in front of it the us soldiers camped in the ruins see lieutenant lavochkin said piece of cake expensive piece of cakesir chester said woodenly lavochkin shrugged they paid more than we did and we can afford it better than they can both those things were probably true in the cold calculus of war they were also probably the only things that mattered a guy whod just stopped shrapnel with his belly cared about none of that chester lit a raleigh and thanked god he hadnt o ne of the first things dr leonard odoull found out about sergeant goodson lord was that he hated his name my mothers maiden name and ive got it for my first one the new medic said if i had a dime for every time i got called good lord id be a goddamn millionaire i believe it odoull said didnt your folks realize what they were doing i doubt it lord replied neither one of ems got much of a sense of humor im afraid how about you odoull asked me sir sergeant lord gave him a wry grin i earned mine the hard way it was either laugh or murder some yokking asshole before i was twelve years old well i spent a couple of years working with a guy who answered to granny odoull said if i say good lord every once in a while i may not be talking to you cant ask for more lord said and ill tell you one more timecareful about the women around here hey i like screwingwho doesnt the noncom said i hope im not too dumb about going after it he didnt seem to swish now even if odoull had wondered before he was on the young side of thirty most guys his age would have said the same thingunless they came out and admitted that they thought with their dick try not to get murdered odoull said earnestly i hate breaking in a new guy every couple of months you know what i mean sir i will do my best sergeant lord said he did his best with the wounded too he was at least as good as vince donofrio had been and he was plainly a better anesthetist odoull still missed granville mcdougald but lord would definitely do and the wounded kept coming in as us forces cut off one road into and out of atlanta after another odoull worked like a maniac to keep the hurt men from dying or getting worse right away then sent them off to field hospitals farther back of the line he spent quite a bit of time patching up a sergeants left hand which had taken a bullet through the palm i think hell have pretty good function there he said when the surgery was done hope so anyway i bet he will doc goodson lord said you really do pay attention to the little stuff and it matters ive seen some guys just stitch up a wound like that and let it go they figure the doctor in the rearll take care of it and sometimes theyre right and sometimes theyre wrong myself i always thought it was a lazy shitty thing to do im with you the more you do right the first time as soon as you can the less you have to be sorry for later odoull said sometimes you couldnt do much the corpsmen brought in a soldier in the mottled camouflage uniform of a freedom party guard hed been shot through the head why did you bother lord said after one look at the wound well you never can tell eddie answered that was true every once in a while odoull got a surprise but he didnt think he would this time the wounded man was barely breathing his pupils were of different sizes and unresponsive to light his pulse reedy and fading brains and blood and bits of bone dribbled out of a hole the size of odoulls fist i can clean things up a little but thats it odoull said hes in gods hands not mine he didnt think god would hang on tight either the confederate died halfway through the cleanup he gave a couple of hitching last breaths and then juststopped thats a mercy sergeant lord said other mercy is he never knew what hit him how many bad burns have you seen doc one is a million too many odoull answered and the senior medic nodded when odoull thought of those he didnt think of seeing them though the smell like pork left too long in the oven rose up in his mind as vividly as if a burned barrelman lay on the table in front of him and they got themselves a different kind of casualty one brought in not by the medics but by an irate platoon commander sir this sorry son of a bitch has the clap the lieutenant said in a voice that seemed barely done changing isnt that right donnelly fraid so donnelly said hurts like hell when i piss well we can do something about that odoull said guys with vd were just as much out of the fight as if jake featherstons men had plugged them drop your pants donnelly and turn the other cheek you gonna give me a shot the soldier asked apprehensively yup odoull readied the needlea big one i thought you got pills for the clap donnelly might well be fearless in the field but he sure wasnt here you used to this penicillin clears it up faster and better though odoull said now bend over you fuck around donnelly ill have you bend over and ill kick your sorry assi wont stick it the kid lieutenant said by the expression on donnellys face he would rather have got a kicking than a shot but he saw he had no choice he yelped when the needle went home odoull pushed in the plunger with a certain malicious glee for chrissake wear a rubber next time he said its like screwing in socks donnelly whined well your sweetheart sure gave you something to remember her by odoull said what did you give her four cans of deviled ham she was skinny as all getout how was i supposed to know shed give me a drippy faucet youre supposed to think about shit like that his platoon commander snapped before odoull could say anything how many times did you hear about it in basic yes sir donnelly said odoull had a good notion of what he wasnt saying that the only thing hed cared about was getting his jollies that was natural enough of course so was running away if somebody started shooting at you soldiers could learn not to they could also learn not to screw without being careful they could but this one hadnt clap isnt the only thing to worry about down here odoull said medic who worked with me got murdered for laying a confederate woman i wasnt worried about that sir i wasnt worried about anything donnelly said he wouldnt listen odoull could see that well pull your pants up and get the hell out of here he said if you come down with another dose so help me god ill find a bigger needle the threat might work if anything did it made donnelly look worried as he covered himself again anyhow the lieutenant kept barking at him as he led him away from the aid station how often does that happen lord asked every now and again odoull answered at least this guy didnt have a chancre penicillinll do for syphilis too sergeant lord said sure a lot better than the chemicals full of arsenic we used before odoull agreed and before that it was mercury and all kinds of other poison the senior medic made a face i think id rather have the pox a lot of the time something else would kill you before it got bad maybe odoull said but maybe not too a lot of the time youd get sick over and over one thing after another theyd all be different theyd all look different anyhow but theyd all have syphilis at the bottom damn things the great pretender you know more about it than i do sir sergeant lord said i played the trombone before i got conscripted i knew some guys who had it and it didnt seem to bother them all that much seem to is right odoull said and then the trombone eh have one with you afraid not sir its not like a flute or even the trumpetnot so easy to carry around too bad well maybe you can liberate one maybe goodson lord looked dubious ive seen fiddles and pianos and guitars in these pissant confederate towns but thats about it well let the corpsmen know let the guys in front of us know odoull said youd be amazed at what they can come up withbesides the clap i mean if i want that ill get it myself lord said odoull snorted since the medic didnt seem to want to spread the word odoull did it for him inside of three days eddie produced a horn here you go he said merry christmas ill be a son of a bitch goodson lord said he took the trombone and started to play notes smooth and mellow as butter filled the tent they made the army bugles odoull was used to seem like screeching blue jays by comparison wow eddie said you really can play that soandso you think i was lying lord asked lowering the trombone no not like that eddie answered but theres playing and then theres playing you know youre really good oh thanks the corpsmans enthusiasm made the sergeant blink he started to play some more he got about thirty seconds into a number from oh sequoyah before a corpsman brought in a man with a piece of shrapnel in his thigh you can blow that thing man the soldier said can you keep playing while the doc works on me sorry lord said after a quick look at the wound i think were gonna have to knock you out aw hell the wounded man said as far as leonard odoull could remember that was the first time hed ever heard a man ask not to be anesthetized sergeant lord got the patient etherized on the table odoull cut away the mans trouser leg and started cleaning out the wound and tying off bleeders he could see the femoral artery pulsing in there but it wasnt cut if it had been the man likely would have bled out before he got back to the aid station odoull sewed him up and injected him with penicillin and tetanus antitoxin these arent so bad he said he should heal up fine you do like to work on em when they turn out that way lord agreed how many amputations have you done i couldnt even begin to count em theyre like burns more than i ever wanted to thats for damn sure odoull said yeah same here lord said theyre easy to perform theyre fast and the patient usually comes through em pretty well but you know hell never be the same afterwards the poor bastard aint it the truth odoull said sadly most of the time when i do an amputation i feel more like a butcher than a surgeon thats about the size of it lord said odoull wished they hadnt been talking about it because the very next man the corpsman carried in had a foot and lower leg smashed beyond the hope of saving the doctor pulled out the bone saw and did what he had to do as sergeant lord had said the soldier would probably pull through whether he would be happy about it was a different question odoull wasnt likely ever to learn his answer to it f ayetteville lay south and even a little west of atlanta a rail line ran through it once the us army got astride that line it would pinch off one more confederate artery into the beleaguered capital of georgia lieutenant michael pound didnt think the enemy would be able to hold atlanta much longer after that happened being a platoon commander pound wore earphones more often than he wanted to instead of doing as he pleased he had to keep track of what the other units in the regiment and the other barrels in his platoon were up to he thought it cramped his style marquards platoon has lost three barrels at square g a voice from somewhere in back of the line intoned need armor there to cover the infantry advance pound checked the map if his platoon was where he thought they were right on the edge of g themselves pound here he answered on the same frequency we can cover do you know why they lost them over he waited he didnt have to wait long roger your covering the voice said report is that the losses are due to enemy barrels over what the hells wrong with marquard pound asked but not with the transmit key pressed he happened to know that the other lieutenant had newmodel machines to his way of thinking you had to be worse than careless to lose three in a hurry to cs barrels you damn near had to be criminally negligent he wirelessed the news to the other four barrels in his platoon by what their commanders said they felt the same way well take care of it one of the sergeants promised those butternut bastards can kiss their butts goodbye damn straight pound said he led a bunch of hardcharging pirates men who thought the same way he did lets go get em follow me he led the platoon west and a little south to come in where the luckless marquard had got in trouble he hadnt got far before realizing the trouble might not be what he thought there sat a dead us barrel in a fieldnot just dead but decapitated for the turret lay upside down about ten feet from the chassis fuck sergeant scullard said whered they get a gun that could do that good question pound said which didnt answer the gunner he got on the platoon circuit again be careful guys use all the cover you can i think featherstons fuckers just came up with something new for most of a year the latest us barrels had dominated the battlefield if they couldnt do that any morethen everything got harder michael pound approved of easy not that the enemy cared he flipped up the lid to the cupola and stood up in the turret he needed to be able to see the periscopes built into the cupola just didnt do the job there wasnt a lot of smallarms fire if the cs gunners who nailed that us barrel opened up on him with an automatic rifle or a machine gunthat was better than having them shoot at his barrel with whatever monster gun they had one of the other barrels in his platoon was about a hundred yards to his left he saw a blast of flame burst from a thick stand of bushes heard a thunderous roar and a moment later watched the other us barrel brew up the men inside couldnt have had a chanceand that gun whatever it was would be aiming at him next front he bawled as he tumbled back into the turret identified scullard answered im going to give it ap i think a hulls hiding in there i dont know i didnt see one but pound added if you got a better look go with what you think mouradian had already slammed the round into the breech the gunner fired the piece the cannons bellow was slightly muffled inside the turret smoke and fire spurted from the heart of the bushes michael pound whooped and thumped sergeant scullard on the back gimme another round scullard told the loader he fired again more flames burst from the bushes shame moses isnt here pound thought sir i think that son of a bitch is history scullard said i think youre right pound said and if you werent so quickand if you werent so sure about what was hiding therewe would be instead he spoke into the intercom move forwardcarefully i want to see what the hell we killed yes sir the driver answered by the time pounds barrel drew near the bushes were burning briskly through them he got a pretty good look at a low hull a turret as smoothly curved as a turtles carapace and a gun that looked as if it came off a destroyer fuck scullard said again gonna be a ton of work killing these babies we can do it you did it pound said i know the gunner said but they can kill us too easy as you please i hope the confederates dont have a lot of em me too pound admitted we cant go marching around like no gun can touch us any morethats for sure sometimes us newmodel barrels confident in their armor would almost dare cs machines to shoot at them if you did that against one of these barrels theyd bury your ashes in a tobacco pouch he got on the wireless to pass what hed found to division hq roger that came the reply weve had a couple of other reports about them the soldier on the other end of the connection sounded calm and relaxed why not he was well behind the line why the devil didnt you pass the word along pound yelled you damn near got me killed we said the losses were due to enemy barrels the wireless man answered as if that were enough he probably thought it was pound took off the earphones we can beat the enemy he said to nobody in particular but god help us against our own side headquarters being stupid again scullard asked sympathetically theyd have to wise up to get to stupid warming to his theme pound added theyve got their headquarters in their hindquarters and were the ones wholl end up paying for it the gunner predicted guy in one of our uniforms coming up mouradian said that sent pound out of the cupola again a captured confederate submachine gun at the ready just because somebody wore a us uniform he wasnt necessarily a us soldier but he stopped by himself before pound could tell him not to come any closer you nailed that fucker he said his harsh accent claimed he was from kansas or nebraska but that didnt prove anything either yeah pound answered and so more of em aroundbound to be said the us soldierpound supposed he was a us soldier anyhow can you clear em out who knows pound didnt just look at the monstrous machine his barrel had just wrecked he looked back at the us barrel the confederates had killed those were five men of his five friends of his gone in the wink of an eye he hadnt had even a moment to grieve he still didnt not really those other guys they walked into a buzz saw the infantryman in greengray said bam bam bam they went out one after another i dont think they ever knew what got em pound hoped the men in the barrel from his platoon didnt know what got em was that a ѕinch gun on the cs machine a fiveincher whatever it was it was devastating a confederate machine gun started snarling the foot soldier threw himself flat pound ducked down into the turret he got on the platoon circuit with the survivors were moving up for gods sake watch it we arent the biggest cats in the jungle any more how many of those big barrels did featherstons men have how fast were they how maneuverable how well did they do on bad ground a barrels engine could be as important a weapon as its gun but the gun in that bastard kinda revs up the pucker factor doesnt it sir scullard said which came unpleasantly close to echoing pounds thoughts maybe a little he answered his voice as dry as he could make it he didnt want to admit he was scared but he couldnt very well deny it either he got on the wireless any chance of sending up some more armor to g we dont know whats ahead of us and it feels pretty naked around here well well see what we can do said the wireless operator on the other end of the line he was sitting in a chair under canvas somewhere for all michael pound knew he was eating bonbons and patting a cute nurse on the ass to hear her giggle he wasnt up here at the sharp end of the wedge wondering if hed cook like a pot roast in the next few seconds two rounds of he silenced that chattering machine gun the country was pine woods and little clearings pound stayed away from the clearings when he could and dashed across when he couldnt somewhere ahead lay the georgia southern line somewhere ahead and to the right the unreduced town of fayetteville if everything worked the enemy would have to abandon it along with atlanta pound had been confident he wished he still were he also wished the enemy were still counterattacking that would have made things easier then those big honking barrels would have had to show themselves as things were they lurked in ambush the only way to find one wasthe hard way having foot soldiers along came in handy pound waited in the woods while the men in greengray trotted across a field a big round of he slammed into the poor bloody infantry some us soldiers went flying while others flattened out and dug in see where that came from sir scullard asked bearing was almost straight ahead of usbehind that twisted tree with the chunk of bark missing pound answered peering through the periscopes if hes smart hell back awayhe ought to figure our guys have armor with em maybe hell get greedy instead the gunner said pound wouldnt have but the enemy crew did they fired twice more at the infantrymen in the field they had good targets in front of them and they were going to take advantage of it to give them their due they didnt have any room to retreat not if the csa wanted to hang on to the railroad line identify em now mel pound asked oh hell yes scullard said and then to the loader ap he added be ready for another round as fast as you can if the first one doesnt do the trick weve got to try again right mouradian said if the second one doesnt do the trick weve got to get awayif we can pound thought the cs barrel would know where the shots were coming from and would answer pound didnt want to be on the receiving end of that reply the gun spoke twice in quick succession scullard didnt wait to see if the first round hit before sending the second on its way as soon as hed fired both of them pound shouted reverse the barrel jerked backward no enemy antibarrel rounds came after it pound popped out of the turret to see what theyd done to the cs barrel smoke rose from behind the tree an evergrowing cloud he spotted motion back theresomebodyd got out and was running away that impressed him in spite of himself his own barrel wouldnt have let anybody inside survive not after it got hit twice the confederates had themselves some deadly dangerous new toys here he hoped like anything they didnt have too many of them v i rving morrell posed for us photographers in front of the atlanta city hall new years day for was chilly and overcast with the wetdust smell of rain in the air morrell didnt care he would have posed for these pictures in the middle of a deluge a year ago we were still mopping up in pittsburgh he said now were here weve done pretty damn well for ourselves by god did you expect the confederates to evacuate the city a reporter asked they were going to lose it either way morrell answered the question was would they lose atlanta or would they lose atlanta and the army that was holding it they saved a good part of the army by pulling out theyd saved more than he wished they would have theyd started the evacuation at night and bad weather had kept us fighterbombers on the ground so their columns hadnt got the pounding they should have pattons army was still a going concern somewhere over near the alabama border morrell didnt know what his cs opposite number would do with the men he had left but he figured patton would think of something a rifle banged not too far away holdouts and snipers still prowled atlanta the confederates had planted lots of mines theyd attached booby traps to everything from fountain pens to toilet seats the stars and stripes might fly here but the town wasnt safe and wouldnt be for quite a while how much does this victory mean another reporter called well the enemy will have a lot tougher time fighting the war without atlanta than he would have with it morrell said it was a factory town and a transport hub and now hell have to do without all that the reporter waved at the wreckage doesnt look like he could have done too much with it even when he had it youd be amazed morrell said weve seen how places that look beaten to death can go right on producing till they finally change hands a plaque on the bulletpocked terracotta wall behind him said atlanta resurgens the city hall had gone up in the brief spell of prosperity that followed the csas devastating postwar inflation then the worldwide economic collapse sucked down the confederacy along with almost everybody else and paved the way for the rise of jake featherston what do you aim to do now general another reporter inquired by his earnest voice and expectant look he really expected morrell to answer in detail some reporters never did figure out that their right to a good story stopped where it began to endanger us soldiers as gently as he could morrell said well i dont want general patton to read about it in tomorrows paper you know will you drive west into alabama or east toward the atlantic this fellow was stubborn or stupid or both yes morrell answered the reporter blinked some of his colleagues quicker on the uptake grinned morrell said thats about all boys happy new year a few more flashbulbs popped he didnt mind thatthe confederates already knew he was in atlanta bodyguards closed up around him as the press conference ended he didnt care for the guards but he didnt care to get killed either enemy snipers would have loved to get him in their sights the state capitol wasnt far away a lot of people on his staff had wanted him to make his headquarters there he said no and kept saying no till they believed him demolition men were still going through the building which looked like a scaleddown version of the confederate capitol in richmondat the moment including bomb damage theyd already found a couple of dozen booby traps thereand how many had they missed a small none too fancy house a couple of blocks away seemed a better safer bet the demolition experts had swept it too and found it clear the confederates didnt have enough ordnance or time to boobytrap everything which came as a relief morrell had other things to worry about plenty of them sitting on his desk when he got back were photos of wrecked newmodel cs barrels by all reports they were half a step ahead of the us machines that had dominated the battlefield for most of how far could that race go would there be land dreadnoughts one day with twelveinch guns and armor thick enough to stop twelveinch shells you could build one now what you couldnt build was an engine that would make it go faster than a slow walkif it moved at all he was glad the reporters hadnt asked him anything about the new enemy machines he wouldnt have had much of an answer for them except to note that the confederates didnt seem to have very many how long would that last hit birmingham harder by air he wrote notes helped him remember the million things he had to do they were already dropping everything but the kitchen sink on the town have to throw that in too a large explosion stunned the air and his ears he ducked not that that would have done him any good had the blast been closer he hauled out his notebook again hit huntsville too he scribbled intelligence said the confederates made their rockets there not many of them had crashed down on atlanta yet but how long would that last not long enoughhe was dismally sure of it he was also sure he couldnt do a damn thing about the rockets except smash the factories that made them and the launchers that sent them on their way once they got airborne there was no defense if featherston had had them from the beginningthat would have been very bad he was content to leave the thought there neither side had all of what it needed when the war began part of what the war was about was finding out what you needed hed heard rumors that higherups in philadelphia were all excited about some fancy new explosive maybe that would end up meaning something and maybe it wouldnt theyd throw money and talent at it and see what happened next what else could they do another big boom rattled his nerves he didnt know if the enemy was working on superduper explosives the ordinary sort people had been using since the end of the last century seemed plenty good enough now he had to figure out what to do himself the reporter had given him his two basic choices he could keep his original plan of driving to the sea or swing west against birmingham and huntsville if the war department ordered him to go west he would he decided otherwise he wanted to cut the confederacy in half if the offensive in virginia came to something where would jake featherston run then and could the confederate west stand on its own for long without orders from richmondand without featherstons ferocious energy available to stiffen spines finding out would be interesting an aide stuck his head into the bedroom morrell was using for an office sir the mayor of atlanta would like to speak to you he would would he morrell said so he didnt run away with the confederate army i guess not sir well send him in then lets see what hes got to say for himself the mayor had gray hair and was skinny as a rail he introduced himself as andrew crowley when morrell asked him why he hadnt fled he answered i wanted to protect my people so i chose to remain he threw back his head a gesture straight out of a corny movie thats nice morrell said how many negroes are you protecting i was speaking of confederate citizens sir the mayor answered not of confederate residents one word made all the difference in the world they all look like people to me morrell said you dont understand the way we do things in this country crowley told him maybe i dont morrell allowed of course if you hadnt invaded mine i wouldnt be down here now since i am i have to tell you that murder looks a lot like murder no matter who you do it to i havent got a whole hell of a lot of sympathy for you mr mayor we did what the government in richmond told us to do crowley insisted dont see how you can go and flabble about that yeah sure now tell me you never once yelled freedom in all your born days andrew crowleys hollow cheeks turned red i he stopped maybe hed been about to deny it but how many people could give him the lieto say nothing of the horse laughif he tried heres whats going on morrell told him well try to keep your people from starving well try to keep them from coming down sick if they stay quiet well leave em alone if they dont well make em sorry shoot at a us soldier and well take twenty hostages and shoot em kill any us soldier and well take fifty hostages and shoot em kill a negro and its the same price got that is it plain enough for you youre as cruel and hard as the government warned us you would be crowley whined tough beans mr mayor was morrell enjoying himself playing the tyrant as a matter of fact he was your soldiers were every bit as sweet in ohio and pennsylvania only difference now is the shoes on the other foot hope you like the way it feels youve got to be kidding the mayor said fifty people for a worthless nigger if thats not a joke it ought to be chances are you dont need to worry about it much morrell said i bet youve taken most of yours off to be killed by now isnt that right even if it is the ideas ridic crowley broke off several words too late he went red again this time at what hed admitted by letting his mouth run free get out of my sight morrell said i dont think weve got much to say to each other you wouldnt like it if i told you what i thought just get out before i chuck you in the calaboose crowley got this probably wasnt the interview hed wanted to have morrell didnt intend to lose any sleep about that he went into the bathroom and washed his hands he wasnt pilate turning his back on the truth he knew it when he ran into it and its touch disgusted him he was glad he was only a soldier he didnt have to try to figure out how to administer captured cs territory on any longterm basis all he had to worry about was making sure the locals didnt give his men too much trouble the war department didnt care if he got rough doing it that suited him fine because the little hed seen south of the ohio inclined him to be gentle a long lifetime earlier this had been part of the country hed grown up in the country he served it wasnt any more nothing could be plainer than that attitudes toward the usa attitudes toward negroes jake featherston hadnt been in the saddle here for even ten years but the hatreds hed exploited and built on had been here long before he used them to such deadly effect you couldnt create those out of nothing without them the black rebellions during the great war wouldnt have had such lasting and terrible aftereffects did whites here have guilty consciences they had plenty to feel guilty about that was for sure if they didnt the csas negroes never would have launched uprisings almost surely doomed to fail will the confederates go on fighting for the next eighty years even if we wipe their country off the map that was morrells greatest dread and the greatest dread of everyone in the usa who thought about such things at all the mormons were bad canada gave every sign of being worse but the confederate states if these people stayed determined they could be an oozing sore for a long long time if the united states didnt wipe their country off the map wouldnt they start another big war in a generation and wouldnt that be even worse g eorge enos jr was a shellback you couldnt get to the sandwich islands from boston by sea without becoming a shellback that gave him the privilege of harrying the poor hapless polliwogs aboard the josephus daniels the sailors who hadnt crossed the equator before paid for the honor of swearing allegiance to king neptune the poor polliwogs got sprayed with saltwater from the hoses some of them were painted here and there with iodine the cook who doubled as a barber cut their hair in strange and appalling ways one rating who was inordinately proud of his handlebar mustache got half of it hacked off anyone who squawked got thumped too sid becker a chief petty officer who might have been the hairiest man george had ever seen played king neptune his mermaids had mop tops for wigs inflated condoms for breasts and some kind of padding to give them hips they also had hellacious five oclock shadows no doubt to emulate their sovereign polliwogs had to kiss each stubbly mermaid and then kiss king neptunes right big toe which was as hairy as the rest of him george and the other shellbacks whooped as they gave out what theyd taken when they were initiated into the fraternity of the sea sweetest of all as far as george was concerned was that myron zwilling was a polliwog king neptune didnt respect rank or anything else that was a big part of what made the ceremony what it was the exec did have the sense to know he couldnt complain about anything that happened to him he didnt have the sense to know he ought to look as if he were enjoying it he went through it with the air of a man who had no choice george wondered if he was noting who did what to him for payback later he wouldnt have been surprisedthat seemed like zwillings style after crossing the equator the ship got back to work keeping argentine beef and grain from getting across the atlantic and keeping the royal navy from interfering she could do the first on her own for the second she had help from a pair of escort carriers the irish sea and the oahu the limeys had carriers in these waters too if one sides airplanes found the otherthere would be a big brawl george was glad captain carsten gave the crews so much gunnery practice the more time he put in as a loader the faster he got the more shells the twin mm mount threw the better the chance it had of knocking down an enemy swordfish or spitfire before the airplane could perpetrate whatever atrocity its crew had in mind maybe even more than the other sailors in the gun crew george liked that idea they hadnt been attacked from the air when they couldnt shoot back he had having their own airplanes along enormously extended how far they could see a wireless call sent the flotilla steaming south after a convoy more than a hundred miles away the enemy freighters and their escorts would have got away if the baby flattops hadnt joined the destroyers and cruisers in the south atlantic keep an eye peeled for subs swede jorgenson warned as the josephus daniels picked up speed the new gun chief added be just like the limeys to have a couple traveling with the convoy just to fuck us over even though the destroyer escort had its fancy new hydrophone that struck george as good advice he scanned the blue water for a telltale periscope maybe it wouldnt help but it sure couldnt hurt he didnt want to die the way his father had he didnt want to die at all but especially not that way fighters and dive bombers streaked off the escort carriers these new carriers didnt seem to have torpedo airplanes aboard scuttlebutt said the brass had decided they were sitting ducks and dive bombers could do the job better reaching the enemy convoy took a while the oahu and the irish sea slowed down the rest of the us ships the baby flattops were no faster than any of their predecessors snails with flight decks jorgenson said scornfully yeah but theyre our snails with flight decks george answered and the crew chief grinned at him now hear this now hear this lieutenant zwilling said over the pa system our aircraft report one enemy destroyer sinking and one on fire the convoy is breaking up in flight that is all that was plenty to set sailors slapping one another on the back they steamed on then the josephus daniels and another destroyer escort pulled away from the ships that still stayed with the airplane carriers somethings going on jorgenson said do you think so sherlock marco angelucci said the new shelljerker laughed to take any sting from the words wish the exec or the skipper would tell us what george said hed hardly spoken before zwilling came on the pa again we are in pursuit of a pair of enemy freighters that broke north from the pack of ships in the convoy our purpose is the capture or incapacitation of these vessels boy the skipper wouldnt talk like that jorgenson said no kidding george said hed say something like were after two of the bastards whore trying to get away well take em or sink em the gun chief nodded wonder how come the exec doesnt talk like that cause he talks through his ass instead of his mouth angelucci suggested when the ship swung farther east george wondered why was a us airplane shadowing the freighters and wirelessing their moves back to the josephus daniels that was the only thing that made sense to him then he let out a catamount whoop his finger stabbed toward the horizon smoke he yelled before long the freighter making the smoke spotted the exhaust spewing from the josephus daniels funnels the other ship sheered away trying to run the destroyer escort was slow for a warship but had no trouble overhauling her the fourincher in the forward turret boomed sending a shot across her bow a moment later the argentine flag came down from the staff at the stern sailors along the rail waved whatever white rags and scraps of cloth they could get their hands on weve got her sam carstens voice boomed from the pa were going to put a prize crew aboard her and take her back up to the usa whatever shes carrying better we have it than the damn limeys a prize crew jorgenson laughed out loud thats something right out of pirateship days i wonder if the guys still get a share of what shes worth is that what they used to do george asked how do you know about that oldtime stuff theres this limey writer or i guess maybe hes an irishman anyway his names c s obrian he writes about fighting napoleon like youre there you think swabbies got it bad now you oughta read what it was like way back when loan me one george said and jorgenson nodded lieutenant zwilling came down from the bridge to choose the prize crew a chief came with him to serve out submachine guns to the men he picked if the sailors on the freighterher name was the sol del sudtried getting cute theyd be sorry all old shellbacks george remarked as the sailors crossed to the sol del sud you noticed that too eh jorgenson said now george nodded on one level it made sense men whod crossed the equator before likely had more experience than men whod been polliwogs only a few days earlier but wasnt the exec taking off men whod given him a hard time when he was getting initiated it sure looked that way to george as soon as the boats came back from the captured freighter the josephus daniels hurried off after the other ship shed been assigned damn lumbering scow couldntve got far george said she hadnt before long smoke came over the southeastern horizon again the destroyer escort had no trouble running her down again a shot crashed across her bow she was the tierra del fuego by looks a near twin to the sol del sud but her captain seemed more stubborn another shot from the fourincher thundered past her this one just in front of her bridge next one well hit you with carsten thundered over the pa the tierra del fuego struck her colors lieutenant zwilling pointed at george enos go aboard her he snapped the cpo handed george a tommy gun and several drums of ammo george said the only thing he could aye aye sir maybe theyd take her back to boston he could hope so anyhow but yeah the exec was clearing the destroyer escort of the people whod had too good a time when he suffered with the other polliwogs one of the rubberbreasted mermaids and king neptune himself were also in the prize crew the cpo held command when george told becker what was going on he shrugged and said i bet youre right but i dont care zwilling aint as smart as he thinks he is i bring this baby in all right maybe i go up through the hawse hole like the skipper only chance i goti sure as hell cant pass the goddamn exam lord knows ive tried when george got up on the tierra del fuegos deck he eyed the sailors standing there would they give trouble or were they just glad his ship hadnt sunk them any of you guys speak english he asked two men raised their handsthe skipper and a fellow with a lightningbolt patch on his sleeve the wireless man george thought i do the fellow said good tell your pals nobodys gonna hurt em as long as they do what we say george said theyll be pows in the usa and theyll go home after the war the wireless man rattled off some spanish a moment later one of the sailors from the josephus daniels knocked him down and yelled at him also in spanish any of these assholes says anything with puto or chinga or maricуn in it beat the shit out of him cause hes cussin you the sailor said they aint gonna dick around with us he spoke in spanish to the wouldbe interpreter then came back to english i told him to try it again only not to get cute this time a couple of men from the destroyer escorts black gang went below to look at the engines one of them came back up shaking his head theyre oilburnersshed make even more smoke if they werent he reported but theyre about as old as they can be and still burn oil aint no surprise she couldnt outrun us chief becker took charge of the pistol and the couple of shotguns in the tierra del fuegos arms locker dont look like she ever had anything more he said enough to try and put down a mutiny and thats about it at his orders the freighters sailors pointed her bow north and got her up to about eight knots she lumbered along george would rather have gone north aboard a fishing boat it would have bounced worse but it would have gone over the waves instead of trying to slice through them he didnt look forward to riding out a gale in this wallowing tub before long they recrossed the equator nobody asked whether any of the argentine sailors were polliwogs george didnt know whether the greasers talked about king neptune all he knew was that he had to keep an eye on them day followed day the chow on the tierra del fuego was different from what he would have eaten on the josephus danielsnot really better or worse but different he tried yerba matй tea the stuff wasnt bad better than he expected it had more kick than regular tea not so much as coffee if a british or confederate seaplane spotted them flying the stars and stripes they were history george tried not to think about that he blessed the fogs and mists that shrouded the tierra del fuego as she got farther north they made navigation harder but she was going by the seat of her pants anyway when she came closer to the us coast no doubt shed get an escort for the last leg of her journey shed need one too in the meantimein the meantime it was just the ship and the sea for george that wasnt so bad r ichmond the front was richmond in the bunker under the ruins of the gray house jake featherston shook his fist toward the north and cursed a god who seemed to be cursing him and the csa ever since the war started people were saying that whoever could do two big things at once would win the confederacy had never managed it neither had the damnyankeestill now they were still going great guns down in georgia and they were pushing out of the wilderness and heading straight for the confederate capital us artillery hadnt fallen on richmond yet the ground between the rapidan and the capital was likely the most heavily fortified stretch on the face of the earth if the yankees came they had to come that way both sides knew it whatever artifice could do to stop them artifice had done but along with artifice the confederate states needed menmen they didnt have too many soldiers had died in the great war too many had died or gone off into captivity in ohio and especially pennsylvania this time around and too many were doing everything they could to fight the usa farther south that left a lot of the bunkers and gun emplacements between the rapidan and richmond nothing more thanwhat did the bible call them whited sepulchers that was it featherston jumped when the telephone rang he picked it up yeah he said harshly lord halifax on the line sir lulu said put him through jake said at once was a rat deserting the sinking ship mr president that plummy british accent whats up jake asked the ambassador if halifax was bailing out hed put a flea in the bastards ear all right i have some papers you may perhaps be interested in seeing the british ambassador said well bring em on over then jake told him he was so relieved that halifax was staying put he couldnt refuse him anything when halifax got there it gave jake an excuse to throw out nathan bedford forrest iii he didnt want to listen to the chief of the general staff anyhow forrest was too gloomy to be worth listening to by the noises he made he feared richmond would fall even if that was true jake didnt want to hear it so he bundled forrest out and brought in the ambassador instead whats up he asked again lord halifax opened his fancy attachй case buttery leather polished till it gleamed with clasps that looked like real gold he pulled out a document held together with a fat paper clip here you are mr president i honestly didnt believe they would turn these loose but they did you must have made an even more favorable impression on the prime minister than i thought he does admire apurposeful man no doubt of that jake featherston hardly heard him he was flipping through the papers he didnt understand more than one word in ten and he didnt understand any of the math but he knew the word uranium when he saw it and he knew about element even if the limeys were calling it churchillium and not jovium did your scientists name it after winston because its supposed to make a big boom when it goes off he asked with a sly grin officially its a compliment to his office we call mosleyium after the minister of war halifax replied unofficiallywell i shouldnt wonder if youre right ill get this to our people who can use it just as quick as i can jake said and i want you to thank winston for me from the bottom of my heart what he did here it means a lot to the country and it means a lot to me personally he found your point about the need to continue the struggle against the united states by any means necessary alarmingly persuasive lord halifax said if you fail britain is most dismally surrounded by the yankees and the huns how close are you to getting one of these bombs jake asked the british ambassador shrugged narrow shoulders havent the foggiest im afraid were i not ambassador to a country also taking part in this research i doubt i should know there is any such thing as uranium mmmakes sense featherston allowed that was the only reason the confederate envoys in london and paris knew about uranium and what you might be able to do with it but they hadnt been able to pry anything out of england or france he damn well had will you be able to hold richmond sir halifax asked hope so jake said but even if we dont well keep fighting as long as weve got a punchers chance well hang on and with thishe tapped the document with a nicotinestained forefingerwe do very good the british ambassador said but he meant it the way limeys did so it might have been all right he didnt mean it was very good just that hed heard i shall convey your determination to london bombing is picking up there im afraid though its not so bad as here damn squareheads have airfields closer to you now jake said lord halifax looked like a man whod just sat on a tack but was too polite to mention it featherston knew why he hadnt beendiplomatic well too bad he thought hed told the truth hadnt he hed told the truth all the time while he roseit looked that way to him anyhow he didnt see any point to stopping now and he was telling the truth again the kaisers forces had bundled the british out of northwestern germany out of holland and back into belgium they were threatening ypresuniversally pronounced wipers by englishspeakersagain as they had in the great war when it fell then it was a sign that the entente couldnt hold on against the central powers if it fell this time around it would be another verse of the same song we are doing everything in our power to deny them the use of those air bases halifax said sure sure jake nodded and smiled he probably should have kept his mouth shut even if he did tell the truth didnt he owe halifax that much the ambassadorand his government of coursehad come through for the confederacy in a big way between us your lordship sir well lick the bad guys yet between us yes and the french and the russians will have something to say about it as well lord halifax grimaced again i worry about the russians failure the last time around cost them the ukraine and finland and poland and the baltic states and a red insurrection at least as unpleasant as yours he was being diplomatic the tsars fight against the reds had been bigger and bloodier than anything the csa went through after a pause to light a habana he continued theyre wavering again i fear when they couldnt beat the germans or even the austriansif they go out heaven only knows what sort of upheaval will follow hell with that featherston said if they go out now you and france get the shaft the kaiser can pull everything away from the east and shoot it all at you quite british reserve had its uses lord halifax got as much mileage from one softspoken word as jake would have from five minutes of cussing he rose and held out an elegantly manicured hand always a pleasure mr president i do hope the document proves valuable to you im sure it will be ill know just how valuable by this time tomorrow jake thought as he shook it aloud he went on englands always been the best friend the confederacy has we know that and we never forget it one more time the truth english recognition in english forcing of the us blockade had ensured the confederacys independence english help during the second mexican war made sure the csa got to keep chihuahua and sonora even if an invasion of the usa from canada came to grief in montana well the confederate states of america paid their debts to the uk in this time no debt was involved both countries wanted revenge against the enemies whod beaten them and remembering alliances past didnt mean you had to do anything but remember jake understood that perfectly well did lord halifax no doubt he was twisty as a snake as soon as the british ambassador bowed his way out featherston summoned a courier the bright young lieutenant saluted freedom freedom jake echoed he handed the man the british document get these pages photographed as soon as youve done that haul ass to washington university in lexington and deliver them to professor fitzbelmont yes sir the courier hesitated if its such a tearing hurry sir why wait for the photography because this has to get through jake answered even if something happens to youeven if the damnyankees roast you like a barbecued porkerfitzbelmont has to get it so we make a copy before we send you off all right sir i understand good tell the fellow in the photo lab to call me as soon as he does what he needs to do with this document jake intended to take no chances whatever yes sir the lieutenant said again he saluted and hurried away he didnt even need to leave the armored underground compartment to find a photographic technician anything that had to do with running a country you could do here now he would have some idea of what was going on in lexington so would the man who photographed the pages that worried jake less than it would have a few months before if one of them reported to the damnyankeeswell so what the united states already knew the confederate states were working on a uranium bomb the united states knew where too otherwise they wouldnt have started pounding the crap out of lexington if they knew the limeys were helping out how did that change things didnt it just give them a brandnew worry it looked that way to jake featherston the courier hadnt been gone more than a couple of minutes before the telephone on his desk jangled again he eyed it the way a man in the woods might eye a rattler with a buzzing tail unlike a man in the woods he couldnt walk away from it no matter how much he wished he could he picked it up featherston herewhat the hell do you mean theyre over the north anna hed expected bad newsthat was the kind that got to the president in a hurry he hadnt expected news this bad though how the devil did they do that which dumbshit general had his thumb up his ass to let emjesus christ they cant have that much armorcan they he sounded worried even to himself that was no good you needed to sound calm evenno especiallywhen you werent he gave orders to try to stem the greengray tide the damnyankees couldnt shell richmond yet no but it wouldnt be long if they kept going like this over the north anna son of a bitch jake muttered after he hung up he started looking at the maps on his office walls in a new way richmond really might fall and if it did he needed somewhere else to go a place from which he could keep fighting till fitzbelmont and the rest of the high foreheads came through hed never thought it would come to this hed figured the united states would roll over and show their yellow belly when he cut them in half when that didnt happen hed been sure losing pittsburgh would make them quit when they didnt lose pittsburghabout then he realized he had a tiger by the tail cant let go he thought and the yankees had a tiger by the tail too if they didnt know that yet they would he nodded to himself they sure as hell would no matter where he had to do it from hed make them pay for every single thing theyd done to his country hed make them pay plenty a rmstrong grimes was happy as a clam in a country where theyd never heard of chowder along with the rest of his platoon he tramped east toward the savannah river and the sea theyd told lieutenant bassler the confederates didnt have a whole hell of a lot in front of them so far they looked to be right keep your eyes peeled though he warned the men in his squad dont want to get your nuts shot off doing something dumb shit sarge i dont want to get my nuts shot off doing something smart squidface said youve got a point armstrong said now put a hat on it the pfc flipped him off he gave back the bird when he took over the squad the men had been wary about him theyd come through a lot together and they werent about to trust somebody from the reppledepple till they saw he deserved it by now armstrong had paid his dues and then some he was part of the life of the platoon somebody to razz and somebody to put them through their paces they followed his orders not just because he had three stripes but because theyd seen he had a halfway decent notion of what he was doing up ahead a confederate machine gun chattered that tearingsailcloth noise sobered people in a hurry men kind of hunched down to make themselves into smaller targets they moved away from one another to make a burst less likely to take out several of them at once armstrong did all that himself too before he even thought about it he knew his trade the same as the other guys did most of them did anyhow a couple were new men fresh out of the replacement depot a tall gangly kid called herk had taken whiteys place he stared around in mild surprise when the soldiers around him spread out then a bullet cracked past his head he knew what that meant all right and awkwardly dropped to the ground you gotta move fastern that man armstrong told him otherwise youll damn well stop one and i aint got time to nursemaid you ill try sarge herk was willing he was just unskilled sure armstrong swallowed a sigh hed hit it all righthe couldnt nursemaid the replacements in a perfect world they would have joined the unit when it got taken out of the line so the veterans got to know them a little bit here it was baptism by total immersion experienced soldiers shied away from the new guys raw men didnt just get themselves maimed and killed they also brought trouble down on their comrades because the confederates who aimed at them also hit guys near them if they made it through a couple of weeks of action they learned the ropes and turned into decent soldiers a lot of them didnt though not too many confederates stood in front of armstrongs platoon right now the ones who did knew their business the only new confederate soldiers were the ones whod been too young for conscription when the war started from the ground herk asked we gonna go after that machine gun sarge not if we can find a barrel or a mortar team to do it for us armstrong answered we want to lick these fuckers yeah but we dont want to pay too much while were doing it now you hope the lieutenant feels the same way squidface said his grin half sly half resigned bet your ass i do armstrong could hope anyhow lieutenant bassler had pretty good senseas far as lieutenants went he didnt think he had an infinite supply of soldiers to do whatever he thought needed doing and he didnt send his men anywhere he wouldnt go himself things could have been worse and they rapidly got that way that rising howl in the air wasnt artillery it was even worse screaming meemies squidface yelled while armstrong was still sucking in wind to shout the same thing everybody who wasnt already on the ground threw himself flat armstrong got out his entrenching tool and started digging like a madman the salvo of rockets shrieked home before hed thrown up more than a shovelful of red dirt a couple of dozen of them slammed down within a few seconds armstrong got picked up and thrown around while chunks of jagged iron whined through the air whether he lived or died wasnt up to him it was just luck one way or the other he hated that more than anything else about combat sometimes whether you were a good soldier didnt matter worth a dime when he came down and stopped rolling he looked around there was herk blood running from his nose but otherwise seeming all right there was squidface who hadnt even lost his cigarette andthere was zeb the hats head attached to one shoulder and not much else the rest of what was probably his body lay thirty yards away herk got a good look at that and lost his breakfast armstrong had already seen a lot of bad things but his stomach wanted to empty out too squidfaces lips silently shaped the word fuck or maybe he said it out loud armstrong slowly realized he wasnt hearing very much squidface said something else armstrong shrugged and pointed to his ears the pfc nodded he came over and bellowed he was a hell of a good guy yeah armstrong shouted back he was that was about as much of a memorial as zeb the hat got armstrong dragged his two pieces together so graves registration would know they went with each other the surviving soldiers helped themselves to zebs ammunition and ration canshe didnt need them any more armstrong took out his wallet and found his real name was zebulon fischer and that he was from beloit wisconsin the billfold held only a couple of bucks had he had a real roll armstrong would have sent that to his next of kin more shrieks in the air announced another salvo of rockets armstrong went flat again these screaming meemies came down off to the left not all around him he had more of a chance to dig in and used it the confederates in this part of georgia didnt seem inclined to let us soldiers come any farther after the rockets slammed down armstrong breathed a sigh of relief nothing bad had happened to him or his men then shouts came from the left he needed a little while to make out what people were saying the first salvo really had pounded the crap out of his hearing after a while though he got the message lieutenant bassler was wounded he swore god only knew what kind of halfassed new man the reppledepple would cough up then somebody said looks like youre in charge of the platoon sergeant what the hell armstrong said two of the other three sergeants were senior to him yeah you are the soldier insisted same goddamn rocket got borkowski and wise one of ems deadlooks like the other onell lose a foot shit armstrong had got a platoon before and the same wayeverybody above him got wounded or killed that was the only way a threestriper could command a platoonor if enough things went wrong a company he didnt really want the honor as usual nobody cared what he wanted what are we gonna do the news bringer asked something not far from panic in his voice we stay here featherstons fuckersll just keep pounding the shit out of us tell me about it armstrong said unhappily the confederates would be loading up more screaming meemies right this minute if he ordered a retreat his own superiors would tear the stripes off his sleeve theyd call him a coward and he wouldnt be able to prove them wrong which leftwe gotta move up they would have to take out that machine gun now like it or not he didnt but he was stuck squidface came to the same unwelcome conclusion that goddamn guns gonna have to go uhhuh armstrong nodded youve got the squad for now fuck of a way to get it squidface said but then he nodded too you dont want the platoon either do you not like this armstrong answered keep the guys spread out and watch that herk for chrissake hell get his ass shot off before he knows whats what i aint his goddamn babysitter for cryin out loud after a moment squidface nodded again well ill try armstrong hadnt gone very far before he realized the machinegun emplacement could murder the whole platoon it had an unobstructed field of fire to the west no way in hell would they be able to sneak up on it he yelled for the wireless man and got on the horn to regimental hq this is grimes in charge of gold platoon charlie company we need a couple of barrels to knock out a nest at square uh b some uniformed clerk well back of the line asked what happened to whatshisname uh bassler hes down ive got it armstrong growled you gonna get me what i need or do i have to come back there and tear you a new asshole keep your hair on buddy replied the fellow back at headquarters well see what we can do that wasnt enough to keep armstrong happynot even close yet another barrage of screaming meemies roared in they were mostly long but not very long armstrong damn near pissed himself he knew plenty of guys who had you didnt rag on them much not if you had any sense it could happen to you half an hour later after still more rocketsagain mostly longthe barrels showed up without getting out of the foxhole hed dug armstrong pointed them toward the machinegun nest they clattered forward the machine gun opened up on them which did exactly no good there was no place for advancing us soldiers to hide that also meant there was no place for cs soldiers with stovepipe antibarrel rockets to hide the barrels shelled the machinegun nest into silence lets go armstrong hustled to catch up with the barrels so did his men anyone whod been in action for even a little while knew armor made a hell of a lifeinsurance policy for infantrymen it could take care of things that stymied foot soldiersand it drew fire that would otherwise come down on their heads and the ground pounders were good for barrel crews life expectancy too they kept bad guys with stovepipes and featherston fizzes from sneaking close enough to be dangerous barrels that got too far out in front of the infantry often had bad things happen to them before anybody could do anything about it come on herk armstrong yelled looking back over his shoulder and seeing that the new guy wasnt moving fast enough shake a leg goddammit im coming sarge yeah herk was willing but he didnt understand why armstrong wanted him to hurry up he wasnt urgent and he wasnt alert with the best will in the world he was asking for trouble armstrong figured hed buy a piece of a plotor maybe a whole onebefore he figured out what was what too damn bad really but what could you do meanwhile the confederates with the screaming meemies were still lobbing them where the us soldiers had been not where they were now before long the rocketeers would find out theyd goofedwith luck when the barrels put shells or machinegun bullets through them armstrong trotted on he heard a few bursts from up ahead but nothing really bad the bastards in butternut all carried automatic weapons nothing you could do about that but if there werent enough of them what they carried didnt matter and right here there werent w hen sam carsten thought of prize crews he thought about pigtailed sailors with cutlasses boarding sailing ships wooden ships and iron men but the josephus daniels was shorthanded because a couple of freighters that would have gone to england or france were bound for the usa instead sam gave lieutenant zwilling the conn so he could straighten out some of the complications detaching men had caused he was talking with a damagecontrol partydamage control being something about which he knew more than hed ever wanted to learnwhen wally eastlake a cpo whod played one of king neptunes mermaids when the destroyer escort crossed the equator sidled up to him and said talk to you for a second skipper when a chief wanted to talk listening was a good idea sure sam said whats on your mind instead of answering right away eastlake drew himself out of earshot of the damagecontrol party a couple of snoopy sailors started to follow but the chief s basilisk stare made them keep their distance in a low voice eastlake said notice anything funny about the prize crews the exec took for those argentine pigs not a whole lot sam answered mostly guys whove been in for a while but thats more good than bad you ask me you need men with some experience when they go off on their own if that was all sure eastlake said but the guys whore gone theyre the ones who busted a gut laughing when he stopped being a polliwog id be gone myself i bet except i was holding it in and busting up where it didnt show swelp me skipper its the gods truth he drew a cross on his chest oh yeah sam said swelp me the chief said again carsten thought about it he hadnt had much to do with the festivities they were designed to let ratings get their own back even if the captain just watched it dampened the fun but he also had a pretty good notion of whod enjoyed themselves most at myron zwillings expenseand whod had reasons for enjoying themselves eastlake was rightan awful lot of those people werent on the ship any more son of a bitch sam said softly yeah eastlake said i didnt think you noticedyou got bigger shit to worry about but i figured you oughta know thanksi guess now sam had to decide what to do about it or whether to do anything at all zwilling could deny everything and say he hadnt done it consciously how would you prove he was lying for that matter maybe he wasnt or he could say he damn well had done it and so what you think i shoulda kept my big trap shut eastlake asked no id rather know whats going on sam answered ill take care of it the cpo nodded he didnt ask sam how hed take care of it which was a good thing because sam still didnt know when he got back to the bridge the exec was keeping station with the other warships in the flotilla zwilling was competent precise painstaking the tip of his tongue stuck out of the corner of his mouth as if he were a gradeschooler working on a big paper hed never be the shiphandler pat cooley was he was plenty good enough to get the job done though chances were he was better than sam whod come to the wheel late whether hed be better in an emergency when instinct and balls could count for more than carefully acquired skill was a different question anything interesting going on sam asked no sir all routine zwilling answered all right in that case why dont you let thad have it for a bit sam nodded toward the yranging officer he can use the practice you never know what could happen if a british fighter or bomber chews up the bridge aye aye sir zwilling stepped away from the wheel lieutenant walters took it a wide grin making him look even younger than he did most of the time carsten gestured to the exec come to my cabin why dont you yes he was going to take the bull by the horns he didnt know what else to do of course sir zwillings eyes narrowed he knew something was up but he couldnt very well say no the cabin small for one man was crowded with two but with the door closed it was about the only place on the destroyer escort that offered reasonable privacy sam sat down on the bed and waved the exec to the metal chair saying ive got a question for you sir zwilling didnt show much well with a superior getting ready to grill him sam would have shown as little as he could too when you picked prize crews for those freighters we nabbed how did you go about it zwilling still didnt show much he would have made a pretty fair poker player and probably did i mostly chose men with aboveaverage experience sir theyll be on their own going north theyll need to be extra alert for enemy action and for trouble from the sailors new fish are less likely to do well in a situation like that i see sam would have said the same thing it was even likely to be true but it wasnt likely to be the whole truth with a sigh sam went on did you also choose men who gave you a hard time when we crossed the equator now the exec knew which way the wind was blowing his mouth tightened he hunched in on himself just a little but his answer was forthright yes sir were better off without some of those troublemakers on board that was a criterion of mine too thinking about the men who were gone sam shook his head they mostly arent troublemakers mr zwilling they have good records they may not love you but thats not the same thing by zwillings scowl it was to him theyre bad for discipline sir im not sorry to be rid of them im sorry you used personal dislikes to influence what you did carsten said if i were you i wouldnt do that again im disappointed you did it once if youre unhappy with me sir may i request a transfer off this ship zwilling asked you need to have confidence in your executive officer he didnt say anything about his needing to have confidence in sam that would have been insubordinate and he was a stickler for the proprieties but it hovered in his tone and in the way he eyed carsten with another sigh sam nodded yes i think thatll be best for everyone this wont go in your papers you didnt do anything against regulations but you did something i dont fancy and i wont try to tell you any different is that all sir the execs voice might have come from a machine yes thats all go take the conn back as far as the ship was concerned zwilling was fine with the sailors on the other handand with me too sam thought sadly there were skippers for whom myron zwilling would have been the perfect exec men who did things strictly by the book themselves would have been wild for him but sam flew by the seat of his pants that drove zwilling nuts and the execs insistence on routine grated on the mustang just as much sam followed zwilling back to the bridge when the exec said i have the conn mr walters the yranging officer almost jumped out of his skin sam didnt blame him zwilling didnt sound like a machine any more he sounded like a voice from beyond the grave christ sam thought now alarmed i hope he doesnt go hang himself from the first pipe fitting he finds he didnt want the exec dead only off his ship and onto one where he fit better thad walters retreated in a hurry his eyes asked sam what had happened in the cabin sam couldnt tell him even in private that would have been monstrously unfair to zwilling then sam shook his head it wouldnt be so simple after all even now people would be buzzing that chief eastlake had talked with him and they would know all too soon that he and the exec had talked in his cabin they would add two and two sure as hell and when zwilling left the ship eastlake would be a power to reckon with indeed that wasnt good you didnt want the crew thinking a cpo could hang an officer out to dry even more to the point you didnt want a cpo thinking he could hang an officer out to dry in this particular case it happened to be true which only made things worse sam shook his head again eastlake would have to go too that wasnt fair but he didnt see that he had any other choice he wished for word of an enemy convoy he almost wished for word of enemy aircraft on the way in anything that took his mind off the ships internal politics would have been nice but no enemy freighters came into sight the sky remained clear of everything but the sun the only thing he had to worry about was myron zwilling steering the josephus daniels with a face that looked as if he were watching his family tortured and killed was i too hard on him sam wondered he played back the conversation in his cabin inside his head he really didnt think so the only other thing he could have done was pretend he didnt know anything about what zwilling had pulled and that wouldnt fly because chief eastlake would let the crew know hed told sam what was going on their respect would get flushed right down the head and so would sams selfrespect hed never been any damn good at pretending oh sometimes you had to if you were dealing with a superior you couldnt stand a little constructive hypocrisy didnt hurt but that was about as far as he could make himself go ignoring this would have felt like ignoring a bank robbery right under his nose lieutenant walters took a long look at his yranging gear the screens must have been blank for he stepped away from them and over to sam in a low almost inaudible voice he asked sir whats going on sam glanced at lieutenant zwilling the exec didnt turn around did his back stiffen though was he listening it didnt matter any which way sam said what he would have said if zwilling were down in the engine room nothing thats got anything to do with you yes sir the yranging officer nodded but he didnt go back to his post instead he asked is it anything that will hurt the ship zwillings ravaged voice and face made that query much too reasonable but sam didnt think he was lying when he shook his head no well be all right he said its he stopped even saying something like its a personnel matter went too far were he in the execs place he wouldnt want anybody running his mouth about him just let it go thad itll sort itself out i hope so sir walters returned to his post hed needed nerve to make even that much protest muttering to himself sam turned away he didnt like the idea of blighting zwillings career he hadnt liked it back in new york city and he liked it even less here but try as he would he didnt see what else he could do zwilling had made his bed now he had to lie in it and what will the fancypants officers back in the usa think about me when they get wind of this sam wondered now that hed been a lieutenant for a while he wanted to make lieutenant commander that would be pretty damn good for somebody who started out an ordinary seaman would the men who judged such things decide he could have handled this better after worrying at it and worrying about it for a couple of minutes he shrugged the ship had to come first if the brass hats didnt care for what hed done hed retire a lieutenant and the world wouldnt end when he first signed up even cpo had seemed a mountain taller than the rockies but hed climbed a lot higher than that so hed go on doing things the way he thought he needed to and if anybody away from the josephus daniels didnt like it too damn bad t he telephone on jefferson pinkards desk jangled he picked it up this is pinkard hello pinkard said the voice on the other end of the line this is ferd koenig in richmond what can i do for you sir jeff asked the attorney general adding glad to hear you still are in richmond from some of the things the papers were saying the capital was in trouble since the papers always told less than what was really going on hed worried were still here we arent going anywhere either koenig said as if to contradict him something in the background blew up with a roar loud enough to be easily audible even over the telephone he went on well lick the damnyankees yet you see if we dont yes sir jeff said though hed already seen all the war he wanted and more besides in snyder coming east to humble was a wonderful escape us warplanes hardly ever appeared over the city of houston far far away from the damnyankee abortion of a state that carried the same name and had never been seen over this peaceful town twenty miles north of it wait till we get all our secret weapons into the fight koenig said were already throwing those rockets at the usa and weve finally got new barrels thatll make their best ones say uncle bigger and better things in the works too sure hope so from everything pinkard could see the confederate states needed bigger and better things if they stood a chance of winning believe it the presidents promised well have em and he keeps his word ferdinand koenig sounded absolutely convinced despite yet another big boom in the distance he went on but theres something i need from you of course there is you wouldnt have called me if there wasnt jeff thought aloud all he said was tell me what i want you to go through your guards anybody whos fit enough to fight put him on a train for little rock well take it from there the attorney general said everybody whos fit enough to fight pinkard asked in dismay thats what i said sir you know a lot of my guys are from the confederate veterans brigades jeff said those were men the cs army had already judged not fit to fight mostly because of wounds from the great war yes i understand that sort through them too some of emll probably dowe arent as fussy as we used to be koenig said but youve got plenty of congressmens nephews and party officials brothersinlaw come on pinkardwe both know how that shit works but we cant afford it any more shall i get on the train myself then jeff asked reckon i still know which end of a rifles which dont be dumb koenig told him weve got to keep the camp running thats damn important too way things are though we need every warm body we can get our hands on at the front well ill do what i can sir jeff said i reckoned you would the attorney general replied freedom the line went dead freedom jeff echoed as he hung up too once the handpiece was back in the cradle he added one more word shit he wondered how few guards he could get away with sending the men on the womens side sure they wouldnt be a problem he could always replace them with dykes plenty of tough broads ready to send negro women to the bathhouses plenty of tough broads eager to do it and if some of them ate pussy in the meantimewell hell as long as the colored gals got what was coming to them sooner or later jeff supposed he could look the other way in the meantime yeah lezzies were disgusting but there was a war on and you had to take the bad with the good losing guards from the mens side would hurt more he couldnt bring female guards over here some of them the butch ones would have liked it but it would stir up trouble among the coons if he tried it and it would stir up more trouble among his men so hed have to do some pruning and then live with personnel being gone congressmens nephews party bigwigs brothersinlaw sure he had some guys like that he didnt want to get rid of all of them they were the young the healthy the quick here you couldnt run a camp with a bunch of old farts who couldnt get out of their own waycould you he hoped he wouldnt have to find out and feared he would he got on the intercom and then on the pa system to summon vern green to his office the guard chief got there about fifteen minutes later whats up sir pinkard told him what was up he looked disgusted when he heard well for gods sake they reckon our boys gonna win the damn war all by their lonesome beats me jeff answered but when the attorney general tells you you got to do this and that you cant very well say no green looked more disgusted yet but he nodded ill ask around he said maybe we can fix it he had his own back channels to richmond someone in the capital would be keeping an eye on jeff for the government or the party or both usually that made the guard chief the camp commandants rival they both wanted to pull in the same direction today though yeah you do that jeff said but dont hold your breath war news is bad enough theyll be grabbing anybody they can get their hands on uhhuh green said they both had to be careful when they talked about how things were going either could report the other for defeatism but they couldnt afford to pretend they were blind either if the news were better richmond wouldnt be prying men loose wherever it could the guard chief went on you got a roster handy sure do jeff spread papers out on his desk ive made some marks already green looked at them he nodded what youve got makes sense we can always come up with guards in skirts for the womens side just what i was thinkin pinkard agreed the ones over here thoughthats gonna be a bastard bastard and a half even yeah the guard chief nodded again some of these guysll bawl like castrated colts when you tell em they got to go and fight the damnyankees some of their fathersll bawl even louder tell me about it jeff said with a wry grin but i know what to do about that damned if i dont ill just say you want to squawk dont you come squawkin to me go squawk to ferd koenig on account of he gave the orders me im only doin like he said vern green smiled a slow conspiratorial smile aint gonna be a whole lot o folks with the brass to try that hell i wouldnt jeff said i know when im fightin out of my weight anybody who wants to take a swing at it well good luck he peered through his reading glasses at the roster lets see how we can finish this off and still have enough left to do our jobs here neither of them ended up happy about what they came up with but they both agreed camp humble could go on reducing population without the guards theyd ship to little rock then they wrangled about who would announce the transfers jeff wanted the guard chief to do it green insisted the words had to come out of the commandants mouth in they end they split the difference pinkard would announce the attorney generals order while green read the names of the men who would go to little rock even assembling the guards was tricky like any soldiers or bureaucrats the men knew a break in routine was suspicious to them change was anything but good and they started yelling their heads off when jeff announced that ferd koenig required some of them to go to the front shut up pinkard yelled and his bellow was enough to rock them back on their heels and make sure they damn well did shut up at least for a little while into that sudden startled silence he went on yall reckon i want to do this youre out of your goddamn minds if you do you reckon ive got any choice youre just as crazy if you think so and a lot stupidern i figured you were we wont go somebody yelled and other guards took up the cry oh yes you will jeff said grimly i dont believe you catch on you aint just fuckin with me people yall are fuckin with ferd koenig and jake featherston and the freedom party and the confederate government youll end up in the stockade and then theyll ship your sorry asses to the front any which way and if you dont end up in a penal battalion for raising a ruckus then i dont know shit about how things work and i damn well do a shudder ran through the guards they didnt want to go to the front as soldiers that was nasty and dangerous but if you went to the front in a penal battalion you were nothing but dead meat that hadnt got cooked yet and they threw you straight into the fire you still talkin about not goin jeff asked nobody said anything this time he nodded in something approaching satisfaction thats more like it maybe yall aint as dumb as you look after all hell you go and mutiny maybe they dont send you to the front at all maybe they just line you up and shoot you he waited for another shudder and got it then he went on vern herell read out the names of the men whore going to little rock you hear your name be ready to ship out tomorrow at you aint ready you got more troublen you know what to do with i promise vern one by one the guard commander read the list of names some men who got called jerked as if shot for a few or more than a few that was bound to be anticipation others cursed green or the freedom party and still others reacted with complete disbelief you cant do this to me one of them cried do you know whose cousin i am you aint ferd koenigs cousin and you aint jake featherstons cousin either jefferson pinkard said in a voice like iron and as long as you aint it dont matter for shit whose cousin you are you got it you cant talk to me that way exclaimed the guard with the prominentbut not prominent enoughcousin no seems like i just did jeff answered you can get on the train tomorrow morning or you can go to the stockade now and get on another train after that you just bet your ass you wont be happy if you do though the cousin said not another word green went back to reading names he got more howls of protest some guards did some virtuoso cussing but nobody else said he wouldnt go nobody else said he had a relative important enough to keep him from going either as far as jeff was concerned that was progress he waited with the shivering guards the next morning all but two of them were there those two had skipped camp theyd be the military polices worry from now on he figured the mps would track them down and make them sorry the train pulled in right on time snorting up in the beginnings of morning twilightsunup was still a ways away doors opened glumly the guards climbed up and into the passenger cars when theyd all boarded the train chugged off its light was dim even here lights could draw us airplanes you didnt want to take chances you didnt have to after the train pulled away jeff went to the kitchen for fried eggs biscuits and gravy and coffee hed done his duty he wasnt happy about it but hed done it pretty soon camp humble would start doing its duty again too even with a reduced guard contingent the camp would keep on working toward making the confederate states negrofree that was damned important work jeff was proud to have a part in it he just wished the damnyankees and the war wouldnt keep interfering vi l ieutenantcolonel jerry dover didnt have atlanta to kick around any more the senior supply officers there couldnt make his life miserable any more theyd either fled or died or were languishing in us pow camps the stars and stripes flew over the capital of georgia and so and soalabama dover had never figured he would have to try to fight the damnyankees from alabama now he could scream at huntsville for not getting him what he needed it was less fun than screaming at atlanta had been the chief quartermaster officer in huntsville was a brigadier general named cicero sawyer he sent dover anything he had when he didnt send it he didnt have it dover could complain about that but sawyer complained about it too anything that comes from virginia and the carolinas forget it he told dover on a crackling telephone line they cant get it here why not dover demanded weve still got augusta weve still got savannah weve still got shipping damnyankees cant sink every freighter in the goddamn country reckon the big reason is all the shit thats going on up in virginia right now sawyer said they want to hang on to every damn thing they can so they can go and shoot it at the yankees there yeah well if they forget this is part of the country too pretty soon it wont be any more dover said lets see how they like that i know sawyer said wearily ive got two worries myself i got to keep the soldiers suppliedthat means you and ive got to keep the rocket works going were hurting the usa with those things damned if were not thats nice dover said in the meantime i need boots and i need raincoats and i need ammo for automatic rifles and submachine guns when the hell you gonna get that stuff for me well i can send you the ammunition brigadier general sawyer answered that comes out of birmingham so its no problem the other stuffmm maybe i can get some of it from new orleans maybe if you dont im gonna have men coming down with pneumonia dover said boots wear out dammit and they start to rot when its wet like it is now the guys who have shelter halves are wearing them for rain hoods but they arent as good as the real thing sawyer sighed ill try dover thats all i can tell you you arent the only dumpmaster yelling his head off at me remember why am i not surprised dover hung up with the last word dumpmaster was a word that fit him much too well right now his supply depot was small and shabby the nearest town edwardsville was even smaller and shabbier close to a hundred years earlier edwardsville had been a boom town for there was gold nearby then the mother lode in california shot the little alabama gold rush right behind the ear some of the fancy houses built in edwardsvilles firstand lastflush of prosperity still stood closed and gray and grim well pete asked when dover hung up he promised us the ammo dover told the veteran quartermaster sergeant as far as the rest of it goes were screwed not us we got the shit for ourselves pete said supply officers and noncoms lived well that was a perquisite of the job pete went on its the poor bastards a few miles east of here who get the wrong end of the stick jerry dover nodded unhappily in the last war the average confederate soldier had been about as well supplied as his yankee counterpart through the first couple of years of this fight the same held true but the confederate states were starting to come apart at the seams and the men were paying for it ammos great pete went on what if everybodys too damn hungry and sick to use it though i already told you dover answered in that case were screwed he looked around to make sure nobody but pete could hear before adding and were liable to be off to the northwest lay huntsville where the rockets came from off to the west lay birmingham where anything made of iron or steel came from off to the east lay damnyankees who knew that much too well when they got ready to push west could they go right on through the confederates standing in their way although dover hoped not he wouldnt have bet against it how many niggers in these parts pete asked not quite out of a clear blue sky well i dont exactly know dover answered i dont think ive seen any but there could be some skulking around like could be yeah i bet there are pete said i bet they get one look at what all we got here then they light out to tell the yankees i bet youre right we saw it often enough farther east dover said maybe we ought to do some hunting in the woods around here he remembered too well the black raiders whod plundered his dump in georgia maybe we should pete grinned i aint been coon hunting since i was a kid heh dover made himself grin back hed heard jokes like that too many times to think they were very funny but he didnt want to hurt petes feelings the hunt was no joke jerry dover feared it was also no success he couldnt get any frontline troops to join in which meant he had to do it with his own men men from the quartermaster corps they could fight if they had to they were soldiers theyd had to a couple of times when us forces broke the lines in front of them they hadnt disgraced themselves but there was a big difference between a standup fight and hunting down negroes who didnt want to get caught or even get seen regular troops probably would have had a hard time doing that it was more than the men from the supply dump could manage they might have made the blacks shift around they caught no one and killed no one the days only casualty was a corporal who sprained his ankle that evening birmingham caught hell the bombers came right over the supply dump flying from east to west when the alarms went off dover scrambled into a slit trench and waited for hellfire and damnation to land on his head as the hebrews in egypt must have done he breathed a silent sigh of relief when the multiengined angels of death passed over him bound for other targets he felt guilty about that and angry at himself but he couldnt help it yes the confederacy was still going to get hurt yes other menand women and childrenwere still going to get blown to bits but his own personal precious irreplaceable ass was safe at least till the sun came up he grimaced when he realized just how many us airplanes were heading west the damnyankees had loaded up their fist with a rock this time alabama boasted only two targets worth that much concentrated hate the bombers course told him they werent bound for huntsville sorry birmingham he muttered birmingham without a doubt would be and shortly was even sorrier he cowered in a trench more than seventy miles east of the city even from there he could hear the bombs going off a low deep roar absorbed almost as much through the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet as through the ears where the hells our fighters pete howled as if dover had a couple of dozen stashed away in the depot we dont have enough dover answered that had been true ever since the front lay up in tennessee it was more obviously more painfully true now us factories were outproducing their cs counterparts dover supposed us pilottraining programs were outpacing their confederate counterparts too howre we supposed to lick em if we cant go up there and shoot em down pete wailed jerry dover didnt answer the only thing he could have said was we cant while that was liable to be so it didnt do anybody any good if the writing was on the wall pete would be able to see it as well as anybody else the bombers didnt come back by the same route theyd taken going in when dover realized they werent going to he nodded in grudging respect the yankees werent so dumb dammit cs antiaircraft guns would be waiting here for the returning airplanes so would whatever night fighters the local confederates could scrape up maybe yranging gear could send the fighters after the us bombers anyway dover hoped so he was far from sure of it though he wasnt sorry to climb out of the muddy trench if chiggers didnt start gnawing on him it would be nothing but dumb luck pete came out of his hole at about the same time aint this a fun war the sergeant said well i could think of a lot of words for it but id probably have to think a long time before i came up with that one dover answered they knocked the shit out of birmingham pete said cant argue with you pete looked west as if he could see the damage from where he stood you reckon the place can keep going after they hit it like that probably dover replied his eyes were well enough adapted to the dark to let him see pete start he went on why not we bombed plenty of yankee towns harder than that and they kept going the usa hit atlanta day after day week after week and it kept making things and shipping them out till just a little while before we finally lost it hard to bomb places back to the stone age no matter how much you wish you could well i sure as hell hope youre right pete pulled a pack of cigarettes from a breast pocket he stuck one in his mouth and bent his head to light it the brief flare of the match showed his hollow unshaven cheeks remembering his manners he held out the pack want a butt sir dont mind if i do thanks dover flicked a lighter to get the proffered cigarette going after a couple of drags he said if they flatten birmingham and huntsville and maybe selma not many factory towns left between here and new orleans yeah pete grunted whole state of mississippis nothin but farms near enough farms and rednecks i mean used to be farms and rednecks and niggers but i reckon we took care o most of the coons there thats one good thing anyways let me guessyoure not from mississippi dovers voice was dry hope to shit im not sir pete said fervently i came off a farm about twenty miles outside of montgomery right near the edge of the black belt well it was the black belt then likely aint no more no i wouldnt think so jerry dover left it there he thought the confederacy had more urgent things to do than hunt down its negroes jake featherston thought otherwise and his opinion carried a lot more weight than a jumpedup restaurant managers but if hed put those coons into factories instead of getting rid of them how many more white men could he have put into uniform enough to make a difference well never know now dover thought you know how many mississippians it takes to screw in a light bulb pete asked out of the blue tell me dover urged twentysevenone to hold the bulb and twentysix to turn the house round and round dover laughed his ass offthat one did take him by surprise here he was his country crashing down around his ears and he laughed like a loon at a stupid joke if that wasnt crazy he didnt know what would be he didnt stop laughing either w hen jonathan moss heard barrels clanking toward him he feared it was all over if the confederates wanted to put that kind of effort into hunting down spartacus guerrilla band they could do it moss knew that all too well so did all the survivors in the band got us some featherston fizzes spartacus called wed do better trying to hide nick cantarella said aint gonna hide from that many machines the chieftain said and moss feared he was right he went on we headin fo heaven might as well send some o them motherfuckers down to hell moss wasnt so sure of his own destination but hed been living on borrowed time long enough that he didnt worry too much about paying it back an old boltaction tredegar wasnt much use against a barrel but he hoped a driver or a commander would be rash enough to stick his head out for a look around if one of them did moss hoped to make it the last rash thing he ever tried there came one of the big snorting monsters moss swore under his breath the barrel was buttoned up tight just his luck to spot a crew who knew what they were doing he also saw that barrel design had come a long way while he was on the shelf here in georgia this greengray machine was different from any hed seen before greengrayhis eyes saw it but his brain needed several seconds to process it to realize what it meant his jaw had just dropped open when nick cantarella a little quicker on the uptake let out a joyously obscene and blasphemous whoop jesus fuckin christ theyre ours thems yankee barrels spartacus sounded as if he hardly dared believe it jonathan moss knew how the guerrilla leader felthe hardly dared believe it himself sure as shit arent confederate cantarella answered as two more machines rumbled down the road the groundpounder took a long look at them wow he breathed theyve really pumped up the design havent they i was thinking the same thing these look like theyre twenty years ahead of the ones we were used to moss said war gave engineering a boot in the butt moss thought of the airplanes hed flown in and of the ones hed piloted three years later no comparison between themand no comparison between these barrels and their predecessors either if he walked out in front of them with a rifle in his hands hed get killed the negroes in spartacus band didnt have that worry us barrelmen seeing black faces would know they were among friends again the guerrillas figured that out at least as fast as he did several of them broke cover smiling and waving at the oncoming barrels the lead machine stopped the cupola lid on top of the smooth rounded turret flipped up boy are we glad to see youse guys the barrel commander said in purest brooklynese his accent even stronger than cantarellas wes mighty glad to see you yankees too spartacus answered we gots a couple o friends o yours here he waved for moss and cantarella to show themselves cautiously jonathan moss came out from behind the bush that had hidden him the barrels bow machine gun swung toward his belly button a burst would cut him in half he set down the tredegar and half raised his hands who the hell are you the barrel commander asked who the hellre both of youse im jonathan moss major us armyim a pilot moss answered in scruffy denim he looked more like a farmeror a bum nick cantarella captain us armyinfantry cantarella added we got out of andersonville and weve been with the guerrillas ever since well fuck me the barrel commander said we heard there might be guys like you around but i never figured id run into any how about that just goes to show you how long you been stuck here since by the way moss said it it might as well have been forever that was how he felt too fuck me the kid in the barrel said again he looked around gonna be some foot soldiers along any minute well give you to them guys and theyll dowhatever the hell they do with you clean youse up anyway that confirmed moss impression of himself cantarella looked even more sinister because he had a thicker growth of stubble sure enough infantrymen trotted up a couple of minutes later at least half of them carried captured confederate automatic rifles and submachine guns the lieutenant in charge probably wasnt old enough to vote where are the closest confederates he demanded sticking to business down in oglethorpe other side o the river spartacus answered they got some sojers there anyways you lead us to em the young officer asked spartacus nodded itd be my pleasure all right well clean em outor if we cant well call for the guys who damn well can the lieutenant took a couple of steps towards oglethorpe before he remembered he hadnt dealt with moss and cantarella he pointed to one of his men hanratty yes sir hanratty said take these robinson crusoes back to division hq let the clerks deal with em the lieutenant raised his voice the rest of you lazy lugs cmon we still got a war to fight robinson crusoes moss said plaintively the infantrymen tramped south boots squelching through the mud the barrels rumbled along with them the confederates in oglethorpe were in for a hard time nobody paid any attention to the newly liberated pows not even the blacks with whom theyd marched and fought with for so long well there was hanratty you guys were officers he said jonathan moss managed a nod so did cantarella who looked as stricken as moss felt hanratty just shrugged well come on sirs still dazed moss and cantarella followed moss had known the ropes with the guerrillas and before that in andersonville and before that as a flier before long hed probably be in a situation where he knew them again for now he was in limbo division hq was a forest of tents a couple of miles to the north hanratty turned his charges over to the sentries there saying my outfit scraped up these two crusoes running with the niggers ones a major the other ones a captain theyre all yours i gotta get back to itcant let my guys down with a nod he headed south again crusoes moss said once more not even robinson crusoes this time thats what we call escaped pows whove been on their own for a while sir the sentry said maybe he was trying to be kind but he sounded patronizing at least to moss ears he went on you guys come with me uh please ill take you to the doc first get you checked and cleaned up and then theyll start figuring out what to do with you next oh boy cantarella said in a hollow voice moss couldnt have put it better himself the doctor wore a majors gold oak leaves but he didnt look much older than that kid lieutenant he poked and prodded and peered fleas lice chiggers ticks he said cheerfully youre scrawny as all getout too both of you do a lot of walking barefoot some after our boots wore out and before we could uh liberate some more moss admitted hookworm too chances are and some other worms i bet yes the doctor sounded like somebody in hog heaven well spray you and give you some medicine you wont likenobody in his right mind does anywayand in a few days youll be a lot better than you are now anyhow and well feed you as much as you can hold too how does that sound better than the worm medicine anyway moss said you make me feel like a sick puppy you are a sick puppy the doctor assured him but well make you better weve learned a few things the last couple of years when do we get back to the war nick cantarella asked if the united states are down here featherstons fuckers have to be on their last legs i want to be in at the death goddammit me too moss said when youre well enoughand when we make sure you are who you say you are the doctor produced two cards and what looked like an ordinary stamp pad let me have your right index fingers gentlemen well make sure youre really you all right and if youre not youll see a blindfold and a cigarette and thats about it if you think the confederates would let somebody get as raggedyassed as we are just to infiltrate youre crazy as a bedbug doc cantarella said well you arent the first man to wonder the doctor said easily for the next few days moss felt as if hed gone back to andersonville he and cantarella were under guard all the time the food came from ration cans the worm medicine flushed it out almost as fast as it went in that was no fun neither was the idea that his own country mistrusted him at last though a bespectacled captain said all right gentlemenyour ids check out welcome back to the us army gee thanks moss had trouble sounding anywhere close to enthusiastic the captain took his sarcasm in stride i also have the pleasure of letting you know that youre now a lieutenant colonel sirand you mr cantarella are a major you would have reached those ranks had you not been captured and so theyre yours they have been for some time which is reflected in the pay accruing to your accounts thats nice moss remained hard to please nobody got rich on an officers pay and the difference between what a major and a light colonel collected every month wasnt enough to get excited about when can we start fighting again cantarella demanded as he had before youll both need some refresher training to get you back up to speed said the captain with the glasses things have changed over the past couple of years as im sure youll understand how much hotter are the new fighters moss asked considerably the captain said thats why youll need the refresher work will i get back into action before the confederates throw in the sponge part of that will be up to you the captain answered part of it will be up to the army as a whole and part of it will be up to jake featherston my own opinion is that you shouldnt waste any time but thats only an opinion we are going to lick those bastards nick cantarella said yes sir we are the captain with the specs sounded very sure whatll happen to spartacus and his gang moss asked adding theyre damn good fighters they wouldnt have stayed alive as long as they did if they werent weve started accepting colored us citizens into the army the captain said which made moss and cantarella both exclaim in surprise the captain continued since your companions are confederates though theyll probably stay auxiliaries theyll work with us but they wont be part of us and if they get out of line you wont have to take the blame for anything they do as a lawyer moss saw all the cynical possibilities in the captains words the other officer didnt even blink thats right but considering everything the enemy has done to them not much blame sticks to negroes acting as auxiliaries in the confederate states is it really as bad as that having been away from even confederate newspapers and wireless broadcasts since his escape moss had trouble believing it no sir the captain said its worse s omewhere ahead lay the atlantic cincinnatus driver had never seen the ocean he looked forward to it for all kinds of reasons he wanted to be able to say he hada man shouldnt live out his whole life without seeing something like that more important though was what seeing the ocean would mean that the united states had cut the confederate states in half he hadnt been sure it would happen this thrust east across georgia had started out in a tentative way the united states was trying to find out how strong the confederates in front of them were when they discovered the enemy wasnt very strong the push took on a life of its own and anywhere soldiers went supplies had to go with them they needed ammo they needed rations they needed gasoline and motor oil cincinnatus didnt like carrying fuel if an antibarrel rocketor even a bullettouched it off hell its no worse than carrying artillery rounds hal williamson said when he groused about it that shit goes up you go with it he had a point even so cincinnatus said artillery rounds blow they take you out fast you get caught in a gasoline fire maybe you got time to know how bad things is well maybe the white driver said they give you a truckload though i figure itll go off like a bomb if it goes mmmmaybe cincinnatus paused to light a cigarette got us plenty o cheerful stuff to talk about dont we you wanted cheerful you shoulda stayed home williamson said cincinnatus grunted that held more truth than he wished it did but he said i tell you one cheerful thingwere beatin the livin shit outa featherstons fuckers thatll do for me only thing thatd do betterd be beatin the shit outa featherston could happen the other driver said you believe even half of what stars and stripes says he wont be able to stay in richmond much longer wheres he gonna run to then with another grunt cincinnatus replied you believe half o what stars and stripes says we won the goddamn war last year hal williamson laughed yeah well there is that those guys lie like theyre selling old jalopies they got a tougher sell than that cincinnatus said they got to sell the war soon as the confederates jumped into ohio i was sold williamson said bastards tried to knock us flat and steal the war before we could get back on our feet again damn near did it toodamn near he was right about that same here cincinnatus said course they aint as likely to shoot our asses off as they are with the kids in the front line still happens though you know that as well as i do weve lost more drivers than i like to think about williamson said oh yeah i wont try to tell you anything different all i said was it aint as likely and it aint cincinnatus said he waited to see if the other driver would keep arguing when williamson didnt cincinnatus decided hed made his point the next morning he picked up a load of canned rations and headed for the front he liked carrying those just fine the soldiers needed them and they wouldnt blow up no matter what happened he couldnt think of a better combination about every third georgia town had negro guerrillas patrolling the streets along with us soldiers whenever cincinnatus saw some of them he would tap his horn and wave the blacks commonly grinned and waved back you a yankee nigger was a question he heard again and again im from kentucky he would answer as he rolled past let them figure that out yes hed grown up in the csa but hed spent most of the second half of his life under the stars and stripes his children were yankeesno doubt about it they even sounded as if they came from the midwestexcept when they got upset or angry then an accent more like his own would come out but he was more betwixt and between than any one thing he probably would be for the rest of his life us authorities here took no chances bodies hung in almost every town square that was supposed to make the living think twice about giving the usa any trouble seeing how much trouble the living gave the usa cincinnatus had his doubts about how much good it did but those dead men wouldnt bother the united states again he had no doubts about that at all would the united states need to kill every white male in the confederate states above the age of twelve if they did need to would they have the will to do it cincinnatus wasnt so sure about that either and even if the united states did set out to slaughter white male confederates wouldnt it be the same kind of massacre the confederate whites had inflicted on their negroes damn ofays have it coming though cincinnatus muttered there in the cab of his deuceandahalf reluctantly he shook his head you couldnt play god like that no matter how much you wanted to jake featherston and the freedom party really and truly believed blacks had it coming too nothing cincinnatus had seen while stuck in covington or while driving a truck through the wreckage of the csa gave him any reason to think otherwise sincerity wasnt enough what was what could be we got to stop killing each other we got to cincinnatus said then he started to laugh that would have been a fine thoughtif hed had it somewhere else when he wasnt hauling food to soldiers dedicated to putting the confederate states of america out of business for good the roads here didnt seem to be mined the way so many had been in tennessee up there the enemy had known which way us truck convoys were going here they didnt cincinnatus wasnt sure us commanders knew where their forces were going from one day to the next and if they didnt how could the confederates every so often snipers would take pot shots at the trucks from the woods when they did us armored cars and halftracks lashed the pines with bullets that took care of thattill the halftracks and armored cars drove on then more often than not the unharmed bushwhackers would climb out of their holes and start banging away at us trucks again cincinnatus watched the woods as closely as he watched the road then he kept a submachine gun on the seat beside him where he could grab it in a hurry if he needed to he didnt want to get shot but he really didnt want to get captured one of the bullets in the captured confederate weapon might be for him if he had to use it that way he wondered how many movies hed seen where the bad guy snarled youll never take me alive flatfoot he didnt think he was the bad guy in this particular melodrama but the confederate skulkers wouldnt feel the same way about him everything went fine till the convoy got to swainsboro georgia not far from where the trucks would unload the woods around swainsboro were particularly thick the town itself had a turpentine plant a couple of planing mills and a furniture factory to deal with the timber in the cleared areas farmers raised chickens and turkeys hogs and goats all in all it was a typical enough backwoods georgia townor so cincinnatus thought till a big bomb went off under a deuceandahalf a quarter of a mile in front of him he was still in town the other truck had just cleared swainsboro the poor driver never knew what hit him his truck went up in a fireball that would have been even bigger had he carried anything inflammable chunks of metal and asphalt rained down around cincinnatus as he slammed on the brakes something clanged off a fender whatever it was it sounded big enough to leave a dent he was amazed his windshield didnt blow in and slash his face to ribbons no sooner had he stoppedjust past the last buildings on the outskirts of townthan he grabbed for the submachine gun hed been through bombings before usually the bomb was intended to stall the convoy so bushwhackers could hit it from the sides his head swiveled he didnt hear any gunfire and wondered why not as the trucks ahead of him moved forward he put his back in gear an armored car went off the road to one side a halftrack to the other the light cannon and machine guns the armored vehicles carried were potent arguments against getting gay with the convoy cincinnatus hoped they were anyhow he ground his teeth when he had to leave the paving and go off into the mud to the side the trucks allwheel drive kept him from bogging down but getting stuck was the least of his worries if those bastards had planted more explosives next to the roadhed seen that before too hed just got back up onto the roadand breathed a sigh of relief because hed made itwhen an antibarrel rocket trailing fire streaked out of the woods and slammed into the armored cars side those rockets were made to pierce much thicker armor than that the armored car burst into flames cincinnatus fired into the trees again and again short bursts he reminded himself the muzzle wouldnt pull up and to the right if he didnt try to squeeze off too many rounds at a time that fire trail pointed right back to where the man with the launcher had to be if cincinnatus could nail him he growled out a triumphant yeah when he did a man in bloodied confederate butternut staggered out from behind a loblolly pine and fell to his knees cincinnatus squeezed off another burst the confederate grabbed at his chest as he toppled he lay there kicking how many bullets did he have in him men often proved harder to kill than anyone who wasnt trying to do it would imagine this bastard though had surely killed everybody in the armored car no hatches opened no men got out and the driver hadnt got out of the blasted truck either no way in hell he could have so the confederate had extracted a high price for his miserable worthless life if all his countrymen did the same but they couldnt cincinnatus had already seen as much the enemy soldiers had the advantage of playing defense of making us forces come to them but the united states also had an advantage they could pick when and where to strike and they could concentrate men and barrels where they thought concentrating them would do the most good breakthroughs were easier to come by in this war than they had been the last time around how many more would the usa need cincinnatus thought about that with half his mind while the rest got the truck rolling down the road again and scanned the woods to either side hed spot the confederates no doubt lurking in there only if they made a mistakehe knew that those bastards were human beings just like anybody else though they could screw up the same way us soldiers could a good thing too cincinnatus shiver had nothing to do with the nasty weather if the confederates hadnt screwed up a couplethree times theyd be ruling the roost now a few negroes still survived in the csa had jake featherston won everything his heart desired everything south of the border would be lilywhite soone more push into savannah and how long would the butternut bastards go on screaming freedom with their goddamn country split in two the united states could turn north and smash one half then swing south and smash the other or maybe the body would die once the usa killed the head cincinnatus patted the submachine gun he sure hoped so j orge rodriguez and gabriel medwick both sewed second stripes onto their sleeves jorge was lousy with a needle and thread back in sonora sewing was work for women and tailors he was surprised to find his friend neat and quick and precise how come you can do that so good he asked ready to rag on gabe my ma learned me medwick answered matteroffactly she reckoned i ought to be able to shift for myself and knowing how to sew was part of it that left jorge with nothing to say ragging on his buddy was one thing ragging on gabes mother was something else something that went over the line instead of talking jorge sewed fasternot better but faster he wanted to get the shirt back on even sitting in front of a campfire it was chilly out artillery opened up behind him from the direction of statesboro covington was a long way northwest now and long gone statesboro guarded the approaches to savannah the town wasnt that well fortified not by what jorge had heard why would it be back before the war who would have imagined eastern georgia would be crawling with damnyankees nobody in his right mind that was for sure imagine or not though us soldiers swarmed through this part of the state everybody figured they were heading for savannah theyd been pushing the confederates back toward the southeast for weeks where else would they be going sergeant hugo blackledge appeared in the firelight he had a gift for not being there one second and showing up out of nowhere the next a jackinthebox with a nasty temper he commanded the company these days all the officers above him were dead and wounded and replacements hadnt shown up jorges promotion to corporal was older than gabes even if their sets of stripes had both arrived at the same time that meant jorge had a platoon while his friend only led a section hows it feel making like lieutenants blackledge asked with a certain sardonic relish dont want to be no lieutenant gabriel medwick said i got enough shit to worry about already you said it jorge agreed as if to underline their worries us artillery came to life jorge listened anxiously then relaxed as the shells roared over his head that was counterbattery fire aimed at the cs guns as long as the big guns shot at each other as long as they left the frontline infantry alone jorge didnt mind themmuch sure enough the us shells came down well to the rear jorge finished sewing on his new stripes and put his shirt back on gabe fussily precise lagged behind what are we gonna do jorge said his buddy looked up from his sewing fight the damnyankees keep fighting em till we chase em back where they came from їcomo jorge asked startled into spanish the question sounded every bit as bleak in english how presidentll figure out some kinda way medwick sounded a hundred percent confident in jake featherston sergeant blackledge lit a cigarette dont get your ass in an uproar about that kind of shit rodriguez he advised you cant do nothin about it any which way all we got to worry about is the damnyankees in front of us thats bad enough jorge exclaimed because blackledge made it sound as if the us soldiers were nothing to worry about rodriguez wished they werent but knew they were yeah well so what youre still here im still here hell even pretty boys still here blackledge blew smoke in gabriel medwicks direction up yours too sarge medwick said without rancor when he first got to know blackledge he wouldnt have dared mouth off like that neither would jorge and the formidable noncom would have squashed them like lice if they had dared now theyd earned the right not least simply by surviving all we can do is all we can do hugo blackledge said weve put up a hell of a fight seeing as they outweigh us about two to one well lick em yet gabe said as he finally put his shirt back on uhhuh sergeant blackledge nodded jorge had seen nods like that from doctors in sickrooms where the patient wasnt going to get better but didnt know it yet you kept his hope up as long as you could maybe it didnt do any good but it didnt hurt either and he felt better for a little while anyway jorges dark eyes met the sergeants icegray ones in a moment of complete mutual understanding gabe didnt get it and probably wouldnt till savannah fell if thenand if he lived that long the patient in the sickroom was the confederacy and chances were it wouldnt get better got another one of those dukes jorge asked blackledge sure do here you go the older man held out the pack jorge got to his feet and walked over to take one as he leaned forward so blackledge could give him a light he whispered were fucked sн bet your sorry butt we are blackledge answered thanks jorge sucked in smoke but he was more grateful for the candor than for the cigarette when morning came he looked up the road along which hed been retreating a couple of dead confederates lay there about three hundred yards in front of the line nobodyd tried to retrieve their bodies for one thing it was too likely that us snipers would shoot anyone who did for another cs engineers had boobytrapped the corpses any damnyankee who flipped them over looking for souvenirs would regret it nobodyd set up a kitchen anywhere close by jorge made do with a ration can it was usissue deviled ham the favorite canned meal on both sides of the front jorge hadnt swapped cigarettes to get his hands on this one hed taken three or four cans off a dead yankee looking at those bodies out there made him shake his head as he ate maybe hed been lucky not to get blown to kingdom come it wasnt as if the damnyankees wouldnt have other chances sooner or laterprobably soonerthey would start pushing hard toward savannah again the only question was whether theyd do it right here or somewhere a little farther west if they did it right here jorge knew hed have to retreat or die if they did it farther west his choices would lie between retreating and getting cut off and trapped he didnt think the cs line could hold as for counterattackswell no when a sergeant commanded a company when a new corporal was leading a platoon this army would have a devil of a time holding its ground pushing the enemy back seemed far beyond its power too many damnyankee soldiers too many damnyankee barrels too many airplanes with the eagle and crossed swords with atlanta gone with richmond in trouble with birmingham getting pounded how could the confederacy reply no us troops came close enough to try to plunder the boobytrapped corpses that left jorge more relieved than anything else advancing us soldiers would have meant more hard fighting hed seen enoughmore than enough in factto last him a lifetime he knew he hadnt seen the end of things here either hed have to do more fighting or hed have to fall back chances were hed have to do both if he didnt have to do either one today or maybe even tomorrow so much the better quiet lasted through the afternoon and into the evening he smoked and ate and dozed and listened to the problems of a soldier in his platoon who had woman trouble back in north carolina somebodyd sent ray a letter that said his wife or maybe fiancйe jorge wasnt quite sure was fooling around on him with a mechanic who was back there because hed already lost an arm in the fighting shoulda blown off his shortarm instead ray said savagely what i want to do is i want to go on home and take care o that my own self well you cant jorge said they catch you deserting they shoot you then they hang up your body to give other people the message itd be worth it then thelma loud know how much i love her ray said jorge wondered why hed got stuck listening to this crap he himself hadnt had a fiancйe let alone a wife back in baroyeca the few times hed lain down with a woman hed had to put money on the dresser first but he was the platoon leader that must have made him seem to ray like someone who knew what he was doing he wished he seemed that way in his own eyes he knew enough to be sure ray was talking like a fool anybody who wasnt in love with thelma lou would have known that she just laugh when you get in trouble jorge said then she go on fooling around with this asshole not if i kill him she dont ray was as stubborn as he was stupid which took some doing then she fool around with somebody else jorge said a gal who cheats on you once she cheats on you lots of times you dont get her back like she never screwed around at all rays jaw dropped plainly that had never crossed his mind dumb as rocks jorge thought sadly he went on or maybe this letter you got maybe its bullshit whoever sent it to you there aint no return address right i dunno ray said which covered more ground than he realized you might could be right but i dunno kinda sounds like somethin thelma loud go and do so why do you give a damn about her jorge didnt scream it however much he wanted to he could tell it would do no good you cant go nowhere he said you dont want to let your buddies down right ray shook his head he wasnt a bad soldier jorge pressed on you cant get leave and theres lots of military police and freedom party men between here and your home town so stay all this stuff if it really is anything itll sort itself out when the wars done why worry till then i guess ray didnt sound convinced but he didnt sound like someone on the ragged edge of deserting either sergeant blackledge swore when jorge warned him of the trouble this aint the first time hes had trouble with that cunt he said but you were dead rightif he does try and run off he aint gonna get far and hell land in more shit than congress puts out half an hour after that a captain and a second lieutenant and six or eight enlisted men showed up a new company co a platoon commander and some real live for the moment anyhow reinforcements would wonders never cease the captain whose name was richmond sellars walked with a limp and wore a purple heart ribbon with two tiny oakleaf clusters pinned to it i told em i was ready to get back to duty he said so they sent my ass here he pointed to the lieutenant who had to be at least forty and looked to have come up through the ranks this is grover burch whos in charge now i am sir sergeant hugo blackledge blackledge likely wasnt happy to see company command go glimmering jorge wasnt thrilled about losing his platoon the good news was that he wouldnt have to listen to complaints like rays so much theyd be burchs worry and sergeant blackledges too well blackledge why dont you fill me in sellars said hed seen enough to know hed be smart to walk soft for a while the sergeant did quickly and competently he said a couple of nice things about jorge which surprised and pleased the new corporal then blackledge pointed northwest not really up to us what happens next sir he said the damnyankeesll do whatever the hell they do and weve got to try and stop em i just hope to god we can f orward to richmond that had been the us battle cry in the war of secession it would have been the battle cry during the great war except the confederates struck north before the usa could even try to push south and in this fight in this fight the csa had held the usa in northern virginia the confederate states had held yes but they werent holding any more abner dowling noted each new us advance with growing amazement and growing delight after us soldiers broke out of the nasty secondgrowth country called the wilderness the enemy just didnt have the men and machines to stop them the confederates could slow them down but the us troops pushed forward day after day a command car took dowling and his adjutant past burntout cs barrels even in this chilly winter weather the stink of death filled the air i didnt believe id ever say it dowling remarked but i think weve got em on the run here yes sir same here major angelo toricelli nodded they just cant hold us any more theyll have a devil of a time keeping us out of richmond i hope we dont just barge into the place dowling said he glanced over at the driver he didnt want to say much more than that not with a man he didnt know well listening his lack of faith in daniel macarthur was almost limitless hed served with macarthur since the great war and admired his courage without admiring his common sense or strategic sense he doubted whether macarthur had any strategic sense as a matter of fact ive heard were trying to work out how to get over the james major toricelli said ive heard the same thing dowling replied hearing is only hearing though seeing is believing a rifle shot rang out not nearly far enough away the driver sped up toricelli swung the command cars heavy machine gun toward the sound of the gunshot he didnt know what was going on he couldnt know whod fired either the shot sounded to dowling as if it had come from a cs automatic rifle but about every fourth soldier in greengray carried one of those nowadaysand the other three wanted one toricelli relaxeda littleas no target presented itself back in the war of secession they would have had a devil of a time taking the straight route were using he remarked the lay of the land doesnt make it easy around here the lay of the lands got the clap dowling said his adjutant snorted so did the driver an adjutant was almost obligated to find a generals jokes funny a lowly driver wasnt so dowling felt doubly pleased with himself hed been exaggerating but only a little the rivers in central virginia all seemed to run from northwest to southeast major toricelli was right those rivers and their bottomlands would have forced men marching on foot to veer toward the southeast too toward the southeast and away from the confederate capital but barrels and halftracks could go where marching men couldnt and us forces were pushing straight toward richmond whether jake featherstons men liked it or not so dowling thought at any rate till cs fighterbombers appeared the driver jammed on the brakes everybody bailed out of the command car the roadside ditch dowling dove into was muddy but what could you do bullets spanged off asphalt and thudded into dirt dowling didnt hear any of the wet slaps that meant bullets striking flesh for which he was duly grateful a moment later he did hear several metallic clangs and then a soft whump that was the command car catching fire he swore under his breath he wouldnt be going forward to richmond as fast as he wanted to he stuck his head up out of the ditch then ducked again as machinegun ammo in the command car started cooking off embarrassing as hell to get killed by your own ordnance embarrassing as hell to get killed by anybodys ordnance when you came right down to it after thecaliber rounds stopped going off dowling cautiously got to his feet so did the driver dowling looked across the road major toricelli emerged from a ditch there he wasnt just muddyhe was dripping his grin looked distinctly forced some fun huh sir now that you mention it dowling said no wed better flag down another auto or a truck or whatever we can find toricelli said we need to be in place he was young and serious even earnest dowling had been through much more with a crooked grin he replied youre right of course the whole war will grind to a halt if im not there to give orders at just the right instant who was the russian novelist whod tried to show that generals and what they said and did was utterly irrelevant to the way battles turned out dowling couldnt remember his name he cared for russian novels no more than he cared for brussels sprouts with the bias that sprang from his professional rank he thought the russians conclusions absurd he remembered the claim though and enjoyed hauling it out to bedevil his adjutant they do need you sir major toricelli said if they didnt they would have left you in texas and if thats not a fate worse or at least more boring than death i dont know what would be dowling said while he and toricelli sparred the driver a practical man looked down the road in the direction from which theyd come heres a truck he said and waved for it to stop maybe he was persuasive maybe the burning command car was either way the deuceandahalf shuddered to a halt brakes squealing over the rumble of the engine the driver said you guys look like you could use a lift you mean youre not selling sandwiches dowling said damn the driver eyed his rotund form you look like youve had plenty already as his eyes found the stars on dowlings shoulder straps his voice trailed off too late of course and the glum look on his face said he knew it uh sir he added with the air of a man certain it wouldnt help just get me to army hq in a hurry and i wont ask who the hell you are dowling said pile in you got yourself a deal now the driver sounded like somebodyd whod just won a reprieve from the governor before long dowling repented of the bargain the trucker drove as if he smelled victory at the omaha he took corners on two wheels and speedshifted so that dowling marveled when his transmission didnt start spitting teeth from the gears other traffic on the road seemed nothing but obstructions to be dodged what are you carrying the general shouted the engine wasnt rumbling any moreit was roaring shellss mostly the driver yelled back leaning into another maniacal turn how come major toricelli crossed himself dowling wondered who was more dangerous the confederate fighterbomber pilot or this nut well if the shells went off it would all be over in a hurry then brakes screeching now the driver almost put him through the windshield were here the man announced oh joy dowling said and got out of the truck as fast as he could toricelli and the soldier whod driven the command car also escaped with alacrity the truck drove off at a reasonably sedate clip the madman behind the wheel probably felt hed done his duty a sentry with a captured cs submachine gun came up i know you sir he said to dowling do you vouch for these two the muzzle swung toward toricelli and the driver never saw em before the words passed through dowlings mind but didnt pass his lips the sentry was too grim too serious to let him get away with them and too likely to open fire before asking questions yes was all dowling said all right come ahead then the sentry gestured with his weapon a little more invitingly than he had before familiar chaos enveloped dowling as he stepped into the big tent the air was gray with tobacco smoke and blue with curses people in uniform shouted into telephone handsets and wireless sets mikes but they just sounded annoyed or angry the way they were supposed to sound when things were going well he remembered headquarters in columbus back in the first summer of the war he remembered the panic in officers voices then no matter how they tried to hold it at bay they couldnt believe what the confederates were doing to them they couldnt believe anyone could slice through an army like a housewife slicing cheddar they didnt know how to do it themselves and so theyd figured nobody else knew either they almost lost the war before they realized how wrong they were now they knew what was what now they had the barrels and the bombs and the artillery and the men to turn knowledge into action better still they had the doctrine to turn knowledge into effective action yes theyd learned plenty of lessons from the enemy but so what where you learned your lessons didnt matter that you learned them did one of the men at a field telephone lifted his head and looked around when he spotted dowling he called message for you from general macarthur sir yes dowling tried not to show how his stomach tightened at that handful of words daniel macarthur often seemed incapable of learning anything and the lessons he drew from what happened to him verged on the bizarre his scheme to land men at the mouth of the james and march northwest up the river to richmond i managed to scotch that one anyhow dowling thought i earned my pay the day i did it too well done for your progress and keep it up the man reported and the general says hes over the rapidan river east of fredericksburg and rapidly pushing south rapidly is his word sir is it dowling said good for him the confederates had given macarthur a bloody nose at fredericksburg in there wasnt much room to slide troops east of the town abner dowling wouldnt have cared to try it himself but if macarthur had got away with it and if he was driving rapidly from the rapidan and punning as he wentsounds like featherstons boys really are starting to go to pieces heres hoping three men in army hq said in one chorus while another two or three added its about time in another dowling liked prizefights people said of some boxers that they had a punchers chance in the ring if they hit somebody squarely hed fall over no matter how big and tough he was that was the kind of chance the csa had against the usa but when the united states didntquitefall over the confederate states had to fight a more ordinary war and they werent so well equipped for that did featherston have one more punch left dowling didnt see how he could but dowling hadnt seen all kinds of things before june he shrugged if the united states seized richmond and cut the confederacy in half farther south what could featherston punch with tell general macarthur i thank him very much and i look forward to meeting him in front of the gray house dowling said forward to richmond things really were going that way a s far as dr leonard odoull was concerned eastern alabama seemed about the same as western georgia the hilly terrain hadnt changed when he crossed the state line neither had the accents the local civilians used shamefaced us soldiers caught social diseases from some of the local women too this penicillin stuff knocked those down in nothing flat though it was better than sulfa for the clap and ever so much better than the poisons that had been medicines only weapons against syphilis move up doc a noncom shouted at odoull one morning fronts going forward and you gotta keep up with it send me a truck and ill do it the doctor answered sergeant goodson lord played a racetrack fanfare on his liberated trombone the soldier who brought the news thumbed his nose at the medic grinning lord paused and returned the compliment if that was what it was by now odoull had moving down to a science packing knocking down the tent loading stuff actually traveling and setting up again went as smoothly as if hed been doing them for yearswhich he had he was proud of how fast he got the aid station running once the deuceandahalf stopped and every forward move meant another bite taken out of the confederate states he hadnt been set up again for very long before he got a hard look at what those bites meant doc hey doc eddie the corpsman yelled as he helped carry a litter back to the aid station got a bad one here doc odoull had already figured that out for himself whoever was on the litter was screaming a high shrill sound of despair christ sergeant lord said they go and find a wounded woman wouldnt be surprised not by the noise odoull answered its happened before he remembered an emergency hysterectomy after a luckless woman stopped a shell fragment with her belly what had happened to her afterwards he hadnt the faintest idea when he first saw the wounded person he thought it was a woman the skin was fine and pale and beardless the cries more contralto than tenor then eddie said look what theyre throwing at us these days poor kid cant be a day over fourteen this time odoull was the one who blurted christ that was a boy he wore dungarees and a plaid shirt an armband said national assault force you damnyankees herere gonna shoot me now aint you the kid asked nooo odoull said slowly hed seen national assault force troops before but they were old geezers guys with too many miles on them to go into the regular army orders were to treat them as pows not francstireurs now the confederates were throwing their seed corn into the naf too they said youd kill everybody you got your hands on the wounded boy said and then he started shrieking again well theyre full of shit odoull said roughly he nodded to the stretcherbearers get him up on the table goodson put him out yes sir lord said when the mask went over the kids face the ether made him think he was choking he tried to yank off the mask odoull had seen that before plenty of times eddie and goodson lord grabbed the boy soldiers hands till he went under hed taken a bullet in the bellyno wonder he was howling odoull cut away the bloody shirt and got to work it could have been worse it hadnt pierced his liver or spleen or gall bladder hed lose his left kidney but you could get along on one his guts werent too torn up with the new fancy medicines to fight peritonitis he wasnt doomed the way he would have been a few years earlier i think he may make it odoull sounded surprised even to himself i bet youre right sir goodson lord said i wouldnt have given a dime for his chances when you got to work on himill tell you that neither would i odoull admitted as he started closing up his hands sutured with automatic skill and precision if he doesnt come down with a wound infection though whats to keep him from getting better then we can kill him lord said odoull could see only the medics eyes over his surgical mask but they looked amused the kid had been so sure falling into us hands was as bad as letting the demons of hell get hold of him yeah well if we dont kill him now will we have to do it in twenty years odoull asked hell be about old enough to fight then sergeant lord said that was one of too many truths spoken in jest but what would stop another war between the usa and the csa a generation down the road after the united states walloped the snot out of the confederates this time around would the usa stay determined long enough to make sure the confederacy didnt rise again if the country did wouldnt it be a miracle and wouldnt the confederates try to hit back as soon as the usa offered them even the smallest chance once you get on a treadmill how do you get off odoull said what do you mean sir lord asked how do we keep from fighting a war with these sons of bitches every twenty years beats me the medic said if you know run for president i guarandamntee you itd put you one up on all the chuckleheads in politics now most of em cant count to twentyone without undoing their fly odoull snorted then wistfully he said only trouble is i dont have any answers i just have questions questions are easy answers he shook his head one reason old socrates looks so smart is that he tried to get answers from other people he didnt give many of his own if you say so hes greek to me goodson lord replied they sent the wounded confederate kid off to a hospital farther back of the lineall the way back into georgia in fact odoull who had a proper professional pride in his own work hoped the little bastard would live even if that meant he might pick up a rifle and start shooting at us soldiers again twenty years from nowor for that matter twenty minutes after he got out of a pow camp the front ground forward before long birmingham would start catching it from artillery as well as from the bombers that visited it almost every night odoull wondered how much good that would do the confederates might be running short of men but they still had plenty of guns and ammunition the bombing that was supposed to knock out their factories didnt live up to the fancy promises airmen made for it featherstons followers still had plenty of rockets too stovepipe rockets blew up us barrels odoull hated treating burns it gave him the shivers he did it anyway because he had to screaming meemies could turn an acre of ground into a slaughterhouse and the big longrange rockets threw destruction a couple of hundred miles hell with birmingham sergeant lord said picking screamingmeemie fragments out of the thigh and buttocks of an anesthetized corporal weve got to take huntsville away from those fuckers thats where this shit is coming from no arguments from me odoull held out a metal basin to the senior medic lord dropped another small chunk of twisted bloody steel or aluminum into it clink the sound of metal striking metal seemed absurdly cheerful well if you can see it and i can see it how come the brass cant lord demanded he peered at the wounded mans backside then dug in with the forceps again sure as hell he found another fragment maybe they will odoull said they swung a lot of force south of atlanta to make the confederates clear out now were better positioned to go after birmingham than we are for huntsville thats all maybe lord sounded anything but convinced me i think the brass are a bunch of jerksthats what the trouble is of course you doyoure a noncom odoull thought he too was given to heretical thoughts about the competence if any of the high command yes he was an officer but as a doctor he wasnt in the chain of command he didnt want to be either there often seemed to be missing links at the top of the chain missing linkshis memory went back to biology classes in college in the dead distant days before the great war he remembered pictures of lowbrowed chinless hairy brutes neanderthal man and java man and a couple of others thought to lie halfway between apes and homo laughably called sapiens he imagined apemen in greengray uniforms with stars on their shoulder straps and blackandgold general staff armofservice colors the picture formed with frightening ease ook he muttered sergeant lord sent him a curious look odoulls cheeks heated he also imagined hulking subhumans in butternut with wreathed stars on their collars confederate neanderthals also proved easy to conjure up a good thing too odoull thought wed lose if they werent as dumb as we are and wasnt jake featherston the top pithecanthropus of them all ook leonard odoull said again louder this time then he shook his head angry at himself for swallowing his own sides propaganda sure featherston had made his share of mistakes but who in this war hadnt the president of the csa had come much too close to leading his side to victory over a much bigger much richer foe if that didnt argue for a certain basic competence what would you all right sir goodson lord asked real concern in his voice as well as i can be anyhow odoull answered what worried him was that jake featherston could still win the confederates had come up with more new and nasty weapons this time around than his own side had the fragments lord was cleaning upanother one clanked into the bowlshowed that if the enemy pulled something else out of his hat something big hey doc that insistent shout from outside drove such thoughts from his mind no matter what the confederates who werent neanderthals came up with all he could do was try to patch up the men they hurt you all right by yourself he asked lord ill cope the senior medic said which was the right answer the new wounded man had had a shell fragment slice the right side of his chest open the corpsmen who brought him in were irate it was a short round doc eddie said odoull could all but see the steam coming out of his ears one of ours it killed another guytheyll have to scrape him up before they can bury him that kind of shit happens all the time another stretcherbearer said happens too goddamn often yeah eddie was hot all right i think so too odoull had also seen too many wounds on us soldiers inflicted by other us soldiers he hated them at least as much as eddie did all the samelets get to work on him the less time we waste the better collapsed lung lots of bleeders to tie off broken ribs odoull knew what to expect and he got it the wound was serious but straightforward and clean odoull knew he had a good chance of saving the soldier by the time he finished he was pretty sure he had if the war lasted long enough the man might return to duty wont he be proud of his purple heart eddie was a little rabbity guy somehow that only made his sarcasm more devastating hes here to get one anyway odoull said you told me he had a buddy who bought the whole plot right yeah eddie nodded well this is better this guyll probably end up all right odoull said eddie didnt answer which might have been the most devastating comeback of all vii w hen cassius walked down the street white people scurried out of his way that still thrilled him it had never happened before he started this occupation duty his whole life long hed been taught to move aside for whites dreadful things happened to colored people who didnt now he had a tredegar in his hands and the us army at his back anybody who didnt like thatand there were bound to be people who didntand was rash enough to let him know it could end up suddenly dead and no one would say a word other members of gracchus band had shot whites in madison for any reason or none and then gone about their business oh the ofays in town flabbled but who paid attention to them not a soul white women were particularly quick not just to get out of the way but to get out of sight cassius had seen that ever since he got here shooting wasnt the only revenge negroes could take on their former social superiors oh nonot at all cassius scowled when he saw blue xs painted on walls those would come down or get painted over in a hurrythey were shorthand for cs battle flags if a property owner didnt cover them up us soldiers would assume he was a confederate sympathizer theyd probably be right too right or wrong theyd make him sorry more than a few whites had already disappeared from madison the us army said theyd gone into prisons farther from the front negroes loudly insisted the us soldiers had shipped them to camps cassius had done it himself he wanted the ofays quivering in their boots theyd made him quiver too damn long theyd made him fight back too tales of horror like that were liable to make the local whites fight back cassius didnt care if the ofays wanted to try they could he figured the us army would start massacring them then and he would get to help he came to a street corner at the same time as another negro marching from a different direction mornin sertorius he said how you doin is tolerable his fellow guerrilla replied how bout yourself could be worse cassius admitted we got us plenty o grub we got warm places to sleep an we got all the yankees on our side yeah sure enough could be worse amen sertorius said as if cassius were a preacher couple months ago things was worse he wore a us helmet and made as if to tip it cassius returned the gesture with the cap he had on see you sertorius added and went on marching his assigned route see you cassius also walked on odds were they would see each other at the end of the day they werent living in fear the way they had when they skulked and hid in the countryside the ofays feared them now cassius liked that better who wouldnt and sometimes the ofays were starting to treat them with respect a kid maybe eight or nine years old came up to cassius got any rations you can spare he asked his voice most polite cassius would have told a grown man to go to hell a skinny kid though was a skinny kid cassius started to reach for one of the ration cans in his belt pouch then he took another look at the boy his hand stopped you called me a goddamn nigger before he said you said i sucked the damnyankees dicks far as im concerned you kin starve the white boy looked almost comically astonished i didnt mean it he said and smiled a winning smile how dumb was he how dumb did he think cassius was that was the real question and cassius knew the answerdumb as a nigger that was what he thought now tell me one ill believe cassius said scornfully if looks could have killed he would have fallen over dead on the spot the white kid started to say somethingprobably something as sweet and charming as the insults hed dealt out the last time he ran into cassius then he glanced at the tredegar and went away instead that was the smartest thing he could have done cassius likely would have shot him if hed run his mouth twice an old man came up behind him you wont even feed a little boy the geezer asked whats the world coming to i aint gonna feed that little bastard no matter what the worlds comin to cassius answered some other kid maybe but not him why not on account of he done called me a nigger and a cocksucker well you are a nigger cassius could see it in the old white mans shrewd gray eyes the fellow had sense enough not to say it though and cocksucker was an insult to anybody oh was all that came out of the ofays mouth he walked on past cassius careful not to come close enough to seem threatening at noon another black man took over cassius beat cassius went back to the tents outside of town to see if the us army cooks had any hot food sure enough big kettles of chicken stew simmered over crackling fires cassius dug out his mess kit and got in line howd it go asked the white soldier in front of him any trouble with the local yokels nah cassius shook his head but then he corrected himself well a little this kid who dont like niggersan i know he dont like niggerstried to bum food offa me hope you told him to fuck himself the soldier said little asshole can starve for all i care just save somebody on our side the trouble of shooting him once he grows up you reckon another wars comin cassius asked as the line snaked forward shit dont you the white man replied sooner or later well let these confederate bastards back on their feet a half hour after we do theyll clean the grease off the guns they got stashed away and start greasin us was that savage cynicism or sage common sense when it came to gauging the chances of peace and war how much difference was there cassius didnt know he did know confederate whites despised both blacks and us whites hed always known cs negroes didnt love whitesand how little reason they had to love them now hed discovered that white soldiers from the usa couldnt stand confederate whites either that was reassuring plainly quite a few soldiers in greengray didnt like negroes either but they hated confederate whites moreat least while they were down here confederate whites wanted them dead and were willingno eagerto pick up weapons and make sure they died negroes in the csa by contrast made natural allies the enemy of my enemyis at least worth dishing out rations to cassius thought the cook loaded his mess kit with as much chicken stew as anybody else got here yare buddy he said his lips barely moving because of the cigarette that dangled from the corner of his mouth thanks cassius moved on when he got a cup of coffee to go with the stew he found it heavily laced with chicory but it came from the same big potalmost a vatthat served the us soldiers no one was giving him particularly lousy coffee the good stuff was hard to come bythat was all as long as he got his fair share of what there was he had no kick coming he made sure he washed his mess kit after he finished eating the us army came down hard on you if you didnt one dose of a jowly sergeant screaming in his face about food poisoning and the galloping shits was enough to last him a lifetime he did notice that the sergeants screamed just as loud at white men they caught screwing up again as long as they tore into everybody equally cassius could deal with it once hed policed upa term that had sounded funny when he first heard it but one he was used to nowhe went over to the pow camp outside of madison watching confederate soldiers behind barbed wire was even more fun than looking at animals in cages had been when his father took him to the zoo the confederates were like lionstheyd bite if they got half a chance but he had claws of his own the tredegars weight which often annoyed him seemed more like a safety net close to the prisoners i had a gun myself id shoot you for totin that thing a pow said shaking his fist you could try cassius answered some other ofays done tried before but im still here you know what happens to uppity niggers the pow said sure do they git shot cassius started to unsling the rifle same thing happens to uppity prisoners the confederate shut up cassius let his hand drop some of the other pows werent uppity they were just hungry they begged from us soldiers and they begged from negroes too got any rations you dont need one of them asked stretching out his hands imploringly to cassius you feed me if i was in there cassius asked well i hope so the man answered after a perceptible pause for thought im a christian or i try to be reckon jake featherstons a christian too sure he is the pow said this time without hesitation he loves jesus same as youn me jesus loves him too fuck you you ofay asshole cassius turned away you can starve you aint no christian the confederate called after him if jake featherston is i dont want to be cassius walked off he wondered if the pow would cuss him out as he went but the man kept quiet a few untimely demises had convinced the cs prisoners that they needed to watch their mouths around the surviving negroes cassius mother would have landed on him like a thousandpound bomb if she heard him say he didnt want to be a christian she prayed even when things looked worstno especially when they did and she got caught in church and went straight from church to one of jake featherstons murder factories what did that say about how much being a christian was worth not much not so far as cassius could see maybe she was in heaven the way she always thought she would be cassius hoped so he had trouble believing it though he had trouble believing anything these days he found gracchus that evening gracchus thought about things too you reckon well ever fit in again cassius asked the former guerrilla leader didnt even pretend not to understand what he was talking about in georgia naw gracchus shook his head dont just mean georgia cassius said i mean anywhere the confederate ofays all hate us he didnt love whites in the csa either but he left that out of the mix continuing ofays from the usa dont all hate us i reckon but theys so different aint no way we belong in yankeeland neither so what does that leave nothin gracchus managed a crooked grin when you ever know a nigger who had moren dat you got somethin there cassius admitted his father had had more a kingdom of the mind a kingdom whose size and scope cassius was only beginning to realize hed never fully grasped but what did all of xerxes quiet wisdom win him in the end only another place on the train bound for hell on earth cassius said i could kill ofays for the rest o my life an not even start payin them fuckers back its a bastard aint it gracchus said maybe jake featherston wins an maybe he loses but weuns weuns already done lost cassius started to answer but what could he say that gracchus hadnt y es the front was richmond there had always been a danger in putting the confederate capital so close to the us border richmond made a magnet for us ambitions mcclellan had threatened it in the war of secession a better general likely would have taken it then even in the second mexican war the usa dreamt of marching in during the great war the flood tide of greengray had reached fredericksburg on its way south before the confederate government decided it had had enough and nownow jake featherston was redhot almost whitehot with fury but not even his unending unyielding rage could stiffen the confederate armies north of the capital god damn it to hell he screamed at nathan bedford forrest iii we need to bring more men into the line up there sir we havent got any more men to move forrest replied get em from somewhere jake said where do you recommend sir the chief of the general staff asked shall we pull them out of georgia or maybe out of alabama no jesus christ no featherston exclaimed the fucking countryll fall apart if we do the country was falling apart anyway but he knew it would fall apart faster if he pulled soldiers away from the sectors where they were fighting hardest what have we got left in the carolinas what was there is either up here or down in georgia forrest replied it has been for weeks he paused then licked his lips and asked are you sure you arent overworked mr president im tired of nobody doin what needs doini sure am tired o that jake growled thatsnot quite what i meant sir nathan bedford forrest iii licked his lips again dont you think the strain of command has been a little too much for you shouldnt you take a rest sir and come back to duty when youre refreshed and ready to face it again well i dont rightly know featherston said slowly do you really reckon im off the war hasnt gone the way we wish it would have and thats a fact forrest sounded relievedand surprisedthat jake wasnt hitting the armored ceiling in fourteen different places maybe somebody with a fresh slant on things can stop the damnyankees or at least get a peace we can live with out of them i suppose its possible but i wouldnt bet on it under the desk out of the generals sight jakes left hand hesitated between two buttons the first one the closer one would send the nearest guards rushing into the office but the chief of the general staff plainly had a coup in mind if he hadnt suborned those guards he wasnt worth the paper he was printed on who do you have in mind to take over afterwards you keep the son of a bitch talking jakes finger came down on the other button ill take military command nathan bedford forrest iii replied but i think vice president partridge is the better man to talk peace with the united states everything stays nice and constitutional that way he was keeping jake talking too waiting till his men got here to back his play you stupid piece of shit only way to get me out of this chair is to murder me featherston let a little anger show but only a littlethe sort he might show if he was thinking of stepping down do you reckon even the yankees are dumb enough to take don partridge seriously he demanded i sure as hell dont if hes speaking in the name of the president or as the president theyll have to listen to him nathan bedford forrests eyes kept slipping toward the door and then jerking back to jake the president of the csa wanted to look that way too but he didnt he had more discipline in his pinkie than forrest did in his whole worthless carcass so who all figures the countryd be better off without me jake asked don must be in on this too right how about clarence potter hes a fellow with pretty fair judgmentalways has been he was also a fellow featherston had suspected for years to his surprise forrest shook his head as a matter of fact no he thinks youre the best war leader weve got i used to think so too but he broke off there was a commotion outside shouts and screams and then a couple of gunshots and more screams and shouts one of the bullets punched through what was supposed to be bulletproof glass in the door almost spent it ricocheted off the wall above jakes head and fell harmlessly to the floor an instant later the door flew open with a crash four soldiers in camouflage uniforms burst into the presidents office jake and nathan bedford forrest iii pointed at each other arrest that man they both yelled four automaticrifle muzzles bore on the chief of the general staff so did the jake featherston plucked from a desk drawer hold it right there traitor one of the soldiers roared freedom the other three shouted they were party guards not army men nathan bedford forrest iii seemed to notice that for the first time his face turned gray as tobacco smoke jake featherston watched with almost clinical interest hed never seen a man go that color beforenot a live man anyhow how forrest gasped that used up all the breath he had in him he might have been a hooked crappie drowning in air he couldnt breathe what you reckon ive only got one set of guards round this place jake said you might be dumb enough to do something like that but i sure aint he turned to the men whod rescued him make sure everythings secure down here you find anybody you dont figure you can rely on grab the son of a bitch well sort out whos what later on in the meantime we squeeze answers out of this asshole hell sing hell sing like a fucking canary you bet boss one of the freedom party guardsa troop leadergrinned a sharptoothed grin once we get going we can make a rock sing the threestriper laughed so did featherston he wont be a rock he predicted part of him wanted to laugh at what an amateurish excuse for a coup nathan bedford forrest iii tried to bring off talking him into stepping down of his own accord if that wasnt the dumbest thing in the world jake didnt know what would be your granddadd be ashamed of you he told forrest greatgrandfather and no he wouldnthe didnt like tyrants any better than i do the suddenly former chief of the general staff replied he could talk a good game but some games werent about talk and hed never figured that out take him away jake said he didnt want to argue with forrest and he didnt have to either but the other man hadnt the least idea what he meant if the original nathan bedford forrest planned a coup he would have done it right this smudgy carbon copyhardly a forrest at all in looks except for the eyesdidnt know the first thing about how to manage one away he went perhaps too numb to realize yet what kind of hell he was heading for well hed find out pretty damn quick the only thing that excused a plot was winning failure brought its own punishment jake went out into the antechamber lulu sat at her desk as calmly as if two army men didnt lie dead not ten feet away i knew youd take care of that foolishness mr president she said shall we call somebody to get rid of this carrion mmnot quite yet featherston answered let me bring in some more men im sure i can count on the worst thing about having somebody mount a coup was being unable to trust the people around you afterwards but if he couldnt count on the freedom party guards he couldnt count on anybodyand if he couldnt count on anybody nathan bedford forrest iiis strike would have worked like a charm jake went back to the telephone on his desk had forrest had the brains to suborn the operator and keep the president from getting hold of loyal troops that might make things dicey even now but no within a minute featherston was talking with a regimental commander named wilcy hoyt who promised to secure the gray house grounds with his troops freedom hoyt said fervently as he rang off would the men who backed forrest fight would they try to take jake out reckoning it was their best chance in their shoes featherston would have done that he still had his but the pistol was there to protect him against a visitor who turned out to be an assassin it wouldnt help much against a squad of soldiers determined to do him in as soon as he got off the telephone with hoyt he went out and grabbed an automatic rifle from one of the dead guards even that wouldnt do him as much good as he wished but it was better than the pistol if he had to go down he aimed to go down fighting will there be more shooting mr president lulu asked well i dont know for sure but there may be jake answered hand me that other rifle then his secretary said featherston stared at her as if shed suddenly started speaking swahili you know how to use it would i ask if i didnt she said he gave her the tredegar she could handle it all right and two rifles blasting anybody who tried to break in were bound to be better than one where the devil did you learn something like this jake inquired a womens selfdefense course lulu answered primly i thought id be shooting at yankees though not traitors rifle works the same either way jake said and she nodded he supposed shed feared assaults on her virtue his own view was that any damnyankee who tried to take it would have to be desperately horny and plenty nearsighted too he would never have said anything like that though he liked lulu and wouldnt hurt her for the worldwhich he wouldnt have said about most people he knew but the people who showed themselves at the doorway to the outer office were freedom party guards featherston loyalists jake had the first few come in without their weapons and with their hands up they obeyed the obvious joy they showed at seeing him alive and in charge of things left him with no doubt that they were on his side when theyd set up a perimeter outside the office he began to feel more nearly certain things were going his way get me another outside line he told lulu she nodded jake snorted in soft contempt no nathan bedford forrest hadnt known thing one about running a coup well too goddamn bad for him jake got down to business put me through to saul goldman yes mr president lulu said and she did that the confederate director of communications remained free made jake snort again didnt forrest know you couldnt run a country without propaganda evidently he didnt hed left the best liar and rumormonger in the business alone had saul said no how would forrest have publicized his strike even if he pulled it off no need to flabble about that now saul this heres jake featherston rasped can you record me over the telephone and get me on the air weve had us a little commotion here but we got it licked now hold on for about a minute and a half sir the imperturbable jew replied i need to set up the apparatus and then you can say whatever you need to he took a bit longer than hed promised but not much go ahead mr president thank you kindly jake paused to gather his thoughts he didnt need long either im jake featherston and im here to tell you the truth truth is that a few damn fools reckoned they could do a better job of running our precious country than me other truth is that the traitors were wrong and theyll pay oh boy will they ever a nother new exec sam carsten wondered what hed get this time hed had one pearl of great price and one burr under the saddle the powers that be might have told him to make do without he could have done it but it wouldnt have been any fun he would have had to be his own ogre instead of playing the kindly benevolent old man most of the time but a new officer had been chosen and brought down to the destroyer escort on a flying boat and now lieutenant lon menefee bobbed in the light swells of the south atlantic as a real boat carried him from the seaplane to the josephus daniels permission to come aboard sir he called when the boat drew up alongside the warship by the matteroffact way he said it the josephus daniels might have been moored in the boston navy yard not out on her own god only knew how many hundred miles from the nearest land permission granted sam said just as formally a rope ladder tied to the port rail invited lieutenant menefee upward he stood up in the boat grabbed the ladder and climbed steadily if not with any enormous agility a couple of sailors stood by to grab him as he came over the rail he turned out not to need them which made sam think better of him reporting as ordered sir he said with a crisp salute good to have you aboard returning the salute gave carsten the chance to look him over he liked what he saw menefee was in his late twenties with a round face a solid build and dark whiskers that said he might have to shave twice a day his eyes were also dark and showed a wry amusement that would serve him wellif sam wasnt just imagining it of course among the fruit salad on his chest was the ribbon for the purple heart pointing to it sam asked howd you pick that up a japanese dive bomber hit my destroyer somewhere north of kauai menefee replied with a shrug i got a fragment in the leg the petty officer next to me got his head blown off so i was lucky if you can call getting wounded lucky all depends on how you look at things sam said next to not getting hurt getting wounded sucks but it beats the hell out of getting killed like you said yes sir lieutenant menefee cocked his head to one side i dont mean this any way bad at all sir but you arent what i expected carsten laughed if i had a nickel for every officer who served under me and said the same thing id havea hell of a lot of nickels anyway who expects to run into a twostriper old enough to be his father thats not what i had in mind besides i already knew you were a mustang menefee said but youre not he paused visibly weighing his options then he plunged like a man throwing a doublesawbuck raise into a poker game youre not a hardass the way i figured you might be he had nerve he had smarts too if that had rubbed sam the wrong way it could have blighted things between skipper and exec from then on out but menefee had it rightsam wasnt a hardass except every once in a while when he needed to be i hope notlifes mostly too short he said now how come you had me gauged that way well i knew the executive officer you had before didnt last very long lon menefee said if youre in my shoes that makes you wonder mm i can see that it would sam allowed why dont you come to my cabin then we can talk about things without every sailor on the ship swinging his big flapping hydrophones towards us hydrophones huh menefees eyes crinkled at the corners his mouth didnt move much but sam liked the smile anyway lead on sir you know where were going ill give you the grand tour in a bit sam said come on after he closed the door to the captains little cabin he pulled a bottle of brandy and a couple of glasses from the steel desk by his bed medicinal of course lieutenant menefee observed well sure sam said pouring good for what ails you whatever the devil it is he handed the new exec one of the glasses mud in your eye they both drank the brandy wasnt the best sam had ever hadnowhere close but it was strong which mattered more so you want to hear about the old exec do you if im going to sail these waters sir shouldnt i know where the mines are that seems fair enough sam said and told him the story of myron zwilling he finished this is just my side of it you understand if you listen to him im sure youd hear something different one corner of his mouth quirked upward yeah just a little ill bet you one thing sir menefee said he wouldnt figure the story had two sides hed tell me his was the only one and hed get mad if i tried to tell him anything different i wouldnt be surprised sam said zwilling hadnt had any doubts sure as hell that was part of his problem do you see things in black and white or are there shades of gray for you i hope theres gray menefee said black and white make things easier but only if you dont want to think that sounded like the right answer but did he mean it or was he saying what he thought his new skipper wanted to hear ill find out sam thought aloud he said things aboard ship are pretty much cutanddried right now theyll stay that way too i hope unless we need to pick another prize crew ill be all right with that menefee said i just got here so i dont know who doesnt like me and who really cant stand me those are about the only choices an exec has arent they pretty much sam said is this your first time in the duty yes sir the younger man replied by the way he said it a second term as executive officer wouldnt be far removed from a second conviction for theft maybe he wasnt so wrong either didnt a second term as exec say you didnt deserve a command of your own just play it straight and i expect youll do fine carsten said hoping he was right pretty soon youll have a ship of your own and then somebody else will do your dirty work for you menefee grinned ive heard ideas i like lessill tell you that but i dont know the wars liable to be over before they get around to giving me my own command and after that the navyll shrink like nobodys business or do you think im wrong sir it worked that way the last time aroundi remember sam said this time well who knows after we get done beating the confederates on land well still need ships to teach argentina a lesson and england and japan one of these days the japsll have to learn they cant screw around with the sandwich islands can we go on with the little fights once the big ones over will anybody care or will people be so hot for peace that they dont give a damn about anything else well find out thats all sam said the questions impressed him plainly lon menefee had an eye for what was important that was a good asset for an executive officeror anybody else all we can do is what they tell us to do sam went on and reached for the brandy bottle want another knock no thanks menefee said ones plenty for me but dont let me stop you im not gonna do it by myself sam put the bottle back into the desk drawer he eyed menefee and wasnt astonished to find the new officer eyeing him too theyd both passed a test of sorts the exec would have a friendly drink but didnt care to take it much further than that and menefee had seen that while sam didnt live by the navys officially dry rules he wasnt a closet lush either and neither of them had said a word about it and neither would as the desk drawer closed menefee said will you give me the tour then and let me meet some of the sailors who wont be able to stand me he spoke without rancor and in the tones of a man who knew how things workedand that they would work that way no matter what he thought about it the slightly crooked grin that accompanied the words said the same thing sam approved having a similar view of the world himself he took menefee to the bridge first thad walters had the conn which meant a petty officer was minding the yranging screens the josephus daniels just didnt carry a large complement of officers when sam told the new exec that the chief hydrophone operator was a cpo menefee raised one eyebrow but then nodded taking the news in stride lots of antiaircraft guns i saw that when i came aboard menefee remarked when they went out on deck thats right and i wish we carried even more sam said the only shiptoship action weve fought was with a freighter that carried a light cruisers guns we whipped the bastard too sam remembered the prideand the terrorof that north atlantic fight most of the time though airplanes are our numberone worry way things are nowadays warships cant get close enough to shoot at other warships so yeahtwin mm mounts all over the damn place and the fourinchers are dual purpose too sure theyve got more reach than the smaller guns lieutenant menefee nodded things look about the same to me if we dont find some kind of way to keep bombers off our backs the whole surface navys liable to be in trouble during the great war everybody flabbled about submersibles this time around its airplanes but as long as we bring our own airplanes with us we can fight anywhere and the carriers need ships to help keep the bad guys airplanes away from them so i figure we can keep working awhile longer anyhow sounds good to me sir menefee gave him another of those wry grins when they got to the engine room the new exec started gabbing with the black gang in a way that showed he knew exactly what he was talking about so you come from engineering sam said shows a little does it menefee said yes thats what i know how about you sir gunnery and damage control sam answered weve got the ship covered between usexcept for all the fancy new electronics i mean most of the guys who understand that stuff dont understand anything elselooks that way to me anyhow menefee said me too carsten agreed if you can figure out all the fancy circuits doesnt seem likely youll know how people work i wouldnt want one of those sliderule pushers in charge of a ship but then he stopped himself holding up his right hand thads an exception i think he can make the yranging gear sit up and roll over and beg but hes a damn good officer too youll see hes mighty young hes had the chance to get used to it right from the start menefee said sam nodded carefully holding in his smile to his eyes lon menefee was mighty damn young too but the new exec was rightthere were degrees to everything young younger youngest sam couldnt hide the smile any more where the hell did old fart fit into that scheme n ot richmond not any more richmond was a battleground basically everything north of the james was a battlegroundexcept for what had already fallen and the damnyankees had a couple of bridgeheads over the river too they hadnt tried to break out of them not yet but the confederates couldnt smash them either and so when clarence potter left lexington to report to jake featherston on what the physicists at washington university were up to he headed for petersburg instead of the doomed capital of the csa getting to petersburg was an adventure getting anywhere in the confederacy was an adventure these days but the confederate states had hung on to equality in the air in northern virginia maryland and southern pennsylvania longer than they had anywhere else theyd hung on and hung on and hung ontill they couldnt hang on any more that was how things stood now antiaircraft guns still blazed away at strafing us fighters and fighterbombers but antiaircraft guns were just annoyances what really held enemy aircraft at bay were your own airplanes and the confederates didnt have enough to do the job any more his motorcar went off the road several times it raced for a bridge once and hid under the concrete shelter with bullets chewing up the ground to either side till the aerial wolves decided they couldnt get him and went off after other easier game then cautiously the driver put the butternut birmingham in gear some fun huh potter said the look the pfc at the wheel gave him told him how flat the joke fell hope to jesus whatever the hell youre doin on the road is winthewar important the kid said if it aint we got no business travelin on account of the damnyankeesre too fuckin likely to shoot our dicks off sir potter wanted to clutch himself like a maiden surprised the mere thought was appalling reality was worse hed seen it he wanted no closer acquaintance with it than that but he said it just may be soldier if anything can nowadays its got a pretty fair chance hope so the driver said this time his suspicious stare was all too familiar how come you talk like a yankee yourself cause i went to college up there a million years ago and i wanted to fit in potter replied and if i had a dime for every time ive answered that question id be too rich to worry about an army post reckon well go through security before we get real far into petersburg the driver sounded as if he was looking forward to it which meant he didnt completely believe potter and if i had a dime for that too the intelligence officer thought he figured petersburg would be something out of dante and he was right soldiers and bureaucrats and civilian refugees thrombosed the streets people moved forward by shouting and waving fists and sometimes by shooting guns in the air potter saw bodies hanging from lampposts some said deserter others said spy he felt the drivers eye on him but pretended he didnt sure as hell there were security checkpoints almost every block papers the soldiers or freedom party guardsmore and more guards as potter neared the center of townwould shout the wreathed stars on his collar meant nothing to them considering that nathan bedford forrest iii and other highranking officers had risen against jake featherston that made more sense than potter wished it did then a freedom party guard checked off his name on a clipboard youre on our list said the man in a camouflage smock you come with me right now by the way he jerked the muzzle of his automatic rifle potter would be sorry if he didntalthough perhaps not for long where are you taking me potter asked never mind that get out of your auto and come along the party guard said not seeing any other choice but starting a firefight he couldnt hope to win potter got out of the birmingham good luck sir the driver said thanks potter hoped he wouldnt need it but it never hurt none of his escortcaptorsdemanded the pistol on his belt he wondered whether that was a good omen or simply an oversight one way or the other he figured hed find out before long now that weve got him what the hell do we do with him another party guard asked the one whod decided potter was a wanted man checked the clipboard again we take him to the lawn thats what he answered it meant something to the other freedom party guard if not to clarence potter the security troops hustled him along nobody laid a finger on him but nobody let him slow down either not quite a frogmarch but definitely something close the lawn on sycamore near the corner of liberty turned out to be a tall redbrick house much overgrown by ivy the grass in front of it had gone yellowbrown from winter cold more freedom party guards manned a barbedwire perimeter outside the house they relieved potter of the before letting him go forward before he could go inside a stonefaced army captain gave him the most thoroughand most intimatepatting down hed ever had the displeasure to get do you want me to turn my head and cough he asked as the captains probing fingers found another sensitive spot that wont be necessary the young officer didnt change expression at all necessarysir potter suggested he didnt usually stand on military ceremony but he was sick and tired of being treated like a dangerous piece of meat he watched the captain think it over the process took much longer than he thought it should have at last grudgingly the man nodded you are on the list and it looks like youre clean soit wont be necessary sir are you happysir dancing in the goddamn daisies potter replied that got the ghost of a grin from the young captain go on in then sir no audible pause this time the boss will take care of you who clarence potter began but the captain had already forgotten about him somebody else was coming up to the lawn and needed frisking those educated hands had more work to do muttering potter went on in when he saw lulu typing on a card table set up in the foyer he figured out what was going on she paused when she recognized him he almost laughed at the sniff she let out she never had liked himshe never thought he was loyal enough to the president but it wasnt funny any more the way things were these days suspicion of disloyalty was liable to be a capital offense general potter the presidents secretary said hello lulu potter answered gravely is he all right hes just fine she got to her feet you stay right thereas if he were likely to go anywhere ill tell him youre here the confederate states of america might be going down the drain but you couldnt tell from the way lulu acted she came back a moment later he wants to see you this way please this way took him through the living room down a hall past four more guardsany one of whom looked able to tear him in half without breaking a sweatand into a bedroom jake featherston was shouting into a telephone dont just sit there with your thumb up your ass goddammit hurry he slammed the handset down lulus cough said she disapproved of the bad language even more than of the man she escorted general potter is here to see you sir she said she still didnt care for potter though not even a little bit thank you darling jake said watching him sweettalk his secretary never failed to bemuse potter he wouldnt have bet featherston could do it if he hadnt seen it with his own eyes again and again come in potter sit down he pointed to a chair lulu hon please close the door on your way out please who would have thought it was in the presidents vocabulary lulu gave potter a fishy stare but she did as jake featherston asked reporting as ordered mr president potter said sinking into the overstuffed chair it was all red velvet and brass nails and looked like something from a victorian brothel how close are they to a uranium bomb featherston didnt waste time or politeness on potter the president looked like hell pale and haggard and skinny with big dark circles under his eyes how much did he sleep did he sleep at all potter wouldnt have bet on it theyre getting closer sir he answered theyre talking about months now not yearsif the damnyankees bombs dont set them back again months jesus christ we cant wait months jake howled havent they noticed this goddamn countrys falling apart around their ears atlanta richmond savannahs going and god only knows how long birmingham will last we need that fucker and we need it yesterday not tomorrow not todayyesterday months he rolled his eyes up to the heavens sir im just telling you what professor fitzbelmont told me potter said he also said that if you think you can find someone wholl do it better and faster you should put him in charge featherston swore there isnt anybody like that is there if there is mr president i sure dont know about him potter answered shall we try disrupting the us program again what the fuck difference does it make featherston said bitterly that alarmed potter whod never before heard him back away from anything even more bitterly the president went on shit theyre licking us without uranium bombs i never wouldve reckoned they could but they damn well are makes you wonder if we deserve to live doesnt it no sir i have to believe that potter said this is my country ill do everything i can for it featherston cocked his head to one side ask you something youre the president sir how can i say no you sure never had any trouble before but how come you didnt throw in with bedford forrest iii and the rest of those bastards sir were in a war we need you we need you bad whoever they brought in instead would have been worse chances are the yankees wouldnt have made peace with him either not this side ofwhat do they call itunconditional surrender that kills us way it looks to me is weve got to keep fighting because all our other choices are worse maybe the sliderule brigade can save us its the best hope weve got anyhow he realized hed just admitted he knew about forrests plot even if he hadnt gone along with it if jake wanted his head he could have it but that had always been true ever since the richmond olympics well i get straight answers from you anyway the confederate president said listen you go back and tell fitzbelmont i dont care what he does or who he killsweve got to have that bomb and faster than months get his head out of the clouds make sure he understands its his country too whats left of it ill do my best sir i dont know how much i can hurry the physicists though potter said youd better thats all ive got to tell you featherston said clarence potter nodded hed seen the president of the csa angry beforejake featherston ran on anger the way trucks ran on gasoline hed seen him gleeful hed seen him stubborn and defiant but nevernever till now anywayhad he seen him desperate n ext stop birmingham michael pound said exultantly it wasnt spring yet not even here in alabama where spring came early it wasnt spring no but something even sweeter than birdsong and flowers filled the air when pound sniffed he didnt just smell exhaust fumes and cordite and unbathed soldiers he smelled victory the confederates hadnt quit he didnt think they knew the meaning of the word some of their terrifying new barrels came into the front line without so much as a coat of paintstraight from the factories us bombers and now artillery were still trying to knock out the crews who fought those shiny metal monsters were brave no doubt about it but all the courage in the world couldnt make up for missing skill and while the confederate machines trickled from their battered factories in dribs and drabs us production went up and up maybe a new cs barrel was worth two of the best us model if the usa had four or five times as many barrels where it mattered how much did that individual superiority matter not enough pound guided his barrel past the guttering corpse of a machine that had tried conclusions with several us barrels at once that might have been a brave mistake but a mistake it undoubtedly was the confederates had made so many big mistakes they couldnt afford even small ones any more somebody not far away fired an automatic rifle maybe that was a us soldier with a captured weapon on the other hand maybe it was a freedom party guard aiming at a barrel commander riding along with head and shoulders out of the cupola regretfully michael pound decided not to take the chance he ducked down into the machine where the hell are we sir sergeant scullard asked the gunner didnt get nearly so many chances to look around as the barrel commander did despite having those chances pound needed to check a map before he answered far as i can tell were just outside of columbiana and where the fucks columbiana unless you were born and raised in central alabama that was another reasonable question twenty maybe thirty miles from birmingham south and a little bit east pound said towns got a munitions plant in it run by the c b churchill companythats what the map notes say anyhow fuck the gunner repeated this time as a term of general disapproval that means those butternut assholesll fight like mad bastards to keep us out theyve been fighting like mad bastards for almost three years pound said how much good has it done em were in the middle of alabama weve got em cut in half or near enough so it makes no difference if they had any brains theyd quit now because they cant win yeah and then theyd spend the next hundred years bushwhacking us scullard was not in a cheerful mood pound grunted the gunner might have meant that for a sour joke even if he did it made an unfortunate amount of sense in a standup fight the confederacy was losing but how much fun would it be to occupy a country where everybody hated your guts and wanted you dead after the great war the united states hadnt enjoyed trying to hold on to kentucky and houston and sequoyah if the usa tried to hang on to the whole csa well nobody ever said the army would go out of style any time soon pound said a good thing too scullard replied if were in deep shit now wed be in a lot deeper without this baby he rapped his knuckles on the breech of the barrels main armament adding i just wish we had more like it theyre coming pound said maybe not as fast as if wed started sooner but they are we can make more stuff than the confederates can sooner or later well knock em flat and its getting on toward sooner the words were hardly out of his mouth before a confederate antibarrel rocket slammed into a us machine a quarter of a mile away the greengray barrel brewed up sending an enormous and monstrously perfect smoke ring up and out through the open cupola fire and greasy black smoke followed an instant later as the barrel slewed to a stop pound didnt think anybody got out he swore under his breath the united states were making more stuff than the confederate states could yes sometimes thoughtoo damn often in factthe confederates made better stuff the automatic rifles their infantry carried these antibarrel rockets the screaming meemies that could flatten acres at a volley the longrange jobs that reached into the usathe enemy had talented engineers their cause stank like a dead fish but they were good at what they did scullard must have seen the us barrel go up too i hope we knock em flat sooner he said that way the mothers dont have the chance to come up with anything really nasty yeah michael pound said that marched with his own thoughts much too well fields and forest surrounded columbiana two routes led up to the town from the south a county road whose thin blacktop coat the barrels tracks quickly wrecked and a railroad line maybe a hundred yards to the west they were both nice and straight and pound couldnt have said which he distrusted more they both let the confederates see what was coming long before it got there and what they could see they were too likely to be able to hit that blazing barrel said as much of course banging your way through the woods was asking to get nailed by some kid in butternut crouching behind a pine tree youd never spot him till he fired off his stovepipe and that was too damn late pound stood up in the cupola he wanted to find out just how much us armor was close enough to follow his platoons lead he hoped the other barrels would follow anyway if they didnt he was liable to end up slightly dead or more than slightly sometimes though a barrels engine was as important a weapon as its cannon this felt like one of those times accidentally on purpose he sent his orders over the allcompany circuit instead of the one that linked him to his platoon alone men we are going to charge up this miserable little road as fast as we can go we are going to blast anything that gets in our way and well be inside columbiana before featherstons fuckers figure out what hit em i hope follow me if this goes wrong theyll get my barrel first he switched to the intercom so he could talk to his driver you hear that beans yes sir the drivers name was neyer but he rarely had to answer to it his fondness for one particular ration can had given him a handle hed keep till he took off his uniformor till he got blown to smithereens which might happen in the next couple of minutes dont think about it pound told himself if you think about it youll get cold feet then gun it he said he was sure his own platoon would come with him the restdont think about that either the engine roared the barrel zipped forward flat out it could do better than thirty on rough ground going like that would have torn out the kidneys of the men inside on the road it was tolerablebarely shoot first if you see anything pound advised shouting over the noise going this fast the stabilizer aint worth shit the gunner answered shoot first anyway even if you miss you make the other guy duck then you can make your second shot count scullard grunted pound knew damn well he was right but he could see that it wasnt the sort of thing where youd want to bet your life if you didnt have to as they neared columbiana they found there were confederate soldiers on the road the men in butternut hadnt figured the yankees would be dumb enough or crazy enough to thunder down on them like that the bow machine gun and the coaxial machine gun in the turret both started jackhammering the cs troops scattered give em a couple of rounds of he too pound said something to remember us by you know yes sir scullard said enthusiastically and then to the loader he the main armament thundered twice a ѕinch shell carried enough cordite to make a pretty good boom when it burst one round went off in the middle of a knot of fleeing confederates men and pieces of men described arcs through the air nice shot pound yelled only later did he remember he was cheering death and mayhem they were what he did for a living his stock in trade most of the time he took them for granted he wondered why he couldnt quite do it now then he did because the barrel roared into columbiana he had no time to think about killinghe was too busy doing it the barrel crew might have been an extension of his arm an extension of his will where the hell is lester street he muttered that was where the c b churchill company was and had been since a glance through the periscopes built into the cupola told him what he needed to know the biggest building in town the one with the stars and bars flying over it had to be the munitions factory send a couple of he rounds in there too he told the gunner let em know theyve just gone out of business right but before scullard could fire machinegun bullets rattled off the barrels sides and turret clattering but doing no harm the bow gunner sent a long burst into a general store with a big drink dr hopper sign out front pound had tried the fizzy water and thought it tasted like horse piss and sugar the enemy machine gun abruptly cut off boom boom pound watched holes appear in the munitions plants southern wall he giggled like a kid sometimes destruction for its own sake was more fun than anything else an alleged adult could do he wondered whether jake featherston had an advanced case of the same disease and then he got more in the way of destruction than even he wanted maybe one of those he rounds blew up something inside the factory maybe somebody in there decided hed be damned if he let the plant fall into us hands any which way it went sky high pound and his barrel were more than half a mile away even through inches of steel armor the roar was overwhelming the barrel weighed upwards of forty tons all the same the front end came off the ground the machine might have been a rearing horse except pound was afraid it would flip right over onto its turret scullards startled fuck said he wasnt the only one either but the barrel thudded back down onto its tracks pound peered out through the periscopes again one of the forward ones was cracked which said just how big a blast that was it must have knocked half of columbiana flat well he said we liberated the living shit out of this place f lora blackford was listening to debate on a national parks appropriation billnot everything congress did touched on the war though it often seemed that waywhen a house page hurried up to her his fresh features and beardless cheeks said he was about fifteen too young to conscript though the confederates were giving guns to kids that age using up their next generation for you congresswoman the page whispered he handed her an envelope and took off before she could even thank him she opened the envelope and unfolded the note inside come see me the second you get thisfranklin it said she recognized the assistant secretary of wars bold handwriting any excuse to get away from this dreary debate was a good one she hurried out of congressional hallleaving was much easier than getting inand flagged a cab the war department was within walking distance but a taxi was faster when franklin roosevelt wrote come see me the second you get this she assumed he meant it heck of a thing about this russian town isnt it the driver said im sorry i havent heard any news since early this morning flora said bet you will the cabby pulled up in front of the massiveand badly damagedwar department building thirtyfive cents maam here flora gave him half a dollar and didnt wait for change a newsboy waved papers and shouted about petrograd so something had happened in russia maybe the tsar was dead that might help the usas german allies she hurried up the scarred steps at the top her congressional id convinced the guards that she was who she said she was one of them telephoned roosevelts office deep in the bowels of the building when hed satisfied himself that she was expected he said jonesy herell take you where you need to go maam somebody will check you out as soon as you get inside check you out was a euphemism for pat you down the tightfaced woman who did it took no obvious pleasure from it which was something anyhow after she finished and nodded jonesywho looked even younger than floras own joshuasaid come along with me maam down they went stairway after stairway her calves didnt look forward to climbing those stairs on the way up franklin roosevelt had a special elevator because of his wheelchair but no mere congresswomannot even a former first ladygot to ride it here we go jonesy stopped in front of roosevelts office ill take you up when youre done dont go wandering around on your own nobody ever came out and said that but it always hung in the air the captain in the assistant secretary of wars outer office nodded to flora hello congresswoman you made good time go right inmr roosevelt is expecting you thanks flora said can you tell me what this is about i think hed better do that maam shrugging flora walked into franklin roosevelts private office hello flora close the door behind you would you please thanks as always roosevelt sounded strong and jovial but he looked like death warmed over he waved her to a chair as she sat she asked now will you tell me whats going on it must be something big petrograds gone roosevelt said bluntly a newsboy outside was saying something about that flora said why does it matter so much to us to the kaiser sure but to us and what do you mean gone when i say gone i usually mean gone franklin roosevelt answered one bomb off the map gone gone no more petrograd gone but thats imposs flora broke off she was as far from catholic as she could be but she felt the impulse to cross herself even so she was glad she was sitting down oh my god she whispered and wanted to start the mourners kaddish right after that the germansuranium she stopped she wasnt making any sense even to herself but she made enough sense for roosevelt he nodded his face thoroughly grim thats right they got there first they tried itand it works god help us all do they have more of them questions started to boil in floras head what are they saying and what about the russians have england and france said anything yet we got a ciphered message yesterday that made me think they were going to try it the assistant secretary of war said they were cagey i would be too wouldnt be good to say too much if the other side is reading your mail so to speak and the kaiser just talked on wireless berlin he looked down at a piece of paper on his desk we have harnessed a fundamental force of nature he said the power that sets the stars alight now also shines on earth a last warning to our foesgive up this war or face destruction you cannot hope to escape my god flora said and then again my god once youd said that what was left nothing she could seenot for a moment anyhow then she did find something how close are we were getting there roosevelt said which might mean anything or nothing the exasperated noise flora made said it wasnt good enough whatever it meant roosevelt spread his hands as if to placate her the people out in washington say were getting close he went on i dont know if that means days weeks or months they swear on a stack of bibles that it doesnt mean years it had better not not after all the time theyve already used and all the money weve given them flora said if not for the money she never would have known anything about the us project and she found another question one she wished she didnt need to ask how close is jake featherston even with the stars and stripes flying in richmond for the first time since she thought of the confederacy boiled down to the terrifying personality of its leader so did franklin roosevelt as his answer showed we still think hes behind us were plastering his uranium works every chance we get and we get more chances all the time because were finally beating down the air defenses over lexington his people have put a lot of stuff underground but doing that must have cost them time if were not ahead hes got miracle workers and i dont think he does alevai flora said and then do they have any idea how many dead there are in petrograd part of her wished she hadnt thought of that most of the dead wouldnt be soldiers or sailors some would be factory workers and she supposed you could argue that the people who made the guns mattered as much in modern war as the people who fired them all the generals did argue exactly that in fact but so many would be street sweepers and dentists and waitresses and schoolchildrenthousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands from one bomb my god she exclaimed again franklin roosevelt shrugged the broad shoulders that went so strangely with his withered useless legs flora i just dont know i dont think anyone knows yetnot the germans not the russians nobody right nowright now the whole world just took a left to the chops its standing there stunned trying not to fall over that wasnt the comparison flora would have used but it was vivid enough to make her nod before she could say anythingif she could find anything to say beyond one more my godthe captain from the outer office came in and nodded to roosevelt sir the tsar just issued a statement what did he say roosevelt and flora asked at the same time the captain glanced down at a piece of paper in his left hand he calls this a vicious unholy murderous weapon and he condemns the massacre of innocents it caused that went well with floras thoughts did he say anything about surrender franklin roosevelt asked no sir the young officer shook his head but he did say god would punish the kaiser and the accursed scientists and people of germanyhis wordseven if the russian army couldnt do the job how can he keep fighting if germany can drop bombs like that and he cant flora asked not really aiming the question at either roosevelt or the captain was god listening if he was would he have let that bomb go off moscow minsk tsaritsyn she ran out of russian cities she did yes but she was sure the germans wouldnt russia always takes more losses than her enemies the assistant secretary of war said thats the only way she stays in wars but losses on that kind of scale i dont think so not for long if the tsar tries to go on fighting and the germans drop one of those on moscow say dont you think all the reds whove gone underground will rise up again the captain asked wouldnt you how many reds are left flora asked didnt the tsars secret police kill off as many as they could after the last civil war they sure did franklin roosevelt said and the captain nodded roosevelt went on we know the secret police didnt get everybody though and the reds are masters at going underground and staying there they have to be if they want to keep breathing the captain added so the short answer is nobodynobody on this side of the atlantic thats for sureknows how many reds there are roosevelt said something like a uranium bomb will bring them out though if anything will and if it doesnt kill them the captain said chances are there are a lot of them close to petrograd and moscow flora nodded those were the two most important russian cities and the reds were like anybody elsetheyd want to stay as close to the center of things as they could her thoughts went west england and france have to be shaking in their boots right now she said unless theyve got bombs of their own i mean if they had them they would use them roosevelt said the war in the west has turned against themnot as much as the war here has turned against the csa but enough if the kaisers barrels really get rolling across holland and belgium and northern france it wont be easy to stop them this side of paris paris flora echoed the germans hadnt got there in the french asked for an armistice before they could kaiser wilhelm granted it too looking back that was probably a mistake like the confederates the french werent really convinced theyd been beaten this time the germans ought to parade through the streets the way they did in sounds good to me roosevelt said keep it under your hat but ive heard charlie la follettes going to go to richmond is it safe flora asked not even a little bit but hes going to do it anyhow roosevelt answered abe lincoln couldnt god knows james g blaine couldnt even my democratic cousin theodore couldnt but la follette can and theres an election this november good point flora agreed how many votes would each photo of president la follette in the ravaged and captured capital of the confederacy be worth maybe as many as the uranium bomb had killed and that was bound to be a lot viii i n in in sergeant hugo blackledge bellowed move your sorry asses before you get em shot off corporal jorge rodriguez hurried aboard the little coastal freighter fires in savannah lit up the docks almost bright as day every so often a flash and a boom would mark another ammo dump or cache of shells going up in smoke the port was falling anybody who stayed to try to hold up the damnyankees would end up dead or a pow orders were to get out as many soldiers as could escape nervously rodriguez looked up into the sky if any fighters came over right now they could chew his company to pieces but they mostly stayed on the runways after dark with a little luck this shipthe dixie princess her name waswould be far away from savannah by the time the sun came up ever been on a boat before gabe medwick asked no jorge admitted you a little rowboat fishin for bluegill an catfish his friend said this aint the same thing is it not hardly he answered his own question soldiers from eight or ten regimentsnot all of them even from the same divisionjammed the dixie princess they eyed one another like dogs uncertain whether to fight sailors in gray dungarees elbowed their way through the butternut crush they knew where they were going and what they were doing which gave them a big edge on the troops they were carrying the rumble of the engines got deeper rodriguez felt the deck vibrate under his boots the freighter pulled away from the pier and down the savannah river toward the sea only gradually did jorge realize there were antiaircraft guns on deck more sailors manned them some wore helmets painted gray others stayed bareheaded as if to say a helmet wouldnt make any difference in what they did a soldier near jorge lit a cigarette kill that you dumb dipshit sergeant blackledge yelled kill it you hear me you want some damnyankee to spot your match or your coal jesus god how fuckin stupid are you anyways all right all right the offender muttered down to the deck went the smoke a boot mournfully crushed it out now when it gets light yall got to keep your eyes peeled for damnyankee submarines blackledge went on one of them fuckers puts a torpedo in our guts its a hell of a long swim to land you know what i mean boy gabriel medwick muttered he sure knows how to make a guy feel safe jorge laughed that was so far wrong it was funny it would have been funny anyway if he werent aboard this floating coffin how many men were with him he wasnt sure but it had to be a couple of thousand a damnyankee submersible skipper who sank the dixie princess would probably get the biggest fanciest medal the usa could give out you reckon its true what happened to that town in russia somebody not far away from him asked its bullshit you ask me another soldier answered damn kaisers just runnin his mouth stands to reasona citys too fuckin big for one bomb to take out you hear about that medwick asked jorge he nodded i hear sн but i dont know what to believe what do you think i hope like anything its bullshit his buddy said if it aintif it aint we all got more trouble than we know what to do with if the germans have a bomb like that if its really real how long before the yankees do too ўmadre de dios jorge crossed himself one bomb one city you couldnt fight back against something like that not unlessmaybe we get those bombs too maybe gabe seemed doubtful if we get em we better get em pretty damn quick thats all i got to say otherwise its gonna be too late he wasnt wrong however much jorge wished he were the fall of savannah meant the confederate states were cut in half people were saying that richmond had fallen too and that jake featherston had got out one jump ahead of the us soldiers coming in some people said he hadnt got out but that didnt seem to be true because he was still on the wireless what can i do about any of that jorge wondered the only answer that occurred to him was not much he yawned it had to be somewhere not long after midnight he couldnt even lie down and go to sleep no room to lie down he dozed a little standing up the way only a tired veteran could dawn was just painting the eastern horizonall ocean flat out to the edge of the worldwith pink when he saw another ship ahead no it was a boat much smaller than the dixie princess it had a blinker that flashed morse at the freighter up on the bridge where no soldiers were allowed a sailormaybe an officeranswered back whats going on gabe medwick asked around a yawn beats me jorge answered we just gotta wait and find out if that didnt sum up a lot of soldiering what did the dixie princess changed course and followed the smaller craft toward the lowlying coast ahead her guide zigged and zagged in a way that made no sense to jorge and whatever the guide did the dixie princess did too then somebody said we better not hit one of them damn mines thats all i got to say thatd be worsen getting torpedoed a light went on in jorges head they had to be heading towards a port one warded by mines to keep out us warships and the small boat knew the way through the floating death traps jorge hoped like hell it did anyhow welcome to beaufort a sign said jorge would have guessed the name was pronounced bofort what his guess was worth he found out when a man with bushy white side whiskers called welcome to bewfort yall where dyou go from here jorge hadnt the faintest idea somebodyprobably an officercalled wheres your train station mile outside o town the oldtimer said pointing west we like our peace and quiet we do aint but one train a day anyways jesus h christ the officer exploded this is as bad as it wouldve been before the war of secession no sir the whitewhiskered man shook his head we had the hurricane back in and the really bad one back in an we came through both o them and besides we was full o niggers in the old days aint hardly got no more coons around now though dont hardly miss em neither more room for the rest of us by god odds were the negroes had done most of the hard work sailors had to jump down from the dixie princess and grab the mooring lines that bound her to the pier gangplanks thudded onto the rickety planking disembark form up in column of fours an officer shouted we will proceed to the railroad station and board transportation for virginia well now we know what were doing anyway gabe medwick said sн jorge nodded but one train a day how big a train is it gonna be how long we gonna have to wait he looked up at the sky which was sunny and blue we aint that far from savannah even now what if a damnyankee airplane sees us they come and drop bombs on our heads thats what better not happen thats all ive got to say medwick shivered at the idea though the day felt more like spring than winter down the gangplanks went the soldiers as corporals jorge and gabe tried to gather their squads together but they didnt have much luck the soldiers had got too mixed up in the desperate boarding in savannah hell with it sergeant blackledge saidhe was trying to gather a whole section and having no more success than the squad leaders well sort things out when we get wherever the hell were going they marched through beaufort though it wasnt at all far from savannah the war might have forgotten all about it only some small shabby houses with broken windows and with doors standing open spoke of the blacks whod lived here till not long before old men and those too badly maimed to fightand a few women toocrewed fishing and oystering boats truck gardens grew all around the town women and kids and the old and injured tended them too at the station the railroad agent stared at the long butternut column in unabashed horror what in gods name am i supposed to do with yall he said get on the telegraph get trains down here dammit an officer answered we got out of savannah they want us up in virginia fuck me if were gonna walk well ill try the agent said doubtfully you better the officerhe was jorge saw a colonel with three stars on each side of his collardidnt even bother disguising the threat the agent clicked away on the telegraph a few minutes later an answer came back theyll be here in twothree hours he reported jorge would have bet that the time promised would stretch and it did the trains didnt get there till midafternoon he had enough food in his pockets and pouches to keep from getting hungry before then but he wondered if anybody would feed the soldiers on the way north he wondered how bad the fighting would be too hed served in virginia before coming down to tennessee wherever things get tough thats where they send me he was surprised at how little he resented that it wasnt as if he were the only one in the same boat on the train his two stripes won him a seat even if it was hard and cramped what with all the men standing in the aisles he counted himself lucky no matter how uncomfortable he was he didnt stay awake long his eyes opened again when the train rolled through the town of st matthews except for a good many women wearing widows weeds the place seemed as untouched by the war as beaufort jorge wasnt used to landscapes that hadnt been torn to bits a town with all its buildings intact without barricades and foxholes and trenches seemed unnatural it does doesnt it gabe medwick said when he remarked on that its like the place isnt important enough to blow up almost jorge hadnt looked at it quite like that which didnt make gabe wrong he turned to ask one of the soldiers in the aisle what he thought only to discover that the man was sound asleep standing up much deeper under than jorge had been on the dixie princess how exhausted did you have to be to lose yourself so completely while you were upright after that the train passed into north carolina there was a sign by the tracks that said so the license plates on the autos went from white with blue letters and numbers to orange with black other than that he couldnt see any difference if the confederate states had a safe haven he was rolling through it somebody at the front of the car dished out ration tins from a crate they werent good but they were better than nothing drinks were bottles of dr hopper warm and fizzy jorge belched enormously virginia was another sign at the border and motorcar license plates with yellow characters on a dark green background it was also before long the cratered shattered bombedout landscape jorge had grown used to he nodded to himself he knew what hed be doing here r and r armstrong grimes had gone out of the line in hostile country before did the people in utah hate us soldiers even more than the people here in georgia did he wouldnt have been surprised but the locals here had nastier weapons with which to make their lack of affection known that meant camp freedomthe name had to be chosen with malice aforethoughthad maybe the most extensive perimeter armstrong had ever seen foxholes and barbedwire emplacements and machinegun nests and entrenchments gobbled up the fields for a couple of miles around the camp on all sides shit on toast squidface said as armstrongs weary platoon made its way through the maze of outworks what alls inside here the fucking united states mint they dont have soldiers the bad guys go and take the mint away armstrong said well yeah sarge sure squidface spoke in calm reasonable tones but they care about money and they mostly dont care about us armstrong grunted it wasnt as if the pfc were wrong soldiers got the shitty end of the stick every day of the week and twice on sundays if the other side didnt screw you the assholes in greengray who stayed safe behind the line would the only people he trusted these days were smelly dirty men in ragged uniforms that said they actually did some fighting they knew what was what unlike the jerks who campaigned with typewriters and telephones he didnt love mps either not even a little bit one of the snowdropshe wore a white helmet and faggy white glovespointed and said delousing station and showers are over that way wheres your officer anyway in the hospital armstrong jabbed a thumb at his own chest this is my outfit now the mp sniffed a platoon with a sergeant in command couldnt be anything much his attitude said somebody from the back of the platoon said boy featherstons fuckersd send him to graves registration in nothing flat who said that goddammit the mp shouted ill kick the crap out of you whoever you are dont worry sergeant ill deal with him armstrong promised all right so the snowdrop wasnt yellow but he didnt realize combat troops wouldnt fight fair theyd ruin him or kill him and then laugh about it getting away in a hurry was the best plan back in the great war armstrongs father said delousing meant baking your clothes and bathing in scalding water full of nasty chemicals none of which kept the lice down for long the spray that a boredlooking corporal turned on the men now was nothing like that but it had one advantage over the old procedure it really worked there was nothing wrong with showering under scalding water wish i had a steel brush to get all the dirt off squidface said snorting like a whale yeah well if you didnt have a goddamn pelt there you could get clean easier armstrong said squidface was one of the hairiest guys hed ever seenhe had more hair on his back than a lot of guys did on their chest if the confederates ever kill you theyll tan your hide for a rug ahh your mother squidface said only somebody whod saved armstrongs bacon plenty of times could have got away with that squidface qualified so did several other guys from the platoon after the shower food along with canned rations armstrong had eaten a lot of fried and roasted chicken in the fieldplenty of henhouses around and you didnt need much more than a skillet or in a pinch a sharp stick to do the cooking but this was fried chicken done right not half raw and half burnt the hash browns were crisp and just greasy enough too he couldnt remember the last time hed seen a regular potato that didnt come out of a can yams and sweet potatoes were all right for baking but they just didnt cut it when you sliced them up and put them in hot lard and apple pie and vanilla ice cream on top goddamn squidface said reverently i think i just came in my pants i know what you mean the size of the bite armstrong took would have made a boa constrictor jealous i want a slice of cheese to put on my pie not ice cream herk said the replacement was a veteran now entitled to a veterans gripesand entitled to get razzed like a veteran too herk wants to cut the cheese squidface held his nose you were the one who came in your pants herk retorted me i want a broad up and down the long table soldiers nodded solemnly armstrong among them this camp had everything for giving soldiers a good time except a whorehouse bluenoses made sure the us army didnt officially sponsor any such thing if you wanted a woman you had to find your ownwhich could get you killed if you picked the wrong one and could easily leave you with a disease that would land you in big trouble when the army found out youd caught it squidface had several suggestions on how herk could satisfy himself each more alarming than the one before shut up already armstrong said after a while youre making me lose my appetite you better show up for sick call in the mornin sarge squidface said somethings sure as shit wrong with you the line for the nightly movie was almost as long as the one for a brothel would have been armstrong got a seat just before they showed the newsreel here is the first film from ruined petrograd the announcer said importantly armstrong had seen plenty of ruined cities hed seen provo and salt lake city and you couldnt ruin a place any worse than they got ruined or he thought you couldnt till the camera panned across what was left of petrograd the russian town was leveled all the way out to the horizon when the camera got to something that stuck up from the devastation it moved in for a closer look it was an enormous bronze statue of a man on horsebackor it had been now it looked melted melted from the top down armstrong tried to imagine what kind of heat could have done such a thing this was the statue of peter the great who founded petrograd the announcer said now he demonstrates the power of our allies scientific accomplishments fuck our allies squidface said we dont get one of those ourselves pretty damn quick the goddamn kaiserll drop one on philly next that struck armstrong as a pretty good guess he made a guess of his own what do you want to bet featherstons got guys in white lab coats working on one too with his fucking rockets he could throw one anywhere in the usa shit squidface looked around as if expecting one of those rockets to crash down any second now youre right as a matter of fact armstrong was wrong the most powerful confederate rockets reached only a couple of hundred miles that meant they couldnt touch most of the usa especially since the areas cs soldiers actually controlled shrank by the day but with a bomb like that worry outran reality with ease on our side of the atlantic the newsreel announcer said the screen showed the charred wreckage of gracious homes that had to date back to long before the war of secession it showed sunken ships in a bombedout harbor district it showed dirty unshaven confederate soldiers shambling off into captivity we was there we seen that squidface said better believe it armstrong agreed on our side of the atlantic the capture of savannah cuts the confederate states in half the announcer said proudly this on the heels of the loss of richmond the stars and stripes flew over the wreckage of the confederate capitol us soldiers prowled the cratered grounds of the gray house walking past twisted and overturned antiaircraft guns scrawny civilians got meals at a us field kitchen how long can the enemy hope to keep up his useless resistance in the face of overwhelming us might the announcer asked as if the soldiers watching the newsreel would be able to tell him the answer they were supposed to give him was not very long armstrong had seen enough propaganda to understand that but this time the newsreel had outsmarted itself the fearsome bomb that leveled petrograd made you think twice it made armstrong think twice anyhow if the confederates came up with one of those or more than one before the united states could they were liable to win the war in spite of losing their capital and getting their country cut in half drop something like that on philadelphia and new york and boston and the united states would really have something to worry about drop one on birmingham armstrong thought savagely drop one on new orleans drop one on fucking charleston like most people from the usa he particularly despised the city where the war of secession broke out after the newsreel came a short feature with the engels brothers involved with an actor plainly meant to be jake featherston ill reduce your population he yelled which made the brothers get into a ridiculous brawl to see which of them would be eliminated that was all propaganda too but it was funny armstrong and squidface grinned at each other in the darkness and the main feature was a thriller with the confederates after the secret of a new bombsight and the heroine thwarting them at every turn she was pretty and she had legs up to there which might have made armstrong root for her even if she saluted the stars and bars after the feature he got to lie down on a real bed he hadnt done much of that latelyoh a few times when he flopped in a house some georgians had vacated but not very often with snoring soldiers all around him he could relax and sleep deep out in the field he might as well have been a wild beast the least little noise would leave him not just awake but with his heart pounding and with a rifle or a knife in his hand bacon and eggs and more hash browns and halfway decent coffee the next morning were wonderful too so was eating them without peering this way and that afraid of holdouts and snipers and his own shadow if it caught him by surprise you know this is pretty damn good i could really get used to this he was surprised at how surprised he sounded it is isnt it squidface sounded surprised too had he been in the war from the start armstrong didnt know but hed sure been in it long enough to turn into a vet i think this is called peace we used to have it all the time armstrong didnt think about those days very often hed gone from high school almost straight into the army hed been a boy then if he wasnt a man now he didnt suppose he ever would be not quite peace squidface said no pussy around we went through that when we got here well yeah we did armstrong admitted all right it isnt quite peace but it beats the shit outa where we were at before squidface solemnly nodded and stuffed another slice of bacon into his mouth t hey gave george enos shore leave after he helped bring the tierra del fuego back to new york city they gave it to him and then they forgot about him he grabbed a train up to boston had a joyous reunion with connie and the boys and set out to enjoy himself till the navy decided what the hell to do with him next the navy took so long george wondered whether he ought to look for a slot on a fishing boat going out of t wharf he could have had one in a minute the navy had sucked in a lot of firstclass fishermen but he had plenty of money as things were with so much back pay and combat pay in his pocket and if he was out a few hundred miles from shore when he got called back to active duty there would be hard feelings all around his wouldnt matter the navys unfortunately would he was back from church one sunday morning when the telephone in his apartment rang hed found he liked catholic services hed converted for connies sake and never expected to take the rigmarole seriously but the fancy costumes and the latin and the incense grew on him if you were going to have a religion shouldnt you have one with tradition behind it i bet thats my ma connie said as she went to answer the call she was saying she wants us over for dinner hello the pause that followed stretched too long as soon as she spoke again her tone told george it wasnt her mother on the other end of the line yes hes here hold on george its for you im coming george said connies stricken face told him who the caller was likely to be he answered formally something he rarely did this is george enos hello enos this is chief thorvaldson at the navy yard the oregons going to put to sea day after tomorrow and shes got a slot for a mm loader you fit that slot and youve had a long leave report aboard her by tomorrow the oregon right chief george said what he had to say standing there beside him connie started to cry he put his arm around her which only made things worse a battleship enos youre coming up in the world the cpo said you could hide your old destroyer escort in her magazines sure george said and hung up he didnt much want to sail on a battleship like a carrier it would draw enemy aircraft the way a dog drew fleas but he couldnt do anything about that either with a sigh he tried to smile at his wife we knew it was coming babe wars getting close to over so i probably wont be gone real long now i dont want you gone at all she clung to him fiercely and things can still go wrong at the end of a war look at your father he wished hed never told her that story then he shrugged he would have thought of it himself too he jumped when the telephone rang again connie picked it up hellooh hi ma god i wish youd been on the line a few minutes agoyes we can come but we cant stay late george just got a call from the navythe oregon tomorrow morningbye she hung up pas got lobsters so itll be a good supper anyway wont see them in the navy george agreed lobsters drawn butter corn on the cobit wasnt quite a traditional new england boiled dinner which didnt mean it wasnt damn good enjoy it george connies father said sliding a narragansett ale down the table to him navy chow aint even like what the cookie makes on a fishing boat i know that its the truth mr mcgillicuddy george said sadly he took a pull at the cold bottle of ale it wasnt bad but hed had better he didnt say anything about that narragansett went back further than he did how long have they been brewing this stuff anyway its been around about as long as i have and i was born in mcgillicuddy answered cant tell you exactly cause i wasnt paying much attention to beer back then but thats about it anyhow sounds right george said he was born in and narragansett had been a boston fixture his whole life long he took another swig from the bottle what with all the food and the gansett he wanted to roll over and go to sleep when he and connie and the boys got back to their apartment but he wanted to do something else too and he did connie would have thought something was wrong with him if he hadnt and god only knew when hed get another chance gotta make it last he said lighting a cigarette to try to stretch the afterglow i should hope so connie poked him in the ribs dont want you chasing after chippies when your ship gets into some port that isnt boston not me george lied without hesitation not very often anyway he amended silently better not his wife poked him again give me one of those he could reach the nightstand more easily than she could he handed her the pack they were niagaras a us brandthey tasted of straw and he swore horse manure but they were better than nothing connie leaned close to him for a light he stroked her cheek thanks she said whether for the smoke or the caress he didnt know he managed an earlymorning quickie too connie wouldnt have put up with that except on a day when he was shipping out he kissed the boys goodbyethey bravely fought against the snifflesand duffel on his shoulder headed across the charles for the boston navy yard before he got in marine guards patted him down and searched the denim sack finding nothing more lethal than a safety razor and a clasp knife they let him through cant be too careful one of the leathernecks said last week down in providence this shithead showed up in a lieutenant commanders uniformhed rolled the officer in an alley behind a bar he blew up two guardspoor bastardsbut he didnt get to the ships and thats what counts story didnt make the news george said noi guess they sat on it the guard replied but one of the guys who bought a plot was my brotherinlaws best friend since they were kids i knew apple a little bit myself he was a good guy apple george had heard a lot of nicknames but that was a new one on him like a babys arm holding one the marine explained be some sad broads around ill tell you now pass on through finding the oregon was easy enough george looked for the biggest damn ship tied up at any of the piers and there she was a mountain of steel bristling with guns of all sizes up to the dozen fourteeninchers of her main armament she could smash anything that came within twenty miles of herbut in these days of airplane carriers how many enemy ships were likely to george shrugged that wasnt his worry he went up the gangplank and paused at the end catching the officer of the decks eye he said permission to come aboard sir the ood was a lieutenant george had had a twostriper for a skipper before granted the name said he poised pen and clipboard and you are george enos sir the officer checked him off the list youre new then he said and george nodded the ood went on what was your previous duty and your battle station i was on a destroyer escort sirthe josephus daniels my battle station was loader on a mm mount when they ordered me to duty here they said that was where youd put me he knew the powers that be would do whatever they damn well pleased but hed got his druthers in i can do just about anything if i have to i was a fisherman before the war and i came back to the usa in the prize crew of a freighter we took in the south atlantic uhhuh you realize we can check all this yes sir its all in my jacket anyway george wasnt talking about clothes but about the paperwork any sailor carried with him uhhuh the ood said again then he turned and called caswell yes sir a petty officer materialized behind him heres enos put him on the numberthree mm mounthes a loader show him where hes supposed to go for general quarters and where he can sling his hammock aye aye sir come on enos caswell had a thin clever face and cold gray eyes george didnt think getting him mad was a good idea youd pay for it and youd keep on paying maybe for years he didnt want to get the senior rating mad at him any which way show me where to go and what to do and ill go there and do it he said hed hoped for a bunk given the size of the battlewagon but he could live with a hammock it wasnt as if he hadnt had one beforeand the oregon would carry a much bigger crew than the josephus daniels did too caswell took him to his battle station first that he still had his duffel slung over his shoulder seemed to mean nothing to the petty officer caswell wasnt carrying anything himself after all george could see right away that the mm mounts on the oregons deck were added long after the ship was built that was no surprise every warship these days piled on as much aa as she could without capsizing the numberthree mount was on the port side well forward george eyed the awesome bulk of the two triple fourteeninch turrets not far away whats it like when they go off he asked loud caswell said and said no more no shit george thought that boom would probably blow the fillings out of your teeth and maybe the hair off your head he didnt want to think about the big guns going off when he had a hangover if that didnt kill you youd wish it would he looked up and down the deck yeah there was a lot of antiaircraft mms andcaliber andcaliber machine guns as well and the fiveinch guns of the secondary armament could fire aa rounds too anybody bores in on us we can make him mighty unhappy he remarked we better the petty officer replied we fuck up once were toast that was nothing but the truth a wellplaced bomb could sink even this floating fighting fortress caswell lit a cigarette he didnt offer george one but he did say come on ill take you below there were bunks on the oregon but there were also lots of hammocks since george was a new fish here his getting one was no manbitesdog story the sailors on either side of him seemed good enough guysa hell of a lot friendlier than caswell that was for sure give me the straight skinny george said to one of them a broadshouldered man who went by country is she a madhouse or is she a home shes a homemostly countrys harsh midwestern accent said he hadnt grown up near the sea mostly when do things go wrong the other sailor tipped him a wink youll find out he said and that was all george could get out of him l ieutenantcolonel jerry dover looked around at the latest place his supply dump had come to rest he looked at pete whod done a hell of a lot of retreating with him from edwardsville to albertville dover said reckon thatd make a good title for my memoirs when i write em up for your what the quartermaster sergeant gave him a blank look this albertville place dont look like its good for squat its bigger than edwardsville dover said pete couldnt very well argue edwardsville had had only a couple of hundred people in it albertville northwest of the other townon the road to huntsville in other wordshad three maybe even four thousand it boasted a cotton gin and a cotton mill and a cottonseedoil plant and a cornmeal mill the local high school bragged about how it trained future farmers while pete didnt argue he didnt seem much impressed either horseshits biggern dogshit too but shits still shit you ask me he pulled out a pack of raleighs with kentucky and tennessee lost with north carolina cut off from alabama even good tobacco was getting scarce seeing dovers longing expression he gave his superior a smoke and a light after his drag he added and the confederate states are in deep shit right now and thats the gods truth you think im gonna pat you on the ass and go no no everythings fine youre out of your tree dover answered theyre already knocking birmingham flat if we lose huntsville too were fucked pete finished for him without the rockets we cant do anything against the damnyankees yeah jerry dover smoked in quick worried puffs if birmingham and huntsville go whats left new orleans and little rock and texas god himself couldnt lick the usa with new orleans and little rock and texas and i bet he wouldnt be fool enough to try which is more than i can say for jake featherston pete looked around nervously jeez sir careful how you talk you seen how many soldiers theyve hanged from trees with defeatist around their necks they wont hang meor you either dover said were still doing our jobsand were doing em pretty goddamn well too thats a hell of a lot more than most people can sayincluding the president wasnt either one of us who lost richmond he says well get it back pete said freedom dover repliedwithout a doubt the most sardonic party salutation in the history of the csa in one politically safe word he called everybody whod ever believed anything jake featherston said an idiot hed believed some of those things himselfnot all of them but someso he knew he was an idiot too pete cocked his head to one side like a bird dog taking a scent firings picking up at the front jerry dover listened too shit youre right yankees are laying down more artillery than theyve used for a while if that doesnt mean another push is on its way cant afford many more pete said any more dover corrected if they start shelling huntsville and bombing it hows it going to keep doing what its got to do before pete could answer dovers field telephone jangled the noncom sketched a salute and ducked out of dovers tent albertville supply depot here dover said as he picked up the telephone he listened then answered im light on shells but ill send you what ive got he yelled for pete to come back would cicero sawyer be able to get him more artillery rounds after he sent off what he had here he had to hope so ill get em moving pete promised when dover told him what he needed we dont have as many as i wish we did though yeah i know i said the same thing dover answered anything is better than nothing though was anything enough better than nothing dover didnt know once more he had to hope the telephone rang again and then again the soldiers farther forward sounded more and more desperate things are falling apart up here one of them yelled we cant hold another cried ill send what i can dover said and rang up huntsville whatever youve got he told sawyer theyre taking it on the chin here ill do what i can cicero sawyer answered sounding much like dover himself we arent getting stuff as fast as i wish we would either great dover meant anything but what he said how are we supposed to fight a war if we dont have anything to fight with good question sawyer said if you dont have any other good questions class is dismissed he hung up swearing so did jerry dover after he finished cussing he checked to see how many clips he had for his automatic rifle he had the bad feeling he might need it before long the next time he saw pete he noticed the noncom was carrying a submachine gun petes eyes went to his weapon too neither of them said anything if you didnt talk about what worried you maybe it would go away and leave you alone or maybe it wouldnt as hed learned to do in the last war dover tracked the battle with his ears he didnt like what he was hearing the yankees seemed to be pushing forward straight toward his dump and they seemed to be outflanking it on both sides a corporal came up to him sir shouldnt we be getting ready to pull out of here yeah i guess maybe we should hed had to move or abandon a lot of dumps in the confederacys grinding retreat he wondered why he was dicking around with this one a staff cara butternut birmingham packed to the gills with officers and menrattled up to the supply dump get the hell out while you still can somebody yelled from inside the damnyankeesre right on our ass the auto jounced away the load it carried was too much for its springs maybe the load dover carried was too much for his but he started shouting the orders hed used so often before set the time charges in the ammo start blowing up the supplies come on dammit weve got to get out of here see where else we can make a stand shells started landing close by then machinegun bullets snapped and whined past his headnot aimed fire not yet but they meant us soldiers sure as hell were too damn close before long the yankees would see what they were aiming at and that wouldnt be good and the rounds were coming in from three sides not just from the front fuck dover muttered he really had waited too long this time he raised his voice to a shout get out men save yourselves hed just gotten in a truckload of newmodel field telephones lighter and better all around than the ones that had soldiered through the war they still sat in their crates he hadnt had a chance to send any of them forward yet he shot them up one short burst at a time if his own side couldnt use them he was damned if hed let the bastards in greengray get them come on sir lets get out of here pete sat behind the wheel of another military birmingham the irony of the autos name struck home for the first time here much too close to the city where it was made dover hopped in pete headed northwest toward huntsville they got maybe a quarter of a mile up one of the most godawful roads dovers kidneys had ever met when a burst of machinegun fire off to one side made the quartermaster sergeant grunt pete slumped over half his head blown off the birmingham started limping as if it had a flatlater dover found out it had two with no one controlling it it slewed off the bumpy asphalt and hit a pine tree luckily it wasnt going very fast dover was bruised and shaken but not hurt he bailed out hold it right there motherfucker somebody with a us accent yelled drop that piece or youre dead meat dover froze he looked around wildly for somewhere to run somewhere to hide if he moved the hidden yankee could plug him before he took more than a couple of steps slowly and carefully he set the automatic tredegar on the ground ive got a pistol on my belt he called im going to take it out and put it with the rifle dont get cute with it asshole that was another us soldier one with a deep bass rasp jerry dover couldnt see him we got enough firepower to saw you in half like a fuckin board the last person who thought i was cute was my mother dover said which won him raucous laughter from the unseen enemy troopers holding his between thumb and forefinger he laid it down next to the rifle then without being asked he raised his hands above his head you got me not two but four us soldiers cautiously came out of the bushes two of them had leaves and branches on their helmets held in place with strips of inner tube two carried ordinary springfields one a heavy clunky us submachine gun and one a captured cs automatic rifle they all needed shaves they smelled of old sweat and leather and tobacco and mud like soldiers in other words son of a bitch one of them said as they drew near we got us a light colonel the two stars on either side of dovers collar werent made to be visible from very far off why let snipers pick out officers the easy way cough up your ammo said the guy with the confederate weapon without a word dover gave him the clips he had left after shooting up the field telephones his captors also relieved him of watch and wallet and cigarettes he went right on keeping quiet they werent supposed to do that but it happened all the time and they didnt have to take him prisoner he could end up dead if any one of them decided to pull the trigger i guess we oughta send him back said the one with the deep voice he was a corporal and one of the pair with leaves nodding above his head officer like that the guys in intelligence can squeeze some good shit out of him maybe the yankee with the submachine gun aimed it at dovers face who are you buddy what do you do cmon sing my name is jerry dover im a lieutenant colonel dover rattled off his pay number i ran the supply dump back there by albertville according to the geneva convention he didnt have to say that selfpreservation argued it would be a good idea quartermaster huh no wonder you got good smokes the one with the deep voice said he turned to the guy with the automatic rifle take him back to battalion hq rudy dont plug him unless he tries to bug out gotcha rudy said he gestured with the captured weapon get movin pops you run its the last dumbass stunt you pull im not going anywhere except wherever you take me dover said he was so relieved not to get shot out of hand he didnt even resent the pops he was old enough to be the damnyankees father will you please bury my sergeant there he asked his captors pointing to the birmingham he was a good man we round up some more of you butternut bastards they can take care of it the corporal said the yankees werent going to dig for an enemy themselves move it rudy said hands still high jerry dover trudged off into captivity d uring the last war chester martin remembered the confederates had seen the writing on the wall in northern virginia as the summer of went on the spirit gradually leaked out of the men in butternut they wouldnt stand and fight till they couldnt fight any more the way they had earlier they would throw away their rifles and put up their hands and hope their us opposite numbers didnt murder them the same thing was happening in georgia now even some of the freedom party guards had the message the confederate states werent going to win this time around either some of the men in brownsplotched camouflage smocks had a hard time surrendering but then anybody who tried to surrender to lieutenant lavochkin had a hard time chester admired the platoon leaders courage past thatif everybody on the us side were like boris lavochkin the war probably wouldnt have been anywhere near so tough but chester didnt think he wanted to live in a country that produced a lot of men like that living with one of them was tough enough getting to savannah seemed to have amounted to the beall and endall of general morrells strategy once the port fell once the sickle slice cut the confederacy in half things were confused for a while the powers that be needed some time to figure out what to do next after you went to bed with the girl of your dreams what did you say when you woke up beside her in the morning martins platoon along with the rest of the regiment and a couple of more besides crossed the savannah river and went up into south carolina the swamps on that side of the river seemed no different from the ones in georgia the people over there spoke with the same mushy drawl they hated damnyankees just as much as the georgians did even if they hadnt been able to muster more than a few soldiers to try to keep the invaders in greengray out of their state south carolina seceded first boys captain rhodes told the company this goddamn state got the csa rolling been a hell of a long time since then but we finally get to pay the bastards back as far as martin was concerned too much water had gone under the bridge to care about which drop went first what difference did it make now he despised all the confederate states equally why not men from each and every one of them were equally eager to do him in what did give him chills were the empty villages through which his outfit passed hed seen the like in georgia once upon a timesay up until a couple of years earliernegro sharecroppers had lived in them those people were almost all gone he would have bet dollars to doughnuts they were almost all dead before long their flimsy shacks would crumble and fall down and then who would remember that theyd ever lived here local whites didnt want to lieutenant lavochkin brought the mayor of a little town called hardeeville to a nameless village a couple of miles away the mayor didnt want to come a rifle to the back of his head proved amazingly persuasive what happened to these people lavochkin demanded well i dont rightly know the mayor was a whitemustached fellow named darius douglas he walked with a limp that probably meant he had a purple heart stashed in a drawer somewhere what do you mean you dont know lavochkin rapped out you suppose they all decided to go on vacation at the same time douglas had fine fair skin when he turned red the flush was easy to see well i reckon not he admitted but a lot of em was gone a while back off to towns and such the fancier the farm machinery got the fewer the niggers we needed how come we didnt see em in savannah then the lieutenants voice was silky with danger how come we dont see em anywhere how many niggers you got in hardeeville damn you dont have any i dont reckon but we never did darius douglas answered hardeeville its a white folks town niggers came in to work but they didnt live there they lived in places like this here do you know what you are youre a lying sack of shit thats what lieutenant lavochkin snarled if you came out and said yeah we killed em and i dont miss em a fucking bit at least youd be honest this waychrist you know what you assholes did but it makes you jumpy enough so you dont want to own up to it not when youre talking to people like me i always knew damnyankees was niggerlovers the mayor of hardeeville said nobody elsed make such a fuss over a bunch o damn coons yeah so whos gonna make a fuss over you lavochkin asked before mayor douglas could answer the us officer shot him in the face douglas dropped like a sack of beans in the middle of a muddy overgrown street jesus chester martin exclaimed what the helld you go and do that forsir the platoon commander looked at himlooked through him really you going to tell me he didnt have it coming jesus martin said again i dunno he didnt kill any of those coons himself i dont think the late mr douglas was still twitching a little and still bleeding too the iron stink of blood mingled with the foulness of bowels that had just let go no he didnt kill em he just waved byebye when they went off to the camps lavochkin said all these confederate cocksuckers did the same goddamn thing far as im concerned they all deserve a bullet in the head as far as martin was concerned that had nothing to do with anything we deal with that after the wars over sir you start shooting civilians for the hell of it were going to have reprisals come down on our heads and we need that kind of crap like we need a root canal lavochkin grunted im not afraid of these assholes theyre whipped how many replacements do we need right now chester asked the lieutenant grunted again they havent all quit yet so lets not fire em up what do you say to that he could tell what lieutenant lavochkin wanted to say lavochkin wanted to call him yellow but damn well couldnt scowling the lieutenant did say if im not a good boy i dont get promoted right you think i give a flying fuck about that chester shrugged he hoped lavochkin did it was the only hold he had on the coldblooded young officer lieutenant lavochkin liked killing too much and chester didnt know what he could do about it yeah you killed in a warthat was what it was all about but the guys who enjoyed it caused more trouble than they solved martin wondered whether the platoon commander needed to have an unfortunate accident he didnt let that show on his face if he had he was sure lieutenant lavochkin would have plugged him with as little remorse as hed shot darius douglas if i have to take him out i cant fuck up cause ill only get one chance martin thought unhappily lets go back to hardeeville lavochkin said which was anything but a retreat what will you say when the people ask what happened to the mayor chester wondered shot resisting us authority the lieutenants voice remained hard and firm he didnt sound the least bit guilty chester wondered whether he knew how to feel guilty the first sergeant wouldnt have bet on it as far as lavochkin was concerned anything he did was right because he did it how did that make him any different from jake featherston except that featherston had more scope for running wild than an infantry lieutenant did come on you guys chester called to the men in the platoon you heard the lieutenantwere heading back to hardeeville keep your eyes open when we get there in case of trouble in case the locals go nuts because we scragged the mayor he didnt say that but he hoped the men could work it out for themselves most of them seemed able to they tramped back toward the little town as if advancing into battle they moved in small groups warily keeping an eye out ahead and to all sides hardeeville was a block of shops a filling station a saloon and a few houses before the war it might have held two or three hundred people with the men anywhere close to military age gone it was smaller than that now when the mayors wife saw the us soldiers coming back without him she screeched wheres darius dead lavochkin said flatly he resisted our authority and whatever he said after that mrs douglas shriek smothered it she made a fuss over the late mayor a shot rang out from one of the houses a us soldier went down grabbing his leg shit he yelled chester didnt think the cartridge was anything more than a but that didnt mean it felt like a kiss three soldiers with automatic rifles emptied their magazines into the front of the house glass and chunks of wood flew a woman and a twelveyearold boy staggered out both of them were bleeding the boy still clutched the he tried to raise it and shoot at the us soldiers again but he fell over instead blood puddling under him fuck said one of the men in greengray he was no happier about shooting a kid than anyone else would have been yeah the kid had fired first yeah he was an enemy that didnt make it much better had things ended there they would have been bad but they didnt they got worse somebody fired from another house a featherston fizz came flying out of nowhere and burst at the feet of a us soldier he screamed like a damned soul as flames engulfed him and one of the old men in hardeeville laughed take em out lieutenant lavochkin yelled take em all out chesters first shot knocked over the old man who thought watching a yankee burn was funny his second shot hit the old woman next to the old man right in the middle of the chest she crumpled before she had a chance to screech of course chesters wasnt the only bullet that hit hernot even close all the soldiers in the platoon were letting go with everything they had they started throwing grenades into the houses closest to them a couple of men had grenade launchers on their rifles they lobbed grenades all over hardeeville almost at random itll come down on somebodys head one of them whooped as he pulled the trigger and sent one offsomewhere the men and women and kids on the street went down as if scythed their dying criesand the gunfire and the grenades bursting randomly all over the little townbrought more people out to see what was going on the us soldiers shot them down too it was madness redhot madness chester martin felt it as he fired and reloaded fired and reloaded and slapped in clip after clip he didnt know how many confederates he killed he didnt much care either along with his buddies he went through the town by the time they got done there wasnt much town leftit burned behind them and just about everybody whod lived in hardeeville was dead chester stood there shaking his head like a man whose fever had suddenly broken wow he said looking back on the devastation what did we just do settled their hash lieutenant lavochkin answered i dont think too much of this needs to go into the afteraction report do you christ no chester thought about some of the things hed just done he wished he hadnt he wished he hadnt done them too so no doubt did hardeeville well it was too late for him and much too late for the little town he had the rest of his life to try to forget hardeevilledidnt not any more c onfederate connie was on the air again to most people in the usa the music the propaganda broadcaster played was hot stuff at or past the cutting edge lieutenant colonel jonathan mosshe was still getting used to the silver oak leaves on his shoulder strapshad heard stranger wilder rhythms when spartacus guerrillas got their hands on a guitar and a fiddle here he was at a big air base just outside of dayton ohio not far from where the confederates swarmed over the border not quite three years before the base didnt exist then now unless the kaisers airmen had something fancier it was the biggest training center in the world the song ended like most of the other guys at the base moss thought listening to confederate connie was more fun anyway she had a contralto like a wet dream well you yankee boys arent you proud of yourselves she said as if she were waiting for you to get back into bed with her and didnt want to wait very long she was probably fiftyfive and frumpy but she sure didnt sound that way your brave soldiers went and wiped hardeeville right off the map where the hells hardeeville somebody asked shut up said moss and two other men listening to confederate connie didnt just remind you why you fought it reminded you why you were alive thats right she went on they marched into a defenseless town and they murdered everybody in itmen women children everybody then they burned it down on top of the bodies no more hardeeville south carolina gone right off the map some fun hey arent you proud to live in a country that does stuff like that nobody could keep the men around the wireless set quiet after that oh yeah like the csa never murdered anybody a pilot said wheres your coons you lying cunt somebody else added if they killed everybody how come you know it happened demanded yet another flier confederate connie actually answered the last question saying the yankees missed a couple of women though they played dead in the blood and then got away and now to make you feel good about what your boys in greengray managed to do heres a tune by smooth steve and the oiler orchestra how about that music blared from the wireless more of the syncopated noise the confederates liked better than most people in the usa did jonathan moss listened with at most half an ear he wasnt the only one plenty of people were still telling confederate connie what a liar she was moss wasnt so sure hed heard enough war stories to believe a unit could go hog wild and massacre anybody who got in its way he didnt believe troops would do anything like that just for the fun of it if somebody in hardeeville had fired at them thoughin that case the town was what soldiers called shit out of luck probably all the men whod torn up the place wished they hadnt done itnow that was liable to be a little late for hardeevilles innocentand not so innocentcivilians a fellow with a bombardiers badge above the right pocket of his tunic said whats she getting her tit in a wringer for anyway i bet i blow up more people three times a week than those groundpounders did but i do it from twenty thousand feet so im a fuckin hero its a rough old war along with the bombardiers badge he wore the ribbons for a purple heart and a bronze star with an oakleaf cluster if he wasnt a hero he would do till the genuine article came along he also had a view of the war cynical enough to give even moss pause the next morning moss got summoned to the commandants office he wondered how hed managed to draw that worthys notice and what kind of trouble he was in major general barton k yount was a sixtyish fellow who might have looked like a kindly grandfather if he werent in uniform have a seat moss he said his accent suggested hed been born somewhere not far from here thank you sir moss said cautiously and sat with just as much care the condemned man got a hearty meal went through his mind general yount must have realized what he was thinking i didnt call you in here to ream you out colonel he said i want to ask you a question sir the less moss said the less he might have to regret later on but yount came straight to the point youve flown a lot of different airplanes havent you well yes sir i started with a pusher job in and im still doing it so i must have eh thats right yount smiled and nodded how would you like to add a turbo job to the list a crazy grin spread across moss face sir id kill for a chance like that only reason i havent is i didnt know who needed bumping off turbos were going to turn propellerdriven airplanes obsolete as soon as the boys with the slide rules and the thick glasses worked the gremlins out of them they were already sixty or eighty miles an hour faster than the hottest propdriven fighters the drawbacks were unreliable engines and landing gear among other things turbos were widowmakers on a scale that hadnt been seen since the early days of the great war moss was one of thousands of pilots who didnt give a damn he wanted that chance so bad he could taste it major general younts smile got wider he knew moss was kiddingup to a point youve got it colonel you can call it a reward for a hard time if you like theres one thing i do have to warn you about though what that its dangerous i already know sir im ready to take the chance no no the training commandant shook his head i assumed you knew that but you also have to know that for the time being we arent using turbo fighters anywhere except above usoccupied territory if you get shot down or forced to crashland because of engine trouble we dont want this machinery falling into enemy hands you must agree to that before you begin flight training here oh moss didnt try to hide his disappointment i wanted to go hunting i understand that you wouldnt be a good fighter pilot if you didnt but i hope you follow the reasoning behind the order yes sir moss said reluctantly even more reluctantly he added all right sir i agree to the condition good in that case report to building twelve at tomorrow morning youll learn about the care and feeding of your new beast several turbo fighters sat on the runway outside of building twelve moss got there early so he could walk around them before he went in they looked weird as hell the fuselage was almost sharkshaped the wings swept back from root to tip hed never seen or imagined anything like that before the turbos had no tailwheel they sat on a nosewheel instead so the fuselage rested parallel to the ground instead of sloping down from nose to tail the engines sat in metal pods under the wings yeah the new fighter was one peculiar bird but the longer moss stared the more he nodded to himself it might look different but it also looked deadly he wasnt the only pilot giving the new airplanes a onceover fly one yet he asked a muchdecorated major yeah the younger man answered whats it like like your first girl after youve been jacking off too goddamn long moss laughed that wasnt what hed expected but he liked the way it sounded he went into the building to hear about the care and feeding of the boeing as the new turbo was officially known the major doing the lecturing had some fresh and nasty burn scars on his left arm and walked with a limp moss wondered if hed got hurt in a turbo but didnt ask he didnt really want to know nobody else seemed curious either he learned about the instruments about the guns four mm cannon in the noseone hell of a punch about the strange and temperamental landing gear about what to do if an engine quit or caught fire about what to do if both engines went out not the most encouraging bit of instruction hed ever had about tactics against the confederates hottest propdriven hound dogs about everything he needed to know before he plopped his butt down in the crampedlooking cockpit he had to make himself listen he knew he was hearing all kinds of stuff that would help keep him alive he was a pro he understood that even so all he wanted to do was get in there and find out what the bird could do after what seemed forever and was only a week he got his chance in a twoseat trainer us armies had driven the confederates out of petersburg birmingham and huntsville were under artillery assault moss wondered if thered be any enemy airplanes left for him to face when he finally went on duty in the new turbopeople were calling them screaming eagles and the brass didnt seem to mind too much the noise inside the cockpit was different he felt it all through his body instead of just hearing it he gave the turbo some throttle it raced down the runwayit needed half again as much tarmac as a prop job as he came up to takeoff speed the instructor said ease the stick back not too much now you do everything by little bits with this baby right moss said and then he was airborne he gunned the turbo a little when he felt what happened he whispered ohh sure as hell the murmur wasnt much different from the one hed made as he first slid into beth sullivan when he was seventeen hed forgotten you could mix so much delight and awe and astonishment the instructor chuckled how many other pilots had made that same sound in his earphones its something isnt it he said wow moss answered which wasnt a hell of a lot more articulate after a moment he tried again its like angels are pushing it is isnt it now the instructor sounded thoughtful he hadnt heard that before anyway he paused for a moment then said remember they can turn into devils in nothing flat if you screw upor even if you dont sometimes only god knows why the engines flame out or throw a rotor or just up and quit and if you dont want to be asking him facetoface youve got to get out of the bird in a hurry i understand moss said the singleseat screaming eagle had one of the nicest cockpit canopies hed ever seen a sleekly streamlined armorglass bubble the trainers canopy was longer and more bulbous to accommodate the longer cockpit with two men could you yank it back quick enough to bail out he hoped so at the instructors command he swung the turbo into a turn you couldnt come close to turning as tight as you could in a prop job but you wouldnt want to dogfight in a screaming eagle anyway not when you could outdive outclimb and just plain outrun anything else in the air landing with a nosewheel as the first flight ended felt strange but he did it he couldnt stop smiling when he got out of the fighter if this wasnt love what was it ix g eorgia now alabama cincinnatus driver didnt care where they sent him that he could drive through states which didnt come close to bordering the usa shouted louder than any words that the confederacy was cracking up enemy wireless programs still denied the obvious they promised vengeance on the united states and swore cs victory lay right around the corner those bastards are so full of bullshit no fuckin wonder their eyes are brown hal williamson said he paused to drag on a cigarette the smoke like the batterypowered wireless set was loot from a captured confederate supply dump the enemy had destroyed what he could but hed had to retreat too fast to get rid of everything we will take our revenge on the damnyankees the announcer brayed our rockets will drop from the skies and punish them as they only dream of punishing us we will wipe their corrupt and filthy cities off the map one after another cincinnatus lit up a raleigh of his own turn him off he said screechin like thatll ruin my digestion i hear you williamson said and turned the power knob till it clicked the ranting confederate broadcasterhe must have studied at the jake featherston school of dramafell silent williamson made as if to throw a rock at the set goddamn lying cocksucker yeah cincinnatus said and hoped he was right us newscasters went on and on about the german bomb that leveled petrograd if the germans could do something like that could the confederates match them you didnt want to think so but was it impossible hals thoughts ran along a different train track besides wherell the dickheads get their rockets once were done with huntsville yeah this time cincinnatus sounded much happier everybody knew the enemy rockets came from there if the confederates couldnt throw their superbomb at the usa what good would it do them and even before huntsville got overrun it was catching holy hell battery upon battery of s pounded away at the town their muzzle flashes brightened the horizon from the north all the way around to the southeast the deeper crump of bursting bombs said us airplanes came over huntsville too how anybody could go on working while high explosives were knocking his city flat was beyond cincinnatus the confederates seemed intent on trying though before the drivers settled down for the night they cut cards to see who would stand sentry when cincinnatus got a threehour shift right at the start that was good news and bad mixed together he would have to stay awake longer when he was hungrier for sleep than for a good steak but when he did climb into the cabin of his truck and roll up in blankets he wouldnt have his sleep interruptedunless confederate raiders hit and they might he knew that too well which was why he carried his submachine gun with the safety off cs regulars were thin on the ground raiders damn them popped out of nowhere some were bypassed soldiers others civilians with a chip on their shoulder if they could throw a few grenades or stitch a burst of automaticweapons fire through a truck park the damage they did more than paid for itself even if they got scragged a lot of the time they didnt they disappeared into the darkness and were never seen again bastards cincinnatus muttered his leg hurt so did his shoulder they did a lot of the time even though he took enough aspirins to give himself a perpetual sour stomach run out in front of a motorcar and you werent the same again afterwards he prowled around the parked trucks doing his best to move quietly not far away he heard a sound like crazy screeching he froze for a second before realizing it was a raccoon those unearthly noises could get you going his wristwatch had numbers and hands that glowed in the dark when his stretch on patrol ended he shook his replacement awake and curled up on the seat of his truck whatever happened from then till sunup happened without him somebody had liberated a ham toasted over a fire a thick slab of it was delicious and beat the hell out of the canned scrambled eggs cincinnatus also ate the coffee tasted as if it was at least half chicory hed had blends like that when he lived in covington he was used to it he even kind of liked it some of the white drivers grumbled hal williamson put things in perspective shit guys its better than no coffee at all nobody found any easy way to argue with that the drivers headed for the closest dump to load up with whatever the troops might need today or whatever the quartermaster had which wasnt always the same thing before they got there a bird colonel in a command car waved them down you men have empty trucks right yeah so the lead driver asked being technically a civilian he could get away with things that would have put a soldier in the stockade cincinnatus was only two trucks behind and could hear everything that went on between the driver and the officer that worthy didnt even blink at the nearinsubordination so youre going to come with me instead of going wherever the hell you were going we cant do that the lead driver exclaimed theyll have our heads no they wont the colonel said whatever you were doing what ive got for you is more important unless youre on your way to pick up a bunch of those kraut superbombs this trumps everything and i will have your guts for garters if you fuck with me buddyi promise you that the lead driver considered but not for long colonel you talked me into it he said cincinnatus would have said the same thing he didnt think the colonel was bluffing all the man said after that was follow me he got into the command car nudged the driver and took off the truck convoy rumbled after him they headed straight for huntsvillestraight for the front in other words cincinnatus began to wonder if the colonel wasnt one of those confederate impostors who showed up every now and then even more than raiders they caused trouble all out of proportion to their numbers if this son of a bitch was leading a whole column of trucks into an ambush cincinnatus glanced over to the submachine gun beside him he had as many bullets as he could for the confederates and one more for himself afterwards they wouldnt take him alive no matter what the command car pulled up in front of a nondescript factory buildingor it would have been except for the barbedwire perimeter surrounding it soldiers stood at the doorway soldiers in greengray uniforms cincinnatus breathed a sigh of relief let them come out the colonel shouted the soldiers waved and nodded they threw the doors wide do jesus cincinnatus gasped his next thought after an ambush had been that the usa might have overrun another camp where the confederates got rid of their negroes he turned out to be wrong but what he saw was just about as bad he hadnt imagined anything could be the men who came shambling out were white they wore striped uniforms the way convicts had back when cincinnatus was a kid the trousers and shirts looked as if they were made for some much larger species and so they had beencincinnatus didnt think any of these skeletons on legs weighed more than pounds most of them werent anywhere close to that a powerful animal stench came from them do jesus cincinnatus said again he was out of the truck and limping toward them before he thought about what he was doing he had several ration cans in pouches on his belt here he called and tossed them to the closest captives he wasnt the only driver doing the same thing anyone who had enough himselfeven someone who was only hungrywould have wanted to feed these brighteyed walking skeletons but the food almost touched off a riot the drivers didnt have enough with them to give everybody some the starving men who didnt get any tried to steal from the ones who did finally the us guards had to break things up with rifle butts hate to do it one of them said its like hitting your puppy cause he wants a bone these guys cant help ittheyre that hungry but what can you do otherwise well have an even bigger goddamn mess on our hands youll all get some soon the colonel shouted honest to god you will thats what the trucks are here forto take you to where theres food that turned the trick the boneracks in stripes swarmed onto the trucks which could hold many more of them than of human beings of ordinary dimensions who are you poor bastards cincinnatus asked were politicals a scrawny man said not without pride im a whig i was mayor of fayetteville arkansas he looked more like a disaster than a onetime public official a weak breezenever mind a strong onewould have knocked him over in a heap i didnt like the freedom party still dont by god and this is what it bought me what were you doin in there cincinnatus asked but the mayor of fayetteville didnt hang around to chat that might have cost him a place in a truck and he wasnt about to take a chance one of the guards answered for him they were putting rockets together thats whatthe big mothers that go miles and miles featherstons fuckers figured they might as well work em to death as just shoot em oh cincinnatus said in a hollow voice when the guard said work em to death he wasnt kidding some of the men still coming out of the factory would plainly die before they got fed the dreadful odor that accompanied them from the building said more than a few men were already dead in there and yetwhat happened to these political prisoners was horrible no doubt about it but they still got to try to stay alive some of them might have staved off death since before the war began the confederacys negroes never got even that much of a chance they went into campsand they didnt come out the politicals who hated the freedom party still labored for the confederate states negroes would have done the samehad anyone asked them to nobody seemed to have the freedom party and a lot of white confederates wanted their negroes deadand they got what they wanted as horrible as this was it could have been worse that was perhaps the scariest thought of all as cincinnatus got back into the cab of his deuceandahalf he also wondered whether that bird colonel would have made such a fuss if the rocket factory were full of negro laborers he shrugged he couldnt be sure one way or the other but if he had his doubtswell who could blame him considering all the things hed seen all the things hed escaped none of which made the plight of the starving stinking politicals who jammed the back of the truck anything less than dreadful yes if they were black they would have been dead already but they couldnt last long as things were cincinnatus put the truck in gear and drove them off toward whatever help the us army could give e ven with no more than a scratch force of guards camp humble went right on doing what it was designed to do reducing population jefferson pinkard was proud of that he was proud of the men he had left and he was proud of the way hed designed the camp it was so smooth it almost ran itself you just didnt need a whole lot of guards to herd negroes from the trains to the trucks and bathhouses and then to chuck bodies into the crematoria everything went as smoothly as it did in any other wellrun factory every few weeks the latest batch of negro trusties who thought theyd dodged death by playing along discovered theyd made their last mistake the only thing jeff kept on being unhappy about was the ovens the company that made them had come out a couple of times to try to get them to perform better but without much luck pinkards conclusion was that the contractor had sold him a bill of goods from the start the greasy black smoke that belched from the stacks and the burntmeat stench that went with it were part of the operation and he couldnt do a thing about it trains still brought negroes to the camp trains from alabama and mississippi and louisiana and arkansas and texas hed also had loads of blacks from florida and cuba arrive the local authorities rounded up their negroes and sent them to houston or galveston by ship hed heard reports that subs operating in the gulf of mexico had sunk some of those ships that was funny in a grim way the damnyankees were doing some of the confederacys work for it the telephone on his desk rang he scowled why couldnt people just leave him alone and let him take care of his job it rang again scowling still he picked it up pinkard here he rasped this heres lou doggett general the mayor of humble said pinkard wasnt a general he had a party rank instead but he didnt argue hed been a pfc the last time around if somebody wanted to call him general he didnt mind a bit whats up he asked now well ill tell you generalthe winds blowing this way from your camp and its pretty bad doggett answered this aint how you told me it was gonna be when you put that camp in it aint the way i thought it was gonna be neither jeff answered but its the way it is i dont know what else i can tell you if it dont get better pretty damn quick im gonna talk to the governor the mayor warned jeff pinkard laughed go right ahead you do that be my guest you reckon the governor amounts to anything when you set him next to ferd koenig and jake featherston to his surprise the mayor of humble answered matter of fact general i sure do richmonds gone even if it wasnt theres damnyankees in between here and there what the hell can koenig and featherston do way out here he might be right a nasty chill of fear ran through pinkard when he realized as much like any government the confederacy ran because people agreed it ought to what happened if they stopped agreeing what happened if texas rangers came out here with guns how could you know ahead of time let me ask you a question your honor pinkard said heavily who went down on his knees beggin for me to put this here camp where its at who damn near jizzed in his dungarees when i said i would was that anybody who looks like you that was then doggett returned you didnt tell me it was gonna stink the way it does and belch out black smoke you can see for miles i didnt know goddammit those bastards who put in the ovens and the stacks went and rooked me jeff said but even if it does stink its doing something the country needs you gonna try and tell me im wrong well no i got no more use for coonsn any other decent godfearing white man does the mayor said but godalmightydamn general it sure does stink makes the whole town smell like a barbecue pit some stupid fool went and forgot about youre in a fancy uniform so you get to give orders me i got voted in and i got a hell of a lot of people here in humble who sure aint gonna vote for me again cause of that smell i mean gettin rid o niggers is one thing doin it so you can smell em roastthats a whole different story you want to eat roast beef but you dont want to butcher your cow jeff said camps gotta be somewhere i liked it where it was at before too but the damnyankees went and ran us out of there that aint my fault i didnt say it was but its another problem suppose we go and lose the war thats defeatism jeff said automatically the mayor of humble astonished him by replying oh cut the crap general were fucked and you know it as well as i do like i said richmonds gone they chopped us in half in georgia the presidents on the run how are we gonna win i wish we could but i aint a blind man and suppose we lose like i said what if the damnyankee soldiers march in here and ask what the devil were you doin with a murder camp there on your doorstep mr mayor what do i tell em then hey fuck pinkard muttered under his breath that was insubordination so bad it was damn near treason or it would have been if it werent such a good question suppose we do go and surrender suppose the yankees do come marching in what do i tell them the only answer that came to mind was i was just doing what the bigwigs in richmond told me to do would they buy that what would they do to him if they didnt general hey general you there how long had doggett been yelling in his ear a little while evidently hed had other things to worry about yeah what is it he managed dragging himself back to the business at hand you dont get that camp cleaned up in jig time i will talk to governor patman you see if i dont youll be sorry if you do jeff thought he meant that anyway he knew damn well he had more firepower than the texas rangers could bring to bear against him but whether his guards had the will to fight other confederate white menhe wasnt so sure about that he hoped like anything he wouldnt have to find out if youre smart general youll take off your uniform put your wife an young uns in a civilian motorcar and head for some town where nobody knows your face you think the damnyankeesll have questions to ask me whatll they say to you pinkard hung up he did it by sheer reflex the mayors thoughts didnt just run parallel to his theyd got ahead of them on the same road if us soldiers came here they would have things to say to him unpleasant things but i cant leave he said aloud no matter what the yankees had to say to him he was proud of everything hed done here and over in snyder and outside of alexandria too hed had an important job to do and hed done it well if not for him the whole populationreduction program would have been a hell of a lot less efficient didnt that count for anything the attorney general thought so hell the president of the confederate states of america thought so what else mattered nothing else matteredas long as his side was calling the shots never mind texas rangers us soldiers wouldnt like what hed done and the main reason they wouldnt like itor so things seemed to himwas that his own side did fuck em jeff muttered fuck em all he wondered whether mayor doggett would send cops around to give edith and the boys a hard time he didnt intend to put up with anything like that maybe his guards would have trouble against the rangers against this little towns onelung police force though they could start a reign of terror no sooner had that crossed his mind than the telephone rang again he said some things that should have melted the glass out of the windows in his office what did doggett want now pinkard here he snarled jeff its me that wasnt the mayorit was edith my pains have started were going to have us a baby oh good god jeff said mentally apologizing to the lord whose name hed done worse than take in vain a moment before you ready to go down to houston i sure am his wife answered miss todd next door shell take care of willie and frank till you can get home ill send a guard with an auto for you right away jeff said he couldnt leave the camp himself right now especially not after the brawl with the mayor humble wasnt big enough to boast a hospital of its own but it was only twenty miles from houston so that shouldnt matter he summoned a reliable troop leader to drive one of the birminghams attached to camp humble as he gave the threestriper his orders he thought damn i wish hip rodriguez was still around to do this for me his old army buddy would have done it right one hundred percent guaranteed oh porter was more than reliable enough but still as always pinkard knew a moment of pained incomprehension when he thought about hipolito rodriguez what the devil made hip eat his submachine gun he was doing a good job and doing a job that needed doing that was something to brood on as he poured himself a big snort from the highly unofficial bottle in a desk drawer he couldnt have taken the whiskey along if he had torn himself away from this and gone to the hospital what could he do in the waiting room anyway worry he could do that here too he could and he did dammit what possessed hip to do that he didnt see any damnyankee writing on the wall things were going well enough when he shot himself why then it was as if hed suddenly decided hed made some vast mistake and blowing off the top of his head was the only way he could fix it but thats crazy jeff said taking a slug from the drink just plain old crazy it wasnt as if hip didnt believe in getting rid of negroes he couldnt have had woman troubles either jeff knew hip got laid every once in a while on the womens side not many male guards didnt for that matter the same was true of female guards he felt guilty about fooling around on his wifejeff remembered as much from the great war but he didnt feel all that guilty which jeff also knew so what went wrong then the obvious answerthat hip couldnt stand killing people any more even if they were blackstared pinkard in the face it had ever since rodriguez shot himself and ever since then jeff had stubbornly refused to look at it he didnt change now hed come too far down this road to changeunless he put the barrel of a gun in his own mouth and pulled the trigger he refused to look at doing that either instead he finished the drink and poured another one he kept on drinking for the next seven hours the camp didnt fall to pieces in that time which was just as well because he wouldnt have cared if it had he spilled whiskey when the telephone rang pinkard here he slurred congratulations sir your wife is fine and youve got a boy troop leader porter said whatll you name him raymond jeff answered at oncedrunk or sober he knew raymond longstreet pinkard he knew where he stood too even now e very time irving morrell came into philadelphia the city looked worse the confederates kept finding new ways to hit the de facto capital of the usa us forces had driven the confederates from their own capital and held bridgeheads across the james the rocket factories in huntsville were history but jake featherstons forces kept launching their damn birds not all of them had been driven out of range of philly not yet their bombers still managed to sneak up here by night too fresh craters and wrecked buildings loudly insisted the war wasnt over yet but the people in philadelphia had a jaunty spring in their step that wasnt there the last time morrell came into town maybe it was all the generals imagination but he didnt think so folks figured things were on the downhill slope and by god they had plenty of good reasons to think so not without pride morrell knew hed given them more than a few of those good reasons himself his driver a sergeant with a purple heart and three oakleaf clustersnot the kind of decoration anybody in his right mind would want to winsaid weve got those cocksuckers whipped dont we sir well wed have to screw up pretty good to blow things now morrell allowed are you on permanent light duty sergeant or will you go back to the front youre two wounds ahead of me and i wouldnt wish that on anyone ill be at it again in a couple of weeks sir the noncom answered none of ems been real bad i limp a little from the latest one and ive lost a finger but the other twohell i dont even notice em if i dont see the scars for a guy whos not real lucky im pretty lucky you know yeah morrell said and he did the way the sergeant put it was kind of loopy but it made sense anyway the ford rolled past a wall with a few bomb scars and a big splash of dried blood morrell was afraid he knew what that meant people bomb afraid so sir they think this one was a diehard mormon he took out four or five soldiers when he went damn morrell said how long would the usaand other countries all over the worldhave to worry about people willing even eager to die for their cause get some dynamite some nails or scrap metal and there you were your own artillery shell and you could aim yourself better than the best gunner in the world the assumption in war had always been that the other guy didnt want to die how were you supposed to protect yourself against somebody who did mormons canucks confederates the sergeant said mournfully even what they call peace wont be the same i was just thinking the same thing morrell said i dont know what to do about it if you get any brainstorms for christs sake tell the war department youll be a captain faster than you can blink no offense sir but i dont know if i want to be an officer with some relief the noncom hit the brakes in front of the war department here you go you dont even have to tip me heh morrell said he stepped between concrete barriers that kept autos from getting too close they could carry a lot more explosives than mere people could the war department building had a big chunk bitten out of a corner those cs rockets werent supposed to be real accurate but one seemed to have landed right on the money not even stars on his shoulder straps kept him from having to show his id or from getting patted down after he did he submitted without a murmur times were still dangerous once hed placated the entrance dragons an escort took him down to general staff headquarters it hadnt been buried so deep the last time he came to the war department of course if it werent now it might have gone sky high when that rocket came down heres general abells office sir the escort said telephone when you need to come up again and somebody will take you thanks morrell said the kid gave him a crisp salute and hurried down the corridor morrell was much less eager to enter john abells sanctum but he did welcome the general staff officer said with what passed for warmth from him brigadier general abell sometimes reminded morrell of a ghost mostly congealed into the real world he was tall and thin and pale and so cool of manner that he sometimes hardly seemed there at all the general staff suited him perfectly he was a dab hand at moving divisions around but would have been hopeless with dirty smelly wisecracking foulmouthed soldiers thanks morrell answered and couldnt help adding see it wasnt a twoyear campaign after all so it wasnt congratulations yes abell was in a gracious mood we managed to attrit the enemy so he couldnt resist with as much persistence as i thought he might utilize when we first broached the issue early last year morrell distrusted officers who said utilize when they meant use as for attritwell obviously it came from attrition but that didnt mean he ever wanted to hear it again he managed a nod that seemed to satisfy john abell the question now of course is where do we go from here he could speak clear english when he wanted to why didnt he want to more often on the western flank birmingham and huntsville are pretty much in the bag morrell said were hitting selma and mobile hard from the air well get to em before too long new orleanswell we can bomb it if we smash the levees we can flood a lot of it but we wont get soldiers there any time soon a reasonable estimate abell agreed and in the east im shifting most of the effort there up into south carolina morrell replied charleston columbiaif the general staff has a different idea i expect youll let me know he wondered if that was part of the reason hed been summoned to philadelphia what did they think he would do if he stayed down in the confederacy and got orders he didnt like set up on his own he admired napoleon as a soldier but not as a politician at present no that seems adequate or more than adequate john abell said he acted nervous though for a moment that made no sense at all to morrell the united states was manifestly winning the war theyd cut the csa in half the campaign in virginia was going well at last even the minor struggles in arkansas and sequoyah and west texas all inclined toward the usa so why wasnt abell even happier morrell didnt expect hosannas and backflips from the general staff officer hed known abell too long and too well for that but stillthen a light went on a light as bright and terrible as the sun that goddamn superbomb morrell exclaimed how close is featherston he didnt ask how close his own country was that he assumed would be a secret more tightly held than the other ah good you do understand the basic difficulty under which we labor abell said the answer is we just dont knowand that is our principal area of concern at this point in time i can see how it might be morrell said dryly if the confederates could blow a city off the map with one bomb they hadnt lost yet not by a long chalk we are trying to do something about this as a matter of fact yes john abell said before too much longer the question may be moot but at the moment it remains relevant and what was that supposed to mean were the united states about to capture the csas superbomb works or was his country close to getting a superduperbomb of its own anything you can tell me without bringing the wrath of the great god security down on your head morrell inquired our own research along those lines is making good progress abell said and not another word even that much was more than morrell expected well all right he said and took out two packs of dukes he pulled a cigarette from one and stuck it in his mouth the other he tossed on abells desk here you go spoils of war thanks abell opened the pack and held out a cigarette morrell gave him a light the general staff officer never went near the front he probably got sick of the nasty us tobaccounless other officers who wanted to stay on his good side kept him in smokes maybe his desk was full of them you never could tell those bombs are going to change the way we fight theyll change the way everybody fights morrell said we are commencing studies on that topic abell said how we dont know enough yet morrell said and that reminds mehow come the kaiser hasnt flattened london or paris did he only have the one bomb how long till he gets another one i dont know the answer to that abell replied but i do have an idea why petrograd went up in smoke and the western capitals havent im all ears morrell said prevailing winds abell told him these bombs spew poison into the air and the wind can carry it a long way from petrograd the stuff goes deeper into russia from london or paris the germans could give themselves a present a present they want like a hole in the head morrell said john abell nodded morrell stubbed out his cigarette and shuddered that makes these damn things even worse than i thought the only thing worse than using them on somebody is somebody else using them on you abell said have we stopped the confederates from using one on us we hope so whats that supposed to mean morrell asked theyre working on this thing in a virginia mountain town we have bombed it so heavily next to nothing is left aboveground the general staff officer replied morrell had listened to a lot of presentations he could hear what wasnt said as well as what was what are they doing underground well we dont precisely know abell sounded as uncomfortable as he ever did theyve burrowed like moles since the bombing started thats why i hope weve kept their program from producing a uranium bomb but i cant be sure we have terrific morrell said how do we find out for sure if they use one on us we failed abell said its as simple as that im afraid oh boy morrell said in distinctly hollow tones thats encouraging he looked up at god only knew how many feet of steel and concrete over his head if they drop one on philadelphia will it get us all the way down here i dont think they can do that anyhow abell replied im told a uranium bomb is too heavy for any airplane they have were having to modify our bombers to carry the load mm well i guess thats good news so theyve got to wait till their rockets get out of short pants then or do they have an extraspecial rocket ready to go we dont believe so john abell said but then we didnt know about the ones they do have till they started firing them at us tell you one thing morrell said as he lit another cigarette abell made a questioning noise morrell explained you sure know how to cheer a guy up y ankee bombers still didnt come over lexington virginia very often in the daytime cs fighters and heavy flak made that an expensive proposition clarence potter thanked god for small favors he would have thanked god more for big ones but the deity didnt seem inclined to give the confederate states any of those nowadays a crane swayed a crate into the cargo bed of a truck that looked ordinary but wasnt this machine had a very special suspension even so the springs groaned as the crate came down potter watched the loading process with professor henderson fitzbelmont youre sure this damn thing will work potter said fitzbelmont looked at him no thanks a lot professor potter said you sure know how to cheer a guy up would you rather have me lie to you fitzbelmont asked right now i really think i would clarence potter told him i hate to try this if theres an evenmoney chance well get nothing but a squib fitzbelmont shrugged its untested ideally we would have more time and more weapons things being as they are well yes there is that potter said just getting back to lexington from petersburg had been nightmare enough all right well try it and well see what happens thats all wish us luck i do professor fitzbelmont said in my own way im a patriot too his way wasnt so different from potters neither man went around shouting freedom they both loved the confederate states all the same potter climbed into the cab of the truck next to the driver a sergeant we ready sir the noncom asked in accents not much different from potters own if were not we never will bewhich is of course always a possibility the intelligence officer said the sergeant looked confused were ready wilton potter assured him now we see what happens several command cars and armored cars rolled north and slightly east with the special truck everybody in them spoke the same kind of english as clarence potter all the men could pass for yankees in other words both sides had used that trick during the war whenever they thought they could get away with it one more time potter thought its coming down toward the end but were going to try it one more time in the war of secession stonewall jackson had played the shenandoah valley like a master violinist in his hands it turned into a dagger an invasion route aimed straight at the usas heart the same thing happened again during the great war with the confederate charge that almost got to philadelphia after the united states occupied the northern end of the valley and fortified it so the confederate states couldnt try that again and jake featherston didnt he drove up through ohio instead the shenandoah valley was also the csas granary the united states busy elsewhere and fighting for survival hadnt tried to take the valley away from the confederacy they had dropped a hell of a lot of incendiaries on it one us wag was supposed to have said that a crow flying up the shenandoah valley would have to carry its own provisions things werent quite so bad as thatbut they sure werent good potter drove past too many fields whose main crops were ash and charcoal past too many barns and farmhouses that were nothing but burntout skeletons of their old selves even after a wet winter the air smelled smoky he had bigger worries than the way the air smelled the first time they came to a bridge he said this is what they call a moment of truth sir sergeant wilton said theyre supposed to have strengthened it i know potter left it right there the confederate states were in their death agony he knew it even if wilton didnt things that were supposed to get done mightor they might not you never could tell and if they didntim screwed potter thought only one way to find out take it across he said yes sir the driver did the bridge held potter breathed a sigh of relief nowhow many more bridges across the winding shenandoah before they got to the head of the valley how many bridges beyond that again only one way to find out they made it over again and again the trucks transmission and engine werent happy theyd been beefed up too but they were even more overstrained than the suspension if the damn thing crapped outwell they had some spare parts but it wouldnt be good news potter tensed againfor the millionth timewhen they came into luray the northernmost town in the valley the csa held just as the sun was setting if things there werent ready they were screwed again but the stuff they needed was waiting for them potter let out one more sigh of relief but for the caves outside of town and a nitrates plant that had drawn its share of us bombs lurays chief claim to fame was a twoandahalfstory brick courthouse near the center of town potters convoy stopped there a work crew dashed out and spread canvas over the truck and the vehicles accompanying it then under that cover they got to work slapping greengray paint over the butternut that had identified them as soon as the paint was even close to dry they put us markings all over the machines those couldnt hide their confederate lines of course but after almost three years of war both sides were using lots of captured equipment and the disguise didnt end with the truck and the armored cars and command cars potter and his comrades put on us uniforms he became a major which suited him well enough if the damnyankees captured him in their togs theyd shoot him he shrugged at the moment that was the least of his worries you have the passwords and countersigns he asked the veteran first sergeant in charge of the unit there yes sir sure do we went out and took a couple of prisoners less than an hour ago the noncom answered he was of about potters vintage a man whod been through the great war and didnt flabble about anything he gave potter what he needed potter wrote it down to be sure thanks he said the retread sergeant nodded the patch over his left eye and the hook sticking out of his left tunic cuff told why he was in a backwater like this despite them he was a better man than most at the front the chameleon convoy rolled out of luray before sunup potter wanted to get into usheld territory while it was still dark that would help keep his vehicles from giving themselves away right where people were most likely to get antsy about them yankee country started just a couple of miles north of luray if somebodyd spilled the beansnot impossible with the csa visibly coming to piecesa couple of companies of real us soldiers could have swooped down and ended a lovely scheme before it really got rolling but no the sergeants raid for prisoners hadnt even made the us forces jumpy potter and his merry band got several miles into yankeeland before they came to a checkpoint the passwords hed picked up in luray worked fine a kid second lieutenant asked what is all this crap uh sir matйriel captured from featherstons fuckers potter answered crisplyhe knew what the enemy called his side were taking it north for evaluation nobody told me the shavetail complained its a war potter said with more patience than he felt they wouldnt tell you your name if you hadnt had it issued ahead of time no shit the lieutenant said laughing all right sirpass on on they passed the sun came up they crossed over the shenandoah again at front royal nobody on their side had specially reinforced that bridge think itll take the strain sir wilton asked if they ever sent a barrel over it it will potter said barrels are a hell of a lot heavier than this baby they made it they stopped at a fuel dump and gassed up then went on the farther they got from the front line the less attention us soldiers paid them they just seemed to be men doing a job one nineyearold kid by the side of the road gaped though he knew they were driving cs vehiclespotter could tell he probably knew every machine and weapon on both sides better than the guys who used them did plenty of kids like that down in the csa too it was a game to them it wasnt a game to clarence potter harpers ferry john brown had come here trying to start a slave uprising robert e lee led the men who captured him and three years later lee came through again on the campaign that won the confederate states their independence maybe this trip north would help them keep it over the potomac into maryland into the usa proper potter had come this way almost exactly thirty years earlier with the army of northern virginias thrust toward philadelphia theyd fallen short then had they taken the de facto capital they might have had a triumphant six weeks war jake featherston had hoped for the same thing this time around what you hoped for and what you got werent always the same dammit maryland looked prosperous pennsylvania when they got there even more so oh potter spied bomb damage here and there but only here and there this land hadnt been fought over the way so much of the csa had it had got nibbled but not chewed up the united states was too big a place for bombing alone to chew them up pittsburgh now pittsburgh probably looked as if it had had a proper war but potter and his band of cutthroats headed east not west drivers in military vehicles coming the other way waved to him and honked their horns as they passed he always waved back they figured he was returning from the front with something important nobody bothered checking his papers or asking him where he was going or why the united states were a big place once beyond the usual military zone security for people who looked and sounded like us soldiers eased off hed counted on that when he put this scheme together jake featherston wanted him to go all the way into downtown philadelphia he didnt intend to there of all places security would tighten up again he couldnt afford to have anybody ask questions too soon some overeager goon with a tommy gun or a captured automatic tredegar could mess everything up if he got suspicious at just the wrong time no not downtown potter stopped west of it on the far side of the schuylkill river at his order wilton pulled into a parking lot potter ducked into the back of the truck and set two timers on the side of the cratehe wasnt going to take chances with only one the driver meanwhile raised the hood whats going on somebody called damn things broken down wilton answered weve got to round up a mechanic somewhere he and potter jumped into one of the command cars back the way we came potter said fast as you can go he eyed the man whod questioned them the fellow only shrugged and ambled into a shop maybe hed seen breakdowns before how long sir asked the corporal behind the command cars wheel not long enough potter said step on it fifteen minutes later the world blew up behind them i rving morrell wasnt looking west when the bomb went off he was standing at a counter trying to decide between a chocolate bar and a roll of mints all of a sudden the light swelled insanely printing his shadow on the wall in back of the sidewalk stand the fat little old woman behind the counter screeched and covered her eyes with her hands good god morrell said even before the roar of the explosion reached him his first thought was that an ammo dump somewhere had blown sky high he didnt think of a bomb the explosion seemed much too big for that he forgot about the candy and ran out into the street then he realized just how lucky hed been because a lot of windows had turned to knifeedged flying shards of glass the magazine stand and snack counter where hed been dithering didnt have a window of any sort so hed escaped that anyhow he stopped and stared he wasnt the only one everybody out there was looking west with the same expression of slackjawed disbelief no one had ever seen anything like that rising boiling roiling cloud before how high did it climb three miles four five he had no idea the colors put him in mind of foodsalmon peach apricot the top of the cloud swelled out from the base as if it were a toadstool the size of a god the roar came then not just in his ears but all through his body he staggered like a drunken man but it wasnt his balance going the ground shook under his feet a blast of wind from nowhere staggered him also out of nowhere rain started pelting down the drops were enormous they left black splashes when they hit the ground when one hit his hand he jerked in surprisethe rain was hot wheres it at somebody asked across the river looks like a woman said it looked that way to morrell too the rain shower didnt last more than a couple of minutes it hadnt ended before he started trying to scrub the filthy drops from his skin he remembered what john abell had told him a few days before uranium bombs put out poison and what else could that horrible thing be no ammunition dump in the world blew up like that how much poison was in the rain how much was in that monstrous toadstool cloud am i a dead man walking he wondered we gotta go help said the man whod asked where the blast was he hurried toward the schuylkill river his courage and resolve shamed morrell of course the strangerwho was plump and fiftyish with a gray mustachedidnt know what morrell did if ignorance was bliss after a moments hesitation morrell followed if he was already poisoned then he was that was all nothing he could do about it now overhead that cloud grew taller and wider winds began to tear at it and tug it out of shapeand blow it toward downtown philadelphia crowds got worse the farther west morrell went everybody was pointing and staring and gabbling you fools dont you realize you might all be dead no morrell didnt shout it out but it filled his thoughts damage got worse the farther west he went too all the windows that had survived years of confederate air raids were blown out motorcars and trucks had windows shattered too drivers their faces masks of blood staggered moaning through the streets many of them clutched at their eyes morrell knew what that was bound to mean they had glass in them as he neared philadelphias second river he saw buildings brutally pushed down and vehicles flipped onto their sides or upside down some men stopped to help the injured others pressed on and then morrell got a chance to look across the schuylkill that part of the city was almost as heavily built up as downtown or rather it had been next to morrell a skinny woman crossed herself he felt like doing the same thing almost everything over there was knocked flat a few buildings that must have been uncommonly strong still stood up from the rubble but only a few a bridge across the schuylkill survived though it leaned drunkenly to one side how long it would stay up god only knew people staggered across it from the west some had had the clothes burned off of them morrell saw several with one side of their face badly seared and the other fine they must have stood in profile to the bomb when it went off his shadow a dreadfully burned man babbled i saw his shadow on the sidewalk all printed like but not a thing left of george he slumped down and mercifully passed out morrell wondered whether he would ever wake he might be luckier not to a loudspeaker started to blare all military personnel report at once to your duty stations all military personnel report at once to morrell didnt exactly have a duty station he headed back to the war department the catastrophe across the river was bigger than any one man and he had a better chance of finding out what was going on at the militarys nerve center so he thought anyway but one of the guards who patted him down asked what the hell happened sir do you know not exactly morrell answered i was hoping people here did before a private took him down to john abells office he paused in a mens room and washed off as much of the filthy rainwater as he could why are you doing that sir asked the kid who went in with him just in case morrell answered getting rid of the horrible stuff wouldnt hurt he was sure of that abell always looked pale he seemed damn near transparent now he might have aged ten years in the few days since morrell last saw him my god he said they beat us to the punch i didnt think they could but they did have you been up top morrell asked did you see it with your own eyes no abell had always wanted to deal with things from a distance was that a strength or a weakness probably both at once morrell thought the general staff officer went on how did they get it here they couldnt have used an airplanei swear to god they dont have a machine that can carry it and our yranging gear didnt spot a thing coming up from the south they must have sneaked it in god damn them morrell said remember how they broke through in eastern ohio they had a whole battalion of guys in our uniforms in our vehicles who could talk like us what do you want to bet they did the same damn thing againand made it work hed made it work himself getting over the tennessee river in front of chattanooga abell managed a shaky nod then he reached for a telephone with a little luck they wont get away we can shoot every last one of them if we catch them in our uniforms morrell nodded that was what the laws of war said whether the usa would want to shoot those confederates if it caught them might be a different story how much could they tell interrogators about their uraniumbomb project wed better catch them abell said as he slammed down the telephone after barking into it with unaccustomed heat they cant get away with that how many thousands of people did they just murder would it have been better had the enemy dropped the bomb out of an airplane and then flown away would it have been better had he dropped ton after ton of ordinary bombs instead or machinegunned as many people as hed killed in this one blast morrell found himself shaking his head it wouldnt have been any better but it would have been more familiar that mattered too the uranium bomb was something brand new poison gas had carried some of that same whiff of horror during the last war people took it for granted now would they come to take uranium bombs for granted too how could they when each one could devastate a city and these were just the early ones would next years model level a whole county or maybe a state my god abell said again those stinking crackersand they beat us there wont be one stone left on top of another one by the time our bombers get through with lexingtonill tell you that the last time he and morrell talked about uranium bombs hed waltzed around the name of the town where the csa was working on them this time hed slipped he was human after all and would probably have to do penance before the altar of security the almighty he realized as much a few seconds too late you didnt hear that from me he said in some embarrassment hear what morrell asked innocently i wonder if we could drive down the shenandoah valley and take that place away from them abell said even though he was embarrassed now that the cat was out of the bag he was letting it run around wouldnt take long to pull an assault force together morrell spoke with the assurance of a veteran field commander dont know how hard the confederates would fight backhard as they can i bet now that theyve used one bomb how long do they need to build another one that i cant tell you because i dont know i wouldnt tell you even if i did but i dont abell said days weeks months twenty minutes i just have no idea all right morrell said the general staff officer was liable to lie about something like that but morrell didnt think he was not this time he went on this would have been a lot worse if theyd brought it here by the government buildings instead of blowing it up across the river i dont think they could haveit wouldnt have been easy anyhow abell said we search autos and trucks before we let them in here auto bombs are bad enough but put a couple of tons of high explosive in a truck he didnt finish or need to one of those was plenty to make us clamp down good for you then you just saved the president and congress and us i mean i hope you did morrell told him about the black rain exactly how dangerous is that stuff anyway well all find out i dont know the details im not sure anybody does abell looked down at his own soft immaculately tended hands i do believe you were wise to wash off as much as you could its like xrays you want to keep the exposure to a minimum morrell looked at his own hands and at his uniform which still bore the marks of those unnatural drops were there little xray machines in them something like that he supposed maybe there were more in the dust in the air we sure never learned any of this stuff at west point he said who knew back then john abell said nobody thats who half of what we learned just went obsolete more than half morrell said new rules from now on if we live long enough abell said yeah if morrell looked at his splotched uniform again i think the new rule number one is dont get in a war with anybody whos got this damn bomb a little too late for that now the general staff officer pointed out dont remind me morrell said i m jake featherston and im here to tell you the truth this wasnt the familiar studio in richmond from which jake featherston had bellowed defiance at the world since the days when he was a discredited rabblerouser at the head of a withering freedom party he had no idea whether that wireless studio still stood he would have bet against it richmond had fallen but the confederates put up a hell of a fight before they finally pulled out portsmouth virginia then it wasnt where featherston wanted to behed always wanted to broadcast in triumph from washington dc and philadelphia and i will yet goddammit he thought savagely but portsmouth would have to do for now the station had a strong signal and somehow or other saul goldman had patched together a web to send jakes words all over the csaand up into yankeeland too if saul wasnt a wizard hed do till a real one showed up the speech truth is we just showed the damnyankees what we can do just like the kaiserone bomb and boom a citys gone philadelphia will never be the same he didnt exactly say the uranium bomb no from the reports he got from fitzbelmont it was really a jovium bomb whatever the hell jovium was had blown up all of philly if his confederate listeners wanted to think hed said that though he wouldnt shed a tear maybe st louis the next time maybe indianapolis or chicago maybe new york city or boston maybe denver or san francisco who knows but one bomb and boom no more city whatever it is he didnt say when the next cs jovium bomb would go off he had excellent reason for not saying anything about that he had no idea henderson fitzbelmont didnt even want to guess us bombers were hitting lexington harder than ever some of the bombs had armorpiercing noses too so they dug deep before going off they were causing trouble but the csa got in the first lick anyway the damnyankees reckoned they had us down for the count jake gloated they forgot about how much we lovefreedom theyll never lick us not while we can still load our guns and fire back and we can as if on cue cannon boomed in the distance the studio insulation couldnt swallow all of that noise some were antiaircraft guns banging away at the us bombers that constantly pounded the whole hampton roads area and others were the big guns from the few surviving confederate warships now turned against land targets rather than enemy cruisers and destroyers the damnyankees were pushing toward portsmouth and norfolk by land anything that could slow them down the confederates were using since some of that artillery noise was going out over the air featherston decided to make the most of it you hear that people he said that noise shows we are still in the fight and well never quit they say our country doesnt have a right to live i say they dont have a right to kill it they wont either if you dont believe me ask whats left of philadelphia he stepped away from the mike behind the glass wall that took up one side of the studio the engineer gave him a thumbsup this wasnt the fellow hed worked with for so long in richmond but some stranger still jake thought hed given a good speech too nice to find out other folks could tell well done mr president saul goldman said when jake stepped out into the corridor what a speech can do that one did yeah featherston wished the director of communications hadnt put it like that what a speech could doa speech might make soldiers fight a little longer it might make factory hands work a little harder all that would helpsome no speech in the world though could take back kentucky or tennessee no speech in the world could take back atlanta or savannah or unsever the divided body of the confederacy no speech could take back the rocket works in huntsville and no speech could keep birmingham from falling any day now no speech not to put too fine a point on it could keep the confederate states of america from being really and truly screwed dammit featherston said i didnt reckon thingsd end up like this who would have sir goldman was loyal not only that he didnt aspire to the top spot himself maybe because he knew damn well no confederate general or party bigwig would take orders from a potbellied little hebe the combinationand his skill at what he didmade him invaluable they also meant jake could talk more freely to him than to anyone else except perhaps lulu no this aint how things were supposed to work the president repeated swear to god saul if the yankees lick us its on account of we dont deserve to win you know what i mean what can we do we have to win goldman said featherston nodded he had the same attitude himself well keep fighting till we cant fight any more thats what and we wont surrender not ever he said if we ever stop fighting itll only be on account of we got nobody left to fight with by god the director of communications nodded youve always been very determined i knew it right from the first time you started broadcasting on the wireless he shook his head in wry wonder thats more than twenty years ago now sure as hell is jake said you could see those years in goldmans gray hair in how little of it he had left in his waistline and double chin on the outside time had dogged featherston less harshly he had lines on his face that hadnt been there then and his hairline had retreated at the temples too but he remained whipcord lean hate burned too hot in him to let him settle down and get fat and you know what he went on even if the war turns out rotten ive had a good life ive done most of the things i always aimed to do how many men can say that when you get right down to it not many goldman agreed damn right featherston paused to light a cigarette he didnt like to smoke just before he went on the air his voice was raspy enough anyway the folks who live down here after this war is over whoever the hell they turn out to be they wont have to worry about nigger trouble ever again no matter what and thats thanks to me goddammit he jabbed a thumb at his own chest yes mr president but goldman didnt sound happy jake had artillerymans ear and didnt hear so well as he had once upon a time while he might miss words though he was still dead keen for tone whats eating you saul he asked i guess its the way you put it sir the director of communications said slowly i can see the tsar talking about jews like that or the ottoman sultan talking about armenians when nobody flabbled much about the way the sultan got rid of his armenians that had encouraged jake to plan the same for the blacks in the csa hed said as much in over open sights too because he liked goldman he was willing to believe the other man had just forgotten the tsars a damn fool even if he is on the same side as us he said jews are white men dammit and so are armeniansi reckon cant talk about those folks the same way you do about niggers biggest mistake folks here ever made was shipping niggers over from africa nobody ever tried to fix ittill me and i damn well did saul goldman still didnt look convinced maybe his being jewish was finally causing problems after all his people had been persecuted unjustly that might make it hard for him to see that negroes really deserved what the freedom party was giving them if he was getting pangs of conscience now hed sure taken his own sweet time doing it trains had been carrying blacks off to the camps since before the war started and sauls propaganda helped justify it to the confederate people and to the world cmon outside jake told him maybe you need some fresh air itll help clear your head maybe goldman didnt argue like anyone who bumped up against jake featherston hed soon come to realize arguing with him didnt do a damn bit of good it was a fine spring day the savage heat and humidity that would close down soon hadnt yet descended on portsmouth like a smothering blanket a newly arrived hummingbird ruby throat glittering sucked nectar from a honeysuckle bush the smell of growing things filled the air but so did nastier odors the stench of death and the slightly less noxious stink of spilled fuel oil yankee bombers had been punishing hampton roads ever since the war began they had reason to damn them this was the most important confederate naval installation on the atlantic coast as in richmond few buildings had survived undamaged not many warships were fit to put to sea from here either salvage crews were clearing a sunken cruiser and destroyer from the channel that steel would find another useif the confederacy lasted long enough it will dammit featherston thought angry at himself for doubting the sun sparkled off the wavesand off the thin iridescent layer of fuel oil floating atop them a moored cruiser laid up with engine trouble and bomb damage let go with a salvo of eightinch shells theyd come down on the damnyankees heads soon enough a few us airplanes buzzed over hampton roads jake took that for granted nowadays cs air power did what it could but it couldnt do enough to hold the enemy at arms length any more not even above virginia by the sound of the engines most of the engines were above newport news on the north side of the mouth of the james antiaircraft guns flung shells at them but the bursts were too low to bring them down jake pulled a notebook out of his breast pocket and wrote we need stronger aa the confederate states needed lots of things right now he had no idea when engineers could get around to designing a largercaliber antiaircraft gun let alone manufacture one but it was on the list he looked down to put the notebook back in his pocket that spared his eyes when a new sun sprang into being above newport news six or eight miles away from where he was standing he suddenly had two shadows the new one far blacker than the old slowly the new shadow started to fade saul goldman had his hands clapped over his facemaybe hed been looking the wrong way jake stared north in openmouthed awe even when a quick fierce hot blast of wind almost knocked him ass over teakettle that toadstool cloud rising high into the sky was the most terrifying thing hed ever seen but it had a strange and dreadful beauty of its own goldman took his hands away he blinked tears ran down his face i can see yousort of he said isthis what we did to philadelphia yeah jakes voice was soft and dreamy almost as if hed just had a woman he might not have been able to stop the damnyankees from making their bomb but in spite of everything hed finished ahead of them both sides had staggered over the finish line still the csa won first prize yisgadal vyiskadash shmay rabo saul went on in a language jake didnt know the president of the csa hardly noticed hed struck first and hed struck at the enemy capital newport news he snapped his fingers who cared x i m jake featherston and im here to tell you the truth the voice coming out of the wireless set and the boundless arrogance it carried were absolutely unmistakable the president of the csa went on if the yankees reckoned theyd blow me up when they dropped their fancy bomb they reckoned wrong and they went and killed a big old pile of innocent women and babies the way the murderers always do damn flora blackford turned off the wireless in disgust blasting jake featherston off the face of the earth was the only way she saw to end this war in a hurry blasting newport news off the face of the earth had its points but it was only one town among many the lies featherston could tell to listen to him the us uranium bomb was designed solely to slaughter civilians what about the one his men had touched off right across the schuylkill from downtown philadelphia well that one was an attack against the us government and military it was if you believed featherston anyhow of course if you believed featherston there you also likely believed him when he said ridding his country of negroes was a good idea when he said the usa had forced him into war and when he said any number of other inflammatory and improbable things if jake featherston said he believed in god it would be the best argument flora could think of for either atheism or worshipping satan depending she nodded to herself and wrote that down on a notepad it would make a good line in a speech one thing featherston had said even before the us uranium bomb went off did seem to be true worse luck the united states hadnt caught the confederate raiders whod brought the bomb north flora supposed those raiders wore us uniforms and could sound as if they came from the usa all the same the joint committee on the conduct of the war would have to look into the armys failure to hunt them down but the joint committee had something else on the agenda this morning they were going across the schuylkill for a firsthand look at what the explosion of a uranium bomb was really like as she took a cab to congressional hall to meet with her colleagues she couldnt help noticing that a lot of westfacing buildings had their paint scorched or seared off on some the paint had come through intact only in patterns taller structures closer to the blast had shielded part of the paint but not all they say we blew that featherston item right off the map the driver remarked he seemed healthy enough but he was at least ten years older than flora which put him in his midsixties at the youngest it isnt true she answered i just heard him on the wireless oh the cabby said well thats adarn shame dont hardly see how well get anywhere till we smoke his bacon neither do i flora said sadly i wish i did when the cab pulled up in front of congressional hall she gave him a quarter tip which pleased him almost as much as seeing jake featherston stuffed and mounted would have much obliged maam he said touching a forefinger to the patentleather brim of his cap he was grinning as he zoomed away flora wasnt surprised to find franklin roosevelt there with the members of the joint committee first well see what one of these damn things can do he said then youll rake me over the coals for not getting ours first and for not keeping the confederates from finishing theirs did you think they could beat us to it she asked he shook his big head no i didnt think they had a prayer to tell you the truth theyre formidable people all the more reason for squashing them flat and making sure they never get up again sounds good to me flora said they went to the schuylkill in a bus two army officers helped roosevelt out of his wheelchair and into a seat then manhandled the chair aboard considering some of the terrain well be crossing maybe i should have brought a tracked model he said sounding a lot more cheerful than flora could have under the same circumstances the bus didnt cross at the closest bridge some of the steel supporting towers on that one had sagged a bit and army engineers were still trying to figure out whether it would stay up the joint committee on the conduct of the war had to chug north to find one that was sound then the bus went back south and west till wrecked buildings and rubble in the road made the driver stop were not quite a mile from the center of the blast one of the officers said it gets worse from here he wasnt wrong it got worse and worse and worse again before long only what had been the stoutest sturdiest buildings had any walls standing at all even they werent just scorched but half melted in a way flora had never imagined much less seen one of the army officers pushed franklin roosevelt forward when the rubble got too thick to let the man advance with the assistant secretary of war his colleague would bend and grab the front of the wheelchair together the two would get roosevelt over the latest obstacle and push him on toward the next steel and even granite lampposts sagged like candles in the hot sun how hot had it been when the bomb went off flora had no ideasome physicists might know hot enough plainly hot enough and then some somewhere between half a mile and a quarter of a mile from what the officers were calling ground zero there was no sidewalk or even rubble underfoot everything had been fused to what looked like rough crude glass it felt like hard unyielding glass under floras feet too my god she said over and over she wasnt the only one either she watched a catholic congressman cross himself and another take out a rosary and move his lips in prayer when you saw something like this what could you do but pray but wasnt a god who allowed such things deaf to mere blandishments can the confederates do this to us again someone asked roosevelt dear lord i hope not he exclaimed which struck flora as an honest unguarded response he went on to tell you the truth i didnt think they could do it once but theyve got an infiltratorhis names potterwhos so good hes scary we think he led their team and sothey surprised us damn them again flora said roosevelt nodded thats right they surprised us again they almost ruined us when they went up into ohio and then they didthis but do you know what theyre going to lose the war anyway even if we didnt fry jake featherston like an egg the way he deserves why didnt we a senator asked well we had intelligence he was in the hampton roads area and i still believe he was roosevelt replied but he wasnt right where we thought he was which is a shame why didnt we catch the people who did this flora said the ones who brought the bomb up here i mean the wireless has been saying we havent and i want to know why not they cant play chameleon that wellcan they it seems they can roosevelt said morosely just before i joined you at congressional hall i had a report that confederate wireless is claiming the bombers got out of the united states i cant confirm that and i dont know that ill ever be able to but i do know we dont have them yes ive heard the confederates making the same claim flora kicked at the sintered stuff under her feet we dont have any witnesses do we none whove come forward franklin roosevelt said im sure there were some but when a bomb like this goes off he didnt finish flora nodded anyhow when a bomb like this went off it took a whole neighborhood with it anyone who saw the truckshe supposed it was a truckthe bomb arrived in and wondered about it died in the blast from now on theyll be calling the police and the bomb squad any time anything bigger than a bicycle breaks down a congressman said thats already happened roosevelt said its got cops all over the country jumping like fleas on a hot griddle but i dont know what we can do about it people are nervous and im afraid theyve got a right to be anyone need to see anything else the army officer behind him asked when nobody said yes the man started pushing roosevelt back toward the bus the members of the joint committee on the conduct of the war went back too the bus took them east over the schuylkill to philadelphia general hospital the closest one to survive the blast the pennsylvania hospital for mental and nervous diseases only a couple of blocks from ground zero was now as one with nineveh and tyre a tallish lump in the melted glass no more i think you people are a bunch of ghouls to rubberneck here a harried doctor said and i think you were crazy or stupid or both at once to rubberneck over there dont you know that goddamn bomb left some kind of poison behind weve had plenty of people who werent too bad and then their hair falls out and they start bleeding internallyand out their noses and eyeballs and fingernails and uh rectums tooand they just up and die you want that nobody told us a senator said faintly nu now im telling you the doctor said and now ive got to do some work hearing that was plenty for flora but some of her colleagues wanted to see what the doctor was talking about she went with them and ended up wishing she hadnt people with ordinary injuries were heartbreaking enough and the bomb caused plenty of those if a window shotgunned you with knifelike shards of glass or if your house fell down on you and you had to lie in and under the ruins till somebody pulled you out you werent going to be in great shape but there were others worse ones who made her have a hard time sleeping that night and for several nights afterwards the people with what the nurses called uranium sickness which had to be what the doctor described and the burnsthere were so many burns and such horrible ones how many hands with fingers fused together did she see how many faces with melted noses how many moaning sufferers with eyes boiled out of their heads she was glad to escape she didnt have the stomach for such things one of her colleagues said well at least weve paid the confederates back for this by then the members of the joint committee on the conduct of the war were climbing into their bus flora pointed back to the hospital im sure that makes the people in there very happy she said the congressman gave her an odd look i dont believe your hearts in this any more he said youve been a rock since the start why not now because now ive seen the difference between enough and too much flora answered and what these bombs do is too much she looked a challenge at him go aheadtell me im wrong he didnt he couldnt she hadnt thought he would a bner dowling had dreamt of seeing richmond in his professional capacity ever since his west point days those were long behind him now but here he was striding through the streets of the captured confederate capital with not a care in the worldexcept for breaking his neck in the rubble stepping on a mine setting off a booby trap or getting shot by one of the snipers who still haunted the ruins he turned to his adjutant you know its a funny thing he said whats that sir angelo toricelli was sporting silver oak leaves instead of gold on his shouldersthe spoils of victory we mashed this damn place flat but next to what happened to philadelphia and newport news its nothing but small change oh the younger officer nodded well we had to do it the hard way not all at once if theyd held out a little longer though wouldnt have broken my heart dowling said i know that sounds cold but its the lords truth a superbombs about the only thing that would have got these peoples attention as if to underscore the point somebody with an automatic weapon opened up in the distance dowling started to dive for cover then checked himself none of the bullets came anywhere near a shattered storefront nearby had freedom painted on it that graffito and csa were everywhere in richmond the locals didnt like the idea of living under the stars and stripes for the first time since something moved back behind the storefront dowlings hand dropped to the on his belt it wasnt much of a weapon against an automatic tredegar but it was what he had lieutenant colonel toricellis pistol leaped from its holster come out of there he barked the kid who did couldnt have been much above seven years old he looked at the greengray uniforms then asked you a couple of niggerlovin damnyankees before dowling or toricelli could answer the kid went on got any rations im mighty hungry why should we feed you if you call us names dowling asked what names the little boy didnt get it hed probably never heard us soldiers called anything else he rubbed his belly gimme some rations yall got any deviled ham here kid toricelli took a can out of a pouch on his belt and tossed it to the boy now you got some scoot the boy disappeared with his prize looking faintly embarrassed at himself toricelli turned to dowling maybe hell grow up civilized yeah maybe dowling said but dont hold your breath high overhead a swarm of bombers flew south like wintering birds below the james the confederates still fought as stubbornly as they could if they wouldnt give up what was there to do but keep pounding them till they didnt have any choice dowling wished he could see something but he couldnt once we win do we really want to try to run this place he asked speaking more to god than to his adjutant but his adjutant was the one who answered what choice have we got sir dowling wished he knew what to say to that if the usa beat the csa what happened next as far as dowling could see the usa had two choices the united states could leave an independent confederacy or they could reunite north america under the stars and stripes an independent confederacy was dangerous what had just happened to philadelphia told how dangerous it was but if virginia returned to the usawell what then if all these states that had been their own nation for eightyodd years returned to the one from which theyd seceded wouldnt they spend years trying to break away again wouldnt there be guerrillas in the mountains and the woods wouldnt there be people bombs in the cities wouldnt the locals send freedom party bastards to congress the way kentucky and houston had between the wars winning this goddamn war will be almost as bad as losing it would have been dowling said in a voice not far from despair that crossed my mind too sir his adjutant said how many of these sons of bitches will we have to kill as many as it takes dowling answered if we dont kill any more than that just for the fun of it our hands arepretty clean anyway he had to look around to orient himself the united states had knocked most of richmond flat while the confederate defenders had flattened much of the rest theyd fought hard they never seemed to fight any other way but there hadnt been enough of them to keep us soldiers from breaking in jefferson davis robert e lee stonewall jackson old pete longstreet woodrow wilson the famous confederates of ages past had to be spinning in their gravesunless us bombs had already evicted them a pity jake featherston wasnt spinning in his well the time for that was coming you know sir in a way theyre lucky here lieutenant colonel toricelli said oh yeah hows that dowling asked its like i said beforeif theyd kept fighting a little longer they would have had a uranium bomb come down on their heads then theyd think whats left here was paradise by comparison well youre bound to be right about that dowling said except most of them wouldnt be doing any thinking like they do anyway his adjutant put in that stopped him but only for a second because theyd be dead he finished a lot of them already were the stench in the air left no doubt of that stench or no stench though hed done something a lot of the most important people in us history never managed hed remembered longgone confederate dignitaries before now lincoln and mcclellan james g blaine and john pope and teddy roosevelt and george custer sprang to mind not a one of them had ever set foot in richmond but here i am by god dowling thought proudly general hey general dowling sir somebody behind him yelled guess what sir that doesnt sound so good angelo toricelli said no it doesnt slowly ponderously dowling turned im here what is it guess what the soldier said again but then he told what we just found a whole family of niguh negroes all safe and sound well ill be damned dowling said a few blacks had come out of hiding when us soldiers entered richmond but not many after the uprising here jake featherstons goons had been uncommonly thorough every surviving negro seemed a separate surprise who are they how did they make it they were servants to some rich guy before the war the soldier answered carter i think his name was from the tarkas estate or maybe ive got it backwardsdunno for sure sir but anyway he and his people have been hiding them ever since colored folks started having trouble here how about that lieutenant colonel toricelli said just when you think theyre all assholes somebody goes and does something decent and fools you theyre human beings dowling said they arent always the human beings we wish they were but theyre human beings he raised his voice to call to the soldier send this carter fellow to my headquarters id like to talk to him will do sir the man replied dowlings headquarters were in a tent in capitol square not far from the remains of the statue of albert sidney johnston george washingtons statue smothered in sandbags still stood nearby he got back there just before jack carter arrived the virginian was tall and trim and handsome with gray eyes black hair and weathered features he looked to be some age between thirtyfive and sixty welcome dowling told him id like to shake your hand carter looked at himlooked through him really im sorry general but i dont care to shake yours this wasnt going to go the way abner dowling had thought it would whatever carter was he wasnt the us liberal somehow fallen into the csa dowling had thought him to be maybe youll explain why the us soldier said of course sir id be glad to jack carter replied my chiefest reason is that i am a confederate patriot i wish you were hundreds of miles from here suing for peace from victorious confederate armies thats nice dowling said jake featherston wishes the same thing he wont get his wish and you wont get yours santa claus doesnt have those in his sack jake featherston do me the courtesy if you please of not mentioning that name in my presence again carters loathing might have been the most genteel dowling had ever met which made it no less real sorry about that hes still president of the confederate states hes an upstart a backwoods bumpkin his father was an overseer jack carters lip curled that was one of those things people talked about but hardly ever saw dowling saw it now carter went on my family has mattered in this state since before the revolution a light went on in dowlings head thats why you saved your negroes yes of course theyve served us for as long as weve served virginia to lose them to the vulgar excesses of that demagogue and his faction carter shook his head no noblesse oblige dowling murmured mock me if you care to we did what we thought right for them dowling wasnt sure whether he was mocking or not without a doubt carter had risked his own life and his familys to protect those of his servants that almost required admiration and yetdid you do anything for other colored people mr carter that was not my place carter said simply but youll find i was not the only one to take the measures i thought necessary he was bound to be right some other whites had hidden negroes and helped them escape the freedom partys population reductions some had yes but not very many maybe youd better go dowling said jack carter took a step back you thought we might be friends because of what i did i assure you sir i am more sincerely your enemy than jake featherston ever dreamt of being good day he bowed then stalked out he might be a more sincere enemy but jake featherston made a more dangerous one carter was content to abhor from a distance featherston wasnt he wanted to kill what he didnt like and he was much too good at it a sergeant with the wireless patch on his left sleeve burst into the tent paris sir he exclaimed paris dowlings first thought absurdly was of helen of troy the sergeant set him straight yes sir paris the kaiser just blew it to hell and gone eiffel towers nothing but a stump the report says jesus christ dowling said and then will anything still be standing by the time this damn war gets done n obody messed with lavochkins looters as they fought their way up the south carolina coast toward charleston nobody shot at them from ambush nobody gave them any guff when they went through a town confederate soldiers who surrendered to them seemed pathetically grateful to have the chance you see lieutenant boris lavochkin said you can put the fear of god in these assholes you can and we did chester martin didnt answer that he pretended he didnt hear it he wished he could pretend hed had nothing to do with the massacre in hardeeville but he had he was no damn good at lying to himself even if he were the nightmares that tore apart even his exhausted sleep would have made him stop trying he wasnt the only one who had them several guys in lavochkins platoon were jumpier than a cat at a great dane convention some replacements knew what was going on as soon as they came in arent you the guys who they would say and stop right there others more naпve or less plugged in tried to figure out what was going on they usually said something on the order of how come you guys are so weird if anything bothered lieutenant lavochkin he didnt show it if anything he was proud of what had happened in hardeeville nobody fucks with my outfit he would tell anyone who wanted to listen i mean nobody you fuck with us tell the carver what you want on your goddamn headstone cause you are all over with captain rhodes kept shaking his head i never expected anything like this to happen to me he said one evening he and chester had got outside of some pretty good cherry brandy a confederate had left behind booze blunted nightmares wars a filthy business chester said god knows i saw that the last time around i think the trenches were even worse than what were doing now for fighting in i mean yeah for fighting in the company co agreed or rather half agreed for he went on but what happened in hardeeville that wasnt fighting that was justmurder for the fun of it and what the confederates are doing in those goddamn camps that isnt fighting either thats murder for the fun of it too cause the smokes cant fight back this wars filthier than the last one was the horrible stuff then just kinda happened cause they couldnt help it this time theyre making it horrible on purpose he knew about the last war from what hed read and what people told him he wasnt anywhere near old enough to have fought in it you have a point sir chester said some of a point anyway disagreeing too openly with a superior didnt do but he damn well had been through the great war what about the guys who started using gas you think they werent being horrible on purpose well you got me there rhodes admitted chester liked shooting the bull with him not least because he would admit somebody else had a point he didnt have anything close to boris lavochkins messianic confidence in his own rightnessand righteousness what was lieutenant lavochkin but a scale model of jake featherston featherston had flushed a whole country down the toilet lavochkin had only a platoon to play withso far but chester was part of the platoon if the lieutenant threw it away the first sergeant went with it he didnt want to think about that so he took another swig yeah cherry brandy made a good thought preventer the bottle was damn near empty he passed it to captain rhodes who put the kibosh on damn near charleston up ahead chester said wont be long now one more city rhodes said oh its more than that chester knew he sounded shocked but rhodes would have gone to school in the lull of the s back then nobody thought you needed to remind anybody of just how and why the usa and csa got to be mortal foes they would stay peaceful and live happily ever after and if pigs had wings chester remembered his own school days before the great war they pounded you over the head with the war of secession then they kept saying that one day the usa would pay the csa back and the united states did and then the confederate states had some backpaying to do and thats how come im sitting on my ass somewhere south of charleston chester thought i wouldnt mind marching through there he said give them one in the eye for fort sumter you know well yeah rhodes said but it didnt mean so much to him martin could tell he didnt have that this is where it all began and well damn well end it here too kind of feeling maybe lieutenant lavochkin would or maybe he hated the whole confederacy equally all things considered chester didnt want to ask him he woke with a headache the next morning strong coffee and a couple of aspirins helped incoming artillery on the other handeven now the confederates counterattacked whenever they thought they could drive their foes back a couple of miles a us machine gun opened up no more than twenty yards from chester his head didnt explode which only proved he was tougher than he thought then he had to do some shooting of his own and that was even worse a lot of the confederates didnt hit the dirt as fast as they should have new men chester thought with an abstract sympathy that didnt keep him from killing them as fast as he could they would have done the same to him if they could but theyd got thrown into the fight too soon to know what they were doing and a lot of them would never have the chance to learn now us armor rattled up to put the final quietus on the confederate attack a couple of barrels had negroes riding on them the blacks had probably shown the barrel crews shortcuts through the coastal swamps one of them gleefully blazed away at the men in butternut with a submachine gun the cannons bellow made chester dryswallow three more aspirins the barrels pushed past the us foot soldiers and went after the confederates come on lieutenant lavochkin yelled follow me we dont leave them to do the work by themselves he jumped out of his hole and loped along with the greengray machines no matter what chester thought about him he was dead right there armor and infantry worked better as a team than either one did by itself come on guys chester scrambled from his foxholehe wasnt limber enough to leap the way the lieutenant did lets go get those bastards some confederates stayed stubborn to the end took a few yankees with them and died some gave up as soon as they could most of those lived killing in cold blood a poor scared kid who only wanted to quit didnt come easy the ones who hesitated were lost a youngster with a face full of zits and enormous gray eyes full of terror threw down his submachine gun and raised his hands high over his head dont shoot me mr damnyankee he blubbered to chester he couldnt have been more than sixteen i give up chester gestured with the muzzle of his rifle as it pointed to the young soldiers midsection a dark stain spread across his crotch oh jesus he wailed i went and pissed myself it happens chester said hed done it himself in two wars now but he wasnt going to tell that to a kid he was capturing he gestured with the rifle again go on back there and theyll take care of you one way or another thank you thank you god bless you hands still high the boy trudged off toward the rear and one way or another they would take care of him maybe theyd take him all the way back to a pow camp or maybe theyd just shoot him whatever they did it wasnt chesters worry any more the damned confederates kept fighting as hard as they could chester captured another guy who had to be older than he was the national assault force soldier had lost his upper plate and talked as if he had a mouthful of mush maybe we fought each other the lasht time around he said could be chester allowed i was on the roanoke front and then in northern virginia how about you nope i wash in tenneshshee the confederate retread said never reckon you bashtardsd get into shouf carolina you fuck with us pops and thats what happens chester told him go on back to the rear theyll deal with you uhhuh the oldtimer said bleakly unlike the kid he knew what could happen to him but he went hed passed the first key test he hadnt got killed out of hand all the others would be easier of course you only had to fail one and that was all she wrote come on lieutenant lavochkin shouted we push hard well be in charleston tomorrow maybe even by sundown chester thought he was right too try as they would the confederates didnt have enough to stop the men in greengray all of which turned out to have nothing to do with anything the wireless man shouted for captain rhodes sir weve got a stop order nobodys supposed to advance past map square gold oh yeah the company co said let me talk to division he talked he listened he talked some more then he did some shouting of his own all troops halt i say again all troops halt we have to stop right here no lieutenant lavochkin said weve got em licked the brass cant screw us out of this lieutenant the halt order comes straight from the war department captain rhodes said you can write em a nasty letter when this is all over but for now we are damn well going to halt no lavochkin repeated that is an order lieutenant rhodes voice turned icy from the war department and from me is that plain enough next stop the stockade they cant keep us out of charleston lavochkin raged the enemy hasnt got a chance the dumbshit brass hats in philly dont know diddlysquat im going forward anyway and taking my men with me well see you in charleston too no sir chester martin said lavochkin stared at him caught between fury and astonishment but a first sergeant was there to keep a lieutenant in line chester went on i think we better follow the order youll pay for this sergeant lavochkin said chester shrugged slowly and deliberately he sat down on the muddy ground and lit a cigarette ill take my chancessir he wondered whether lavochkin would go on by himself the rest of the platoon was stopping the lieutenants face had murder all over it but he stopped too he fumed and swore for the next three hours god damn it to hell i could have been in charleston by now we all could he said chester didnt think so but the lieutenant wasnt so far wrong why had the brass called a halt with the city so close when the fireball rose over charleston when the toadstool cloudweirdly beautiful and weirdly terrifyingrose high above the town where the war of secession started he understood so did captain rhodes lieutenant do you really want to get any closer to that place rhodes asked uh no sir boris lavochkin answered in an unwontedly small voice do you think following orders might be a good idea every once in a while even if you dont happen to like them personally captain rhodes persisted uh yes sir congratulations that is the right answer lieutenant do you realize you and whoever you dragged with you would have ended up dead if you did manage to break into charleston uh yes sir lavochkin said again still more softly than usual then remember that goddammit rhodes barked yes sir the young lieutenant said one more time and no doubt he wouldfor a while how long not long enough i bet chester martin thought p ortable wireless sets would have been a lot better if they lived up to their name luggable was more like it as far as leonard odoull was concerned the damn things were too damn big and too damn heavy and so were the batteries that powered them those batteries didnt last long enough either still having a wireless set was better than not having one especially since us wireless atlanta went on the air uswa had the power to punch through all the jamming the confederates put out and it brought the wordor the us version of the wordinto the heartland of the csa over near birmingham for instance it also gave us personnel something to listen to besides confederate connie her sultry voice kept reminding odoull hed been away from home too damn long he knew she told lies every time she opened her mouth like hundreds of thousands of other guys he kept listening to her anyway she sounded like bottled sex when he said something like that one evening eddie nodded then the corpsman said shes probably sixty and fat and ugly yeah she probably islife works that way too goddamn often odoull agreed but she sure sounds hot she doesnt do that much for me sergeant goodson lord said odoull reached for his wrist do you have a pulse man sergeant lord jerked his arm away not for the first time odoull wondered whether the senior medic was a fairy how could you like women and not like confederate connie eddie looked at his wristwatch seven oclock he said time for the news he switched the wireless from confederate connies music to uswa he couldnt have timed it better if he tried for a week hello said a deep voice with a distinctive us accent im eric sevareid and im here to tell you the real truth all the men in the aid station grinned how many times over how many years had they heard jake featherston open up a can of worms with that bullshit hope the confederates listen up goodson lord said theyd better he might be a queer but if he was he was a patriotic queer long as he doesnt grab my ass i can live with that odoull thought and felt proud of his own tolerance today president la follette again called for the surrender of the confederate states sevareid said on the wireless in his words only by quitting the war now can the csa hope to escape destruction of a sort the world has never seen before newport news and charleston are just the beginning we will put an end to this evil regime one way or another which way that will be is the only thing left for existing confederate officials to decide thats telling em eddie said he was as mild and inoffensive a little guy as ever came down the pike but he hated the csa he wouldnt have had to see so much misery if not for jake featherston featherstons reply was we arent going to lay down for the united states and they cant make us do it sevareid continued he is believed to have broadcast that reply from somewhere in north carolina richmond of course is in us hands featherston narrowly escaped the newport news bomb and us forces are now pushing toward hampton roads before long he will be a president without a country the broadcasters voice showed unmistakable satisfaction in the european half of the war german drives against russia continue sevareid said the tsars army shows signs of disintegration but petrograd wirelessnow broadcasting from moscow after the destruction of petrograddenies reports that the tsar is seeking an armistice from germany if russia bails out england and france are done lord opined france is about done anyway eddie said byebye gay paree he waved half a lifetime spent in the republic of quebec speaking french almost all the time made odoull look at france differently from most americans it was the sun around which quebec revolved whether they were on the same side or not and when the heart of the sun was torn out despite the loss of paris france also denies any plan to leave the conflict eric sevareid said the new king of france louis xix vows revenge against germany and winston churchill was quoted by the bbc as saying we can match the hun bomb for bomb let him do his worst and we shall do our best with gods help it will be good enough with him and featherston the bad guys have all the good talkers sergeant lord said doesnt seem fair churchills a better speaker than featherston any day odoull said hes not such a bastard either thats what you say doc eddie put in ask the kaiser and i bet hed tell you different since he was bound to be rightwhat did the kaiser care about the csaodoull didnt argue with him he gave his attention to the wireless japan has sent russia an ultimatum over several siberian provinces if the tsars forces do not evacuate them the japanese threaten to take them by force wait a minute lord said the japs and the russians are on the same side theyre on the same side against us leonard odoull said otherwise forget it the japs already screwed england in malaya theyve got australia sweating bullets theyre the ones whove done the best for themselves in this war if theyd driven us out of the sandwich islands nobody could ever touch em wont be easy even the way things are eddie said they havent used any of these new superbombs yet odoull said i wonder how close they are to building one well if they werent working on em before they sure as hell are now goodson lord said that was another obvious truth back before the pacific war people in the usa would have wondered whether the japanese were smart enough to do something like that not any more the pacific war was a push or as close as made no difference but japan bombed los angeles while the united states never laid a glove on the home islands this time around the united states hadnt tried breaking through the japs island barricade either all the fighting had been on us soil and in us waters the united states was too busy fighting for their life against the confederacy to give japan more than a fraction of their attention it had been quiet up at the front suddenly it wasnt any more machine guns and automatic weapons started banging away its getting dark outside lord exclaimed what the hell do they think theyre shooting at they dont care odoull answered somebody imagined he saw something and as soon as one guy starts shooting they all open up we better get up there eddie told his fellow corpsmen they scurried out of the aid station before long theyd likely be back with wounded men eric sevareid went on talking about the world and the usa he had a good wireless voice a voice that made you think he was your friend even though youd never met him and never would you wanted to believe what he said you wanted to believe what jake featherston said too even after you knew what a liar he was if he didnt believe it himself he put on one hell of an act will the corpsmen be able to find us in the dark goodson lord asked dont know odoull answered but ill tell you somethingim not gonna put on a light if our own side doesnt shoot us because of it the enemy would not even fifteen minutes later he heard the toofamiliar shout of doc hey doc from somewhere off to the left hey eddie he yelled back a battery of s was thundering behind the us lines pretty soon cs artillery would open up too or theyd start shooting off screaming meemies and then hell really would be out to lunch in the meantimewe got a sucking chest doc eddie said odoull swore that was a bad wound one that would kill the soldier who had it unless everything went rightand might kill him anyway how are we fixed for plasma he asked sergeant lord weve got enough lord answered good odoull said grab a big needlechances are well want to pour it in as fast as we can sweat made the corpsmens faces shine when they brought in the wounded soldier heat and humidity were starting to build toward summer odoull noticed only out of the corner of his eye most of his attention focused on the corporal on the stretcher the man had bloody foam on his lips and nostrils sure as hell hed taken one through the lung get him up on the table odoull told the corpsmen to goodson lord he said get him under right lord said he jammed the ether cone down on the noncoms face as soon as the corpsmen put him in position the plasma line went in next the corporal already seemed unconscious so odoull started cutting even before the anesthetic would have fully taken hold seconds counted here when he opened the guy up he found the chest cavity full of blood he hadnt expected anything different he had a fat rubber tube ready to go to siphon it out of there how bad was the wound did he have time to tie off the major bleeders in the lung or would he have to do something more drastic he needed only a moment to decide he couldnt do anything that took a long time his vorpal scalpel went snickersnack and took out the bottom two lobes of the right lung that left him with just a few vessels to tie off and he knew where they werehe didnt have to go looking for them you could live with a lung and a third you could live with one lung if you had to though you wouldnt have an easy time if you did anything strenuous for a living with the worst of it done he repaired the wound in the corporals back whats his bp he asked as he worked its over goodson lord answered checking the cuff not real great but its pretty steady anyway all right odoull dusted the inside of the chest cavity with sulfa powder then started closing up hed read in a journal that the powder probably helped less than people said it did he used it anyhow why not it wouldnt hurt what do you think sergeant lord asked while he finished he left a honking big drain in the incision that could come out later if shock doesnt get him if he doesnt hemorrhage odoull shrugged wishing for a cigarette ive done what i can maybe hell make it i can hope so anyway the corporal would be dead for sure if he hadnt got here if he livedif he lives score one for me odoull thought that wasnt a bad feeling to have not even a little bit l ieutenant michael pound had fought through the battle of pittsburgh hed seen what a city looked like after two armies jumped on it with both feet now on the outskirts of birmingham alabama he was seeing it again confederate general patton was holed up inside birmingham and he wasnt coming out the usa had forced him out of atlanta but he refused to pull what was left of his army out of the alabama factory town he refused to surrender too if you want me come and take me he told the us officers who went in to parley with him i dont want to dig the son of a bitch out a block at a time sergeant mel scullard grumbled expensive goddamn real estate yknow yeah pound nodded maybe we wont have to how come sir the gunner asked cant just leave him there no but if we gave one to newport news and we gave one to charleston how long will it be before we give one to birmingham too pound said scullard laughed a particularly nasty laugh bye george he said waving see you in hell like you deserve thatd be pretty good all right joe mouradian agreed but what if they blow us up too we aint that far outside of town ourselves urk pound hadnt thought of that the more he did the more it worried him the brass would be eager to get rid of patton after jake featherston and maybe ferdinand koenig he was the most dangerous character the confederacy had if one of those superbombs took him out but hurt or maybe killed some of their own guys how much would the fellows back in philadelphia care not a whole hell of a lot not unless a dedicated cynic like michael pound missed his guess he stuck his head out of the cupola for a quick looksee he wasnt sure what a superbomb could do to birmingham that lots and lots of ordinary bombs and artillery shells hadnt already done the place had been torn up and burned more times than anybody could count everything that wasnt green was gray or black and just about all the walls he could see either listed or had chunks bitten out of them or both but the remnants of pattons army of kentucky still lurked in the ruins they were stubborn men with automatic weapons and stovepipe rockets they wouldnt be winkled out easily or cheaply maybe a superbomb could get rid of them the way ddt got lice out of clothes as if to prove the confederate states were still in business somebody squeezed off a burst from one of their carnivorous machine guns pound ducked down into the barrel he didnt want to win a purple heart not this late in the game he didnt want to buy a plot either anything worth going after sir scullard asked notright this minute pound answered he prided himself on being an aggressive soldier and he was still ready to go forward whenever anybody told him to without anything obviously urgent ahead though he was just as well pleased to sit tight this must be what the end of the war feels like he thought yeah you were still willing but how eager were you when pushing too hard might get you killed just when things wound down sitting tight didnt mean sticking his head in the sand like an ostrich standing up in the open cupola wasnt smart right now all rightnext best thing then that was looking out through the periscopes built into the cupola he couldnt see as much with them as he could head and shoulders above there but powaski he shouted to the bow gunner and wireless man ten oclock somebody sneaking up on us maybe yards im on it powaski answered over the intercom the bow gun wasnt useful very often pound had heard talk that the next generation of barrels would dispense with it and go with a fourman crew instead of five this once though it was liable to be a lifesaver it started to chatter now pound watched tracers spang off brickwork and fly every which way the turret hummed as scullard traversed it so he could bring the coaxial machine gunand maybe the cannon tooto bear like any welltrained gunner powaski squeezed off short bursts you didnt want to burn out your machinegun barrel and have to change the son of a bitch but the butternut bastard behind the bricks got the bow gunners rhythm quicker than he had any business doing as soon as powaski eased off the trigger after a burst he popped up and let fly with a stovepipe rocket aw shit pound said it was a long shot for one of those babies maybe this one would fall short or fly wide left or right like a bad field goal maybe it would but it didnt it caught the barrel right in the glacis plate the thick armor there nearly kept the hollowcharge warhead from penetrating nearly mattered with everything but horseshoes and hand grenadesand it turned out hollowcharge warheads too powaski and neyer both screamed pound didnt think either of them had a prayer of getting out and inside a barrel nine million different things could catch fire especially when a whitehot gout of flame played across them pound screamed himself out some of the things that could catch fire were his boots and his coveralls they could and they did he screamed again without words this time then he shot out through the cupola he never remembered opening it but he must have next thing he knew he was on the ground beside the burning barrel on the ground and rolling away mel scullard had got out too more of his clothes than of pounds were burning drop and roll and beat out the fire that was what they taught you doing it while you were actually burningwell if you could do that you were disciplined indeed michael pound surprised himselfhe was he got some more burns on his hands putting out his boots and the legs to his coveralls but he did it easy when its either that or make an ash of yourself he thought and started to laugh then he realized it wasnt just his clotheshed been on fire too he howled like a wolf instead a foot soldier in greengray ran up to mel scullard with a bucket of water and put him out scullard was already shriekingyes hed got it worse than pound corpsman the soldier yelled and then hold on for a second buddy and ill give you a shot what about me pound wondered he fumbled for the wound kit on his belt that was a brand new hellan inferno in factbecause his hands were burned he managed to get out the syringe and stick himself he wanted instant relief hell he wanted a whole new carcass every second he had to wait seemed an eternity maybe this is what einstein means about relativity inside the burning barrel ammunition started cooking off he hoped it wouldnt keep medics back the first team that got there carried sergeant scullard away well be right back for you pal a little bespectacled guy called to pound he didnt wait for an answer right back turned out to be something more like fifteen minutes by then the morphine syrette had kicked in it didnt make the pain disappear but did shove it into a dark closet so pound didnt have to give all of his attention to it anything was better than nothing here came that same stretcher team ease onto the litter there the little guy saidhe seemed to be in charge he looked at pounds legs with experienced eyes not too bad its never too bad when it happens to somebody else pound snarled in no mood for sympathy the little guy blinked then nodded well im not gonna tell you youre wrong he turned to the other bearers on threeonetwothree up went the stretcher how come we get the heavy guy after the light one eddie a bearer grumbled cause were lucky thats why said the guy with the glasses come on lets move they took pound back to an aid station a few hundred yards behind the line morphine or no morphine he yelled and swore whenever a stretcherbearer missed a step he felt ashamed at being such a slave to pain which didnt mean he could do anything about it red crosses flew everywhere on and around the aidstation tent which didnt keep bullet holes from pockmarking the canvas docs still busy with your buddy eddie said want another shot yes please pound said in lieu of grabbing him by the shirtfront and making him use the syrette he hardly noticed the bite of the needle the second shot really did send the pain off into some distant province he thought so anyway till they picked him up again and lugged him inside that hurt in spite of all the morphine hows mel he asked the doctor who was scrubbing his hands in an enameled metal basin hes the other burned man the doctor had a funny accent half new england half almost frenchsounding he waited for pound to nod then said i think hell make it he wont be happy for a while though he turned to eddie get this one up on the table and well see how happy hell be right doc eddie said somebodya medic pound supposedstuck an ether cone over his face the gas didnt just smell bad it smelled poisonous even as consciousness faded he tried to tear off the cone they wouldnt let him when he woke up his legs hurt so bad he wasnt sure hed really been anesthetized but he lay in a bed somewhere that wasnt the aid station his groan brought a real live female nurse she wasnt beautiful or anything but she was the first woman from the usa pound had seen in a devil of a long time in pain she asked briskly yes he said thinking what the hell do you expect even though shed asked a dumb question she had the right answer ill give you a shot as she injected him she went on the tannicacid dressings do hurt i know but youll heal much better because of them your burns wont weep so much and youre less likely to get infected oh boy pound said everything else seemed secondary to the way he felt he tried to look around but his eyes werent tracking real well yet is mel scullard here he asked adding hes my gunner yes hes three beds down the nurse said he hasnt regained consciousness yet poor mel he did get it worse than i did pound thought then the morphine started to kick in it struck faster now than it had right after he got burned maybe that meant he wasnt fighting so much pain he could hope so anyhow ahh he said we have to be careful with this stuff the nurse told him we dont want you getting hooked right then pound couldnt have cared less if he had to stick a needle in his arm every hour on the hour for the rest of his life if it made him stop hurting that struck him as a good deal down underneath there wasnt much difference between people and animals war brought that out all kinds of ways pound wished like anything he hadnt found out about this one at firsthand t he officers pow camp to which the yankees took jerry dover was somewhere not far from indianapolis the train trip that brought him there wasnt much fun but it was instructive just the same confederate wireless went on and on about all the sabotage that raiders behind us lines were still perpetrating in georgia and tennessee and kentucky well maybe they were even so the train didnt have to stop once it didnt even have to slow down as far as dover could tell it didnt make any detours yes bridges and overpasses were guarded yes concrete blockhouses with machine guns sticking out of them protected some stretches of track but trains seemed to get wherever they needed to go and to get there on time jerry dovers train also had no trouble crossing the ohio all the bridges across what had been the csus border should have been prime targets they probably were if this one near evansville had ever been hit it had also been efficiently repaired evansville itself had been bombed but it hadnt been flattened the way so many confederate cities were it lay in the western part of indiana well away from the early thrust north that almost won the war for the csa they should have done a better job here complained the artillery captain sitting next to dover its a big country dover said they couldnt get all of it well they should have the younger man repeated glumly he wasnt wrong but if the united states turned out to be too big to let the confederacy smash them all up didnt that go a long way toward explaining why the war was going as it was it sure looked that way to dover actually reaching the camp also told dover his country was fighting out of its weight he knew how the csa housed prisoners of war the confederacys camps were no sturdier than they had to be because his country had nothing to spare they probably didnt break geneva convention rulesyou didnt want to give the enemy an excuse to take it out on pows from your sidebut he would have been amazed if they didnt bend them camp liberty with the exclamation pointa sardonic name if ever there was one wasnt like that dover wouldnt have wanted to assault it with anything less than an armored brigade it didnt just have a barbedwire perimeter it had a wall and a moat with barbed wire on top of the wall and outside the machinegun towers beyond the water you got in there you werent going anywhere inside the buildings were as solid as if they were meant to last a hundred years yes indiana had harder winters than georgia but even so the lumber and the brickwork and the labor the united statescould afford to lavish on a place like this were daunting if the military clerk who signed him in were twentytwo years old and fit jerry dover really would have been alarmed but the man had to be at least sixtyfive with a white kaiser bill mustache the likes of which dover hadnt seen since he quit fighting the damnyankees in didnt this guy know they were as out of fashion as bustles evidently not he seemed proud of his youre in barracks twelve and youll sleep on cot seventeen the clerk declared in harsh midwestern tones numbers are large i dont think you can miss em after that dover felt he ought to get lost on general principles he couldnt though because the yankee was right directional signs told you just where everything was barracks was a brick building with a pouredconcrete floor starting a tunnel and keeping it hidden would be a bitch or more likely impossible two stout coalburning stoves sat there to heat the hall in winter a wireless set was playing an insipid yankee tune when dover walked in the confederates punished pows for clandestine wirelesses us authorities equipped the halls with them that was daunting too a colonel in his late thirties ambled up to dover howdy im kirby smith telford he said texas in his voice and in his name im the senior officer hereabouts they caught me outside of chattanooga late in jerry dover introduced himself they shot up my command car and got me in front of huntsville he said i was up near chattanooga too had to clear out my supply dump quick as i could when the damnyankees paratroops came down yeah that screwed everything up all right telford watched him with a blueeyed directness that looked friendly but dover realized wasnt you sound like youve been around i reckon somebody in herell be able to vouch for you vouch for me dover echoed im a pow for crying out loud what the hell else am i gonna be he didnt think the colonel would have an answer for him but kirby smith telford did maybe a yankee plant they try it every now and then see what they can find out about us pretty soon youll find out who you can talk in front of and who youve got to watch yourself with i dont mean any offense coloneldont get me wrongbut right now i dont know you from adam so ill be careful what i say around you however you please i dont mean any offense either but right now i dont know how much difference its gonna make dover said telfords face clouded thats defeatist talk he said stiffly ive got news for you colonel the damnyankees didnt capture me outside of huntsville because were winning the senior officer turned away from him without another word dover contemplated winning friends hed just lost one even if somebody did vouch for him now telford wouldnt want much to do with him well too goddamn bad dover thought if he doesnt like the truth he can read a novel he found cot it was a better bed than the one hed had in his own tent it had a footlocker underneath dover didnt have much to stick in there not after the soldiers who caught him relieved him of his chattels personal they hadnt shot him and they could have next to that robbery was a detail he stretched out on the cot hed been sitting up ever since he got on the train somewhere near the alabamageorgia border two minutes later he was snoring what might have been the voice of godif god talked like a yankeeblasted him awake supper call supper call the camp had a pa system he was sure the confederates had never thought of that supper wasnt fancy but it wasnt bad fried chicken green beans overcooked of coursethe exrestaurateur did notice that and french fries you could take seconds the apple pie for dessert was actually pretty good dover turned to the captain sitting next to him and said hell of a note when the enemy feeds us better than our own side did yeah the younger officerexcept for some other obvious retreads all the men in here were younger than doverlooked surprised hadnt thought about it like that but youre right if i am what does it mean dover didnt like any of the answers that occurred to him the most obvious one was the one that was probably true the united states were enough richer than the confederacy that they didnt have to worry about pennies and dimes they could afford to do little things like build sturdy pow camps and give enemy soldiers decent rations the csa couldnt the confederates had enough trouble taking care of their own men nothing to do after supper but troop back to the barracks hall a couple of card games got started two officers bent over a chess set by the way they shot pieces back and forth as the game opened theyd already played each other a great many times dover played a fair game of checkers but chess had never interested him he figured hed play poker or bridge one of these days but he didnt feel like it now he went up to kirby smith telford who was reading a news magazine and shaking his head every now and then can i get some paper and a pencil dover asked id like to let my family know im in one piece theyll have a red cross wire by now telford said which was likely true but he handed dover a sheet of cheap stationery imprinted camp liberty an envelope and a pencil dont seal it when youre done he warned censors look over everything you write i reckoned they would dover said after more than ten years of freedom party rule in the csa he took censorship for granted no reason the damnyankees wouldnt have it too thanks he added and went back to his own cot as he went he felt colonel telfords eyes boring into his back did the other officer think he hadnt been respectful enough did they worry about that crap here if they did why for gods sake what difference did it make now as for dover hed cussed out generals he was damned if hed get all hot and bothered about somebody whose three stars didnt even have a wreath around them he wished he could have grabbed some table space writing at the cot was awkward but he managed dear sally he wrote i bet you will have heard by now that im a pow im up here in the usa in indiana im not hurt theyre treating me all right i love you and the kids ill see you when the war is over i guess xoxoxoxjerry he looked at the letter after a shrug he nodded it said everything he needed to say he couldnt see anything the censor would flabble about he folded the paper put it in the envelope and wrote his home address on the outside no matter what telford had said he started to lick the glue on the flap but caught himself in time im a creature of habit all right he thought somebody turned on the wireless women sang about war bonds in yapping yankee accents they wouldnt have made dover want to buy when the advertisement ended an announcer said and now the news none of the news was good not if you were a confederate pow dover assumed us broadcasts bent things the same way his side did but you could bend them only so far before you started looking ridiculous when the newsman said birmingham was surrounded it probably was when he said us soldiers had freed more starving political prisoners from rocket factories on the outskirts of huntsville they probably had using politicals for work like that sounded like something the freedom party would do so did starving them and when the fellow said the tsar was asking the kaiser for an armistice how could you doubt him after petrograd went up in smoke russia had hung on longer than jerry dover thought it could but all good things came to an end england and france would be in even more trouble now that germany didnt have to fight on two fronts two confederate cities had already gone up in smoke so had a big part of philadelphia the war on this side of the atlantic sounded like a game of last man standing who could make superbombs faster who could get them where they needed to go how long could the poor bastards on the other side stand getting pulverized odds were the united states could make bombs faster they made everything else faster odds were the usa could deliver the goods too how long could even jake featherston stay stubborn when death rained down on his country from the skies camp liberty dover winced odds were hed get his liberty back when his country finished losing the war xi j onathan moss savored the feeling of being at a forward air base again he was a little southwest of atlantanot too far from where hed pounded the ground with gracchus guerrillas comparing what he could do now with what hed done then was funny in a macabre way the new turbo fighter could take him as far in an hour as he could march in a month every time he flew off towards alabama he hoped to pay the confederates back for all the time away from his specialty theyd cost him the pilot whod shot him down might have killed him instead so might the soldiers whod taken him prisoner he didnt dwell on that resenting them for turning him into a guerrilla helped keep and hone his fighting edge his biggest trouble these days was finding someone to fight the confederates didntcouldntput up many fighters any more he had a pretty good notion of what his screaming eagle could do but he wanted to put it through its paces against the best opposition the enemy could throw at it if the turbo wasnt going after the latest soupedup hound dogs or razorbacks or mules it didnt have much point it carried enough firepower to make a fair groundattack aircraft but only a fair one it went so fast and covered so much ground it couldnt linger and really work over a target it had bomb racks but using it as a fighterbomber struck moss as the equivalent of using a thoroughbred to pull a brewery wagon sure you could do it but other critters were better suited to the job and so he wished the united states had come up with it a year and a half earlier it would have swept confederate aircraft from the skies as things worked out enemy airplanes were few and far between anyhow but getting them that way had taken a lot longer and cost a lot more his pulse quickened when he spotted a pair of hound dogs well below him the newest confederate aircraft got a performance boost by squirting wood alcohol into the fuel mix they were a match for any us pistonengined fighter they werent a match for a turbonot even close he gave the fighter more throttle and pushed the stick forward as he dove he wondered what kind of pilots sat in those cockpits these days the confederates had two types left kids just out of flight school who might be good once they got some experience but didnt have it yet and veterans whod lived through everything the usa could throw at them and whod be dangerous flying a twodecker left over from the last war the way these guys stuck together leader and wingman told him right away that theyd been through the mill so did the speed with which they spotted him and so did the tight turns into which they threw their aircraft the one thing a turbo couldnt do was dogfight a hound dog youd get in trouble if you tried theyd turn inside you and get on your tail in nothing flat even if they did they wouldnt stay there long in a turbo you could run away from anything in the world except another turbo moss climbed again for a new pass the hound dogs dove for the deck he followed them down smiling when his airspeed indicator climbed over no piston job could touch that not even diving for all it was worth they knew he was after them all right they stuck together all the same yes theyd been flying together awhile or more than awhile he had to guess which way theyd break when he got close he chose right and that was right they started to turn so they could shoot back at him but his thumb had already come down on the firing button atop the stick when the cannon boomed pieces flew from the cs wingmans hound dog the pilot struggled for control and lost the fighter spun toward the ground the pilot wouldnt have an easy time bailing out meanwhile though the leader was shooting at moss well he was trying to your sights wouldnt let you lead a turbo airplane it just flew too fast the leaders tracers went behind the turbo as it zipped past him swinging through as tight a turn as he could make moss came back at the cs fighter the hound dog didnt want any more of him its pilot wanted nothing more than to escape and he did too getting down to treetop height and dodging and jinking in a way moss couldnt hope to match all right buddyill see you some other time inside his cockpit moss sketched a salute that was a good flyer over there on the other side yeah he was a confederate son of a bitch but he made one hell of a pilot time to break off then when moss pulled back on the stick the turbo seemed to climb hand over hand no prop job could come close to matching that performance you had to trade speed for height but the turbo had so much speed that it sacrificed much less than a hound dog or similar us fighter if moss could have seen this in hed flown a twodecker pusher when the great war broke out that was the only way anyone had figured out to get a machine gun firing straight ahead no interrupter gear to fire through the spinning prop not yet moss laughed that technology was turning obsolete right before his eyes he hadnt had a wireless in his pusher either he hadnt had an enclosed cockpit let alone oxygen he hadnt worn a parachute if he went down he was a dead duck and with an airplane made of wood and canvas and glue and wire with an engine almost aggressively unreliable plenty of those early airplanes did go down even with no enemies within miles he laughed once more now he sat behind sheet metal and bulletproof glass in an armored seat he could fly more than twice as high as that pusher could have gone but he still flew or flew again with aggressively unreliable engines maybe he could bail out now if they went south on him on the other hand maybe he couldnt finding the airstrip from which hed taken off was another adventure just any old field wouldnt do the turbo had a high takeoff and landing speed it needed a lot of runway one that was fine for prop jobs likely wouldnt let him land instead of the base he spotted another airplane a confederate grasshopper buzzing along over us territory to see what it could see grasshoppers were marvelous little machines they could hover in a strong headwind and land or take off in next to nothing for artillery spotting or taking out casualties or sneaking in spies or saboteurs they couldnt be beat moss knew that several captured specimens were wearing the us eagle over crossed swords instead of the confederate battle flag the guy in this one saw him coming before he got close enough to fire it scooted out of the way with a turn no honest fighter could match try to shoot down a grasshopper whose pilot knew you were there and youd end up talking to yourself it was like trying to kill a butterfly with an axe more for the hell of it than any other reason moss made another pass with effortless ease the grasshopper evaded him again he didnt even bother opening fire and the observer in the back of the light airplanes cockpit squeezed off a burst at him with his pintlemounted machine gun none of the tracers came close but the defiant nosethumbingit couldnt be anything elsetickled moss funny bone he would have had a better chance against the grasshopper in his curtiss pusher than he did in a screaming eagle he made it back to the airfield and eased the turbo down to the ground you had to land gently the nosewheel was less sturdy than it should have been sometimes it would break off if you came down on it too hard the first couple of pilots whod discovered that would never learn anything else now howd it go a groundcrew man asked as moss climbed down from the cockpit nailed a hound dog he answered the groundcrew techs cheered somebody pounded him on the back he went on his buddy dove for the deck and got awaybastard was good and i made a couple of runs at a grasshopper but ffft he squeezed his thumb and forefinger together miming a watermelon seed squirting out between them take an even strain colonel a groundcrew man said those suckersll drive you bugshit the others also made sympathetic noises howd she perform another tech asked everything went fine this time around moss banged a fist off the side of his head in lieu of knocking wood engines sounded good gauges looked good all the way through guns behaved themselves nosewheel wasnt naughty he turned to eye it there it was all right looking as innocent as if its kind never ever misbehaved no matter how innocent it looked he knew better leaving the screaming eagle to the men who fed and watered it he walked over to the headquarters tent to report more formally his flight suit kept him warm up over thirty thousand feet here in the muggy warmth of georgia spring he felt as if it were steaming him colonel roy wyden ran the turbo squadron he was a boy wonder just past thirty with the ribbons for a distinguished service cross and a bronze star among the fruit salad on his chest when moss told him hed knocked down a cs fighter wyden reached into his desk drawer and pulled out a bottle and two glasses he poured a couple of knocks of good tennessee sipping whiskeyspoil of warand said way to go thank you sir moss tasted the drink and added thank you sir wyden grinned at himand seemed even younger moss went on i went after a grasshopper too but he got away a lot easier than the hound dogs buddy those goddamn things there ought to be a bounty on em wyden said a screaming eagle isnt exactly the weapon of choice against them either tell me about it moss exclaimed he fired at me i never laid a glove on him hes back there somewhere laughing his ass off theyll drive you to drink all right as if to prove it wyden sipped from his own whiskey he glanced over to moss does that hound dog make you an ace in both wars no sir i made it the first time but ive only got three this round moss said i spent too damn long on the shelf in andersonville and then running around with the black guerrillas you ought to get some credit for that its not like you didnt hurt the confederates while you were doing it the war on the grounds an ugly business some of the memories that surfaced in moss mind made him finish his drink in a hurry our war with the csa is ugly the one the negroes are fightingno quarter on either side there and what featherstons fuckers would have done to me for fighting on the negroes side better not to think about that wyden broke in yeah i know just staying alive took luck if the confederates hadnt had all of their regulars fighting the usa they wouldve hunted us down pretty damn quick jake shouldve started in on his blacks sooner or else left them alone till after the war trying to get rid of them at the same time as he was fighting us only screwed him up he figured hed whip us quick and then take care of the smokes wyden got outside the last of his drink tough shit eliot for some reason moss thought that was the funniest thing hed ever heard he started giggling nobody in the guerrilla band not even nick cantarella would have made that kind of joke moss hadnt known how much he missed it till he heard it again w hen george enos saw land off the oregons port bow he realized how much the war had changed that was the coast of north carolina out there even six months earlier coming so close would have been asking to get blown to pieces now some of the big wheels back in philadelphia thought the navy could get away with it george hoped like hell they were right two battleships two heavy cruisers two escort carriers to give them air cover the usual destroyers and supply ships that accompanied a flotilla now they were paying a call on the confederate states the gamble was that the confederates couldnt pay a return call on them listen up guys said wally fodor the chief in charge of georges antiaircraft guns we can put a hell of a lot of shells in the air no goddamn asskickers gonna make a monkey out of us right right the gun crew shouted george didnt know about the other guys but he was as pumped up as he would have been if he were playing in a big football game that was for glory and for cash though he was playing for his neck here dive bombers roared off the baby flattops decks they would send a message to a state that had mostly been shielded from the war ever since it started us fighters circled overhead any confederate airplanes that tried to visit the flotilla would get a warm reception smoothly almost silently the oregons forward pair of triple turrets swung so the big guns bore to port the barrels elevated a few degrees brace yourselves fodor yelled he covered his ears with his hands and opened his mouth wide to help equalize the pressure inside his head in the nick of time george did the same the guns thundered right over his head he staggeredhe couldnt help it he felt as if somebodyd dropped a boulder on his noggin in spite of his precautions his ears wanted to move to a far country where things like this didnt happen wow he said shore had to be twenty miles away maybe more some little while went by before the distant roar of bursting fourteeninch shells came back to georges abused ears he was amazed he heard themor anything else good morning morehead city wally fodor whooped george imagined people going about their business probably not even suspecting anything was wrong when all of a suddenwham fourteen hundred pounds of steel and high explosive coming down on your head could ruin your whole day the guns bellowed again when george reached for his ears this time it was to see if they were bleeding they didnt seem to be he couldnt imagine why not the other battleshipshe was the mainewas firing too those detonations were just loud or maybe his ears were so stunned that nothing this side of cataclysmic really registered well if they didnt know we were in the neighborhood before they damn well do now tom thomas said people mostly called the shelljerker ditto george wondered what the devil his parents were thinking of more booms said the latest shells were striking homeor maybe those were bombs from the carriers airplanes smoke began to rise from the shore the cruisers from the flotilla had to get closer to land than the battlewagons before opening up their eightinch main armament didnt have the range of the bigger ships heavier guns before long they started firing too this is so neat ditto said ever think we could get away with shore bombardment we aint got away with it yet fodor answered george enos was thinking the same thing but he was the new kid on the block so he kept his mouth shut the gun chief went on when we steam out of aircraft range then ill be happy and even after that theres fuckin subs the main armament fired again fired was the word too the gouts of flame that shot from the muzzles were almost as long as the gun barrels if god needed to light a cigar this was where hed do it up above the bridge the yranging antenna spun round and round round and round it would spot enemy airplanes on the way in anyway how much good that would dowell knowing the bastards were coming was better than not knowing they were inshore from the oregon not far from the cruisers a tall column of water suddenly sprang into being a moment later another one appeared even closer to the us warships what the hell somebody said those arent bombswe woulda got the word the bombers were loose they must have shore guns wally fodor said soon as we spot the flashes theyre history and theyll have a bitch of a time hitting us we can move but theyre stuck where theyre at a few more rounds fell near the cruisers then as abruptly as theyd begun they stopped either the confederates had given up or us gunfire put their cannon out of action george neither knew nor cared what the right answer was as long as those guns kept quiet that suited him fine then the pa system came to life with a crackle of static now hear this now hear this enemy aircraft approaching from the north expect company in five or ten minutes georges stomach knotted here we go again he thought hed had a ship sunk under him he knew disasters could happen he didnt want to remember that but he didnt see how he could help it either just like a drill chief fodor said they havent got us yet and we arent about to let em start right right the gun crew shouted again george was as loud as anybody how loud he yelled made no difference in the bigger scheme of things but it wasnt bad if it helped him feel a little better some of the fighters that had been circling over the ships zipped away to see if they could meet up with the intruders before the cs airplanes got the chance to intrude others held their stations if the enemy bombers got past the first wave of fighters they still wouldnt have a free run at the flotilla youve been through this before right fodor asked george i mean for real not just for practice sure chief george answered ive got it from the japs and featherstons fuckers and the limeys i dont like it but i can do it thats all you need the gun chief said i thought i remembered you lost your cherry but i wanted to make sure airplane engines scribed contrails across the sky their wakes george thought but the comparison with ships misled it wasnt just that airplanes were so much faster they also moved in three dimensions not just two like surface ships a destroyers antiaircraft guns started going off so did the heavy cruisers then george saw a couple of gullwinged ships that looked only too horribly familiar asskickers he yelled and his wasnt the only cry that rose one of the slow ungainly confederate dive bombers went down trailing smoke a moment after he shouted it splashed into the atlantic a mile or so from the oregon and kicked up more water than the shells the coastal guns had fired the other cs mule bored in on the battleship the oregon heeled in as tight a turn as she could make but she was large and cumbersome and much less nimble than say the josephus daniels would have been that made her action less evasive than george wished it were he didnt have much time to worry about it commence firing wally fodor shouted the shelljerkers started passing george ammo he fed the twin mms breeches like a man possessed casings leaped from the guns and clattered on the deck burstspuffs of black smokeappeared all around the attacking airplane but it kept coming the bomb under its belly dropped the asskicker zoomed past hardly higher than the tops of the battleships masts the bomb burst on the ocean less than fifty yards from the oregon water hit george like a fist in the face next thing he knew he was flat on his back partly on the deck partly on ditto thomas whod stood right behind him getgluboffa me goddammit thomas spluttered spitting out what looked like about half of the ocean yeah george scrambled to his feet and gave ditto a hand to haul him up too ditto rubbed at his eyes georges also stung from seawater the other men from the gun crew were picking themselves up wally fodor had a cut on his ear that bloodied the shoulder of his tunic could you get a purple heart for something like that george wouldnt lose any sleep over it and he didnt think wally would either at that the number three mount got off lucky guys were down at the next mm mount too only they werent getting up again a fragment of bomb casing had taken off one sailors head like a guillotine blade another man was gutted as neatly as a fat cod on a fishing trawler but cod didnt scream and try to put themselves back together and you couldnt gaff a sailor and put him on ice in the hold though it might have been a mercy stretcherbearers carried him below the oregon boasted not one but two real doctors not just a pharmacists mate like the josephus daniels could they do anything for a guy with his insides torn out doctors were getting smarter all the time and the fancy new drugs meant fever didnt always kill you even so george didnt get the chance to brood about it come on fodor yelled did the cpo even know he was wounded back to the gun we may get another shot at the sonsabitches suddenly though the sky seemed bare of confederate aircraft one limped off toward the north toward land trailing smoke as it went the restwerent there any more a rubber raft bobbed on the surface of the atlantic somebodyd got out of one of them anyhow the oregons main armament boomed out another thunderous broadside half a minute later the maine also sent a dozen enormous shells landward the air attack had made them miss a beat but no more jesus george said his ears ringing is that the best those sorry suckers can do sure looks like it chief fodor sounded surprised too he noticed the blood on his shoulder and did a professionalquality double take what the fuck happened here maybe a splinter nicked you or maybe you got hurt when the water knocked you down george answered i be damned fodor said i always heard about guys getting hurt without even knowing it but i figured it was bullshit then it goes and happens to me i be damned a us destroyer steamed toward the downed confederate flier somebody on the destroyers deck threw the man a line he didnt climb it after a minute or so a sailor went down into the raft with him and rigged a sling the men on deck hauled the confederate uphe must have been wounded he was probably lucky not to be strawberry jam then they lowered the line to their buddy up he swarmed agile as a monkey the big guns on both battlewagons bellowed again if that was all the confederates could do to stop themif that was all the confederacy really was coming apart at the seams p aperwork jefferson pinkard hated paperwork hed never got used to it he didnt like being a papershuffler and a penpusher he could manage it but he didnt like it working in a steel mill for all those years left him with the driving urge to go out there and do things dammit to soothe himself he kept the wireless going if he listened with half an ear to one of the houston stations playing music he didnt have to pay so much attention to all the nitpicking detail richmond wanted from him muttering he shook his head no not richmond richmond was gone lost captured jake featherston and what was left of the confederate government were somewhere down in north carolina now still screaming defiance at the damnyankees and at the world camp humble went right on reducing population trains still rolled in from louisiana and mississippi and arkansas and east texas ships brought negroes from cuba to the texas ports he aimed to go right on doing his job till somebody set over him told him to stop without warning the song he was listening to broke off an announcer came on the air we interrupt this program for a special proclamation from the governor of the great state of texas the honorable wright patman governor patman what the jeff said something had hit the fan that was for damn sure citizens of texas governor patman said a hundred years ago this state was an independent republic owing allegiance to no nation but itself we joined first the usa and then the csa but we have never forgotten our own proud tradition offreedom that was the party slogan yeah but he didnt use it the way a good party man would jeff muttered uhoh no he didnt like the way patman used it at all sure as the devil the governor of texas went on the confederate government has brought us nothing but ruin and a losing war the united states have already stolen part of our territory and revived the socalled state of houston that blighted the map after the last war they have killed our soldiers bombed our cities and ruined our trade the confederate government is powerless to stop them or even slow them down uhoh pinkard said and then for good measure aw shit since the confederate government cannot protect us it is no longer a fit government for the great people of texas governor patman said accordingly by my order the state of texas is from this day forward no longer part of the socalled confederate states of america i hereby restore the republic of texas as a free and independent nation on an equal footing with the confederate states the united states the empire of mexico and all the other free and independent nations of the world as my first act as provisional president of the republic of texas i have asked the government of the united states for an armistice they have recognized my administration jesus i fuckin bet they have jeff exclaimed what a mess and he was literally in the middle of it and agreed to a ceasefire all texas soldiers are ordered to no longer obey the socalled confederate authorities all other confederate troops within the borders of the republic of texas may hold in place and be disarmed by texas authorities or may withdraw to territory still under the rule of the socalled confederate states the united states have agreed that the forces of the republic of texas are not obliged to hinder this retreat nor will weso long as it remains peaceful and orderly us forces reserve the right to attack retreating cs forces however and neither will we interfere with them on the ground in the air or at sea at this point in time that is all as peace returns at last after the madness of the featherston administration i call on god almighty to bless the great lone star republic of texas thank you and good afternoon that was governoruh excuse me presidentwright patman of the uh republic of texas the wireless announcer sounded as flummoxed as everybody else had to be he went on president patman has brought peace to texas and what could be a more precious gift hes bugged out on the war thats what hes done the goddamn traitor son of a bitch jeff pinkard shouted as if patman and the announcer were there to hear him he remembered what mayor doggett had told him to do if the damnyankees got close take his family and get the hell out in a civilian auto and civilian clothes the advice looked a lot better now than it had then but raymond was tiny and edith still wasnt over birthing him and the telephone rang if that was edith and shed listened to the wirelesspinkard here it wasnt edith it was vern green and hed listened to the wireless fuck a duck the guard chief cried what the hell are we gonna do sir can we get outa here the damnyankeesll crucify us if they catch us theyre still way the hell over on the other side of the state jeff said uneasily all the better reason to get out now while we still can green said that asshole patman hes surrendering to them near as makes no difference therell be us soldiers all over texas fast as they can move part of jeff said vern green was flabbling over nothing there wouldnt be us soldiers all over texas no matter whatthe state was too damn big for that but there might be us soldiers here at camp humble in the next day or two the yankees wanted this place closed down and they wanted that bad hed never dreamt he would have to worry about something like this anybody who wants to disappear i wont say boo he said slowly do what you think you gotta thats all hell you may be right much obliged sir green said and hung up jeff knew what that meant he planned on bailing out how much did what he planned matter a guard knocked on jeff s door when the camp commandant let him in the man said sir theres a texas ranger captain named hezekiah carroll out there and he wants to see you pinkard didnt want to see the biblically named texas ranger what choice did he have though all right he growled bring him on in carroll was tall and weathered and toughlooking but if he was as tough as he looked why wasnt he in the army before jeff could ask him he said you will have heard of the reestablishment of the republic of texas yeah ive heard of it getting out while the gettings good are you jeff said yes carroll answered baldly you will also have heard that confederate troops may evacuate i heard that too all right jeff allowed what about it it doesnt mean you thats part of the deal governoruh presidentpatman cut with the yankees carroll said they say confederate combat soldiers are welcome to leave but you peoplethey want yall crimes against humanity they call it oh my ass pinkard exploded you gonna tell me youre sorry were taking care of our nigger troubles yeah surego ahead make me believe it captain carroll turned red all the same he said what i think hasnt got diddlysquat to do with it i know damn well this is the best deal texas can get if you and your people try to evacuate this camp we will stop you and thats the gods truth christ i never thought my own side would fuck me jeff tried to figure out what to do with all the machine guns in the guard towers he could hold off the rangers or anybody else who didnt have artillery for a long time but what good did that do him when he needed to get the hell out of here none zero zip maybe he could mount machine guns in some of the camp trucks and shoot his way past the rangers yeah it might work once but it was more than a hundred miles from humble to the louisiana border could he win a running fight not a chance in church and he knew it i am a citizen of the republic of texas and my country has an armistice with the usa carroll said i have to abide by the terms of the armistice and i will im only following orders same as you were doing here but the country that gave you orders is going down the crapper and mines just getting started only following orders that was the main defense pinkard had if he ever did get in trouble for what the camps did it sounded pretty goddamn hollow when somebody else threw it in his face listenlets do it like this he wasnt used to pleading he hadnt had to do it for a lot of years he gave it his best shot though we can keep it unofficial let us slide on out of here a few at a timehows that then nobodyll be any wiser when were gone nobodyll get in any trouble and we can get back to doing what needs doing once were somewhere thats still fighting he didnt even cuss out wright patman no matter how much he wanted to but hezekiah carroll shook his head sorry about thati am sorry about that i would if i could but i cant so i wont i dont reckon you understand how bad the damnyankees want you they told thethe president they would bomb the living shit out of austin if you got away theyre a bunch of niggerlovers thats why and youre throwing in with em jeff couldnt keep his temper down forever what we are is out of the war you think we want the damnyankees dropping one of those superbombs on dallas you think we want em to drop one on houston or austin or san antone you better think again buddy butbutchrist on his cross youre cutting the csa off from sonora and chihuahua you cant do that no huh just watch us captain carroll said white folks dont need all those greasers around anyway if francisco josй wants em back hes welcome to em far as im concerned realization smote pinkard if we were smokin their sorry asses i bet youd let us go he said carroll neither affirmed nor denied he just said things are the way they are and so you know the yankees are flying in a team to take charge of this place they ought to be landing in houston pretty soon wont be more than a couple of hours before theyre here whatever youve got to say from now on you can say to them he left the office without a salute without a nod without a backwards glance vern green burst in a moment later what are we gonna do he cried jeff told him what the texas ranger had said if you and the guards still want to try and skip i still wont say boo he finished maybe youll get away maybe youll get your ass shot off i dont know one way or the other with edith and the kids here im fuckin stuck damnyankeesll hang you green warned how can they i was doing what ferd koenig told me to do jeff said could i say no we got to treat the niggers better hed shoot me if i did sides the job needed doing you know it as well as i do sure but the yankees wont green sketched a salute i am gonna try and get away wish me luck luck jeff said not much later he heard spatters of gunfire in the near distance he had a couple of drinks at his desk two and a half hours after that a man in a greengray uniform with gold oak leaves on his shoulder straps walked in youre brigade leader pinkard he asked in us accents thats right jeff said a little surprised the yankee officer got the party title right major don little us army the other officer said and then youre under arrest a rtillery fire came down near armstrong grimes platoonnot real close but close enough to make them pucker some through the manmade thunder squidface said how come we aint in texas how come you aint a beautiful woman armstrong answered how come you aint even an ugly woman for cryin out loud if you didnt know how to handle a gun youd be fuckin useless ah youve been talkin to my old man again squidface said in mock disgust he remained stubbornly male and central alabama where the war was very much alive remained nothing like the stateor even the republicof texas where it had died instead soldiers on both sides were doing the dying here the confederates didnt have enough to keep the united states away from selma and montgomery but they didnt seem to know it yet armstrong didnt mind showing them he did mind getting killed or maimed on a bright spring day when the air smelled green and the birds sang and the bastards in butternut couldnt possibly win even if they wiped out every us soldier south of birmingham why couldnt they see the shit had hit the fan and just give up that would have suited him fine but the confederates down here were a stubborn bunch they didnt just fight backthey kept throwing in local counterattacks a little farther east one of those had driven us forces back ten or fifteen miles before it finally ran out of steam by now the enemy had lost all that ground again and more besides hed thrown away men and barrels he couldnt possibly hope to replace what the hell was the point armstrong couldnt see it some of the shells from his latest barrage sounded funny so did the bursts they made when they hit the ground oh for chrissake armstrong said almost as disgusted with the men he was facing as he had been when he fought the mormons he raised his voice gas he yelled theyre throwing gas at us why were they bothering what was it supposed to prove he put on his mask it was annoying it was inconvenient if they wanted to attack here theyd have to wear masks too and be annoyed and inconvenienced and his own sides gunners would probably give them a big lethal dose as soon as they found out this crap was going on serve em right armstrong thought sucking in air that smelled like rubber instead of spring off to the left somebodyhe thought it was herk but how could you be sure when a guy was talking through a maskshouted here they come armstrong peered in that direction through porthole lenses that needed cleaning sure as hell the confederates were pushing forward their foot soldiers backed up by a couple of assault guns and one of their fearsome new barrels somebody must have fed their co raw meat a us machine gun started chattering the masked soldiers in butternut dove for cover the barrels massive turret swung toward the machinegun nest the main armament fired once sandbags and somebodys leg flew through the air the machine gun fell silent that did the confederates less good than it would have earlier in the war armstrong had a captured automatic rifle squidface had his own gun herk was banging away with a cs submachine gun plenty of other captured weapons and usissue tommy guns gave the guys on armstrongs side a lot more firepower than they would have had even a year earlier mortar rounds started landing among the unhappy cs soldiers too armstrong whooped see how you like it you bastards he shouted its better to give than to receive then a us barrel put an ap round through an assault guns glacis plate the assault gun slewed sideways sending greasy black smoke high into the sky he whooped again that pillar of smoke marked four mens funeral pyres they werent his buddies so he didnt care a moment later the other assault gun hit a mine and stopped with a track blown off that was the signal for every us barrel in the neighborhood to open up on it it didnt last longwhat could have recognizing the minefield the enemy barrels crew also stopped a couple of rounds hit it but bounced off armstrong stopped whooping and swore ap rounds could penetrate those monstershed seen it happen but it didnt happen all the time and the metal monster started picking off us barrels one after another its big gun could penetrate any us machines frontal armor with no trouble at all still swearing armstrong wished for a stovepipe rocket like the ones jake featherstons men carried if any of those had been captured they didnt seem to be in the neighborhood too bad how come the confederates get all the good stuff first he wondered they did damn them theyd carried automatic weapons against springfields they had the screaming meemies and the stovepipe antibarrel rockets and the longrange jobs they even used the superbomb first and a whole fat lot of good it did them because there werent quite enough of them anyway not if they wanted to conquer a country that could put three times as many soldiers in the field he supposed featherstons fuckers got the fancy weapons because they really needed them the usa muddled along with ordinary stuff and eventually got the job done the local confederate attack bogged down when the big nasty barrel stopped going forward the cs infantry knew they couldnt push their foes out of the way without armor support they went to ground and dug in artillery and mortar rounds rained down on them dig as they would their holes werent so good as the ones they would have had in prepared defensive positions two fighterbombers zoomed in and ripplefired rockets from underwing racks one of those or maybe more than one hit the cs barrel the rocket got through the armor where the ap rounds hadnt the barrel started to burn somebody bailed out of the turret every us soldier around fired at the barrelman but armstrong thought he made it to cover too bad he thought whistles blew somebody who sounded like an officer yelled lets push em back boys with their armor gone they wont even slow us down then he said the magic words follow me if he was willing to put his ass on the line he could get soldiers to go with him come on armstrong called scrambling out of his own scrape in the ground lets go get em we can do it and damned if they couldnt oh some of the confederates fought there were always diehards who wouldnt quit till the last dog was hung but there werent very many not this time around some of the men in butternut drew back toward their own start line others raised their hands as us soldiers drew near dont shoot me sweet jesus buddy i dont want to die an unshaven corporal called to armstrong another confederate soldier near him also held his hands high waddaya think armstrong asked squidface we can take em down the road squidface answered bout what i figured armstrong agreed he raised his voice herk take these guys down the road you sure sarge herk asked yeahgo on go deal with em armstrong said right herk gestured with his captured weapon come on you two the confederate soldiers eagerly went with him after he led them around behind some trees the submachine gun stuttered out two short bursts he came back its taken care of he said attaboy cmon lets go armstrong told him if you told one of your men to take somebody back you really meant to make a prisoner of him if you told your guy to take him down the roadwell it was a hard old war sometimes you didnt have the manpower or the time to deal with pows and soyou didnt that was all somebody up in the middle of the fighting was on the horn to us artillery the usa didnt have screaming meemies but battery after battery of s did a hell of a job the barrage moved in front of the advancing soldiers and fell with terrible power on the line from which the confederates had jumped off they couldnt hold that line not with the men they had left after the counterattack failed they would have done better not to try to hit back at the us forces sunset found armstrong and his men several miles farther south than they had been at daybreak he camped in an empty sharecropper village hed seen a lot of those here this was supposed to be the black belt the heart of alabama negro life but the heart had been ripped out of the state or so he thought till a sentry said sarge we got niggers comin inmaybe half a dozen fuck me armstrong said that didnt happen every day well go on snakebring em in we can spare the rations for em right snake saidhe had a rearing rattler tattooed on his left forearm he came back a few minutes later with two skinny black men an even skinnier woman and three kids who were nothing but skin and bonesand in the firelight eyeballs and teeth the soldiers gave them food which got their immediate undivided attention after the negroes had eaten enough to blunt the edge of their hunger armstrong asked howd you people stay alive we hid we stole one of the men answered his accent was so thick armstrong could hardly follow him now we is free again the woman said now we kin live again long as theys sojers here long as theys yankees here the second man said reckon the white folks hered get rid of us pretty damn quick if they seen a chance armstrong reckoned the negro was right not many white confederates seemed unhappy about what had happened to the blacks whod lived alongside them the only thing the whites were unhappy about was losing the war what is we gonna do the first man asked as if a kid sergeant from washington dc had answers for him hang around with soldiers as much as you can we wont screw you armstrong said although he knew some of the guys in the platoon liked negroes no better than most confederates did and some of the guys would want to screw the woman yeah she was skinny as a strand of spaghetti yeah she was homely yeah she might have vd if she stayed around very long somebody would make a pass at her and trouble would follow sure as night followed day they can hang around with soldiers armstrong decided but they wont hang around with my platoon ill send em to the rear let somebody else worry about em he nodded to himself that definitely sounded like a plan and when he put it to the negroes they didnt squawk a bit rear sounds mighty good the first man said we done seen us enough fightin to las us fo always all the other blacks solemnly nodded come to that armstrong had seen enough fighting to last him for always too maybe he thought hopefully i wont have to see much more t here was a poem about the way the world ended jorge rodriguez hadnt had as much schooling as his folks wished he would have when you grew up on a farm in sonora you didnt get a whole lot of schooling but he remembered that poemsomething about not with a bang but a whimper he knew why it came to mind now too he was thinking that the fellow whod written that poem didnt know what the hell he was talking about buckingham virginia wasnt a whole lot more than a wide spot in the road it didnt even have a gas station though it did boast a couple of hotels that dated back to before the war of secession it lay west and a little south of richmond and jorges outfit had orders to hold it in spite of everything the damnyankees could do the indomitable hugo blackledge had charge of the companyall the new officers were either casualties or missing in action jorge led one platoon gabe medwick another blackledge looked around at buckingham well dig in he said well fight as long as we can and then well pull back and fight somewhere else this chickenshit hole in the ground aint worth dyin for and thats the gods truth thats not what the high command told us medwick sounded worried they aint gonna kill us for moving back after we fight jorge assured him theyre too fucked up for that but i think the sergeant hes right we make a big stand here the damnyankees blow us up for sure his wave encompassed the country town and for what amigo for what gabe had no answer for that nobody whod done any fighting would have buckingham would have fallen a while ago if the main yankee thrust from richmond hadnt gone southeast through petersburg toward hampton roads but the united states had enough men to push west tooand the confederacy by all the signs didnt have enough men to stop them still if you werent going to surrender you had to try somebodys rearguard action up ahead gave the company a couple of hours to entrench and to eat whatever rations and foraged food they happened to have on them a command car towing an antiaircraft gun came through town sergeant blackledge flagged it down got any armorpiercing rounds he asked a few one of the gunners answered good blackledge said stay here youll have a better chance to use em than you would have wherever the hell you were going he didnt quite aim his automatic rifle at the command car but he looked ready to jorge was one of the men who stood ready to back his play the gunner didnt need long to figure out what was what you talked us into it he said after a barely perceptible pause show us where to set up he and his crew had just positioned the gun when us s started landing on buckingham the first few fell short but the rest came down right in the middle of town huddling in a foxhole jorge knew what that meant the yankees had a forward artillery observer hidden in the trees somewhere and he was wirelessing the fall of the shot back to the batteries that were firing killing him would have been nice but who could guess where he lurked fighterbombers worked buckingham over next they dropped bombs they fired rockets and they dropped fishshaped pods of jellied gasoline as if the town were under attack by flamethrowers from the sky some burned men screamed some jorge feared never got the chance one of the fine hotels from before the days of the war of secession went up in flames it had lasted for a century but no longer after the damnyankees softened up the town infantry and armor came forward why do things the hard way when you could take it easy that was what the us officer in charge must have thought anyhow but nothing turned out to be easy for the men in greengray that antiaircraft gun knocked out two barrels in quick succession the others pulled back in a hurry machinegun and automaticweapons fire sent us foot soldiers diving for cover the confederates in buckingham raised a defiant cheer if theyd had barrels of their own if theyd had air support if theyd had more groundpounders they could have driven the enemy back toward the james if theyd had all those things here they also would have had them lots of other places the war would have looked very different since they didnt have any reinforcements they had to wait for the us forces to regroup and take another crack at buckingham pull back into the woods south of town sergeant blackledge called well let them beat on the place while its empty then move back into our old holes and give em a surprise smoke from the burning buildings in buckingham helped screen the withdrawal from yankee observers and blackledge knew just what was coming more shells more bombs more rockets and more napalm descended on buckingham jorge crossed himself he was glad to crouch half a mile away from all that destruction as soon as the last fighterbombers roared off to the north sergeant blackledge yelled cmon hustle up we gotta get back to our places before the enemy infantry starts moving up trotting forward jorge saw that the antiaircraft gun wouldnt stop any barrels this time around it lay upside down the tires on the gun carriage all burnt and melted and stinking how many stovepipes did the company have he swore under his breath the cannon could kill from much farther away than one of those rockets at least no jellied gasoline smoldered in his foxhole he slid down into it and waited for the push that was bound to come he felt more resigned than afraid he wondered why probably because hed been in lots of other bad spots what was one more my grave it could be not far away gabe medwick was praying his version of the lords prayer had words a little different from jorges protestant the sonoran thought condescendingly but both versions meant the same thing so how much did the words really matter hang in there boys hugo blackledge said we been screwin so long with a limber dick why the fuck cant we row the damn boat with a rope in spite of himself jorge laughed sometimes obscenity wasnt so far from prayer here came the damnyankees again they were more cautious this timethey didnt want another bloody nose the confederates in buckingham held their fire till the enemy soldiers and fighting vehicles got very close then they all opened up at once howls of dismay from the us soldiers said theyd hoped it would be easy this time no matter what they hoped it wasnt a lancehead riding a shaft of fire a stovepipe rocket incinerated a greengray barrel but other us machines sensibly stayed out of stovepipe range they raked buckingham with highexplosive rounds and machinegun bullets that let yankee infantry grab a toehold on the north side of townnot enough confederates could put their heads up to stop the enemy and the yankees pushed forward to either side of buckingham too there werent enough men in butternut to hold them back hey sarge jorge called urgently we done what we could do here sн bet your ass blackledge raised his voice to a formidable roar back back goddammit well make another stand at the next town south wherever the fuck it is disengaging under fire wasnt easy either a less experienced outfit might not have been able to bring it off so neatly but jorge had plenty of practice making a getaway from overwhelming us strength so did his buddies they left the wounded behind for the yankees to take care of that gave the hurt soldiers a better chance than they would have had if they got dragged along the men in greengray mostly fought fair the ground rose south of buckingham no roads led south only tracks and game trails the soldiers trudged past a couple of farms carved out of the forest a woman in homespun stared at them from a cornfield was that a pipe in her mouth damned if it wasnt jorge hoped the yankees wouldnt shell her farm trying to kill the retreating cs soldiers on he went armor wouldnt have an easy time coming after him anyhow artillery started probing for the confederates suddenly jorge hated the trees air bursts were deadly and the only thing you could do to protect yourself was dig in with a roof over your head any hanging branch might touch off a shell and rain fragments down on you a hundred yards away from him gabe medwick fell with a wail clutching his arm no jorge yelled and rushed over to his friend when he got there he saw gabe had a leg wound too with the best will in the world the kid from alabama couldnt go on hurts gabe got out through clenched teeth i bet it does jorge clumsily injected him with morphine then bandaged the wounds the leg wasnt too bad the armjorge hoped gabe would keep it but it looked pretty chewed up the yankees they take care of you jorge said feeling helpless dont want nothin to do with no damnyankees gabe sounded like a petulant child here jorge gave him his canteen and some rations you sit tight and yell for them when they get close buena suerte amigo he hurried away not knowing what else to say before long jorge got to pick up a canteen from a man an air burst had shredded there were worse things than getting wounded the flies were just starting to gather on one of those things jorge stumbled up to the top of the line of hills and then down the other side the company what was left of it was hopelessly scattered through a break in the trees jorge caught a glimpse of a town down below that place is where were going hugo blackledge yelled well form up there and figure out what the hell to do next what could they do jorge had no idea but he had a target now somewhere to go as he picked his way through thicker stands of timber the town disappeared but he could always find it again it looked bigger than buckingham not that that was saying much when he drew closer he got a glimpse of armor in the town hed wondered when he would see more of it hell hed wondered if the confederates had any armor left in central virginia there were already soldiers in the streets too maybe the csa could throw one more rally together even after you thought your side had done everything it could it kept surprising you the first few men from the company jorge among them had come out onto open ground within a quarter of a mile of the town when sergeant blackledge let out a theatrical wail of despair theyre yankees and they were they even had some sort of portable pa system surrender somebody blared surrender or die first last and only warning there is no escape there wasnt either the barrels and the automatic weapons ahead could tear the dismayed confederates to pieces theyd lost their last race with the enemy blackledge set down his automatic rifle and walked into captivity with his hands and his head high if he can do it so can i jorge thought he laid his weapon on the ground and walked toward the waiting us soldiers one of them pointed into the town line up by the courthouse he said not unkindly some trucksll take you off to prison camp all right jorge pointed back the way hed come we left wounded in the woods my buddys there well get emdont flabble about it you move along now dully jorge obeyed the men with whom hed endured so much tramped through the lateafternoon stillness in the little town of appomattoxa sign on the courthouse gave him the name of the placetoward the end of the war t hings were quiet outside of birmingham and inside too cincinnatus driver approved of that after all the shells that had flown back and forth a truce was holding now a us officer had gone into birmingham to confer with cs general patton none of the drivers of course knew what the us officer would tell the surrounded general that didnt stop them from guessing if he dont quit i bet we drop a superbomb on him cincinnatus said sounds good to me hal williamson said several other men nodded williamson went on all the trouble pattons caused we ought to drop a bomb on the fucker anyway more nods cincinnatus among them i wonder when hell come out the negro said the officer a major had gone in not far from their encampment if he came out the same way maybe he would tell them what was what you could hope so anyway how long dyou think hell give patton somebody asked i wouldnt give him long williamson said if its surrender or get one of those bombs in the kisser what does he need to figure out cincinnatus lit a cigarette not even tobacco smoke soothed him much he wanted to know what was going on there inside the battered heart of the confederate industrial town so did the other drivers that pattons a stubborn bastard one of them said what if he doesnt give in his funeral in that case cincinnatus said and then couldnt happen to a nicer fella well it could happen to jake featherston but i reckon thats comin too williamson pointed into the ruin that was birmingham here comes our guy he said and look hes got one of those butternut bastards with him sure enough two men came out of the city each of them carrying a large flag of truce the cs officer looked clean and neat despite the disaster that had befallen the place he was defending he also looked as unhappy as if he were burying his only son that told cincinnatus most of what he needed to know they givin up suh he called to the us officer the rising lilt in his voice saying he already had a good notion of the answer all the drivers burst into cheers when the major nodded they sure are he answered or it looks that way anyhow weve still got a few little things to iron outthats why captain monroe is with me the confederate started to give the men standing near the big greengray trucks a polite nod then he saw cincinnatus among them you have those damned black terrorists here he demanded of the officer in greengray i aint a guerrilla cincinnatus spoke for himself i dont blame those folks for risin updont get me wrongbut i aint one of them im a citizen of the usa and proud of it too thats telling him hal williamson said captain monroe looked even more mournful than he had before the us major whose name cincinnatus still didnt know grinned from ear to ear you asked captain he said now you know its still wrong monroe said stubbornly niggers got no business fighting you call me nigger again you ofay asshole you aint gonna last to dicker your goddamn surrender cincinnatus said captain monroes jaw dropped all the way to his chest he couldnt have been more astonished if an army mule had cussed him out somebody doesnt seem to agree with you the us major observed and since hes here maybe hes got a point you know monroe shook his head cincinnatus hadnt expected anything different speaking of army muleswhen it came to the confederates views of negroes they could have given the beasts mulishness lessons as the two officers went back to confer with us higherups hal williamson thumped cincinnatus on the back that butternut bastard cant make nasty cracks about you he better not cincinnatus said the guys who can talk are the guys who end up winnin you lose you got to listen to the fellas on the other side doin the braggin thats us two drivers said it at the same time cincinnatus nodded after that with the ceasefire holding the drivers had nothing to do but sit around and smoke and eat and play cards cincinnatus didnt mind not even a little nothing could go wrong while he was in the middle of a big us army nobody was likely to shoot at him from ambush his truck wouldnt hit a mine and explode in flames and they gave him the same combat bonus for this as they did for driving through bushwhacker country three hours later the us major and cs captain monroe returned both of them with their white flags the officer in greengray was all smiles while monroe his shoulders slumped his head bowed showed nothing but gloom its all over the us major said theyll come out one more nail in the coffin and a big one too did you have to say that monroe barked im sorry captain but will you tell me its not the truth the major asked the confederate officer didnt answer which in itself told everything that needed telling the major nodded to the group of truck drivers we gave them one thing patton gets to address his men after they lay down their arms why not cincinnatus said talk is cheap his pals laughed the us major didnt but mostly cincinnatus judged to keep from offending his cs counterpart as for captain monroe his glare said cincinnatus belonged in a camp even if he was a us citizen cincinnatus scowled back remembering how close hed come to ending up in one how many other negroes from covingtons barbedwireenclosed colored district were still alive any he just didnt know the two officers went back into birmingham cincinnatus listened to shouts some of them amplified inside the city spreading the word he judged after another hour or so confederate soldiers started coming out they werent carrying weapons and they held their hands above their heads a few had bits of white rag tied to sticks they were skinny and their uniforms had seen a lot of wear but like captain monroe they all looked surprisingly well bathed and well groomed patton was supposed to be a stickler for stuff like that they werent shy about scrounging ration tins from anybody in greengray they saw thanks pal one of them said when cincinnatus tossed him a can then the man did a double take at his dark skin he looked at the can yeah thanks he repeated and went on wow hal williamson said this place made half the shit they threw at us seems like and now its out of business he mimed swiping the back of his hand over his forehead in relief so where do we drop the superbomb we were gonna put here another driver asked new orleans gotta be new orleans the answer came to cincinnatus as soon as he heard the question satchmo wont like it but too bad for him no offense cincinnatus but i dont much care for the music he plays hal said cincinnatus shrugged well i can see that cause it aint what youre used to me i grew up in the csa so it sounds right to me and hes damn good at what he does whether you like it or not so is jake featherston williamson said which was true but not exactly a compliment cincinnatus thought about rising to it and arguing for real but why when a whole confederate army was surrendering what point to a dumb little quarrel more and more soldiers in butternut and freedom party guards in camouflage uniforms trudged out of birmingham the party guards looked even sorrier about giving up than the army men did had they seen any chance to fight on they would have grabbed it but they didnteven they knew the jig was up hall nudged cincinnatus look thats patton that has to be patton sure does cincinnatus said nobody else would have worn a chromed helmet with wreathed stars picked out in gold nobody else would have worn not one but two fancy sixshooters either pattons look of loathing made everything from the other soldiers and the freedom party guards seem downright benign by comparison patton already had us soldiers walking along watching him as if he were a lion in a zooa dangerous beast that couldnt hurt anybody any more cincinnatus and the rest of the drivers fell in with them the confederate soldiersnow the confederate powsstood in rough ranks in a battered cratered field us troops many armed with captured automatic weapons guarded them more us soldiers rubbernecked like cincinnatus engineers had set up a microphone in front of the prisoners the us commander was a longfaced bald brigadier general named ironhewer he waited by the mike for pattons approach patton saluted him with immense dignity general ironhewer returned the military courtesy patton took off his pistols and handed them still holstered to ironhewer this time the us general saluted him first he gave the ceremonial weapons to an aide then went up to the microphone men of the army of kentucky he said in midwestern accents general patton has asked leave to speak to you one last time as this battle ends as peace between our two countries draws near i did not see how i could refuse him this privilege he nodded to the cs commander general patton ironhewer stepped away from the microphone and patton took his place thank you general for the courtesy you have shown me and the kindness you are showing my men he said his voice thick with unshed tears he needed a moment to gather himself before continuing soldiers by an agreement between general ironhewer and me the troops of the army of kentucky have surrendered that we are beaten is a selfevident fact and we cannot hope to resist the bomb that hangs over our head like the sword of damocles richmond is fallen the cause for which you have so long and manfully struggled and for which you have braved dangers and made so many sacrifices is today hopeless reason dictates and humanity demands that no more blood be shed here it is your sad duty and mine to lay down our arms and to aid in restoring peace as your commander i sincerely hope that every officer and soldier will carry out in good faith all the terms of the surrender war such as you have passed through naturally engenders feelings of animosity hatred and revenge but in captivity and when you return home a manly straightforward course of conduct will secure the respect even of your enemies patton paused he brushed a hand to his eyes then went on in bidding you farewell rest assured that you carry with you my best wishes for your future welfare and happiness i have never sent you where i was unwilling to go myself nor would i now advise you to a course i felt myself unwilling to pursue you have been good soldiers preserve your honor and the government to which you have surrendered can afford to be and i hope will be magnanimous still very erect he saluted his men some of them cried out his name others let loose with what they still called the rebel yell tears now streaming down his face patton waited for the tumult to die down a little then he stepped into the ragged ranks of the rest of the pows defeated confederate soldiers shook his hand and embraced him cincinnatus watched them with a little sympathybut not much we done licked em here he said to hal williamson now we got to finish it everywhere else xii d id taking your own airplanes with you mean a flotilla could operate close to enemyheld land it hadnt at the start of the war as sam carsten remembered too well landbased cs airplanes badly damaged the remembrance when her bombers struck at charleston well all kinds of things had changed since then charleston was no moreone bomb from a landbased airplane had seen to that and the fleet approaching haiti had not one airplane carrier but half a dozen only one of those was a fleet carrier newer and faster and able to carry more airplanes than the remembrance had the others were smaller and three of them slower still together they carried close to three hundred airplanes if that thought wasnt enough to give the confederate defenders on the western part of the island of hispaniola nightmares sam didnt know what would be he had a few nightmares of his own the confederates still had airplanes on haiti in the bahamas and in cuba they had submersibles and torpedo boats they had a sizable garrison to hold haiti down and to keep the usa from using the negro nation as a base against them in the caribbean they had sir they have troubles lots of them lon menefee said when sam flabbled out loud all those colored folks on these islands hate jake featherston like rat poison why cuba i know about cuba sam broke in the josephus daniels ran guns in there a couple of years ago to give the rebels a hand well there you go then the new exec damn near dripped confidence besides they may have airplanes but have they got fuel weve been pounding their dumps and hitting the shipping from the mainland we can do this i honest to god think we can sir hey heres hoping youre right carsten said it wasnt just that menefee was a kid because he was plenty old enough to have served through the whole war but he wasnt the old man the josephus daniels was sams responsibility if anything went wrong the blame landed squarely on him command made you the loneliest most worried man in the worldor at least on your ship the poor son of a bitch in charge of the destroyer half a mile away knew what you were going through though so did the sub skipper who was trying to send you to the bottom bombers and covering fighters roared off the carriers flight decks squadron after squadron buzzed off toward the southwest toward caphaпtien and portauprince more fighters flew combat air patrol above the fleet battleships guns roared the battlewagons didnt rule the fleet the way they had when sam enlisted back before the great war started but their big guns still reached far enough and packed enough punch to make them great for shore bombardment sams gaze went forward to one of the josephus daniels pair of fourinch guns his smile was fond but wry that gun could shoot at enemy aircraft from longer range than the twin mms that had sprouted like mushrooms everywhere there was free space on the deck for shore bombardmentwell youd better be hitting some place where the bad guys couldnt hit back slow squat ungainly landing craft surged forward the troops on them were going to take haiti away from the confederate states if everything went right they were anyhow if the operation went south every skipper in the fleet and every brass hat up to and including the secretary of the navy would testify under oath before the joint committee on the conduct of the war anything sam asked thad walters the yranging officer shook his head ive got our aircraft on the screen sir but im not picking up any bandits ill be damned sam glanced over to lon menefee maybe youre right maybe the butternut bastards are further gone than i thought sure hope so menefee said tell you one thing when the marines and the army guys go ashore their venereal rates gonna climb like one of those fighters lots of infected people in haiti and the gals therell be mighty glad to see em well with the spiffy new pills and shots weve got its not as bad as it used to be still not good sam added hastilyyou couldnt sound complacent about vd the idea of lying down with a colored woman didnt drive him wild but if you were a horny kid and there were no white gals for three islands around youd take whatever you could get he remembered some of his own visits to brothels full of chinese girls in honolulu during the last war a yeoman came up onto the bridge carriers report airplanes heading our way from cuba sir thanks van duyk sam said carriers had stronger yranging sets than his ship did the men already stood at battle stations sam passed the word that the enemy was on the way after he stepped back from the pa microphone lon menefee said well were not first on their list anyhow he was bound to be right about that the confederates would want to hit airplane carriers and battlewagons and he supposed landing craft before they bothered with a lowly destroyer escort all the same sam said if we end up on their plate they wont send us back to the kitchen and we dont want to get loose and sloppy either youve got that straight sir menefee said at once thats what she said sam answered and the exec snorted overhead some of the fighters from the cap streaked off toward the west was that a good idea if more enemy aircraft came at the fleet from another direction from the bahamas or from haiti itself they might catch the ships with their pants down these days battles mostly happened out of sight of one sides fleet or the others this one might start out of sight of both and that record would be hard to top unless one of these days you got a fight something like the battle of the three navies back in great war days i have bandits on the screen sir lieutenant walters reported bearing approachingwell pretty fast looks like theyre about ten minutes out our boys are on em thanks thad sam said and passed the word to the crew then he asked any sign of bandits from some different direction walters checked his screens before answering no sir sam grunted that sounded more like what hed hoped than what hed expected echoing his thoughts lon menefee said the confederates really must be at the end of their tether well maybe they are who woulda thunk it sam called down a speaking tube to the hydrophone station in the bowels of the ship hear anything bevacqua not a thing sir the cpo replied nothin but our screw and the ones from the rest of the fleet jack diddly from the pings when i send em out all right thanks sing out if you do remember better believe it sir bevacqua said its my ass too you know hearing that float out of the speaking tube menefee raised an eyebrow it didnt faze sam a bit is he wrong he asked the exec shook his head another destroyer escort off to the west started firing a moment later so did the josephus daniels theyre going after the carriers sam said watching the confederate airplanes wouldnt you menefee asked maybe but if i could tear up the landing craft i might want to do that first this is about haiti after all sam said if it was about the island any more for all he knew it might have been about hurting the united states as much as the confederacy could and nothing more than that on such a scale carriers were likely to count more than landing boats but not many cs airplanes came overhead sam didnt know how many had set out from cuba but he would have bet a lot of them never made it this far the cap was doing its job the yeoman hurried back up to the bridge our men are ashore sir he said sam sent the news out over the loudspeakers the crew cheered and whooped van duyk didnt go away theres more news sir he added in quieter tones whats up apprehension gusted along sams spine hamburgs gone sir van duyk answered one of those bombs jesus sam said churchill hadnt been kidding then england had caught up with the germans or at least come close enough to wreck a city what does the kaiser say nothing yet sir van duyk said but i sure wouldnt want to be living in london right now me neither sam agreed or anywhere else a german bomber could get to or a british bomberdid the limeys have aircraft that could lug what had to be a heavy bomb across the atlantic to new york city did they have bombers that could fly across the atlantic almost empty and pick up their superbombs in the csa that would be easierif the confederates had any new superbombs to pick up all kinds of unpleasant possibilities and he couldnt do a goddamn thing about any of them all he could do was clap his hands when the forward fourinch gun turned a cs bomber into a smear of smoke and flame in the sky abruptly it was over at least around the josephus daniels he couldnt spot any more confederate airplanes above the ship the gunners went on shooting awhile longer they didnt believe in taking chances boy lon menefee said i hope the guys going ashore have as easy a time as we did yeah me too sam said you wouldve thought the confederates could throw more at us a year ago they could have the exec said two years ago they were throwing the goddamn kitchen sink carsten nodded for the first year of the war things had looked mighty black pittsburgh said the csa wouldnt be able to conquer the usa till then even that was up in the air if the confederates had taken it and gone on toward philadelphiabut they hadnt they couldnt and afterwards it became clear theyd thrown too much into that attack and didnt have enough left to defend with that was afterwards though at the time no one had any idea whether they would fall short what looked inevitable after the fact often seemed anything but while shells were flying and people were dying by how much did the confederates fall short in pittsburgh sam didnt know and he wasnt sure anyone else did all the same he would have bet the answer was on the order of only a little bit lon menefees thoughts ran in a different direction wonder how many smokes our guysll find alive on haiti hadnt worried about that sam bared his teeth in what was anything but a smile they wouldve had gunsthey were a country before the butternut bastards jumped on em i hope they gave featherstons fuckers a good big dose of trouble no he didnt particularly love negroes but he didnt want to see them dead eitherespecially if they were making the confederates sweat c assius hadnt thought patrolling madison georgia and keeping white folks in line could get dull but it did anything you did over and over got dull well he didnt suppose screwing would but he hadnt done enough of that to count as over and over a few hasty grapples with women whod been part of gracchus band at one time or another were the sum of his experience he knew just enough to know he wanted to know more and he knew enough to be worried about whether hed ever get the chance for it one muggy evening at supper he asked gracchus where we gonna find us some nice gals to marry the guerrilla chief looked down at his mess kit as if hoping one would turn up there but he had the same roasted pork ribs and sweet potatoes and green beans as cassiusonly those and nothing more beats me beats the shit outa me he said heavily most of the niggers left alive down here is the ones in the bands aint a hell of a lot of gals who wanted to pick up a tredegar dont i know it sometimes i gets so horny cant hardly stand it cassius said plenty of white women left with no husbands on account of the war good fuckin luck good fuckin luck gracchus said yeah plenty o white widows an you know what else theys sorry their husbands is dead an theys even sorrier we aint cassius wished he thought the older man were wrong unfortunately he didnt a shortage of black women and a shortage of white men should have had an obvious solution before the war during the war saying that where any white could hear him would have got him a oneway ticket to the graveyard would things be any different once the csa finally threw in the sponge fat chance he thought be a few gals dont care what color man they got long as they got one gracchus predicted a fewthe ones who git horny the same way a guy does but even supposin you find one where you gonna set up housekeepin wid her any place you try how long fore the neighbors burn your house down likely with the both of you in it the yankees cassius began gracchus shook his head yankees cant be everywhere sides most of em dont want us messin wid no white women neither they kin use us yeah but they aint gonna stick their necks out fo us when they dont got to and you kin bet your ass on dat hell you mess wid a white woman you is bettin your sorry ass on dat shit cassius said again not because he thought gracchus was wrong but because he didnt maybe we go up to the usa then got to be some colored gals there whod give us the time o day might not be too bad if the yankees let us gracchus allowed but we aint us citizens any moren wes confederate citizens we dont belong nowhere you dont believe me go ask a white man once more he made more sense than cassius wished he did every time you tried to get around what jake featherston and the freedom party had done to negroes in the confederate states you banged your head into a stone wall instead the next morning a couple of confederate privates and a corporal came up to cassius as he was on patrol none of them was carrying a weapon when they saw him they all raised their hands and stood very still dont shoot pal the corporal said were just lookin for somebody to surrender to thats all reckon youre it had they worn the camouflage of the freedom party guards cassius would have been tempted to plug them no matter how they tried to sweettalk him who could guess what guards were doing when they werent fighting the yankees cassius could for one maybe they were closing negroes up behind barbed wire or maybe they were shoving them into the hellbound trains from which nobody came back it wasnt by accident that freedom party guards had a tough time giving themselves up to the us armys new black auxiliaries but these three were just in ordinary butternut if theyd gone out of the way to give negroes a hard time it didnt show and the noncom hadnt been dumb enough to call cassius boy he gestured with his rifle yall come with me pow camps right outside of town you dont give nobody trouble youll be all right had enough trouble the corporal said and both privates nodded the twostriper went on me i got a purple heart and two oakleaf clusters one more wound and im a goddamn colander enough is enough damnyankees wouldnt be here in the middle of georgia if we werent licked damn right if the yankees werent here cassius probably wouldnt have been either sooner or later the militias and the mexicans would have squashed gracchus band get movin keep your hands high and dont git close enough to make me jumpy or you be mighty sorry you got the piece the corporal said you call the shots as they tramped through madison the other two soldiers opened up a little one was from mississippi the other from arkansas theyd had enough of the war they were heading home cassius thought they were nuts to try to get through two states full of us soldiers but they werent the first men to tell him a story like that as confederate armies came apart at the seams as men thought of themselves ahead of their country once more the whole thrashing corpse of the csa seemed full of people in uniform on the move some were trying to get somewhere like these others were trying to get away either from confederates who didnt want them deserting or from us soldiers who had reason to want to catch them never reckoned wed get whupped the corporal said mournfully first time i got shot was in ohio second time was in pennsylvania third time was in tennessee just outside of chattanooga things werent going so good by then i suppose i can see how youd say that cassius allowed but if you was a colored fella here in georgia things never went good aint many of us left alive we were up at the front fighting the damnyankees we didnt know nothin about none o that the private from arkansas said quickly too quickly cassius wasnt sure he did know the us guards at the pow camp questioned new prisoners about what theyd done before they got caught every so often they arrested somebody and took him away for more grilling nabbed yourself some more of these sorry sacks of shit did you a us sergeant in madison called to cassius and gave him a thumbsup cassius waved back hes got no cause to call us that the cs corporal said i wouldnt call him that if i went and captured himand i got me a few damnyankees during the war the private from mississippi nodded you didnt cuss us when you caught us he said to cassius your mama mustve learned you manners she did cassius eyes suddenly stung and then you goddamn ofays went an shipped her to a camp an my pa an my sis too an i reckon theys all dead now none of the confederate soldiers said much after that which was smart of them and yet the mississippian had a point of sorts cassius hadnt cursed the confederates when they gave themselves up to them some of that was because swear words werent enough to let him tell them what he thought of them but some of it was because confederate whites and confederate blacks understood one another in ways us whites never would they might not like one anotherhell they might and often did hate one another but they and their ancestors had mostly lived side by side for hundreds of years each knew how the other ticked score three for the good guys a guard outside the pow compound called as cassius brought the captives up to the entrance i leave these fellas with you cassius asked yeah ill take care of em from here on out the guard replied he carried a submachine gun a heavy us thompson it would do the job if it had to cmon you lugs he told the confederates this is the end of the line for you i dont mind the corporal said like i told this fella herehe nodded toward cassiusi already been shot three different times im still here im still walkin one more maybe my luck woulda run out damn wars over with one of the privates added we lost aint much point to fighting any more you guys arent so dumb the us soldier said kick you in the teeth often enough and you get the idea he led them off into captivity they didnt seem the least bit sorry to go theyd managed to give up without getting killed and the chow inside the barbed wire was bound to be better than what theyd scrounged on their own how much food the yankees took for granted had already astonished cassius the men in butternut were scrawny enough to make him sure it would amaze them too cassius went back on patrol unlike the pows he had to earn his victuals and damned if another pair of confederate soldiers didnt come into madison an hour and a half later theyd also made sure they werent carrying weapons before they showed themselves seeing cassiusand seeing his riflethey wasted no time raising their hands we aint people bombs or nothin rastus one of them said cross my heart we aint he lowered his right hand for a moment to make the gesture my name aint rastus cassius retorted but again as long as they didnt wear camouflage or call him nigger or boy he was willing if not precisely eager to let them give up the same soldier in greengray still stood at the entrance to the pow camp when cassius brought in his next set of captives son of a bitch the yankee said youre turning into a oneman gang they know theys licked cassius said dont bother em to give up now like maybe it did befo thats about the size of it one of the confederates agreed whats the point to gettin shot now sure aint gonna change how things turn out you got that right anyway the us soldier said well come on well get you your rooms at our hotel all right you can have the caviar or the pheasant under glass the barmaidll be along with the champagne in a few minutes but it costs extra if you want her to blow you both men in butternut stared so did cassius the yankees deadpan delivery was mighty convincing then the confederates started to laugh one of them said long as i dont get blown up thats all i care about right now amen said the other new pow as if responding to a preacher in church on that kind of simple level cassius had no trouble understanding and sympathizing with them when he tried to fathom their cause thoughif they had their way id be dead same as the rest of my family how can they want that so bad i never done nothin to them they didnt care they feared negroes might do something to them and so they got in the first lick that was jake featherston all the wayhit first and hit hard but he hadnt hit the united states quite hard enough he got in the first lick but they were getting the last one and im still here too cassius thought you may not like it you ofay asshole but i damn well am s itting in the humble jail was a humbling experience for jeff pinkard even if the republic of texas had seceded from the confederate states the guards at the jail were all us military policemen they wore greengray uniforms white gloves and white helmets with mp on them in big letters they reminded him of a lot of the men whod guarded camp humble and the other camps hed run they were tough and brave and not especially smart they wouldnt let his wife or stepsons in to see him they wouldnt let him see his new baby all he had for company was vern green the guard chief moped in the cell across the hall three hulking us mps came for jeff early in the morning they all carried big heavy us submachine guns come on pinkard one of thema sergeantsaid his voice cold as russian alaska jeff thought they were going to take him outside and shoot him who was there to stop them not a soul he fought to keep a wobble out of his voice when he said i want to talk to a lawyer yeah so did all the coons you smoked come on asshole the mp said one of his buddies unlocked the cell door jeff came fear made his legs light all he could do was try not to show it if you were going to die anyway you wanted to die as well as you could he squinted against the sun when they led him out of the jail he hadnt seen so much sunshine since they locked him up looking back at the jail building he saw the us and texas flags flying side by side above it his mouth tightened both those flags reminded him of the stars and bars both now were arrayed against it barbed wire and machinegun nests and armored cars defended the jail and the buildings close to it seeing jeff glance at the new fortifications the mp sergeant said nobodys gonna spring you from this place so dont get your hopes up way youve got it set up you must reckon an awful lot of folks want to jeff replied the noncom scowled at him but didnt answer jeff smiled to himselfthat shot must have got home what had been a bail bondsmans office down the street from the jail now had us soldiers standing guard in front of it the lone star flag might fly over the jail but pinkard didnt see any texas rangers the damnyankees were running this show he didnt think that was good news for him one of the guards opened the door go on in the mp sergeant said what happens when i do jeff asked suspiciously the bogeyman gets you the mp snapped when jeff neither panicked nor asked for any more explanation the yankee gestured impatiently just go on you wanted a lawyer theyre gonna give you one more than you deserve if anybody wants to know what i think pinkard didnt give a rats ass for what the mp thought a lawyer was more than hed thought he would get from the us authorities of course having one and having one whod do any good were two different critters he was playing by yankee rules now and he knew damn well theyd be stacked against him in he went before the snooty sergeant could tell him again sitting at what had been the bondsmans desk was a skinny fellow with curly red hair a big nose and a us majors gold oak leaves youre jefferson pinkard the man asked thats right jeff nodded whore you my name is isidore goldstein the major answered i figured he was a hebe jeff thought well chances are hes smart anyway goldstein went on im part of the judgeadvocates staff im an attorney specializing in military law i will defend you to the best of my ability and how good are you pinkard asked damn good matter of fact goldstein said lets get something straight right now i didnt want this job they gave it to me well thats how it goes sometimes i dont like you noi despise you if youve done one percent of what they say youve done id stand in the firing squad and aim at your chest and we both know youve done a hell of a lot more than that if youre my lawyer why do they need some other asshole to prosecute me jeff said he surprised a laugh out of goldstein the yankee lawyerthe yankee jew lawyer almost a stock figure in confederate movies about the depravities of life in the usasaid but you gotta understand something else too my job is defending people guilty people need lawyers guilty people especially need lawyers whatever they let me do ill do if i can get you off the hook i will if i can keep em from killing you i will thats what im supposed to do and ill damn well do it and like i say i know what im doing too pinkard believed him not least because goldstein plainly didnt care whether he believed him or not so what are my chances then shitty goldstein answered matteroffactly theyve got the goods on you they know what you did they can prove it you get rid of that many people its not like you can keep it a secret everything i was doing i was doing cause i got orders from richmond to take care of it jeff said far as the laws of my country went it was all legal as could be so what business of your country is it what i was doing inside of mine well thats one of the arguments i aim to use isidore goldstein said youre not so dumb after all are you hope not jeff said how come you reckoned i was one way to do what you did is just do it and never think about it at all the us attorney said i figured you might be like that where youd go yeah sure and take care of things like but youve got too many brains for thati can tell so why did you do it cause the niggers were screwing my country honest to god they were first time i went to combat in it wasnt against you yankees oh hell no i was fightin the damn coons in georgia after they rose up and stabbed us in the back goldstein pulled a notebook out of his left breast pocket and wrote something in it maybe that will help some i dont know but maybe he said the charge though is crimes against humanity and that can mean whatever the people who make it want it to mean sounds chickenshit to me jeff said they gonna make believe the niggers werent up in arms against our government long before we went to war with the usa they can do thati sure cant stop embut theyre a pack of goddamn liars if they do the military attorney did some more scrawling maybe you want to forget the word nigger how come pinkard asked genuinely confused because you hammer another nail into your coffin every time you say it goldstein answered in the united states its an insult a fighting word the idea that negroes could fight whites without having the whole country land on them with both feet deeply offended jeff he was shrewd enough to see saying so wouldnt do him any good he just nodded instead so did isidore goldstein who went on and theyll say things were so bad for the colored population in the confederate states under freedom party rule that it had no choice but to rebel well they can can say any damn thing they want jeff replied saying something doesnt make it so though im jake featherston and im here to tell you the truth goldstein quoted with savage relish yes weve noticed that oh yeah you damnyankees never once told a lie and every one of you just loves coons too and i bet your shit dont stink either all of which would be good points except for two minor details the lawyer ticked them off on his fingers first one is the united states are going to win and the confederate states are going to lose second one is you really are responsible for upwards of a million deaths so what jeff said that made even goldstein blink angrily pinkard said it again so what goddammit who gave the orders to drop those fucking superbombs on our cities you think that asshole aint a bigger criminal than me you gonna hang him by the balls like hell you will chances are youll pin a medal on the motherfucker instead again two minor details goldstein said first you used the superbomb before we did yeah and i wish we woulda started a year ago jeff broke in then youd be laughing out of the other side of your face goldstein continued as if he hadnt spoken and again were winning and youre not you might do well to sound sorry for what youve done and to blame it on featherston and on ferdinand koenig im afraid i dont think it will do you much good but it may do you some you want me to turn traitor jeff said im trying to tell you how you have some small chance of staying alive isidore goldstein said if you dont care i cant do much for you im very much afraid i cant do much for you anyhow ill tell you what im sorry about im sorry we lost pinkard said im sorry it comes down to me havin to try and beg my life from a bunch of damnyankees seems like i got a choice between dyin on my feet and maybe livin on my knees you had a choice like that mr smartass lawyer what would you do i dont know how can any man know for sure before he has to find out the hard way goldstein said but im still jewish that says i likely have some stubborn ancestors up in the branches of my family tree jeff hadnt thought of it like that he didnt exactly love jews but like most confederates he aimed the greater portion of his scorn at negroes and a big part of what was left at mexicans he wondered what hip rodriguez would do in a mess like this he didnt think hip would crawl greaser or not hip was a man but whywhy dammitdid he go and eat his gun there you are then jeff said yeah here i am and here you are and how the hell am i supposed to defend you goldstein shook his head ill give it my best shot better than you deserve too but then like i said its the guys who dont deserve a defense who deserve it most of all what was that supposed to mean jeff was still chewing on it when the us mps took him back to jail he looked around as he walked hoping for a glimpse of edith no luck wherever she was she wasnt close by he wondered whether hed ever see her again if the yankees hanged him would they be cruel enough to keep her away even then he never wondered what the negroes on their way to his bathhouses thought of him t hese days the joint committee on the conduct of the war had less to do congress had set it up to hold the armys feet to the fireand the navys too with the war almost won the senators and representatives didnt have much to criticize flora blackford wished the superbomb had vaporized jake featherstonbut so did the army sooner or later it would catch him either that or hed die fighting to escape capture flora didnt much care which as long as the world was rid of him a senator was grilling a navy captain about why the united states was having so much trouble matching the new german submersible designs those promised a revolution in submarine warfare once the usa got them right that hadnt happened yet isnt it a fact captain rickover that the german navy has had these new models in service for almost a year yes but we only got the plans a few months ago rickover answered you tell him flora thought the captain was a jew one of the few to rise so high he had no give in him continuing well get the boats built faster than the kriegsmarine did but we cant do it yesterday im sorry i would if i could i dont need you to be facetious captain well i dont need you to play mondaymorning coach senator but the rules are set up to let you do that if you want to mr chairman this witness is being uncooperative the senator complained i am not rickover said before the chairman could rule on the dispute the distinguished gentleman from dakotaa state famous for its seafaring traditionwants the navy department to accomplish the impossible the merely improbable which weve done time and again no longer satisfies him the senator from dakota spluttered the chairman plied his gavel with might and main before flora found out how the exciting serial ended a page hurried up to her and whispered excuse me congresswoman but you have a telegram thank you flora stood and slipped out escaping this nonsense is a relief nothing else but she thought then she saw the kid in the western union uniform darker and greener than the one soldiers wore when a messenger boy waited for you did you really want the wire he carried too often it was like seeing the angel of death in front of you her hand shook a little as she reached out for the flimsy yellow envelope much obliged maam he said when she gave him a quarter he touched two fingers to the brim of his cap in a sort of salute then hurried away she had to make herself open the envelope the blood ran cold in her veinsit almost didnt want to run at allwhen she saw the telegram was from the war department the secretary of war deeply regrets to inform you tears blurred the words she had to blink several times before she could see to go onthat your son joshua blackford was wounded in action on the arkansas front the wound is not believed to be serious and a full recovery is expected the printed signature of a lieutenant colonelan assistant adjutant generalfollowed how bad is it maam the congressional page asked wounded flora answered automatically the wire says they think hell get better im glad to hear it the page said if the war went on another yearwhich didnt seem likelyhe might be in uniform himself he probably had friends who already were did he have any whod been unlucky flora didnt want to ask she hurried over to the bank of telephones down the hall from the committee meeting room instead of calling lieutenant colonel pfeil whose signature probably went out on dozens of wires a day she rang up franklin roosevelt in one way a wounded private was no concern of his but when the wounded private was the son of a congresswoman who was also a former first lady and who was friends with the assistant secretary of warmaybe roosevelt would know more than he might if she were calling about private joe doakes she got through in a hurry hello flora roosevelt didnt sound as ebullient as usual so he probably knew something yes i had heard im sorry he said when she asked what happened she demanded well this is all unofficial because im not supposed to keep track of such things but i understand hes lost the middle finger on his left hand roosevelt said bullet or a shell fragmenti dont know which and im not sure anyone else does either not a crippling woundum he isnt lefthanded is he no flora said she didnt know whether to be relieved it wasnt worse or horrified that it had happened at all she ended up being both at once a stew that made her heart pound and her stomach churn thats good if he isnt id say its what the men call a hometowner a hometowner shed heard the phrase too alevai she said by the time he gets well the war will be over wont it we sure hope so roosevelt answered nothing is ever as sure as we wish it would be but we hope so do you know where he is the wire didnt say i dont know but im sure i can find out for you are you in your office no im at a telephone outside the committee meeting room but i can get there in five minutes all right let me see what i can find out and ill call you back the assistant secretary of war hung up flora ducked back into the meeting room to explain what had happened the senators and representatives made sympathetic noises a lot of them had fought in the last war and several had sons at the front this time around captain rickover gave her his best wishes from the witness stand the telephone was ringing when she hurried into her office bertha stared in surprise hello congresswoman how funny you should walk in mr roosevelt is on the line for you ill take it right here flora said and grabbed the handset away from her secretary hello franklin here i am hello flora joshua is in the military hospital in thayer missouri which is right on the border with arkansas thayer missouri flora repeated thank you she hung up then turned to bertha get me to thayer missouri as fast as humanly possible that turned out to be a flight to st louis and a railroad journey down from the big city bertha squawked till she found out why flora needed to make the trip then she shut up and arranged the tickets with her usual competence landing in st louis flora saw to her surprise that it had been hit almost as hard as philadelphia the war in the west never got the press things farther east did but confederate bombers still came up to strike st louis and longrange cs rockets fired from arkansas had hit the town hard the train ride southwest from st louis to thayer wasa train ride every few miles a machinegun nestsometimes sandbagged more often a concrete blockhouseguarded the track here west of the mississippi spaces were wide and soldiers thin on the ground confederate raiders slipped north every now and again the joint committee on the conduct of the war would have had something sharp to say about thatif it hadnt had so many other bigger things closer to home to worry about thayer had gone up as a railroad town it had flourished in a modest way as a crossborder trading centerand then suffered when the war strangled the trade that kept it going the military hospital on the edge of town put a little life back into the economybut at what a cost joshua wasnt in his bed when flora got there to see him she feared something had gone wrong and he was back in the doctors clutches but the wounded man in the bed next to his said hes playing cards in the common room down at the end of the corridor maam oh flora said thank you when flora walked in joshua held five cards in his right hand bandages swathed the left he put down the cards to toss money into the pot see your five and raise you another five then he looked up from the poker game oh hi mom he said as if they were bumping into each other back home be with you in a minute i have to finish cleaning spamheads clock in your dreams kid ill raise you five more another greenback fluttered down in the center of the table the sergeant called spamhead did have a square very pink face he seemed to take the nickname for granted flora wouldnt have wanted to be called anything like that he won the pot toohis straight beat joshuas three tens joshua said oh darn all the other poker players laughed at him what would he have said if his mother werent there to hear it something spicier no doubt he stood up from the table and walked over to flora i didnt think youd get here so fast how are you flora asked joshua raised his wounded hand it hurts he said as he might have said its sunny outside but not too bad plenty of guys here are worse off poor spamhead lost a foothe stepped on a mine hes lucky it wasnt one of those bouncing onesit wouldve blown his balls off sorry its all right flora told him how else can you say that spamhead got mutilated and joshua thinks hes lucky i can see why but what does your doctor say that it was a clean wound that its nothing much to flabble about that easy for him to say flora broke in indignantly he didnt get hurt yeah i know i thought of that too joshua said but hes seen plenty worse so its not like hes wrong either ill heal from this and ill heal pretty fast the only thing i wont be able to do that i could before is give somebody the finger with my left hand joshua flora wasnt exactly shocked but she was surprised her son grinned sheepishly but not sheepishly enoughhed done that on purpose i didnt even think of it he said the medic who took me back to the aid station was the one who said it first terrific now i know who to blame flora sounded as if she were about to haul that medic up before the joint committee on the conduct of the war she was tempted to do it too she recognized abuse of power when she saw it which didnt mean it failed to tempt her maybe joshua saw the temptation gleaming in her eyes for he said somebody else wouldve come up with it if he hadnt i would have myself i betits the way soldiers think terrific i dont want you thinking like that flora said joshua didnt answer he just looked at herlooked down at her to remind her he was taller to remind her he was grown if not grown up to remind her that he didnt care how she wanted him to think he would think the way he chose not the way she did she squeezed him careful of the gauzeshrouded hand im glad youre going to be all right im gladder than i know how to tell you sure mom joshua took it for granted flora didnt couldnt and knew she never would she started to cry im fine mom joshua said not understanding at all he probably was flora knew too well that she wasnt e ver feel like a piece on a chessboard sir lon menefee asked sam carsten nodded now that you mention it yes the comparison wasnt one he would have made himself poker pinochle and checkers were more his speed he knew how the different chessmen moved but that was about it but the josephus daniels sure was making a long diagonal glide across the board of the atlantic right now something big was in the wind the navy department had found a more urgent assignment for her than protecting the carriers that protected the battlewagons that bombarded the coast of haiti while marines and soldiers went ashore im sure not sorry to get out of range of landbased air he said even with our own flyboys overhead i dont like that for hell worked out all right menefee said sam had to nod well yeah when the butternut bastards on the island saw they wouldnt be able to hold us they couldnt give up fast enough the exec laughed dyou blame em christ no sam said if they didnt surrender to us the haitians wouldve got em they werent up for that haiti had won its freedom from france in a bloody slave revolt that shocked the south a century and a half before what the negroes there now would have done to the confederate soldiers they caughtcarstens mouth tightened the blacks probably wouldnt have treated featherstons fuckers any worse than they got treated themselves yes sir menefee said but that covers one hell of a lot of ground mm sam let it go at that again the exec wasnt wrong the confederates had set up one of their murder factories outside of portauprince at first theyd just killed haitian soldiers and government officials then theyd started in on the educated people in the towns folks who might give them trouble one of these days before long all you needed was a black skinand how many haitians didnt have one of those theyll pay menefee predicted if we can arrest the guys who ran that camp in texas we can do the same with the sons of bitches in the caribbean i expect youre right sam said a wave rolling down from the north slapped the josephus daniels port side and made the destroyer escort roll a little she was heading east across the ocean as fast as she could go east and north musingly sam went on i wonder how long well stay out of range of landbased air you think us troops will land on ireland the way we did on haiti sir menefee asked thatd be a rougher job logistics are worse and the limeys arent knocked flat the way the confederates were its one of the things im wondering about sam answered the other one is whats the kaiser going to do now yeah england dropped a superbomb on hamburg but how many more does churchill have you dont want to piss the germans off because whatever you go and do to them theyll do to you doubled and redoubled he wasnt a great bridge player either but he could talk the lingo beats me menefee said i expect well find out before too long the josephus daniels remained part of the flotilla that had landed troops on haiti sam felt a certain amount of satisfaction because the destroyer escort wasnt the slowest ship in itthe baby flattops were he wouldnt have done without them for the world if he really was sailing against the british isles he wanted all the air cover he could get in fact he wanted even more air cover than that summer in the north atlantic was much more pleasant than winter days were longer seas were calmer and the sun was brighter lon menefee tanned sam reddened and burned and wore his hat whenever he went out on deck he exchanged resigned looks with the handful of sailors who came close to being as fair as he was nobody on the destroyer escort was eager to run into the royal navy britains fleet didnt have the worldwide reach it had enjoyed before the great war where it still went though it remained a highly capable outfit a destroyer off on the other side of the flotilla heard or thought she heard a submersible lurking in the sea she prosecuted the sub with a shower of ashcans there was no triumphant signal showing the enemy boatif it was an enemy boathad gone to the bottom sam didnt much care as long as the sub couldnt launch torpedoes he stayed happy he began haunting the wireless shack as hed done aboard several other ships hed served he noticed he wasnt the only one all the officers and chiefs seemed to be waiting for the other shoe to drop but he was asleep in his cabin when it did the clatter of running feet on the steel of the corridor floor woke him a split second before someone pounded on the door its open he called turning on the lamp and sitting up in his narrow bed he didnt have two more sailors right over his head the way he did when he first put to sea yeoman van duyk burst into the cabin theyve gone and done it sir he said his voice cracking with excitement who the germans sam asked around a yawn a hot flask full of coffee stood on the steel nightstand he grabbed for ithe didnt think hed need to worry about sleep any more tonight london yes sir van duyk nodded and brighton and norwichall at the same time or close enough sweet jesus sam exclaimed as he poured from the hot flask he found himself wanting to improve the coffee with a slug of medicinal brandy he didnt not with the rating standing there did they get churchill did they get the king i took this off the german wireless sir so they dont know van duyk answered no word from the bbc yet all right thanks sams guess was that the prime minister and king edward and his family would have got out of london even before the raf hit hamburg they had to know the kaiser would land a superbomb there sooner or later what else did the germans say that they had more where those three came from and that they were ready to knock england for a loop if that was what it took to get the limeys out of the war jesus sam said again how much of this poor sorry worlds gonna be left if we keep blowing chunks of it off the map beats me sir van duyk said i better get back to the shack he sketched a salute and disappeared and i better get my ass up to the bridge sam said even though nobody was there to hear him he put on his shoes and jacket hed slept in the rest of his clothes hed look a little rumpled but the world wouldnt end the exec had the conn when carsten came in you heard sir menefee asked you bet i did sam answered three at once they must be turning those bastards out in carload lots theyre lucky they didnt get one of their bombers shot down damn right they are i bet they snuck em in as part of a big raid that way the limeys couldnt know which machines to go after maybe they had fighters flying escort toowith the yranging sets theyve got nowadays you can see what youre going after even at night makes sense the exec nodded youve been thinking about this sam gave him a crooked grin didnt know it wasnt in the rules but youre righti have i figured the kaiser had to hit back if i was him how would i go about it what will england do now menefee wondered depends on how many bombs shes got i suppose sam said if she has more shell use em if she doesnthow can she go on beats me menefee said hell if it wasnt for churchill i bet england would have quit already sam said him and featherstonthe other sides got the stubborn soandsos now we hope hes dead the exec said amen sam and thad walters spoke at the same time they looked at each other and grinned but churchill wasnt dead he went on the bbc about half an hour later van duyk called sam down to the wireless shack the british prime minister was speaking from somewhere in the united kingdom he sounded furious too if the hun thinks we are beaten let him think again he thundered we shall avenge this monstrous crime even now the angel of death unfolds his wings over a german city i do not choose to name with weeping and repentance shall the kaiser rue the day he chose to try conclusions with us wow sam said too bad hes not one of the good guyshe gives a hell of a speech yes sir van duyk turned the dial on the shortwave set sounds like the germans are going to get hit right about now lets see what they have to say he found the englishlanguage german wireless there is a report of what may have been a superbomb explosion between bruges and ghent in belgium the announcer said only the slightest guttural accent betraying his homeland one of our turboengined night fighters brought down a british bomber in approximately the same location if the angel of death sought to spread his wings over germany tonight he fell short by a good many kilometers van duyk whooped up yours winston sam said he hurried up to the bridge to spread the news oh my lon menefee said well how many more cards do the limeys have well find out sam said stay tuned for the next exciting episode of as the world goes up in smoke brought to you by the jameson casket and mortuary company our slogan is youre going to die sometimewhy not now ouch lieutenant walters said lord its the way things look carsten said wearily this cant go on much longercan it he sounded as if he was pleadingand he was ask featherston ask churchill lieutenant menefee said theyre the ones who have to quit cant happen soon enough sam said its pretty much pointless now we know who won we know who lost only thing we dont know is how many dead there are he paused well maybe churchill has enough bombs left to force a draw doesnt look like featherston does i just dont want to see a bomber coming over us at thirty thousand feet thats all walters said yipes ice walked up sams spine i didnt even think of that he made as if to look at the sky no cap at night it wouldnt be flying anywhere near so high anyway whod ever imagined you might need to but a superbomb didnt need to score a direct hit to ruin a warship he wanted to turn around and run for home but he couldnt and the josephus daniels steamed on t his is going to hurt a little michael pound had come to hate those words because a little always turned into a lot hed never imagined changing dressings on his burned legs could hurt so much and at that there were plenty of guys who had it worse than he did some of the badly burned menpilots and other aircrew most of them and a few soldiers from barrels with themneeded morphine every time they got fresh bandages he didnt not any more he missed the stuff now that he wasnt getting it but not enough to make him think hed turned into a junkie it did do more against pain than whatever else they had codeine wasnt much stronger than aspirin by comparison he could bear what he had to live with though when he heard other men howling he understood the meaning of the phrase it could be worse the military hospital was somewhere near chattanooga formidable defenses kept snipers and auto bombs at bay from what everybody said holding the csa down was proving almost as expensive as conquering the damn place had been that wasnt good but pound couldnt do anything about it he got his purple heart he got a bronze star to go with his silver star he didnt particularly think he deserved one but nobody asked him he got promoted to first lieutenant which thrilled him less than the brass who gave him a silver bar on each shoulder strap probably thought it would and he got a letter from general morrell morrell wasnt just an old acquaintancehe was a friend despite differences in rank and hed been wounded too a letter from him really did mean something you should do very well lieutenant a doctor told pound one day a lot of thirddegree burns are much deeper and impair function even when they heal well youll have some nasty scars but i dont think youll even limp terrific pound said how would you like it if somebody said something like that about your legs especially when you were hurting like a son of a bitch while he did it the doctor pulled up the left sleeve of his white coat his arm had scars that made nasty look like an understatement i was in a motorcar crash ten years ago he said i know what im talking aboutand now we can do things for burns they didnt dream of back then can you use your hand pound asked thumb and first two fingers the doctor replied the tendons and nerves to the others are pretty much shot but ive got the important ones anyhow you dont have that worryi know your toes work uhhuh pound said unenthusiastically he knew they worked too the therapists made him wiggle them that made him forget about the rest of his painit felt as if a flamethrower were toasting them just hang on the doctor said its a bitch while its going on but it gets better you have to give it time thats all pound couldnt even tell him to go to hell because the other man had been through what he was in the middle of now and had come out the other side it is a bitch was as much as he thought he could say oh i know the doctor answered quietly i still miss the needle sometimes but ill be damned if i go back to itand you can take that any way you please he nodded and walked on to the next patient he looked like such a mild little fellow too the kind who slid through life without anything much ever happening to him which only proved you never could tell michael pound had seen that plenty of times with soldiers he got to know he wondered why he was so surprised now he wished he could get up and do things but he was stuck on his backor sometimes to stave off bedsores on his stomach the therapists said he could put weight on his feet in a couple of weeks he looked forward to that and then again he didnt till youd been through a lot of pain you didnt understand how much you wanted to stay away from more in the meantime he had magazines and newspapers and the handful of books in the hospital library he voraciously devoured them he also had the wireless he would have listened to news almost all the time the other guys in the ward plumped for music and comedies and dramas pound endured their programshe couldnt try throwing his weight around not unless he wanted everybody else to hate him but the news was all that really mattered to him sometimes the other burned men gave in to him too especially in the middle of the night when they were all too likely to be awake and when the regular programs were even crappier than they were the rest of the time and so he was listening to a news program when a flash came in we interrupt this broadcast said the man behind the mike this just in from the bbcthe churchill government has fallen parliament voted no confidence in the churchillmosley regime that has run the united kingdom for more than ten years pending elections a caretaker government under sir horace wilson has been formed wilson has announced that his first action as prime minister will be to seek an armistice from the kaiser the room erupted a nurse rushed in to quiet the whoops and cheers when she found out what had happened she let out a whoop herself they only had two pound said two what the nurse asked two bombs pound and two other guys said at the same time pound went on they had two and the second one didnt go off where they wanted it to and that was it now the germans can blow up their cities one at a time and they cant hit back wow the nurse said are you a general you talk like a general im a lieutenant he answered ive got gray hair cause i was a sergeant for years and years they finally promoted me and theyve been regretting it ever since she laughed youre funny too i like that he wished he had a private room maybe something interesting would have happened the ward didnt even boast curtains around the beds whatever they did to you everybody else got to watch after a while you mostly didnt care this once pound might have only featherston left said the man in the next bed what do we do when we catch him somebody asked string him up the answer came from pound and several other wounded soldiers at the same time it also came from the nurse she suggested stringing the president of the csa up by some highly sensitive parts of his anatomy coming from most women that would have shocked pound hed seen that nurses had mouths at least as raunchy as those of soldiers it made sense nurses saw plenty of horrors too my god someone else said the war really is just about over nobody made any snide comments about that maybe the other men in the ward had as much trouble taking it in as michael pound did the war had consumed his whole being for the past three yearsand before that when hed been down in houston before it returned to the csa he might as well have been at war he wondered what hed do when peace finally broke out would the army want to keep a first lieutenant with gray hair the service needed some grizzled noncoms they tempered junior officers puppyish enthusiasm but hed never be anything more than a junior officer himself and he was much too goddamn old for the role if they turned him loose if they patted him on the back and said well donenow well go use up somebody else what the hell would he do then he had no idea the thought was frightening enough the army had been his life since he was eighteen years old they couldnt just throw him outcould they shit another burned man said this fuckin wars never gonna be overexcuse my french miss ive heard the words before the nurse said dryly the soldiers laughed the one whod been talking went on it wont be honest to god it wont maybe the confederate government finally surrenders yeah but well stay on occupation duty down here forever lousy bushwhackers and diehards wont start singing the starspangled banner tomorrow and you can take that to the bank we have grandchildren theyll be down here shooting at waddayacallemsrebels three or four guys groaned probably because they thought the burned man was likely to be right michael pound felt like cheering for exactly the same reason he didnteverybody else would have thought he was nuts but he felt like it if the war or something a lot like the war went on and on the army wouldnt have any excuse to throw him out on his ear well it wouldnt have any excuse except maybe that hed made himself too obnoxious for the brass to stand not without pride he figured he was capable of that once we get done licking the confederates do we go after the japs next asked the guy in the next bed if the general staff of the burn ward of the military hospital outside chattanooga had their way the answer to that one was no pound wouldnt have minded seeing the sandwich islands but not as a way station to a battle somewhere even farther off in the pacific the japs had their sphere and the united states had theirs and as long as neither side poached on the other that was fine with him he did say i bet theyre working overtime in tokyo trying to figure out how to build a superbomb wouldnt you be said the soldier next to him you bet i would pound answered as long as weve got it and they dont its a club we can use to beat them over the head i bet the tsars telling all his scientists theyre heading for siberia if they dont make one pdq too if the germans have one and the russians dont theyre in big trouble he wondered whether austriahungary would try to make one berlin was the senior partner there and had been since the early days of the great war germany had saved austriahungarys bacon against the russians then and again this time around but vienna had some clever scientists too you never could tell pound decided with profound unoriginality before long everybody and his motherinlaws going to have thosemiserable things a soldier had mercy on the nurses nonetoodelicate ears how do we keep from blowing each other to kingdom come that was a good question it was probably the question on the minds of the stripedpants set these days if the diplomats came up with a halfway decent answer they would earn their salaries and then some michael pound thought about the csas rockets if you could load superbombs onto bigger better ones you could blow up anybody you didnt like even if he didnt live next door wouldnt that be fun could you make a rocket shoot down another rocket airplanes shot down airplanessome of the time anyhow why shouldnt rockets shoot down rocketssome of the time anyhow would that be enough pound had no idea which left him in the same leaky boat as everybody else in the world xiii j ake featherston felt trapped the skies over north carolina had been lousy with damnyankee fighterbombers coming down from the north now that hed crossed into south carolina the skies were lousy with damnyankee fighterbombers coming up from the south he and the handful of loyalists who clung to him through thick and thin moved by night and lay up by day like any hunted animals only chunks of the confederate states still answered to the confederate government pieces of virginia north carolina and south carolina the part of cuba that wasnt in revolt most of florida most of sonora and chihuahua which cut off by the goddamn treasonous republic of texas might as well have been on the far side of the moon and a core of mississippi louisiana and most of arkansas if the war would go on if the war could go on it would have to go on there one thing wrong jake hadnt the faintest idea how to reach his alleged redoubt what are we going to do he demanded of clarence potter jesus h christ what can we do theyre squeezing us tighter every day the bastards o god i could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space were it not that i have bad dreams potter answered what the hell is that jake said shakespeare hamlet hot damn i dont need to go back to school now thank you kindly featherston glared at the longtime foe whod done him so much good what are you doing here anyway why dont you give yourself up to the usa you can tell em youve hated my guts since dirt if things were different i might potter said calmly but im the guy who blew up philadelphia remember and i did it wearing a yankee uniform too im not likely to forget jakes laugh was a hoarse harsh bark you got out again too in spite of everything i bet those sons of bitches are shitting rivets on account of it bad security potter said if we had another superbomb we could get it up there that made featherston cuss they would have another bomb in a few monthsif the united states didnt overrun lexington first which seemed unlikely henderson fitzbelmont had moved heaven and earth to make one superbomb now when the csa needed lots of them he got constipated you couldnt count on anybodyexcept yourself always yourself but now the united states want to kill me worse than you ever did potter went on and theyve got an excuse because i wore their uniform so in case they find out who i am i expect im dead which means im all yours mr president all mine huh then why the devil aint you a redheaded gal with legs up to here you cant have everything sir youve still got ferd koenig along for the ride and youve still got lulu she sat in a different motorcar parked under some trees not far away jake looked over in that direction to make sure she couldnt overhear before he said shes a wonderful woman in all kinds of ways but not that one i do believe id sooner hump me a sheep well she doesnt do anything for me either but she worships the ground you walk on potter said god knows why fuck you too featherston said without rancor shes a good gal i dont want to make her unhappy or anything so she better not hear that from you she wont i dont play those kinds of games potter said and jake decided to believe him the intelligence officer wasnt usually nasty in any petty way after a moment potter went on you know youre rightyou are nice to lulu you go out of your way to be nice to lulu how come you dont do that with anybody else there was a question jake had never asked himself now he did but he only shrugged damned if i know potter its just how things worked out thats all i like lulu rest of the worlds full of assholes i wish i could tell you you were wrong potter said airplanes droned by overheadyankee airplanes they were going to hit something farther north columbia was already in us hands so they could drop their load on north carolina and then land in virginia with a sigh potter asked how are we going to make it out west do you think we can get an alligator to land anywhere near here do you think it could fly across georgia and alabama without getting shot down wouldnt bet on it jake answered mournfully what i was thinking was if we put on civvies and make like were a bunch of guys who gave up we can say were going home and sneak across what the damnyankees are holding and they wont be any wiser how do you like it potter pursed his lips if we cant get an alligator maybe if we can i believe id sooner fly at night and take the chance of getting blown out of the sky jake scowled at him potter looked back unperturbed as if to say well you asked me he was one of the few men who never sugarcoated their opinions around the president of the csa reluctantly featherston respected him for that and he was too likely to be right damn him ill see what we can come up with the president said when his shrunken entourage drove into spartanburg south carolina he found the colonel in charge of the towns defenses lost in gloom damnyankees are on the way and to hell with me if i know how to stop em the officer said do your best jake answered now let me get on the horn to charlotte that was the closest place where he thought he was likely to find a transport and he did and after some choice bad language he persuaded the authorities there to fly it down to spartanburg if it gets shot down some officious fool in charlotte said if it doesnt get here youll get shot down jake wasnt sure he could bring off the threat but the jerk up in charlotte couldnt be sure he couldnt the alligator landed late in the afternoon ground crew personnel swarmed out with camouflage nets to make it as invisible as they could do we really want to do this ferd koenig asked if you dont then stay here featherston answered say hello to the us soldiers when they catch you the attorney general bit his lip he got on the airplane with everybody else dont know exactly how well land if we have to do it in the dark the pilot said youll work something out jake told him well i sure as hell hope so but the pilot didnt sound too worried one thingif i think this is crazy chances are the damnyankees will too maybe well surprise em so much well get through em just like shit through a goose now youre talking you take off in the wee small hours jake said fly lowstay under the yranging if you can goddammit we arent licked yet if we can just make the enemy see that occupying our country is more expensive than its worth well get their soldiers out of here and well get a peace we can live with may take a while but well do it he believed every word of it hed been fighting his whole life he didnt know anything else if he had to lead guerrillas out of the hills for the next twenty years he was ready to do it after so many fights what was one more nothing to faze himthat was for sure after they got airborne the pilot asked want me to put on my wing lights yeah do it jake answered if the yankees see em theyll reckon were one of theirs i hope like hell they will anyway me too the pilot said with feeling but he flicked the switch the red and green lights went on the alligator droned south and westmore nearly south than west at first because neither the pilot nor jake wanted to come too close to atlanta if us forces would be especially alert anywhere they both figured that was the place looking out of one of the transports small side windows jake had no trouble figuring out when they passed from csto usheld territory the blackout in the occupied lands was a lot less stringent the yankees didnt expect confederate bombers overhead damn them and the worst part was the yankees had every right not to expect them the confederacy didnt have many bombers left and mostly used the ones it did have in close support of its surviving armies turbulence made the alligator bounce somebody gulped loudly use the airsick bag three people shouted at the same time the gulper did it helpedsome and then turbulence wasnt the only thing bouncing the alligator shells started bursting all around the airplane suddenly the road through the air might have been full of potholesbig deep ones a major general who wasnt wearing a seat belt went sprawling get us the fuck out of here jake yelled if lulu sniffed or squawked he didnt hear her engines roaring the transport dove for the deck the antiaircraft guns pursued shrapnel clattered into the wings and tore through the fuselage somebody in there shrieked which meant jagged metal tore through a person too were losing fuel the pilot shouted lots of it can we go on jake had to bellow at the top of his lungs to make himself heard not a chance in church the pilot answered wed never get there can you land the son of a bitch if i cant were all dead the man answered jake remembered that he hadnt been thrilled about landing at night even in confederateheld territory how much less enthusiastic would he be about a nighttime emergency landing on enemy soil i told him to put on the wing lights jake thought did it matter too goddamn late to worry about it now he hated having his fate in somebody elses hands if he was going out he saw himself trading bullets with the damnyankees and nailing plenty of them before they finally got him this waydammit im a hero the script isnt supposed to work like this brace yourselves the pilot shouted belts on everybody im putting it down i think thats a field up ahead therehope like hell it is anyway anybody gets out let beckie know i love her one of the engines died just before the alligator met the groundthat was one hell of a leak all right the transport was built to take it and built to land on rough airstripsbut coming down in a tobacco field with no landing lights was more than anybody could reasonably expect but it got down it landed hard hard enough to make jake bite the devil out of his tongue one tire blew the alligator slewed sideways a wingtip dug into the ground the transport tried to flip over the wing broke off instead the fire started then out the pilot screamed out now the airplane hadnt stopped moving but nobody argued with him jake was the second man out the door he had to jump down to the ground and turned an ankle when he hit swearing savagely he limped away fuck he said in amazement im alive c larence potter wondered how many nasty ways he could almost die this blaze was a lot smaller than the radioactive fire hed touched off in philadelphia but it was plenty big enough to give a man an awful foretaste of hell before it finally killed him to the poor chump roasting how could any fire be bigger than that he heard jake featherstons obscene astonishment from not far away it summed up how he felt too hed scrambled away from the burning alligator right after the president of the csa was everybody out he looked at the pyre that had been a transport anybody who wasnt out now never would make it that was for damn sure where the hell are we ferdinand koenigs deep voice came from over to the right somewhere in georgiai cant tell you anything else that was the pilot nobody would have to deliver his message to beckieyet but they werent free and clear not by a long shot lets get out of here potter said this field will be swarming with yankees in nothing flat some of the confederate big shots werent going anywhere i think my leg is busted said the general whod replaced nathan bedford forrest iii as chief of the general staff potter couldnt remember his name as far as potter was concerned the officer wasnt worth remembering im not going anywhere quick you can surrender willard dont reckon theyre shooting soldiersonly politicians jake featherston said just dont tell em im around i wouldnt do that sir willard said first name or last potter wondered hell it didnt matter to anybody but willard any more general potter is right saul goldman said potter blinked he hadnt even known the director of communications got on the alligator goldman was so quiet and selfeffacing he could disappear in plain sight lulu was hurt too hurt badly i dont want the yankees to get me mr president she told jake will you please shoot me and put me out of my misery i dont want to do that featherston exclaimed please lulu said i cant go on its the last thing you can do for me sinceoh never mind you didnt care about that not with me she knew what she was talking about jake had put it more pungently the afternoon before but it amounted to the same thing the president of the csa muttered to himself he started to turn away then turned back potter had rarely seen him indecisivewrong often sometimes disastrously so but hardly ever at a loss christ he said under his breath hurry lulu said you cant stay here potter hadnt imagined he would find lulu agreeing with him either christ jake said again a little louder this time then he yanked the out of the holster he always wore he fired and whispered sorry lulu as he did come on now he almost shouted lets get the fuck away from here they stumbled and limped through the field the only light came from the burning alligator and they were trying to put it behind them as fast as they could that must have been hard sir potter said after a while cold comfort he realized as soon as he spoke if any at all feels like i just shot my own luck featherston answered his voice rough withtears that make any sense at all to you sense no potter answered as the president glared at him he added i understand what you mean though lets hope youre wrong thats all yeah lets jakes voice stayed harsh you know what youre liable to be our ace in the hole we do run into damnyankees you can talk for us make em think were on their side i hope i can anyhow potter said hed done it up in the usa if he couldnt do it againthey were up the wellknown creek that was all i hope i dont have to i hope there arent any yankees within miles thatd be nice featherston didnt sound as if he believed it was likely since potter didnt either he would have let it rest there but featherston went on best thing we can do is get into some town the yankees didnt bother garrisoning we borrow a couple of motorcars from loyal people we can head west wish to hell i knew just where we were at potter did they were in trouble that was where jake featherston yelled for the pilot and asked him somewhere east of atlantacant tell you closer he replied i was going to fly south a little while longer then swing west thats about as good as i can do right now beg your pardon sir but im fuckin surprised im in one piece you did good son jake saidhe was never shy about patting small fry on the back that was probably one of the things that had helped him rise and kept him on top yeah you did good so wheres a town lets find a road potter said sooner or later a roads got to take us into a town he didnt say what kind of town a road would take them into they just had to trust to luck on that no sooner had the thought crossed his mind than featherstons mournful comment followed it he found the road by the simple expedient of stepping down into it he came closer to hurting himself then than he had in the alligators crashlanding which way ferdinand koenig asked north or south east or west was supposed to follow that question but potter had no idea which direction was which evidently neither did anyone else but there was the moon a thin waning crescent so that had to be the east which meant the north star should be aboutthere and there it was with the rest of the little dipper curling from it jake featherston worked it out at the same time as potter did this way he said pointing well keep on heading south see what the hell happens hed most likely spent more time in the field than anybody else here he would be able to figure out which way was which as soon as he set his mind to it down the road they went a ragged squad some hale enough others limping most of them had pistols one officer carried an automatic tredegar if yankee soldiers came on them they wouldnt last long potter understood that perfectly well he wondered how many of the others did he also wondered how long they could keep going sooner or later their minor injuries would catch up to them and more than a few of them were to put it politely not men accustomed to taking much exercise ferd koenig in particular resembled nothing so much as a suet pudding in a gray freedom party uniform potter realized they should have changed into civilian clothes before they got on the alligator too late to worry about that now too late to worry about lots of things now would i be here if id managed to shoot jake at the olympics no of course he wouldnt the presidents bodyguards would have gunned him down but maybe the country wouldnt have been in the mess it was in or maybe it would havehow could you tell the vice president in those days hadnt been an amiable nonentity like don partridge willy knight of the redemption league wanted to do a lot of the same things jake featherston did the only reason he didnt get a chance was that the freedom party grew bigger faster a couple of years later he came close to assassinating jake himself and close counted in horseshoes and hand grenades was the soldiers joke knight disappeared off the face of the earth after that potter supposed hed died in one camp or another or maybe he just got summarily killed and dumped in the james any which way he was gone can we get away somebody asked believe it jake featherston said instantly if you believe it you can do it thats what lifes all about believe it hard enough work for it with everything youve got and youll get it look at me he was rightand he was wrong hed climbed from nowhere to the top of the heap in the csa hed run the country for ten years and now the confederate states of americaare getting it all right clarence potter thought nice to know i can still make stupid jokes at a time like this off in the distance like the roar of faraway lions he heard the rumble of truck motors they neared far faster than lions would have and they were likely to be far more dangerous hit the dirt potter sang out the confederate dignitaries scrambled off to the side of the road and hid behind bushes and in ditches it would have been funny if it werent so grim this was what the confederate states of america had come down to a dozen or so frightened men hiding so the damnyankees wouldnt catch them one after another the heavy trucks pounded past exhaust stank in potters nostrils he got a glimpse of soldiers in greengray in the rear compartments and heard a couple of windswept snatches of bad language in us accents then after a few seconds that were among the longest of his life the last deuceandahalf was gone god damn them theyll find willard and thatll spill the shit in the soup jake featherston said potter wouldnt have put it the same way which didnt mean he disagreed with the president jake went on we got to make it to a town quick grab us some autos and get the fuck out of here that also seemed like good advice lets get moving the pilot said he was younger than just about everybody else thereand also the man the yankees were least likely to shoot out of hand if things went wrong move they did fifteen minutes later they all hid and flattened out as more trucks growled up the road these machines had an ambulance with them which likely meant the yankees had indeed found the head of the cs general staff would they rough willard up would he keep quiet if they did next episode of the serial potter thought he began to pant his feet started hurtinghe was wearing dress shoes not marching boots the sky lightened in the east where the hells that town somebody said voice numb with fatigue feels like weve been going down this goddamn road forever couldnt have said it better myself potter said he was definitely getting a blister on his left heel if it worsened he wouldnt be able to keep up the damnyankees would catch himand he suspected that would be that in short order featherston pointed sign up ahead half an hour earlier they wouldnt have seen it till they were right on top of it potter with his weak eyes would have been one of the last men to be able to read it somebody called out the name of the town on the sign and said it was a mile and a half off so he didnt have to where the hell are we ferd koenig demandedthe name meant as little to him as it did to potter smack in the middle of georgia jake answered confidently did he carry a map of the csa in his mind detailed enough to include a nowhere of a place like this one potter wouldnt have been surprised jake knew all kinds of strange things and remembered almost everything he heard that wasnt the problem the problem was hed come up with too many wrong answers from what he knewor maybe if you went and aimed the csa at the usa there werent any right ones c assius yawned he hadnt been on patrol all that long but the antiaircraft fire woke him up ahead of when he would have had to crawl out of the sack anyway he wondered what the hell was going on the confederates hadnt sent any airplanes over madison for quite a while he yawned again and shook his head for all he knew somebodyd got a wild hair up his ass and started shooting at a yankee airplane or maybe at something imaginary you never could tell with something like that anything goin on he asked gracchus when he replaced the other negro at the north end of town more guns an tracers an shit than you can shake a stick at the older man replied i knew that cassius said got me up early see a real airplane though not me gracchus said somethin funny goin on though they wouldntve sent out so many sojers in trucks if there wasnt soldiers cassius echoed gracchus nodded huh cassius said bet youre right then they got somethin all right or they think they do i know what is gonna get me gracchus yawned till his jaw seemed ready to fall off gonna get me some shuteye is what you kin march around the nex few hours an earn your vittles is gone he patted cassius on the back and headed off toward the negro guerrillasthe negro auxiliaries nowcamp all mine cassius thought and then hot damn by now the whites in madison were pretty well cowed they hadnt given any real trouble for several weeks that thought had hardly crossed his mind when he heard somebodys voice in the distance floating through the clear quiet early morning air he started to bark out a challengeit was still before the yankees curfew lifted then he looked north along the highway that led down from athens damned if at least a dozen ofays werent heading his way the rosy light of dawn showed them well enough cassius didnt think they could see him he stood in the deep shadow of some roadside pines he scurried behind one of them challenging that many men when he was by himself didnt seem like a good idea maybe they were yankees in which case a challenge would be pointless if they werent they were trouble that many confederates wouldnt be running around together at daybreak unless they were trouble he waited and watched as they got closer he almost relaxedthey were in uniform and who but us soldiers would be in uniform around here but then he saw that the uniforms were gray and butternut not greengray he wanted to scratch his head but he stood very still instead whoever these people were he didnt want them spotting him one of them carried a better rifle than his and almost all of them had holsters on their belts come on goddammit a rangy middleaged man up near the front of the pack said loudly were almost there that voicecassius knew it instantly anyone in the csa would have anyone black in the csa would have reacted as he did the tredegar leaped to his shoulder he could almost fire over open sightsthe range couldnt have been more than a hundred yards hed never aimed so carefully in all his life take a breath let it out press the triggerdont squeeze get us some motorcars and the rangy man went on as the rifle roared and bucked against cassius shoulder the bullet caught the fellow right in the middle of the chest he got his left foot off the ground for one more step but he never finished it he crumpled and fell instead cassius worked the bolt and fired again as fast as he could jake featherston jerked before his face hit the asphalt while he was lying there cassius put another bullet into him this one made red bits spurt from his head cassius chambered one more round when you were shooting a snake you didnt know for sure what it took to kill him one of the men in butternut knelt by the president of the csa the justrisen sun shone from his spectacles and their steel frames he leaned toward jake featherston cassius could easily have shot him too but waited instead to see what happened next the bespectacled man started to feel for featherstons wrist then shook his head as if to say whats the use when he rose he seemed suddenly old the rest of the confederates might have turned to wax melting in the sun too when cassius saw they slumped and sagged he began to believe jake featherston was deadbegan to believe hed killed him were the tears in his eyes joy or sorrow or both at once afterwards he never knew yall surrender he shouted blurrily and fired another shot over the confederates heads as if on cue gracchus ran up the road from madison four or five white men in greengray pounded after the negro one by one the confederates standing in the roadway raised their hands above their heads the officer with the automatic tredegar carefully set it on the tarmac before he lifted his only then did cassius step out from behind the tree gracchus skidded to a stop beside him who is them ofay shitheads the guerrilla chief panted dunno bigass ol confederates thats all i kin tell you cassius said but i just shot me jake motherfucking featherston thats him on the ground there an hes dead as shoe leather no gracchus whispered the us soldiers heard cassius too they stared north toward the knot of confederates and the corpse in the road then they stared at cassius kid id give my left nut to do what you just done one of them said my right nut said another do you know how famous you just got a third one added it doesnt matter cassius said he killed my whole family the son of a bitch shootings too good for him but its all i could do i heard his voice and i knew who it was and thenbang gracchus set a hand on his shoulder you got that anyways rest of us we dont got nothin he done kilt all our famblies but you kilt him you really an truly did his voice was soft with wonder i sure did cassius sounded amazed too even to himself now i want to see him dead he walked forward his rifle still at the ready in case any of the men ahead tried something he had only one round left in the clip but he wasnt too worried about that not with gracchus and those us soldiers to back him up flies were already starting to buzz above the blood pooling around the corpse in the roadway cassius stirred the body with his foot jake featherstons lean hungry face stared sightlessly up to the sky a fly landed on his cheek it crawled over to the rill of blood that ran from the corner of his open mouth and began to feed well you did it you just sank the confederate states of america the officer with glasses talked like a yankee but he wore a cs uniform with cassius saw a generals wreathed stars on his collar he took off his spectacles and wiped his eyes with his tunic sleeve jake featherston was a son of a bitch but he was a great son of a bitchand you killed him he looked as if he wanted to say more telling off somebody with a tredegar was never a good idea though another man a heavy fellow in a gray party uniform figured that out too he said who wouldve reckoned acolored kid could do in the president the pause meant hed almost said nigger or more likely goddamn nigger but he swallowed anything like that before it got out who the hell are you people anyway one of the us soldiersa sergeantdemanded ferdinand koenig attorney general csa the heavy man answered cassius almost shot him too koenig ran the camps he was jake featherstons enforcer but shooting anybody with his hands up wasnt so easy clarence potter brigadier general csa said the man with glasses christ the sergeant in greengray said youre on our list youre the asshole who blew up philly you know that potter blinked then actually bowed always an honor to be recognized he said cassius found himself surprised into admiration potter had style in a coldblooded way the other confederates gave their names and ranks the only one cassius had heard of was saul goldman whom he thought of as the confederacys chief liar but the rest were all big shots too except for a young captain with a pilots wings on the right breast pocket of his tunic do jesus gracchus said there heres bout whats left o the confederate gummint aint it wheres whatshisname the vice president the us sergeant snapped his fingers partridge in a pear treehim even with their cause in ruins and themselves in captivity several of the confederates smiled at that a couple of them even laughed the vice president isnt with us general potter said if you look under a flat rock youll find a lizard or a salamander or something its bound to be just as smart as don jesus potter show a little respect ferd koenig said hes president now wherever he is only proves were screwed if you ask me potter said calmly three command cars rumbled up from madison probably called by wireless their machine guns added to the us firepower a photographer jumped out of one of them godalmightydamn he said aiming his camera at the corpse in the road that really is the motherfucker aint it he took several pictures then looked up who punched his ticket for him gracchus gave cassius a little shove this fella right here a flashbulb went off in cassius face he saw green and purple spots way to go sonny you just turned famous know that whats your name anyway cassius he answered now two people both white had thrown fame in his face im cassius i dont care nothin about famous only thing i care about is that bastards dead an gone you may not care about famous buddy but famous is gonna care about you the photographer predicted bet your ass it will youre gonna be the most famous smoke in the whole goddamn us of a smoke wasnt exactly an endearment but cassius was too dazed to get very upset about it more command cars and a halftrack came up the road some of the people who got out were soldiers others were reporters when they found out cassius had shot jake featherston they all tried to interview him at once they shouted so many questions he couldnt make sense of any of them some of the reporters started grilling the captured confederates too the prisoners didnt want to talk which seemed to upset the gentlemen of the press cassius kept looking at the body every so often i did that he told himself i really did dont pay these mouthy fools no mind gracchus advised him you dont got to say nothin to em if you dont care to you done somethin instead it wasnt enough if cassius could have killed jake featherston five million or six million or eight million times it might have come close to being enough but hed done all he could do he made himself nod yeah he said n ot far outside of pineville north carolina irving morrell stood up in the cupola of his barrel for what he hoped was the last time in the war sweat ran down his face he was glad to escape the iron oven in which hed ridden north the ceasefire continued to hold with a little luck it would soon turn into something more like a real peace a monument of piled stone two or three times as tall as a man marked the place where james polk had been born since polk was president of the united states before they split into two countries this seemed a good place for the representatives of those two countries to meet close to the monument stood what could only have been a negro sharecroppers cabin it was empty now windows broken door hanging half open if meeting at polks birthplace symbolized something that deserted cabin meant something else altogether where were the blacks whod called it home anywhere on this earth morrell doubted it the sergeant in charge of another us barrel peered up the road toward charlotte with field glasses he waved to morrell here they come sir thanks morrell said a moment later his own mark one eyeball picked up the approaching autos as they got closer he saw that the confederates were scrupulously abiding by the terms of the ceasefire agreement all three motorcars were unarmed the first flew a large white flag from its wireless aerial so did the third the middle auto had two aerials one flew the stars and bars the other the flag of the president of the confederate states morrells barrel was flying the stars and stripes from its antenna that guided the confederates to the proper machine he could have blown them to hell and gone even now when they were giving up the temptation was very real instead he climbed down from the barrel as the confederate motorcars stopped under his guns a confederate officera general morrell sawgot out of the lead motorcar he walked up to morrell and saluted stiffly good day sir he said i recognize you from many photographs my name is northcote cyril northcote after the ah recent unfortunate events i have the dubious privilege of being the senior general staff officer not in captivity morrell returned the salute pleased to meet you general northcote meaning no disrespect to you sir but im afraid i cant say the same northcote answered bleakly well general under the circumstances i dont see how i can take offense at that morrell said yes under the circumstances northcote spoke as if each word pained him the door to the middle cs motorcar opened a younglooking blond man in a sharp gray civilian suit came out general northcote waved to him and he came forward his perfectly shined shoes flashing in the bright sun machinelike northcote said general morrell it is my duty to present to you the president of the csa mr don partridge mr president this is us general irving morrell mr president morrell said formally he did not offer to shake president partridges handhe was under orders from philadelphia to do no such thing partridges hand did start to rise but fell back like a dead thing when he realized no handshake would be forthcoming close up his round face didnt just look young it looked boyish as if none of the past three years of struggle had registered with him or on him at all how was that possible morrell didnt know but it seemed to be general partridge said and managed a nod morrell nodded back he had no orders against that mr president you have come here under the terms of the ceasefire now in place to agree to the unconditional surrender of all forces still under command of the confederate states of america is that correct he sounded like a man speaking from a script and he was president partridge had to work to manage another nod yes thats right he sounded surprised and hurt as if wondering how fateand morrellcould do such a thing to him all right then i have the terms of the surrender here morrell took two copies of the document from his left breast pocket and unfolded them i would like to go over them with you before you sign so no one can say afterwards that there was any misunderstanding is that agreeable to you sir have i got a choice don partridge sounded bleak too only going on with the war morrell answered then i havent got a choice partridge sighed go ahead general we cant fight any more or i wouldnt be here morrell thought that had been true ever since savannah fell if not since atlanta did but jake featherston kept the confederacy going months longer than anybody would have imagined and what he did to philadelphiahe may have killed me yet even if it takes years well it was over now thank god all right here we goarticle one says you surrender unconditionally to the united states all forces on land at sea and in the air who are at this date under confederate control morrell said don partridge nodded thats what im here for under his breath he added what sounded like goddammit morrell pretended not to notice article two says your high command will immediately order all confederate authorities and forces to cease operations on thursday july at hours eastern summer time today at a minute past six the us general went on your forces will hold in place they will hand over weapons and equipment to us local commanders no ship or aircraft is to be scuttled or damaged machinery armaments and apparatus are to be turned over undamaged this specifically includes your superbomb works in lexington is that plain enough for you i understand you partridge said we wont do any damage to them your bombers have already done plenty though make sure you dont use that as an excuse for any sabotage there morrell warned my government is very very serious about that if your people get cute theyll be sorry theyre already sorry the president of the csa said well go along youd better nowarticle three at that same time todayall your camps killing negroes are to cease operations morrell said camp authorities are to make every effort to feed their inmates us supply convoys will reach them as soon as possible camp personnel will surrender to the first us officers who arrive anyone who flees instead of surrendering will be liable to summary executionwell shoot the bastards on sight have you got that ive got it don partridge answered some of them will likely take their chances anyway he was bound to be right there even so morrell went on that brings us to article four your high command will at once issue orders to the appropriate commanders that they obey any commands issued by the us war department and carry them out without argument or comment all communications will be in plain languageno codes agreed by the way he spat it out the word seemed to taste bad in partridges mouth good again morrell left the new and unhappy confederate president what little pride he could article five says that a final political settlement may supersede this surrender that got him a glare when you decide how you want to carve us up youll go ahead and do it you mean partridge said yes morrell thought aloud he said sir im only a soldier i dont have anything to do with that yeah ill pass the buck article six now if your high command or any forces under your control fail to act in accordance with this surrender the war department will take whatever punitive or other action it deems appropriate if you disobey or fail to comply we will deal with you in accordance with the laws and usages of war you won we lost youll do whatever you damn well please don partridge said thats about the size of it sir morrell agreed and if theres any doubt or dispute about what these terms mean the decision of the united states will be final he handed partridge both copies of the instrument of surrender have you got a pen yes partridge took one from an inside pocket he read the terms to make sure they said what morrell claimed they did maybe he wasnt so dumb as people in the usa thought maybe hed been playing possum to make sure jake featherston didnt do unto him as hed done unto willy knight chances were it wouldnt matter now one way or the other biting his lip partridge signed he thrust one copy back at morrell here thank you morrell tried to stay what the diplomats called correct we hate each other but we dont let it show do you have wireless equipment to let you relay the news of the surrender to your commanders so they can issue the appropriate orders you are welcome to use us equipment if you dont i do thank you very much partridge replied so there morrell thought the president of the csa went back to his motorcar morrell watched him talk into a microphone in there morrell made small talk with general northcote till partridge got out again then he asked all taken care of don partridge nodded yes you will have full cooperation from all our officials and now if you will excuse me id like to get back up to charlotte and do what i can to keep things running umim afraid not morrell said pardon me partridge raised a pale eyebrow im afraid not morrell repeated more firmly this time you have surrenderedthe confederate states have surrenderedunconditionally there is no confederate government right now sir there isnt anything not till the united states say there is what does that make me then president partridge demanded my prisoner sir morrell answered hed captured a swarm of prisoners in the course of two wars hed never had one cuss him out with the virtuoso splendor don partridge showed partridge must have listened to his boss a lot by all accounts jake featherston could swear like a muleskinner morrell let partridge have his say why not in the end it made no difference the usa had the firepower and the csa didnt at a minute past six tonight mr president its all over morrell said when partridge finally ran down theyll remember you as the man who made peace theyll remember me as the man who threw in the sponge partridge said or else they wont remember me at all considering how little hed done up till now morrell reflected he might well be right t he confederates in front of lavochkins looters werent giving up without a fight they kept firing even after word came that the confederacy was giving up chester martin stayed deep in his muddy foxhole he was damned if he wanted to get hurt when it didnt mean a thing he just looked at his watch every now and then and waited for to roll around lieutenant boris lavochkin still gave the impression of eating too much raw meat if those assholes fire even one shoteven oneafter surrender time were going to roll on over them and clean them out he shouted we you and your tapeworm martin wondered didnt the lieutenant know he was the only one who still felt like fighting maybe he didnt because he went right on yelling but if he wanted to charge the cs position at hed do it by himself martin would have bet everything he owned on that the second hand spun round and round the minute and hour hands didnt seem to want to move but they did and when came chester martin lit a raleigh and blew out a grateful cloud of smoke son of a bitch he said i made it he still didnt straighten up or show himself for all he knew his watch was a couple of minutes fast then he heard a picket call goddamntheyre coming out the man sounded awed not blasphemous chester decided he could look out men in butternut were coming through the bushes their hands high their eyes either empty or else burning with hate well youve got us one of them said spitting a stream of tobacco juice off to the side and a hell of a git youve got he had a point the confederates were scrawny and filthy and ragged quite a few of them were walking wounded they looked more like hoboes in uniform than soldiers but they could fight through two wars chester had never found any reason to doubt that give em rations boys captain rhodes called its all over now lieutenant lavochkin chester was sure would never have said any such thing once you got up into your fifties you didnt scramble out of a foxhole you emerged with dignity coming into the open with the enemy in sight seemed dangerous wrong unnatural chester remembered that from too he caught the eye of the closest confederate soldiera kid who couldnt have been more than sixteen want some chow he asked much obliged the youngster answered martin tossed him a can as he caught it he said whatll yall do with us now beats me chester said make sure weve got all your weapons i betwe have to take care of that then who knows somebody up topll tell us and well do it whatever it turns out to be you did this before didnt you you coulda fought against my pa too the young confederate said as he used the key to get the lid off the can yeah well we had to lick you people twice chester wondered whether the kid even heard him he was shoveling canned beef stewwhich tasted like tire tread in mud gravyinto his mouth with his dirty fingers it wasnt one of the better us rations but the new pow didnt care not far away captain rhodes was talking with a confederate sergeant with a beer belly and gray stubble the guy could have been a defeated butternut version of martin himselfhe was plainly a retread take me to your demolitions people rhodes was saying we want to make sure we get your explosives under control well ill do it but we dont have a hell of a lot of that stuff left the veteran noncom said cut the shit charlie rhodes told him which was almost exactly the thought going through chesters mind you figure youre gonna squirrel that crap away for people bombs and auto bombs and toys like that you better think twice thats all ive got to say we will take hostageslots of em well shoot em too if theres not a white man left alive from richmond to key west nobody in the usas gonna shed a tear you can take that to the bank the sergeant glared at him with undisguised loathing i believe you you damnyankees are all a bunch of niggerlovers i know one nigger i love right nowthe kid who shot jake featherston captain rhodes answered get it straight sergeant your governments surrendered if it hadnt how long did you have to live a couple of days maybenot much more after that we wouldve flattened you like a steamroller if you fuck with us now we will anyway and you know what else well enjoy doing it too chester stared no that wasnt boris lavochkin with an extra bar on each shoulder strap captain rhodes was usually a pretty mild fellow usually yeah but not always he meant every word of this and the cs sergeant knew it too well come on then he said ill take you to em just dont blame me if they aint got everything you want ill blame somebodythats for damn sure rhodes looked around his eye lit on chester gather up a squad sergeant and come along we may need to do some persuading here sure will sir martin rounded up a dozen men just about all of them with automatic weapons instead of springfields they followed captain rhodes behind what had been the enemy line that was scary especially with the sun sinking in the west if somebody hadnt got the word or just didnt give a damnchester was sure there would be little spasms of fighting for days he didnt want to get stuck in one that was all and he didnt want them to turn into a fullscale rebellion against the us occupiers if they did the usa really might have to kill piles and piles of confederate hostages he didnt look forward to that no matter what captain rhodes said he didnt think it would be fun not all the confederate soldiers had put down their arms yet the men in butternut scowled at the men in greengray nobody did more than scowl though the enemy troops had to know about the surrender even if they didnt like it if we were as big as the united states we wouldve whipped yall a corporal said if pigs had wings wed all carry umbrellas chester answered you soandsos shot me twice thats enough goddammit i dont want your kids trying to shoot my kid the us soldiers walked past a battery of wornlooking s rhodes told off four or five men to take charge of the guns and their ammunition god only knows what a son of a bitch with an imagination can do with an artillery shell he remarked chester could think of a few things all of them unpleasant he was sure real explosives people could come up with a lot more he chatted with the confederate veteran who turned out to have also fought on the roanoke front in the great war yeah that was pretty bad all right the other sergeant said i got hit twicea bullet once a shell fragment in the foot the other time i got it once then and once this time around chester said lucky if you want to call it that shit we both lived through two rounds so we are lucky plenty who didntthats for damn sure the confederate pointed the people your captains looking for are just ahead there as a matter of fact they werenttheyd bugged out but theyd left their stock in trade behind in earthwork revetments roofed with planks and corrugated sheet iron captain rhodes set a guard over the explosives and fuses and blasting caps shaking his head he said how many setups like this are there all over the csa how manyll get emptied out before our guys show up how much trouble is that gonna cost down the line lots quite a few quite a bit chester had no trouble finding answers for questions like that he looked around this wasnt good guerrilla countrytoo flat and too open other places though hearing them talking an armed confederate ambled up to see what was going on his eyes widened jesus he yipped youre damnyankees chester grinned at him nothing gets by you does it he stopped grinning a second later because the confederate soldier aimed a submachine gun at his midsection hold it right there yall are my prisoners oh for christs sake captain rhodes said though chester noted that he kept his hands away from his dont you know your side surrendered my ass the man in butternut said wed never do anything like that go find some of your buddies chester said talk to them we arent bullshitting you man howd we get so far behind your line if we were just sneaking around beats me the enemy soldier gestured with the submachine gun you come with me if youre lyin youll be sorry however you want chester never argued with a man who could kill him lets go i wont even get mad after you find out whats what the other man turned out not even to know jake featherston was dead he no more believed that than he believed his country had surrendered and no doubt to drive chester crazy they couldnt find anybody else in butternut that veteran sergeant had disappearedwith luck to head for a pow camp without it to go off and make trouble at last just as the sun was setting they found another confederate soldier to chesters enormous relief he had got the news fraid the yankees tellin you the truth he said to his countryman its all over were licked son of a bitch bastard chesters erstwhile captor said if that aint the biggest crock o crapwe werent even losing hellothis is south carolina what am i doing here if you guys are winning martin asked the confederate gaped at him as if that had never once crossed his mind chester got the idea not a whole lot of things had crossed the other fellows mind why dont you hand me that piece so my guys dont shoot you for having it reluctantly the soldier in butternut gave him the submachine gun even more reluctantly he raised his hands my pappys gonna whup me when he finds out i quit he said glumly not your fault chester said the whole csa gave up pappy wont care the soldier predicted hell whup me any old way did he fight in the last war chester asked i hope to shit he did then he gave up once himself tell him so like hell listen you dont know pappy as far as chester was concerned that was just as well lets go back to the explosives shed he said i want my captain to know you found out we werent pulling your leg still cant hardly believe it and the president bought a plot the confederate shook his head holy fuckin shit he could cuss as much as he pleased chester had his weapon he remembered the navy guys whod got torpedoed after the ceasefire in the great war thank god he hadnt gone that way himself g eorge enos jr was thinking of his father as the oregon steamed toward the surfaced confederate submarine that bastard of a sub skipper hadnt wanted to quit when the great war ended so hed fired one last spread of torpedoesand little george grew up without a man around this submersible was playing by the rules it had surfaced and broadcast its position by wireless now it was flying a large blue flag in token of surrender men in dark gray uniforms stood on the conning tower and on the deck though nobody went near the deck gun taking on a battlewagon with that little excuse for a weapon was closer to insane than anything else but you never could tell a lieutenant with a bullhorn strode up to the oregons bow ahoy the confederate sub he bawled do you hear me on the sub a fellow in a dirty white officers cap raised a loudhailer to his own lips i hear you he answered what are your instructions have you jettisoned your ammunition yes the confederate answered have you removed the breechblock from your gun done that too are the pistols out of your torpedoes are the torpedoes rendered safe yes weve followed all the surrender orders the enemy officer didnt sound happy about it do you have any mines aboard asked the lieutenant on the oregon nonot a one all right we are going to send an officer and a cpo to inspect your boat before we give you your sailing instructions for baltimore stand by to receive a boarding party very well the confederate skipper said but if the surrender order didnt tell us we had to do exactly what you tell us i would have something different to say to you you would be trying to sink us and we would be dropping depth charges on your head the us lieutenant said things are what they are though not what you wish they were and aint that the sad and sorry truth the sub skipper said we will receive your boarderswe wont repel them that made george think of pigtailed sailors with bandannas and cutlasses and of clouds of blackpowder smoke no more no more the officer who crossed to the submersible was barely old enough to shave the chief might have been his father as far as years went george knew what would happen the ensign would write up the inspection report and the chief would tell him what to say they came back after a couple of hours the ensign was nodding and grinning but george kept his eyes on the cpo when he saw that the senior rating seemed satisfied he relaxed nobody on that sub would give the us navy any more trouble after talking with the ensign and also glancing at the chief the lieutenant picked up his bullhorn again you are cleared to proceed to baltimore keep flying your blue flag by day and show your navigation lights at night understood the cs skipper said as if he hadnt spoken the lieutenant went on remain fully surfaced at all times report your position course and speed every eight hours all wireless transmissions must be in plain language a pilot will take you through the minefields obey any instructions you may receive from us authorities well do it the confederate replied is there anything else mommy or can we go out and play now several us sailors snickered george among them the lieutenant went brick red no further instructions at this time he choked out the cs skipper doffed his cap in sardonic salute then disappeared down the hatch into the submarine it moved off to the northwest in the direction of chesapeake bay the lieutenant was still steaming if i ever run into that son of a bitch on dry land ill punch him in the nose he ground out take an even strain said the chief whod gone aboard the confederate submarine we won they lost let him talk as big as he wantsit doesnt change what really matters no but it makes me look like a jerk all i was doing was making sure he understood the surrender terms we dont want the kind of trouble we had the last time around i should say we dont the cpo looked this way and that till he spotted george heres enos he knows more about that kind of shit than you and me put together his old man was on the ericsson and his mas the gal who went down to the csa and plugged the skunk who put her on the bottom really the lieutenant unlike the chief didnt know george by sight at a quick gesture from the cpo george took half a step away from the twin mm mount the lieutenant said youre sylvia enos son yes sir george was always pleased when somebody remembered his mothers first name i read her book the officer said it was one of the things that made me decide to join the navy i thought i ought to help do things right so people like her didnt have to pick up guns and take care of it themselves yes sir george repeated less enthusiastically this time whenever he thought about i shot roger kimball he couldnt help also thinking about the harddrinking hack who did the actual writing his mother should have known better than to have anything to do with ernie except for the book she should have but she hadnt and so she was dead and so was he and if ernie hadnt shot himself george would gladly have killed him the lieutenant seemed to run out of things to say which might have been a relief for him and george both well carry on enos he said which was strictly lineofduty he hurried back toward the oregons towering bridge george returned to the gun mount some of the men on the gun crew already knew who he was and who his mother had been unlike the lieutenant they also knew better than to make a fuss about it officers one of them said sympathetically yeah well george spread his hands what can you do jack diddly the other sailor said put up with em the best way you can try not to let em fuck you over too bad theyre like women a shelljerker said you cant live with em and you cant live without em neither nope george shook his head if you could get pussy from officers theyd be good for something way things are too many of em are good for nothing three guys on the crew said the same thing at the same time they grinned at one another and at george the banter about what officers would be like if they were equipped the way women were went on and on it got louder and more hilarious and more obscene with each succeeding joke as each sailor tried to top the fellow whod gone before him georges grin stretched wider and wider it wasnt just that the guys were funny everybody was all looseygoosey unless some confederate diehard hadnt got the word nobody would be shooting at the oregon or bombing her or trying to torpedo her theyd made it through the war now all we got to worry about is the crappy cooks in the galley george said see they should be broads too one of the other guys put in then theyd know what they were doin and if they did feed us somethin shitty they could really show us they was sorry somebody else said it went on from there they spotted another surfaced submarine later that day this one flew the union jack not a blue surrender flag like the confederate boat i have no quarrel with you gentlemen the captain called through a loudhailer but i will not go to one of your ports i have received no such orders we have an armistice with germany and you but we have not surrendered we can blow you out of the water warned the us officer with whom he was parleying no doubt the british sub skipper replied politely but we have done nothing provocative and have no intention of doing any such thing are you really so eager to put the war on the boil again muttering the young us officer got on the telephone to the bridge he was muttering louder when he hung up you may proceed he told the royal navy officer thanks ever so the limey actually tipped his cap may we meet againand not in our professional capacities we ought to blow him up anyway the us officer growledbut not through the bullhorn sailors in the british submarine were bound to be thinking the same thing about the oregon as long as the boat stayed surfaced and didnt aim either bow or stern at the battleship george figured he wouldnt flabble if the submarine dove it didnt not till it was out of sight george hoped the oregons yranging set watched it even farther than that since no klaxons hooted he supposed everything stayed hunkydory thinking about women officers was a lot more fun than worrying about getting sunk i bet the limeys never do surrender not the way the confederates did wally fodor said the gun chief went on i bet they just bail out of the fight on the best terms they can same as they did in the last war long as they got their navy in one piece theyre still a going concern till somebody drops a superbomb on their fleet anyway george said yeah but the kaisers got to be sweating about how big japans getting hell so do we fodor persisted the japs dont have the superbomb yet so englands the only one who can give em a hard timeunless we want to go through the pacific one goddamn island at a time nobody at the twin mm mount wanted anything like that george whod already had a long tour in the sandwich islands really didnt want anything like that hed paid all the dues against japan he felt like paying tell you one thing he said all this bullshitting is a lot better than sweating out bombs and torpedoes for real amen that went up from several sailors at once we licked jake featherston and the limeys look like theyve had enough anyway george went on pretty soon well be able to get our old lives back again did he look forward to going after cod from t wharf he wasnt so sure about that but coming home to connie more often sounded mighty good xiv d r leonard odoull donned a professional scowl and glared at the unhappy young pfc standing in front of him thats one of the most disgusting chancres ive ever seen he growled it was red and ugly all right but hed run into plenty just like it the kid didnt have to know that though quivering the pfc said sorry sir he looked as if he was about to cry were you sorry while you were getting it odoull asked uh no sir the youngster in greengray turned red why the hell didnt you wear a rubber on account of i didnt figure i needed to she was a nice girl dammit besides it feels better when youre bareback it did odoull couldnt quarrel about that he could ask and how does it feel now the pfc hung his head odoull went on do you still think she was a nice girl no sir the kid said and then apprehensively what are you going to do to me sir me im going to fix you up thats what odoull raised his voice sergeant lord let me have a vd hypo of penicillin coming up doc goodson lord produced the requisite syringe the pfc stared at it with something not far from horror jeez louise you could give an elephant a shot with that thing elephants dont get syphilis far as i know they dont get the clap either odoull nodded to the kid who wasnt far wrong there eitherit was a big needle bend over most unwillingly the us soldier obeyed shit he muttered i went through the last year and a half of the war i got a purple heart and im more scared of your damn shot than i was of the screaming meemies he wasnt the first man to say something like that with bullets and shells and rockets you could always think theyd miss when somebody aimed a hypodermic at your bare ass hed damn well connect and odoull did the pfc let out a yip as he pressed home the needle and pressed in the plunger you get one on the other side three days from now if you dont show up youre in a lot more trouble than you are for coming down venereal you got that yes sir the kid said miserably can i go now sir he really did want to escape if he was that eager to return to the clutches of his regular superiors odoull couldnt do anything but stick him but they couldand wouldgive him hell still he wasnt quite finished here not yet son you need to tell me the name of the woman you got it from where she lives and the names of any others youve screwed since we dont want em passing it along to any of your buddies you know oh helluh sir do i gotta you sure do vd puts a man out of action just as much as a bullet in the leg does sowho was she and were there any others damn damn damn the pfc said theres just the one anyway her name is betsy and she lives a couple of miles from here on a farm outside of montevallo montevallo was a pissant little town south of birmingham it boasted a small college for women odoull had wondered whether the soldier got his disease from a student with liberal notions evidently not montevallo also boasted a large oak called the hangmans tree which had come through the war undamaged the doctor wondered whether the tree and the college were related the pfc wouldnt know about that though you have a last name for miss betsy odoull asked the soldier shook his head odoull sighed one of the things youll do between now and when i stick your ass again is take some men and get her and bring her back here so we can treat her too got that yes sir it was hardly more than a whisper youd better have it and now you can go odoull said the pfc slunk away odoull sighed boy i enjoyed that i bet sergeant lord said still it beats the crap out of trying to take out a guys spleen doesnt it well yeah odoull admitted but damn weve had a lot of venereals since the shooting stopped he sighed one more time dont know why im so surprised the guys can really go looking for pussy now and the confederate women know theyve lost so theyd better be nice to our troops but i keep thinking about donofrio the medic you replaced vd isnt the only thing that can happen to you you told me about that before lord said so politely that odoull knew hed told him at least once too often the medic went on im not going to make a fuss about any silly bitch down here well good odoull said and wondered if it was would goodson lord make a fuss about a silly boy instead odoull hoped not if the sergeant was queer he seemed to be discreet about it as long as he stayed that way well what the hell betsy came in the next day cussing out the soldiers who brought her in a command car she was about eighteen with a barmaids prettiness that wouldnt last and a barmaids ample flesh that would turn to lard before she hit thirty what do you mean i got some kind of disease she shouted at odoull sorry miss he said private uh eubankshe had to remember the soldiers namesays you left him a little present we can cure you with a couple of shots i bet he didnt catch it from me i bet the dirty son of a bitch got it somewhere else and gave it to me she screeched from the freshness of the us soldiers chancre odoull doubted that out loud he said well you may be right which was one of the useful phrases that werent liable to land you in much trouble it didnt matter one way or the other anyhow im going to need to examine you maybe draw some blood for a test and give you a shot just in case what do you mean examine me examine me there betsy shook her head which made blond curls flip back and forth on either side of her face she would have seemed more alluringto odoull anywayif shed bathed any time lately you aint gonna look up my works pal and thats flat not when i never set eyes on you till just now what kind of girl dyou reckon i am had odoull told the truth there he would have had to listen to more screeching this is a medical necessity he said im a doctor im also a married man in case youre wondering betsy tossed her head in splendid scorn like that makes a difference i know youre just a dumb damnyankee but i didnt think even damnyankees were that dumb odoull sighed it didnt make any difference hed seen as much plenty of times in riviиreduloup he wished he were back there now bettermuch bettersweet nicole than this blowsy foulmouthed gal get up on the table please he said no stirrups im afraid it wasnt made with that in mind stirrups what the hell are you talkin about betsy said and i done told you i dont want to get up there odoulls patience blew out your other choice is the stockade he snapped quit fooling around and wasting my time oh all right goddammit if i gotta betsy climbed onto the table and divested herself of her drawers odoull put on rubber gloves he felt as if he needed them more here than with most of the ordinary war wounds hed treated having fun she asked him as he got to work in a word no he answered so coldly that she not only shut up with a snap but gave him a fierce glare which he ignored he went on youve got it all right you ought to thank your boyfriend for getting you over here not likely she said and added some verbal hot sauce to the comment however you please odoull told her roll over onto your stomach so i can give you your first shot goodson lord ceremoniously handed him a syringe will it hurt she asked a little odoull jabbed the needle home she yipped he didnt care you need to come back in three days for your second injection he told her what happens if i dont betsy sure hadnt said no to pfc eubanksor odds were to a lot of guys before himbut she was cooperating with odoull as little as she could two things odoull said we come and get you and we tell your folks and everybody in montevallo how come we came and got you you wouldnt do that when it comes to getting rid of vd well do whatever it takes dammit this is for your own good then how come it hurts betsy whined if we didnt treat you youd hurt more down the line odoull said actually a lot of syphilis patients didnt have symptoms for years after the primary lesions went away some never did but syphilis was also the great pretender a lot of ills that seemed to be other things really went back to the spirochete that caused it if you could get rid of the germ you needed to might as well get used to it doc sergeant lord advised this is what well see from here on outguys with drippy faucets guys in auto crashes every once in a while a guy who steps on a mine or something could be worse odoull said long as we dont start having lots of guys who guerrillas shot i wont kick amen to that the medic said can i go now betsy asked much as her boyfriend in greengray had yes you can go odoull answered if you dont come back for your next shot remember well make you sorry you didnt i wont forget she said sullenly my pa hell kill me if he finds out by the way she scurried away from the aid tent she meant that literally wonder how many roundheeled broads well give the needle to lord said quite a few i bet odoull said and if its going to be that kind of practice you can handle it as well as i can he was thinking about home again he wasnt a career soldier he had a life away from the army he had it and he wanted to go back to it goodson lord gave him a shrewd look wont be too long before they start figuring out how to turn people loose i bet you paid your dues and then some yeah odoull nodded and once i get back into the republic of quebec theyll never pry me out again there had been times when his practice in riviиreduloup bored him he hadnt been bored the past three years scared out of his mind astonished appalled all of those and often but never bored he was amazed at how wonderful ennui seemed a bner dowling stared at lexington virginia with nothing less than amazement he turned to his adjutant and said damned if it doesnt look like they used a superbomb on this place lieutenant colonel toricelli nodded yes sir the fun we had getting here should have given us a hint i suppose fun heh thats one word for it i guess dowling said as the crow flew lexington was only about miles from richmond dowling wished hed flown from the capitalthe former capitalof the csa hed gone by command car instead and the roads were disastrously badwhich said nothing about the wrecked bridges and the places where mines were still being cleared what might have been a twoandahalfhour drive ended up taking a day and a half something moved in the rubble at first he thought it was a stray dog then he realized what it really was a possum it looked like a catsized rat that had got its nose stuck in a pencil sharpener the long bare pinkish tail seemed vaguely obscene lieutenant colonel toricelli was looking in the same direction if thats not the ugliest thing god ever made damned if i know what is he said now that jake featherstons dead i agree with you dowling said which jerked a laugh from the younger man washington university lay on the north side of town us soldiers whod come down from the north right after the surrender were already thick on the ground there the only way you could tell the university grounds from the rest of lexington these days was that theyd taken an even heavier pounding from the skies it didnt do enough dammit dowling thought in spite of everything that came down on their heads the confederate physicists managed to put together a superbomb abstractly dowling admired the achievement staying abstract when theyd blown a big chunk of philadelphia off the map wasnt so easy though the surviving physicists were housed in tents surrounded by barbed wire and machinegun nests a us colonel named benjamin frankheimer was in charge of them before he let dowling in to talk with the prisoners he checked with the war department werent you told to expect me dowling asked yes sir frankheimer replied but we havent met and i wanted to make sure they confirmed that a man of your description went with your name yourea careful man colonel taking care of people who know this kind of stuff i need to be sir frankheimer scratched his nose it was much the most prominent feature on his face he was little and skinny and looked very very jewish dowling guessed hed got this job because he was a scientist himselftill he noticed the fruit salad on the colonels chest it showed hed won a distinguished service cross a silver star with oakleaf cluster and a purple heart with oakleaf cluster frankheimer had had himself a busy war well dowling said am i who i say i am oh yes sir no doubt about it frankheimer answered youre free to go in and do whatever you need to donow thanks dowling sounded less sarcastic than he might have the men inside this heavily guarded compound werent just dynamitethey were a hell of a lot more explosive than that and theyd proved it he wasnt astonished when he and lieutenant colonel toricelli had to surrender their sidearms before going in either he didnt think of physicists as tough guys but you never knew if the fellows with the white lab coats and the slide rules didnt have the chance to grab any weapons they wouldnt be tempted the first man he saw inside the compound sure didnt look like a tough guy the fellow was about fifty on the skinny side and walked with a limp and a cane can you tell me where professor fitzbelmont is dowling called to him that tent there the middleaged man pointed thanks dowling ducked inside he recognized fitzbelmont right away the photos hed studied were good likenesses tall tweedy bespectacled he looked like a physicist all right he gave dowling a grudging nod pleased to meet you he said and then ive already met a lot of us officersso he probably wasnt very pleased come outside with me professor dowling said weve got some talking to do if you like fitzbelmont said but anything you say to me my colleagues can also hear what are you going to do with us anyway well thats one of the things im here to talk about dowling answered more than a few people in philadelphia who want to string you up by the thumbs paint you with gasoline and light a match then there are the ones who think thats too good for you some of the scientists and technicians in there with fitzbelmont flinched he didnt i dont understand why he said we were serving our country in the same way that your scientists were serving the united states if your service is permitted even heroic why shouldnt ours be as well he had a scientists detachmentor maybe he was just a naturalborn cold fish there is a difference professor dowling said i fail to see it henderson fitzbelmont said why am i not surprised lieutenant colonel toricelli murmured hush dowling said and then to fitzbelmont its simple ill spell it out for you we won you lost there is that plain enough to the victors go the spoils fitzbelmont said is that what this war was about thats part of it if you dont believe me ask jake featherston dowling answered fitzbelmont turned red so maybe at one point or another he had asked the late unlamented president of the csa dowling continued the other part is now you cant go on murdering your own smokes any more fitzbelmont got redder i didnt know anything about that i ought to kick your scrawny ass for lying you miserable son of a bitch dowling said with weary revulsion if i had a dime for every confederate shithead who told me the same thing id be too rich to wear this uniformyoud best believe i would where the hell did you think all the coons in fucking lexington disappeared to you think somebody swept em under the goddamn rug i never even considered the issue professor fitzbelmont said dowling almost did haul off and belt him but the way fitzbelmont said it gave him pause unlike most of his countrymen the physicist might have been telling the truth from the reports the usa had on fitzbelmont he had trouble noticing anything bigger than an atomic nucleus how many millions did they do in angelo dowling asked best guess right now is about eight million sir his adjutant replied but that could be off a million either way easy and you never considered the issue dowling tried to wither henderson fitzbelmont with his scorn im afraid not fitzbelmont said unwithered we had no negroes at all involved in the project even our cooks and janitors were whites or mexicans negroes were deemed to be security risks and so we did not see them its as simple as that im afraid the confederates had good reason to think negroes might be security risks blacks had brought the usa lots of good intelligence data dowling didnt know how much in the way of physics a cook or janitor could understand understand it or not anybody could steal papers though which reminded him under the terms of the surrender youre supposed to keep all your paperwork intact youve done that what survives of it yes certainly whats that mean dowling demanded you ought to know professor fitzbelmont said your airplanes have been bombing lexington for the past year do you think you didnt do any damage youd better think again huh dowling said the confederate physicist had a better excuse than the dog ate my homework he and his pals could have destroyed anything and then blamed it on us bombers dowling didnt know what he could do about it either it is possible for you to expect too much of us you know fitzbelmont said maybe im not the expert dowling agreed but you will be interrogated by people who are expertsi promise you that even if your paperwork is gone theyll figure out what you were up to and yes youre obliged to cooperate with them if we dont the physicist asked dowling made handwashing motions god help you in that case you can bet your bottom dollar nobody else will you have an unpleasant way of making your point professor fitzbelmont said thank you dowling answered which stopped fitzbelmont in his tracks after a moment the physicist asked when will they let us go beats me dowling answered cheerfully suppose youd won when would you have let our superbomb people go ever idont know the confederate scientist said slowly that at least struck dowling as basically truthful henderson fitzbelmont went on surely you understand that we cant be dangerous to the united states without facilities like the ones we had here you cant make a superbomb with a blackboard and chalk i dont know anything about that its not my call to make anyhow dowling said my job is to make sure youre here to make sure youre well protected and to put you at the disposal of our scientists when they get around to needing you im taking care of that right now how about making sure were well treated fitzbelmont asked believe me professor you are dowling said you have shelter you have enough to eat you have a doctor and a dentist when you need one compared to the average white man in the csa these days youre in hog heaven compared to the average negro in the csahell youre alive that puts you ahead of the game right there professor fitzbelmont looked severe if thats a joke general its in poor taste whos joking dowling said youre the one who didnt look at what was going on with your negroes you say were going to hang some of the bastards who did that to them crimes against humanity were calling it considering what happened in philadelphia you ought to thank your lucky stars we arent charging you with the same thingyet how could you do that when your own scientists built the bombs that blew up newport news and charleston where is the justice there dowling shook his head fitzbelmont really didnt get it how much justice would you have given our guys if you won as much as you gave your own smokes we dont need justice professori told you that once already we may use it but we dont need it we damn well won c olonel roy wyden eyed jonathan moss with what looked like real sympathy what are we going to do with you wyden asked beats me sir moss answered not much call for a fighter jockey any more is there especially one whos my age i mean im sorry but there isnt wyden said your file shows you werent in the military straight through what did you do between the wars im a lawyer sir wyden brightened well hell youll make more money after you muster out than youre pulling down now moss laughed harshly it aint necessarily so my specialty was occupation law for one thing the canadian uprisings still going for another theyll change all the rules once they finally do knock it flat and for another i dont want to go back to it anyway a terrorist blew up my wife and my daughter maybe the bomb was meant for mei dont know but thats the big reason i rejoined so i dont really have anywhere else to go jesus i guess you dont im sorry i didnt know your story wyden said not like im the only one whos had the roof fall in on him moss said ill land on my feet one way or another if you think you will chances are youre right wyden said let me make a few telephone calls for you see if i can line something up what have you got in mind moss asked i dont want to tell you yet in case it doesnt pan out wyden answered are you willing to give me a couple of days to see if it will sure why not moss managed a wry grin it isnt like ive got a hell of a lot of other stuff going on he left colonel wydens tent more intrigued than hed thought he would be wyden didnt summon him back for three days when he did he came straight to the point how would you like to go to the republic of texas to do what moss inquired theyre going to try the bastards who ran camp determination and then camp humble wyden answered theyve got guys lined up from here out the door to prosecute them but their number one defense lawyer a guy named izzy goldstein was in an auto wreck last week hes in the hospital pretty torn upno way hell be able to fill that slot now so theyre looking for a legal eagle are you game moss whistled softly i dont know i mean i think those guys are guilty as shit dont you of course i do wyden answered youre the lawyer though dont guilty people deserve to have somebody on their side too that was a commonplace argument in law school moss had always believed it there hed acted on it too when he was doing occupation law up in canada a lot of his clients there werent guilty of anything worse than falling foul of us occupation procedures thisthis was a different story only thing worse would be defending jake featherston himself funny you should mention that wyden answered the people i talked to said they were gonna shoot him without trial if they caught him that colored kid just took care of it for them thats all look you dont have to do this if you cant stomach it im not giving you orders or anythingi wouldnt not for this kind of thing but you were at loose ends and its military justice so youre qualified you know what i mean your call one of the guys there remembers you from canada he said you were a son of a bitch but you were a smart son of a bitch from a military prosecutor thats a complimenti guess moss said colonel wyden grinned and waited moss lit a raleigh to help himself think damn he muttered sucking in smoke he blew it out in what was at least half a sigh tell you what why dont i go over there and talk to one of those assholes if i decide to take it on i will if i donti wont thats all the army couldnt put much pressure on him if it did hed damn well resign his commission then hed have to figure out what to do with the rest of his life as a civilian that was all roy wyden nodded sounds fair enough if you do tackle it youll be doing them a favor not the other way around ill cut you orders for transit to houstonthe city not the state thats gonna confuse the crap out of people for a while and so jonathan moss found himself riding a train across alabama mississippi and louisiana it was perhaps the most surreal journey of his life he passed through the part of the confederacy that the united states hadnt occupied during the war not many soldiers in greengray had entered that part of the country yet it felt very much like going into enemy territory the confederate states still felt like a going concern there too the stars and bars flew from flagpoles soldiers in butternut still carried weapons nobody gave him any trouble though for which he was duly grateful his train had an hours layover in hattiesburg mississippi he got out to stretch his legs and grab a sandwich and a dr hopperhed spent enough time in the csa to get used to the stuff when he came back to the platform he found three or four confederate soldiers facing off with a squad of men in greengray whod just got off a truck plainly the us troops were there to let the town know things really had changed and the surrender was no joke just as plainly the cs soldiers didnt want to believe it well hell one of them said yall may have whupped those sorry bastards back east but you never licked us his pals nodded as if by magic all the us soldiers brought up their weapons at the same time their sergeant stepped forward and shoved the mouthy confederate to the floor he kicked him in the ribsprobably not hard enough to break any but not with any token little thump either how about now fucker he asked have we licked you yet or do we have to blow your goddamn head off to get the message across talk fast or youre dead meat reckonmaybeim licked the man in butternut wheezed bet your sweet ass you are the sergeant kicked him again then stepped back get it straightyou fuck with us we make you sorry you tried on account of wed sooner kill you than look at you as long as us forces felt that way moss judged they at least had a chance of staying ahead of any confederate insurgency the soldier in butternut struggled to his feet his buddies helped him get away from the men in greengray all the new occupiers looked ready to spray bullets around the train station they grinned at moss we showed him one of them crowed you bet moss replied and their grins got wider what would they say if they found out he was heading west to see if he wanted to defend the confederate officers who ran a murder factory nothing he wanted to hearhe was sure of that and so he didnt tell them when he passed from louisiana to texas the lone star flag replaced the stars and bars he wondered how long the united states would go on letting the texans pretend they were independent recognizing their secession from the csa had been a useful way to get them out of the war but he didnt think it was likely to last a texas ranger stood on the platform holding a small cardboard sign with his name on it when moss admitted who he was the texanwho was short and wiry going dead against the image the men of his state liked to put acrosssaid im here to take you to the city jail sir then lets go moss answered the ranger didnt have much to say houston seemed almost intact not many confederate cities were farther from us bomber bases people on the street wore old shabby clothes but they didnt look hungry how do you feel about working with the united states moss asked when the autoa confederate birminghamstopped in front of the redbrick fortress that housed prisoners sir where we were at it looked like the best thing to do with that less than ringing endorsement the texas ranger killed the engine he hopped out and held the door open for moss us officers meticulously checked moss id and then patted him down before admitting him to the building he got checked and searched again when he went into the visitors room a tight steel mesh separated his side from that of the man he might be representing in came jefferson pinkard the fellow whod run camp determination and camp humble was about moss age he had a big burly frame muscles with a lot of fat over them he looked tough but not vicious moss knew how little that proved but found it interesting all the same pinkard was giving him the onceover too so the damnyankees found another bastard willing to speak up for me he asked in a deepsouth drawl i dont know that i am yet moss answered why did you want to kill off as many negroes as you could had pinkard denied it moss would have walked out he didnt though he said because they were enemies of my country they were shooting at us before we started fighting you yankee bastards men women and children moss said theyre black they dont like us pinkard said sides what business of yours is it anyway they were confederate niggers we can do what we damn well please in our own country far as i know we didnt do anything to coons from the usa as far as moss knew that was true he thought it was pinkards strongest argument a country was sovereign inside its own borders wasnt it nobody had gone after the ottoman sultan for what he did to the armenians or the tsar for pogroms against jewsor the united states for what they did to their indians butnobody ever made camps like yours nobody ever thought to jefferson pinkard didnt sound repentanthe sounded proud fuck you assholes are gonna hang me you won and i cant do shit about it but the only thing i was doing was i was doing my job i did it goddamn well too i read that the mayor of snyder killed himself after he got a look at the mass graves your camp had there moss said some people are soft pinkard said scornfully yeah we lost the war but well never have to worry about niggers down here not the way we did before hell you can even ask these chickenshit texas traitorstheyll tell you im all right in their book i helped clean out texas along with the rest of the csa you can defend me or not however you please i know what i did and im damned if im sorry youre damned all right moss thought did guilty people really and truly need lawyers just like anybody else did he want to be one of them there were all kinds of ways to go down in history was this the one he really had in mind if he didnt do it who would whoever it was would the fellow do as good a job as moss would himself he had to doubt it especially with the armys chief defense lawyer already down for the count he didnt believe anybody could get pinkard off but hed always enjoyed giving military prosecutors a run for their money in the end thatand being at loose ends as a pilot with the war overdecided him do you want me to defend you ill give it my best shot dyou reckon you can get me loose pinkard asked or was i right the first time long odds against you mighty long anybody who tells you different is lying too just so you know the camp commandant grunted fuck it looked that way to me too and to that goldstein guy but i was hoping maybe you saw it different but shit even if you dont colonel moss im mighty glad to have you do whatever the hell you can and see if you can embarrass em before they put a noose around my neck he didnt have unreasonable expectations anyhow which was the start of being a good client i think weve got ourselves a deal jonathan moss said because of the wire screen they couldnt even shake on it a lot of the confederate officers at camp liberty sank into despair when they finally believed their country had surrendered most of the ones who took the surrender hardest had been in there longest they hadnt seen the disasters of the past year and a half with their own eyes jerry dover had he knew damn well that the confederate states were licked yeah we lost hed say whenever somebody asked him about itor sometimes even when nobody did why dont you softpedal the doom and gloom dover colonel kirby smith telford asked him the senior cs officer was convinced dover wasnt a yankee plant which didnt mean he was happy with him people already feel bad enough without you rubbing it in christ on a crutch its over were licked dover said how can it be doom and gloom after were doomed keeping our chins up means we can respect ourselves telford answered it makes us forces respect us more too that last might even have been true it left dover no happier what difference does it make he demanded we dont even have a country any more the united states are occupying the whole csa far as i can see that turns us into damnyankees my ass telford said ill see them in hell before i bow down and worship the goddamn stars and stripes yes sir i feel the same way dover said only problem is as long as we feel that way why should the yankees let us out of this place why because the wars over dammit thats why but not even kirby smith telford could make himself sound as if he thought that was reason enough the us authorities showed no signs of letting their commissioned pows go free after a few days colonel telford asked them why not the answer he got left him scowling they say theyre investigating to see if they need to charge any of us with this crimes against humanity crap he reported jerry dover didnt like the sound of that it struck him as being vague enough to let the united states do whatever they pleased what exactly do they mean by that he asked well what they were mostly talking about with me was finding out whether we ever gave niggers up to the people who shipped em off to the camps telford answered oh dover relaxed about the most hideous thing hed done as a quartermaster officer was send gas shells up to the front since the damnyankees had used gas themselves they couldnt very well get their bowels in an uproar about itunless they felt like getting their bowels in an uproar if they did who was going to stop them nobody this side of the kaiser that was who someone said they cant treat us this way so maybe he thought he was the kaiser or else somebody even more important kirby smith telford looked bleak and sounded bleaker not much we can do about it not anything we can do about it far as i know if they decide to line us up and shoot us whos going to complain to them it aint right the other confederate officer said telford only shrugged whod complained when the confederacy got rid of its negroes dover knew he hadnt he also knew his fellow officers wouldnt appreciate his pointing that out sometimes the smartest thing you could do was just keep your big mouth shut dover a man who liked to yell at people had been a long time learning that he had the lesson now though one by one the officers in his barracks hall got summoned to their interrogations a few left camp liberty not much later the rest stayed where they were fuming and cursing their damnyankee captors dover wondered how smart the victors were if these pows hadnt been embittered yankeehaters who would do anything they could to hurt the usa once they finally got free they were more likely to turn into men with views like that the longer they sat and stewed of course maybe the us authorities didnt intend to let them go at all dover imagined stooped whitehaired pows dying of old age as the twentieth century passed into the twentyfirst he shivered not even the yankees could stay vengeful for upwards of half a centurycould they they seemed to be questioning prisoners in roughly the order the confederates had been captured that meant jerry dover had quite a while to wait he was perfectly willing to be patient kirby smith telford came back from his grilling hot enough to cook over im a special case the sons of bitches say he rasped how come dover asked you were just a combat soldier right why are they flabbling about you then on account of im from texas thats why telford answered from the goddamn traitor republic of texas now if im gonna get outa here i have to swear to be loyal to a countryhe made as if to spit at the very ideathat betrayed the country i grew up in you could just ask them to ship you back to some other part of the csa dover said i tried that it only made things worse telford said bleakly they reckoned i said that because i wanted to raise trouble for them i didnt mean it that waynot then i didnt but jesus god if i get out of here now he didnt say what he would do then what he didnt say nobody could report to the authorities dover didnt have much trouble figuring it out though probably should have done whatever they told you to do and then gone on about your business afterwards he said yeah i figured that out too only not quick enough to do me any goddamn good kirby smith telford sounded almost as disgusted at himself as he did at his yankee interrogators dovers turn came about a week later on a summer day as hot and sticky as any in savannah the officer who questioned him was a major about half his age a fellow named hendrickson he had a manila folder with dovers name on it it was fat with papers dover wondered whether that was a good sign or a bad one you were in the quartermaster corps major hendrickson said he had a prissy little hairline mustache that didnt go with the shape of his face i sure was dover said you were taken outside of huntsville thats right you fought in the great war but youre not career military right again this ground seemed safe enough hendrickson lit a cigarettea nasty us brand he didnt offer one to dover instead he went through some of the papers in the folder tell me what you did between the wars i managed a restaurant in savannah georgia dover replied hendrickson asked him for the name of the place the huntsmans lodge dover said wondering why that could possibly matter it seemed to major hendrickson grunted and checked something off dover tried to see what it was but he couldnt read upside down well enough to tell the interrogator went on did you employ negroes in this restaurant yeah dover said cooks and waiters and cleanup crew couldnt hardly get along without em we dont seem to have any trouble hendrickson said primly dover only shrugged he didnt care how damnyankees ran their eateries the interrogator riffled through his papers some more was one of these negroes a man named uh xerxes he botched the name so dover almost didnt recognize it xerxes he said it the right way as if the first x was a z yeah he worked for me for years hell of a smart guy probably wouldve been a lawyer or a congressman if he was white but how the devil did you know that annoyingly hendrickson answered a question with another question do you remember his sons name have to think about thati only met him a couple of times he wascassius how come before the yankee major answered dovers jaw dropped sweet suffering jesus not that cassius the us wireless wouldnt shut up about the negro whod shot jake featherston major hendrickson nodded the very same and it just so happened your name came up a couplethree times when we questioned him oh yeah dover had never imagined his fate could rest on a black manshell on a black kidsword whatd he have to say before answering hendrickson shuffled papers even though he had to know already dover wanted to clout him but made himself sit tight he said you treated his old man pretty decent said you saved his whole family from a cleanout once is that a fact yeah dover didnt want to make a big deal out of it now hed saved scipio and his familyand several other colored workers and theirsas much to keep the huntsmans lodge going as for any other reason but this us soldier didnt need to know that what about it well it means you arent real likely to be a hardcore freedom party man hendrickson said will you swear an oath to live peacefully in georgia and not to cause trouble for the united states if we let you go major i have lived through two wars now i have had enough trouble to last me the rest of my days dover said read me out your oath i will swear to it and i will live up to it raise your right hand hendrickson said dover did the oath was what the us soldier said it was dover repeated it swore to it and then signed a printed copy in triplicate show one copy to us military authorities on request hendrickson told him we will give you the balance of your back pay and a train ticket to augusta you can wear your uniform but take off your rank badges before you leave the camp the cs army is out of business kirby smith telford scowled at dover as he packed a meager duffel and took the stars off his collar other pows eyed him with varying mixtures of envy and hatred he didnt care he was going home a young captain looked at cincinnatus from across a nodoubtliberated card table that did duty for a desk you are cincinnatus driver he said yes sir i sure am cincinnatus agreed you have been serving as a civilian truck driver attached to the us army since the end of the captain said thats right too did the same thing in the las war cincinnatus said yesso your records indicate according to your superiors you always performed your duties well in spite of your physical limitations always done the best i could cincinnatus answered i had to stick around when it got tightcouldnt hardly run youre probably eager to return to your family in uh des moinesthe captain had to check cincinnatus papers before naming his home townnow that we have achieved victory cincinnatus nodded sure am you know anybody who aint to his surprise the officer took the question seriously there are always some who are more comfortable in the army they dont have to think for themselves herethey just have to do as theyre told and they never have any doubts about whos on their side and who isnt the young officer was probably right no he was bound to be right hadnt thought of it that way sir cincinnatus said but me im a big boy i can take care of myself and i can make up my own mind and if the governments ready to muster me out im real ready to go home thats what youre here to arrange the captain said i have your final pay warrant here and i have a train ticket to get you home ask you a favor sir i dont know what is it can you arrange my train route to take me through covington kentucky i was born and raised there and i want to see if any of my people in the colored quarter came through in one piece its irregular its an extra expense the officer in greengray frowned considering let me talk to my superiors you may have to stay in alabama an extra day or two while we set things upif they approve that is i dont mind cincinnatus said not even a little bit he stayed an extra three days in fact the rest of the drivers in his unit headed for home long before he did hal williamson shook his hand and said good luck to you buddy goddamn if i didnt learn something from you whats that cincinnatus asked colored guysyoure just like anybody else only darker hal answered cincinnatus laughed shit ill take that good luck to you too man he got the travel orders he wanted back in confederate days he would have had to ride in a separate car no more some white passengers looked unhappy at sharing a row with him but nobody said anything that suited him well enough he didnt ask to be loved only tolerated the stars and stripes flew over covington a blue x that stood for the cs battle flag showed up on walls all over town so did the word freedom the csa had lost the war but not everybody had given up buses were running he took one east from the train station to the colored quarter by the licking river or what was left of it he sat up near the front of the bus the first time hed been able to do that here regardless of whether covington flew the stars and stripes or stars and bars not all the fences and barbed wire that sealed off the colored quarter had come down yet but ways through the stuff were open now cincinnatus got off the bus a couple of blocks from lucullus woods barbecue place if anyone had come through what the confederates did to their negroes he would have bet on the red barbecue cook houses and shops stood empty windows had broken panes doors sagged open leaves drifted on lawns ice shivered up cincinnatus spine what was that fancy word people used when they talked about dinosaurs this place was extinct a stray cat darted across the street and behind some untrimmed bushes cats could take care of themselves without people cincinnatus didnt hear any barking dogs he should have if the colored quarter had any life left to it when he saw somebody else on the street he jumped in surprise and alarm it was an old white man in a cool linen suit his white hair shining under his panama hat the white man seemed as startled to spot a negro as cincinnatus was to see him then all of a sudden he wasnt i might have known it would be you he said youre tougher to kill than a cockroach arent you go to hell bliss cincinnatus said wearily lucullus still alive his place looks as dead as the rest of this part of town luther bliss answered the longtime head of the kentucky state police sighed i tried to get him out once they closed off the colored quarter but i couldnt do it dont know what happened to him but im afraid its nothing good damn shame they go and kill everybody cincinnatus asked they really go an do that just about bliss said and you were in bed with em for a while doesnt that make you proud fuck off and die cincinnatus said coldly i was never in bed with the goddamn freedom party and you know it luther bliss spat maybe i never knew anything about you for sure though thats how come i never trusted you cincinnatus laughed in his face dont give me that shit you never trusted your own grandma if youd known the old bat you wouldntve trusted her either she was an evil woman nothing fazed bliss his mournful hounddog eyes pierced cincinnatus so you drove a truck did you keepin tabs on me damn straight i was bliss replied you deserve it but things are all over now the united states won and if we kill enough confederates to keep the rest quiet well do all right he waited cincinnatus laughed again what you reckon im gonna argue with you we better kill a lot of them bastards otherwise theyll be killin us too damn soon well we agree about something anyway luther bliss said i hope to god i never see you again you gave me too much to worry aboutmore than lucullus even he was smarter than you but i always knew where he stood with you i had to wonder you son of a bitch cincinnatus said you kept me in jail for two years wasnt for that darrow ofay you never woulda let me out i still say i was doing the usa a favor by keeping you in nothing would ever make bliss back up or admit he might have been wrong either the two men warily sidled past each other cincinnatus went on toward the barbecue shack he didnt trust bliss word about anythinghe had to see with his own eyes but the secret policeman wasnt lying here the place lucullus had taken over from his father sat quiet and deserted oh the building still stood but piles of dead leaves and broken windows said no one had come here for a long time even the wonderful smell that had always wafted from the shack was gone you could gain weight just from that smell no more dammit nothing in covington would ever be the same sighing cincinnatus walked on to the house his father and mother had shared till she passed away hed lived there himself getting over his accident helping to take care of her as she slid deeper into senility and then simply trapped in covington the house was still standing too cincinnatus supposed his father still owned it even with a shell hole in the front yard and a little shrapnel damage it was bound to be worth something who would want to buy a house in the colored district though how many negroes would want to live here even with covington passed back to the usa how many negroes were left to live in covington and all the other towns that had flown the stars and bars not enough nowhere close to enough would whites eventually settle in this part of town too or would they tear everything down and try to pretend negroes had never been a part of life south of the masondixon line and the ohio cincinnatus couldnt know which but he sure knew which way hed bet sore and sad he walked on through the almostdeserted quarter instead of heading back to the bus stop and the train ride on to his family his feet knew where he was going better than his head did before long he found himself in front of the brass monkey hed drowned a lot of sorrows in that bar while he was stuck here he almost jumped out of his shoes when a voice floated out through the door cmon in were open do jesus cincinnatus walked inside there was no electricity so his eyes needed a little while to adjust to the dimness a black man sat at the bar nursing a whiskey another one stood behind it fanning himself it was the same bartender whod been there before didnt reckon id see you alive cincinnatus remarked i could say the same thing about you the man answered when the police done took you away i reckoned you was dead meat i was on a list cincinnatus said figured you was thats why they took you away no a different kind o list they went an exchanged me an my pa fo a couple of confederates who got stuck up in the usa lucky the bartender observed yeah i reckon cincinnatus said howd you get by me i was lucky a different kind o way the bartender fanned harder and didnt go on the black man at the bar said cambyses he done the butternut bastards enough favors they didnt take him off to no camp shut your mouth the bartender squawked indignantly shit dont make no difference now the other man said me i done the same damn thing i aint what you call real proud o myself but i aint dead neither an a hell of a lot o folks is cincinnatus had been about to buy himself a drinkhe could have used one instead he turned around and walked out had those two negroes survived by ratting on their fellows hed always wondered about cambyses and he seemed to have been right to wonder had they bought their lives at too high a price they wouldnt say so as for cincinnatus he was mostly surprised the confederates had let them live maybe the whites just hadnt had time to kill them before covington fell how many negroes down here had made the same devils bargain to survive he was heading back to des moines back to the usa he thanked god he wouldnt have to find out w ith a wheeze that said it might not get much farther the train stopped at the little station in baroyeca jorge rodriguez wore his butternut uniform shorn of his stripes and all confederate insignia it was all the clothing he had hed been living on the ration cans the yankees gave him when they let him out of the pow camp if he never ate anything that came from a tin can again he wouldnt be sorry he was even sick of the famous deviled ham enough was enough and then some jorge was the only one who got off at baroyeca there on the platform stood his mother his brother pedro and his sister susana and two of her little children jorge hugged everybody and kissed everybody and slapped pedro on the back his older brother had been a pow much longer than he had do you know when miguel is getting home jorge asked their other brother had been captured too and wounded as well pedro shook his head i havent heard anything one of these days thats all soon god please their mother crossed herself when jorge saw the alcaldes house he saw the stars and stripes flying above it even here he said in dismay even here pedro agreed we lost you can get into big trouble if you show the confederate flag all we can do is what the yankees tell usfor now he sounded as if he was ready to pick up the fight again if he ever saw the chance jorge wasnt so sure hed seen a lot more war than his brother hadenough to satisfy him for a long long time if not forever as long as you could live your life how much difference did it really make which flag flew over the alcaldes house there was freedom party headquarters where his father spent so much time it stood empty deserted what happened to seсor quinn jorge asked he went off to war himself when things got hard and they started calling in older men his mother answered after that nobody here knows he hasnt come backi know that maybe he will jorge said who could guess how long all the confederate soldiers would need to come home especially if they lived in outoftheway places like baroyeca maybe robert quinn lay in a us hospital maybe he was still in a camp as the war ran down and surrender finally came the yankees took prisoners by the tens maybe by the hundreds of thousands lets go home his mother said actually what she said was vamos a casa she mixed english and spanish indiscriminately most people her age did jorge and pedro smiled at each other theyd used more english even when they lived here since going into the army the only time jorge had spoken any spanish was when he ran into another soldier from sonora or chihuahua even then he and the other man would mostly speak english so their buddies from the rest of the csa wouldnt tab them for a couple of dumb greasers home was a threemile walk jorge carried his little nephew part of the way after a sixtypound pack and a rifle on his back juanito didnt seem to weigh much it was hot but jorge was used to heat the air was dry anyhow he wouldnt have to wring himself out when he got to the farmhouse better weather than farther east he said and pedro nodded a blackheaded magpiejay sat on a power line and screeched at the people walking by below jays in the rest of the csa were smaller with shorter tails they didnt sound the samebut they did sound like cousins when he got to the farmhouse it seemed smaller than he remembered it also seemed plainer and poorer he hadnt thought anything of the way he lived before he went into the army people who lived around baroyeca either scratched out a livelihood from farms like this one or went into the mines and grubbed lead and silvernever quite enough silverout of the ground by local standards his family was well off they had running water and electricity though they hadnt when jorge was younger theyd talked about getting a motorcar jorge had needed to go up into the rest of the csa the part where everyone spoke english all the time to realize how much hed grown up without if nobody around you had it though you didnt miss it like old times having two of my sons home and the third one on the way his mother was invincibly optimistic he thought so anyhow till her face clouded and she went on if only your father were here to see it sн jorge said nobody seemed to want to say any more than that hipolito rodriguezs death so far from all his family would cast a shadow over them for the rest of their lives why had he shot himself hed been doing work he thought the country needed and doing it for his army buddy from the last war what could have gone wrong it was almost as if hed listened to yankee propaganda about the camps and that even before there was much yankee propaganda if mallates were people like anybody else then putting them in those camps was wrong if no matter what the damnyankees said jorge had trouble believing it most confederate citizens would his father would havehe was sure of that could something he saw something that happened at the camp have changed his mind jorge also had trouble believing that and with no way to look inside his fathers mind and understand what he was thinking it would stay a mystery forever his mother cooked tacos stuffed with shredded pork and spices fiery enough to make his nose runhe wasnt used to them any more he ate and ate yes this kind of food beat the devil out of canned deviled ham and there were chicharronespieces of pigskin fried crisp and crunchy that gave your teeth a workout this is wonderful jorge said i ate boring food so long i forgot how good things could be his older brother laughed i said the very same thing when i got heredidnt i mamacita yes exactly the same thing magdalena rodriguez answered lets hope we can hear miguel say it too susana said and soon please god their mother said someone knocked on the door its the postman she got up to see what he had there were a couple of advertising circulars and a large envelope that looked official and it was it came from something called the us occupying authority in the former state of sonora magdalena rodriguez fought through the pronunciation of that when she opened the envelope and unfolded the piece of paper inside she made a face all in english she said let me see jorge could read english well enough and in fact the paper was aimed at pedro and him he frowned at the eagle in front of crossed swords on the letterhead people using that emblem had done their level best to kill him now they were telling him what he had to do as a returned prisoner of war and they werent kidding around either returned pows had to report to the alcaldes office once a week they had to renounce the freedom party they had to report all meetings of more than five people they attended pedro laughed when jorge said that more than five people here now he observed do we report this i wouldnt be surprised jorge said he kept reading returned pows could not write or subscribe to forbidden literature they couldnt keep weapons of caliber larger thaneither pistols or longarms im surprised they let you have any his sister said when he read that somebody who was writing the rules had to know every farm down here has a varmint gun jorge said his father had taught him to shoot and to be careful with firearms when he was a little boy if they said we couldnt keep guns at all we wouldnt pay any attention to them they think this keeps them out of trouble you can kill somebody with a pedro said sure jorge agreed but you have to hit him just right are you sure they really let us out of the camps his brother asked he shrugged were here this isnt so good but theyll get tired of it after a while they have to how many soldiers can they put in baroyeca as many as they want pedro said but jorge shook his head i dont believe it theyd have to stick soldiers in every little town from virginia to here even the yankees dont have that many soldiersi hope pedro thought about it mm maybe youre right the war is over the yankees will want to go home too sure they will who wouldnt jorge said being a soldier is no fun you march around thats not so bad but when you fight most of the time youre bored and uncomfortable and the rest youre scared to death and you can get hurt too their mother said softly and crossed herself again jorge and pedro had both been lucky coming through the war with nothing worse than a few scratches their brother hadnt the roll of the dice the turn of the cardsome guys had a shell burst ten feet away from them and didnt get badly hurt some turned into hamburger who could say why god maybe from everything jorge had seen he had a rugged sense of humor one of these days he wanted to talk that over with pedroand with miguel too not here though not now not with their mother listening she believed and she hadnt seen so many reasons not to believe well all that could wait it would have to in fact how is the farm he asked his mother he would be here for a long time this was what counted now not so bad she answered but not so good either we all did everything we could with so many men in the army thoughshe spread her handswe couldnt do everything we wanted to the livestock is all right the cropswell we didnt go hungry but we barely made enough to pay for the things we need and we cant get from the land its about what youd expect pedro said if we work hard we can bring it back to the way it was before the warmaybe better if the yankees let us i mean i think maybe they will they dont care so much about uswere too far away jorge said virginia tennesseethey really hate the people there and georgia too i think theyll come down on them harder and leave us alone unless somebody here does something stupid like try to rise up pedro didnt say anything jorge realized that wasnt necessarily good news no his brother hadnt seen so much fighting as he had maybe pedro was still ready for more jorge knew damn well he wasnt bombers dropping loads on baroyeca without even any antiaircraft to shoot back believe it or not the mere idea made him want to cross himself xv p eople in the united states said washington dc had confederate weather armstrong grimes father who was from ohio said so all the goddamn time armstrong had always believed it why not his old man wouldnt waste time and effort lying about anything so small but now armstrong was stuck in southern alabama in the middle of summer and he was discovering that people in the usa didnt know what the hell they were talking about hed already found that out about his fatherwhat guy growing up doesntbut discovering the same thing about the rest of the country came as a bit of a jolt every day down here was like a bad day back home it got hot it got sticky and it never let up us soldiers gulped salt tablets when the sweaty patches under their arms dried outwhich didnt happen very oftenthey left salt stains on their uniforms he itched constantly prickly heat athletes foot jock itchyou name it armstrong came down with it he smeared all kinds of smelly goop on himself sometimes it helped more often it didnt and there were bugs they had mosquitoes down here that could have doubled as fighterbombers they had several flavors of ferocious flies they had vicious little biting things the locals called noseeems they had chiggers they had ticks they had something called chinch bugs the army sprayed ddt on everything and everybody it helpedsome you would have had to spray every square inch of the state to put down all the nasty biting things local whites hated the men in greengray whod whipped their armies and made them stop killing negroes bushwhackers shot at us soldiers you looked sideways at every junked motorcar by the side of the road it could go boom and take half a squad with it the us army didnt waste time fighting fair not after the surrender every time a us soldier got shot tenthen twentyconfederates faced the firing squad the number for an auto bomb started at a hundred and also quickly doubled armstrong hadnt been on any firing squads while the war was going on now with three stripes on his sleeve he frequently commanded one the first couple of times he did it it made his stomach turn over after that it turned into routine and he got used to it so did the soldiers who did the shooting they went about their business at the same time as they argued about whether it did any good just makes these motherfuckers hate us worse squidface opined they already hate us armstrong said i dont give a shit about that i just dont want em shooting at us if we dont get the assholes whore really doin it what do we accomplish squidface asked shootin little old ladies gets old you know we shoot enough little old ladies the ones whore left alivell make the triggerhappy guys knock it off armstrong said good fuckin luck squidface was not a believer armstrong trotted out what he thought was the clincher sides we kill all the whites down here nobodyll be left to go bushwhacking right shit now youre talkin like a confederate nigger squidface said we do that wont be anybody left alive down here wouldnt break my heart armstrong wiped his face with his sleeve the sleeve came away wetbig surprise best thing they could do with this country is give it back to the possums and the gators squidface laughed but he wouldnt give up on the argumentwhat better way to kill time he suggested a reason to leave some confederates alive nobody gets laid any more if we kill all the women some of the ones we grease are cute thats a waste of good pussy how come you havent come down venereal yet armstrong asked same reason you havent i bet squidface answered im lucky and when i figure maybe i wont be lucky im careful the broads down here theyre nothin but a bunch of whores they lost armstrong said which went a long way towards explaining things he added a lot of em their husbands or boyfriends arent coming back either he supposed he had been lucky hed got an education down here that was a hell of a lot more enjoyable than anything theyd tried to cram down his throat in high school he hadnt cared about english lit or medieval history or practical math thisthis was stuff he wanted to learn the one thing he was glad about was that none of the women whod enlightened him had come before his firing squad that would have been worse than embarrassing and it might have landed him in trouble orders against what the brass called fraternization had gone out getting anyone to listen to them was another story far as im concerned its the same now as it was when we were shooting at each other he said i just want to serve out my hitch take off the goddamn uniform go back home and figure out what the hell to do with the rest of my life want to hear somethin funny squidface said im all ears armstrong answered me im thinkin about turning into a lifer jesus christ cmon with me buddy im taking you to the aid station youre down with something worse than the clap youve got softening of the brain damned if you dont nah i been thinkin about it squidface said thinkin hard too say i go back to civvy street whats the best thing that can happen to me you get out of the army armstrong answered at once yeah and then what best thing i can see is i spend the next forty years working in a factory i find some broad we have some kids and get old and fat together big fucking deal pardon my french that was in broad outline the future armstrong saw for himself too it didnt seem so badbut when squidface laid it out it didnt seem so good either but when the other choice was staying inwould you rather get your balls shot off instead i already got one purple heart thats about five too many it wont be as bad now as it was squidface said what i figure is if i stay in i can end up a top kick pretty goddamn fast theyre gonna lose all kinds of senior noncomssome of those sorry assholes are great war retreads and they aint gonna stick around peoplell call me first sergeant giacopelli not squidface ill get to tell lieutenants where to head in even captains wont look at me like im dogshit on the bottom of their shoe ill have more fruit salad on my chest than the mess hall has in cans youre gonna do what youre gonna do armstrong said dont figure i can talk you out of it hell i wish you luck if its what you really want but im not gonna go that route youll end up in an office somewhere with a secretary to blow you if your wife wont youre a smart guy squidface said im just a sap from the wrong side of the tracks armys the first place i ever got anything like a square deal if im so smart what am i doing here armstrong asked squidface laughed armstrong wished he hadnt made the crack about secretaries his own father had worked in a washington office since time out of mind armstrong didnt have any reason to think his old man was unfaithful but now hed wonder that wasnt so good then somebody let out a yell and armstrong and squidface both jumped up to see what was going on the guy who yelled was a captain seeing armstrong he said gather up your platoon grimes and take em into hugo weve got trouble there yes sir armstrong said and then can you tell me what kind of trouble so they know what to look out for theres a gal says a nigger raped her he says she gave it up and she only started yelling when somebody saw him leaving her house all the white folks in town want to hang him up by the nuts before we got down here theyd hang a coon for whistling at a white woman let alone fucking her what are we supposed to do exactly armstrong asked hes in the town jail dont let em haul him out and lynch him were still figuring out what really happenedtrying to anyway so thats whats going on go deal with it do whatever you have to do to hold the jail white folks here have to know were the law in these parts nowadays they arent got it yes sir armstrong repliedthe only possible answer go deal with it he thought right turning to squidface he said lets round em up sure sarge squidface said the only thing he could they tramped into hugo in full combat gear weapons loaded and ready finding the jail was the easiest thing in the worldit was the building with the mob in front of it a squad of scaredlooking us soldiers in the jail looked as if they didnt think they could hold the mob out if it attacked they might well have been right too break it up there armstrong yelled from behind the crowd of irate alabamans go home they whirled almost as one for a second he wondered if they would charge his men the sight of so many more soldiers in greengrayand so many automatic weaponsseemed to give the locals pause we want the nigger one of them yelled then they all took up the cry we want the nigger well you arent gonna get him armstrong said hes ours to deal with once we work out what really went on you people go on home first last and only warning we start shooting we dont quit what he done to that white gal just killins too good for him shouted a man with a gray mustache stained by tobacco juice were gonna youre gonna shut the fuck up and go home right now or youre gonna end up dead armstrong broke in those are the only choices you got well deal with the colored guy or maybe with the whore he was trickin with that caused fresh tumult he silenced it by chambering a round the harsh snick cut through the crowd noise like a sharp knife through soft sausage enough of this shit armstrong said beat it he wondered if they would rush him in spite of everything he also wondered if he and his buddies could shoot enough of them to break the rush before they got mobbed then sullenly the crowd dispersed they were willing to kill to defend confederate womanhood but less enthusiastic about dying for it whew armstrong said yeah squidface nodded aint you glad the wars over christ we almost started it up again armstrong said and you want to keep on doing crap like this you gotta be out of your tree hey i wont be bored anyway squidface made light of it but he wasnt about to change his mind got a butt on you sure armstrong handed him a pack wonder if that coon really did give her the old whatfor who cares squidface paused to flick his zippo sucked in smoke and went on way i look at it is all the shit these white freedom party assholes gave the spades who gives a shit if they get some of their own back eight inches at a time mm youve got something there armstrong lit a cigarette too besides i bet shes ugly he and squidface both laughed their side had won they could afford to c assius had wondered about a lot of things in his life whether he would be famous never made the list a negro in the csa had no chance at all of reaching that goal so what point to wondering about it all he had to do it turned out was be a halfway decent shot knock one man over and his own world turned upside down and inside out no he hadnt expected that he hadnt even imagined it none of which kept it from happening first us officers inside madison grilled him he told his story there wasnt much of a story to tell soon as i seen it was jake featherston i shot the son of a bitch shot him some more once he was down sos he wouldnt get up no mo whatll we do with him one officer asked another over cassius head they might as well have been talking about somebody in the next county hell i dont know the second yankee answered if it was up to me though id put him up for a congressional medal of honor cant the first officer said why the hell not he isnt a us citizen oh the second officer laughed sheepishly yeah youre right but he just did more for us than a fuck of a lot of guys who are one thing that happened because hed shot jake featherston was that he didnt have to go out on patrol any more he didnt have any more duties at all in fact he could eat as much as he wanted and sleep as late as he wanted if theyd issued him a girl he would have had the whole world by the short hairs and if hed asked they probably would have but he didnt think of it and no one suggested it so he did without a few days later a newsreel crew filmed him he told them the same story hed given the army officers one of them asked did you feel you were taking revenge for all the negroes jake featherston hurt he didnt hurt em suhhe done killed em cassius answered my ma an my pa an my sister an lord knows how many more cant hardly get even for all that jus by killin one man he needed killindont get me wrong but it aint enoughnot even close why didnt you get taken with the rest of your family asked the white man from the usa on account of i didnt go to church on sunday thats where they got grabbed do you think god was saving you for something else beats me cassius answered plenty of other times i couldve got killed too what are you going to do now cassius spread his hands suh i got no idea plenty of other people had ideas for him next thing he knew he was on a train heading for the usa hed never ridden on the railroad before and he would have gone hungry if one of the whites escorting him hadnt taken him to the dining car the food was goodbetter than us army chow it didnt measure up to what the huntsmans lodge or his mother had made but he didnt figure anything ever would not this side of heaven he took some satisfaction in seeing what the usa had done to the csaand the carolinas had been a confederate redoubt till late in the war as he passed through virginia he saw what the united states had done where they werent fooling around he saw white people living in the midst of the rubble they were filthy and grubby and scrawny hed gone through that himself he might have been sorry for themif hed seen more than a tiny handful of blacks living alongside them since he didnt he stifled whatever sympathy he would have felt then he crossed into the usa another country not only that a country where they just treated negroesnot too well his father had always been cynical about the united states compared to what cassius had survived though being treatednot too well looked pretty goddamn good the united states didnt look so good the part he saw the stretch between the marylandvirginia border and philadelphia looked almost as bombpocked and trampled as the land farther south had he wondered how any part of this poor battered continent would ever climb back to its feet again he saw the edges of what the superbomb had done to philadelphia the edges were bad enough what were things like at the center where the bomb went off maybe not knowing was better they put him up in a hotel not far from congressional hall anything you wantanything at allyou just telephone and ask for it a bright young lieutenant said theyll bring it to you thank you kindly cassius said and then show me how to work the telephone suh please you never used one before the officer who couldnt have been more than a year or two older than cassius blinked no suh cassius answered werent more than a couple in the terrywhere i come fromeven before things got bad after that we didnt have nothin all right the white manhe was blond and blueeyed and handsome in the csa he might have become a freedom party guardshowed him what to do you know about hot and cold water taps right well we always had to heat our own but i can cipher out whats hot and whats cold an we had the bathroom down the hall mighty nice puttin it right here i bet my folks grew up in a place like that im lucky i didnt have to theyll be delivering a dress uniform for you tonight too you go up to congress tomorrow so they can thank you for getting rid of featherston oh my cassius said he tried the telephone and ordered a steak and fried potatoes fifteen minutes later somebody knocked on the door a white man in a fancy getup a lot like what cassius father had worn brought in a tray here you are sir he said in a funny foreign accent cassius understood tips theyd given him pocket money so he handed the waiter fifty cents with a nod and a smile the man left i did that right cassius thought again the food reminded him army cooks didnt know everything there was to know was it as good as what the huntsmans lodge made pretty close if it wasnt hed just finished eating when the uniform arrived it fit perfectly how did they do that did they measure him while he wasnt looking the fabric was buttery soft the only differences from a real us army uniform were plain brass buttons and no us on his collar he had an auxiliarys armband instead well he was one his visit to congress passed in a blur dozens of people shook his hand one of them he realized just after it happened was the president of the usa charlie la follette didnt look nearly so fierce as jake featherston but hed won and i helped cassius thought dizzily he got dizzier a moment later along with a resolution expressing the thanks of congress they gave him a reward taxfree the congresswoman who made a speech about that was flora somebody afterwards she told him if you like ill find someone you can trust to help you look after the money you dont want to waste it then she smiled or maybe you doi dont know but it would be a shame thank you maam reckon i take you up on that cassius had never imagined so much money but he remembered how his folks always squeezed every penny to get by he didnt think he wanted to waste this not when it could set him up for life maybe waste a little he thought he gave wireless interviews he talked to bill shirer and eric sevareid and walter winchell he could hardly understand winchells rapidfire slangfilled new york accent if he hadnt heard a few soldiers talking that way he probably wouldnt have been able to follow at all each broadcaster asked the question a different way but they all wanted to know the same thing what did killing jake featherston feel like the more he told the story the further from the reality of it he felt a few days later as if remembering it had overlooked something congress voted cassius a fresh honor it declared him a citizen of the united states he felt more excited than someone from say the empire of mexico might have up till now hed never been a citizen of any country negroes in the csa were residents but they didnt have the rights citizens did the congresswoman whod offered to help him sent over an accountant a thin quiet man named sheldon klein he always wore a glove on his left hand cassius watched it and saw only his index finger and thumb move so he probably had some kind of war wound there yes if we invest in bonds and some carefully chosen stocks we can provide you with a very decent income without touching your principal at all he said my what cassius asked your principal that means the basic amount of money you have now it will still be there and you can live off what it earns klein answered he didnt say you dumb nigger he didnt even act as if he thought it any chance i can make more money cassius asked im sure you will the accountant said there will probably be a book about you and a film as well the fees from those you can either spend as they come in or add to the nest egg and make your investment income larger and nothing stands in the way of your pursuing an education and having a career like anyone else cassius hadnt even thought about that what about he brushed a couple of fingers across the black skin on the back of his other hand a difficulty not an impossible difficulty not in this country sheldon klein replied if you work hard you can overcome it and if i may speak frankly even people who dislike most negroes will go out of their way for the man who rid the world of jake featherston that wasnt fair which didnt mean he was wrong dont like to take advantage cassius said slowly if you can if you arent hurting anybodywhy not klein said you spent your whole life up till now disadvantaged didnt you you were a negro in the confederate states so of course you did do you even read and write yes suh my pa he learned me he knewall kinds of things cassius realized he had no idea just how much his father knew hed never had the chance to find out even having his letters made him stand out in the terry he also saw hed surprised klein all right that will help you then the white man said the stronger your foundation the bigger the house you can build on it reckon youre right something else occurred to cassius what do you make out of this off of you not a dime congresswoman blackford would skin me if i charged you klein answered i may get some extra business when people find out i work for you but thats a different story oh and just so you knowits easy for an accountant to steal from you every so often you should pay somebody else to check up on what i do cassius started to say he was sure he wouldnt need to then he saw klein was telling him he shouldnt be sure of things like that and the accountant wouldnt be the only one who could screw him if he wasnt careful so he nodded back and said thanks reckon i will by the way sheldon klein nodded hed passed a small testor maybe not such a small one s am carsten remembered coming home after the last war hed been a petty officer on the dakota then and eager to learn more about the strange and exciting new world of naval aviation hed been on the remembrance when the new airplane carrier launched after some detours hed been aboard her when she got sunk too coming home with the josephus daniels was different she was his he wondered what the navy would do with her after the war shed done everything they asked of her while the country needed ships when you got right down to it though she couldnt do any one thing very well and he wondered what the navy would do with him after the war a middleaged lieutenant up through the hawse holehe might have had a better chance of hanging on if hed stayed a cpo the navy needed grizzled old chiefs grizzled old midgrade officers that was a different story too since he couldnt do anything about it he tried not to worry he steered the destroyer escort to her berth in the boston navy yard himself by god he could get the job done as sailors on the pier caught lines and made her fast he nodded to lon menefee and said well we made it yes sir the exec nodded in style too as much as the old beast has was sam talking about the ship or himself even he wasnt sure men whod got leave happily hurried off the destroyer escort a lot of them wouldnt stay in the navy much longer they would pick up the threads of the lives theyd led before they put on the uniform sam couldnt very well do that hed cut those threads thirtyfive years before but if they put him on the beach hed have to find something else to do he wished he had any idea what shes in your hands for a bit lon he said i get to go talk to a board all things considered i think id rather have a tooth pulled menefee said judiciously matter of fact im sure of it ha your time will come and soon too sam wasnt kidding the exec was still in his twenties he had plenty of time to climb the links in the chain of command carsten wished he did himself that was one wish he wouldnt get at least he had sense enough to know it he set his cap at the proper angle left the bridge and then left the josephus daniels a commander who couldnt be much older than lon menefee started to salute him then jerked his arm down without smiling sam did salute the younger man that kind of thing happened all the time when you had more wrinkles than stripes two younger but senior officers did salute him before he got to the meeting room where he supposed he would hear his fate as was his habit when they did that he returned the salutes with an admirals dignity if one of his stripes were of thick goldif i had an admirals pay he thought you couldnt get rich in the service no matter what not if you were honest but if you won flag rank you did pretty well for yourself he laughed which made a passing sailor give him a funny look a lieutenants pay was nothing to speak of but he had a fair bit of money sitting in one account or another when had he had time to spend any of it when he walked in to face the board one of the men on it was a rear admiral and two were captains all about his age the last fellow was also a fourstriper but of much more recent vintage his handsome face unlined his brown hair unfrosted with gray he grinned jumped to his feet and held out a hand hello sam he said how are you mr cressy sam exclaimed good to see you he shook hands with the former exec of the remembrance youre going up as fast as i thought you would sir is that the ribbon for a navy cross dan cressy looked embarrassed i was lucky youre lucky youre alive thats one of the ways you get a navy cross the rear admiral said he turned back to sam take a seat lieutenant commander carsten lieut sam blinked thank you sir two and a half stripes hed made it at last wonder filled him as he sat down hed climbed about as high as a mustang could hope to get but he couldnt relax even now the navy might be giving him a pat on the back at the same time as it was giving him a kick in the ass a promotion on the way out the door was anything but unheard of you had yourself a busy war the rear admiral observed captain cressys told us part of the story and your record since you got a ship of your own speaks for itself i took her where i got sent sir carsten answered i did what my orders told me to do im just glad we didnt get cut up too bad doing it your attitude does you credit one of the senior captains said captain cressy predicted you would tell us something like that he should talk i was lucky sam glanced toward cressy no offense sir but you sandbag like a son of a gun i dont know what youre talking about cressy said deadpan everybody laughed the rear admiral returned to business you had a little trouble with your previous exec carsten how does lieutenant menefee suit you hes a fine officer sir sam said quicklyhe didnt want to screw menefee i recommend him without reservation thats the short answer details are in his fitness reports but it all boils down to the same thing short answer will do for now the rear admiral nodded to one of the captains who wrote something down the admirals seagray eyes swung back to sam where do you see yourself going from here as long as its in the navy sir ill take a shot at whatever you want to give me sam replied weve heard that before said the captain who was taking notes havent we just the rear admiral agreed i dont think the navys going to shrink the way it did after the last war weve got the japs to keep an eye on god only knows how friendly germany will stay and we really are going to sit on the confederatesand the damn canucksthis time around we wont leave you on the beach thats mighty good to hear sir sam said will congress give us the money we need to do all that good stuff the rear admiral glanced over to captain cressy well you were right hes plenty sharp i said so didnt i cressy returned you sure did the flag officer gave his attention back to sam they will for this year anyhow because were still running on war appropriations what happens after thative never believed in borrowing trouble have you only when i worry about my ship sam answered all the senior officers sitting across from him nodded there is that yes indeed there is that you understand what commands all about all right suppose we give you a choice you can keep the josephus daniels and go on occupation patrol in confederate waters or if youd rather you can have a real destroyer out in the sandwich islands i dont know what kind of duty that would be technically were still at war with the empire of japan but it looks like well let things peter out on the status quo ante bellum same as we did the last time around you may end up gathering moss out there if you go down to the confederacyto the south i suppose i ought to call it since were going to try to hold on to it if i go down there it wont be dull whatever else it is sam finished for him well yes the rear admiral said thats how it looks ill hang on to the de sir sam said if i were captain cressys age id take the bigger newer ship itd look spiffier in my service jacket but i figure i can do more good keeping the confederates in line the pacific war he shook his head the supply lines are just too damn long to let either side fight a proper war out there thats how its been so far anyhow captain cressy said if we get airplanes that can carry a superbomb from midway say to the philippines or if they get one that can carry a superbomb from guam to honolulu the rear admiral broke in or if either side gets a bomber that can fly a superbomb off an airplane carrier sam said theres a cheerful thought with these new turbos itll probably happen in the next few years the rear admiral said or else the smart boysll make the bombs smaller so the prop jobs weve already got can carry them interesting times interesting times however interesting they might be he didnt sound as if he looked forward to them sam understood that because he knew he didnt sir how the heck is the navy going to fight a war when one airplane with one bomb can knock out a flotilla you want the straight dope the rear admiral asked yes sir sam said eagerly all right the straight dope is right now nobody has the faintest idea in the whole wide world if youve got any hot suggestions put em down in writing and send em to the navy department theyll go into the mixyou bet your sweet ass they will the only idea ive got about a superbomb is being under it when it goes off is a bad plan youre even with everybody else sam captain cressy said hell youre ahead of some people there are officers and civilians in philadelphia who think the kaiser is our buddy and the japs dont know how to build superbombs so why worry i believe you even though its philadelphia i believe you sam said some people dont believe things are real till they happen to them and if a superbomb happens to you its too late sometimes you can talk till youre blue in the face and it doesnt do you one damn bit of good makes you wonder the rear admiral shook his head all right well cut orders for you and well get your ship refitted and congratulations again commander thank you sir sam got to his feet and saluted hearing it that way sounded even better it was as if hed got the whole third stripe not just half of it most of the time people didnt bother calling you lieutenant commander any more than they bothered calling you lieutenant junior grade sam knew all about that hed been a jg for a long time two and a half stripes and they still had a slot for him he really hadnt expected the one and hed flabbled about the other once he got back to his ship he owed all the officers drinks well he could take care of that he could tie one on if he felt like ithed earned the right maybe i will he thought when am i ever going to have another promotion party the answer to that was all too plain never s omebody said you could never go home again back in augusta georgia jerry dover would have said that whoever it was had a point the city he came back to wasnt the one hed left when he joined the confederate army when he left the war hadnt touched augusta negro rebels had set off auto bombs in town but that was different so was the isolation of the terry from the white part of town whites and negroes had always lived apart barbed wire between them didnt seem to matter so muchnot if you were white anyhow everything had got shabby even before he joined up nobody put any effort into keeping things neat that all went into doing whatever it took to beat the damnyankees well the whole damn country did whatever it took to beat the damnyankees and that turned out not to be enough and now the whole damn country was paying for it augusta sure was the stars and stripes flew over city hall for the first time in more than eighty years the yankees had captured the town more or less by sideswipe in their drive down the savannah river to the port of the same name theyd bombed it a few times but the confederates didnt make a stand here jerry dover had seen what happened to places where one side or the other made a stand he thanked heaven augusta wasnt one of them incidental damage was bad enough streets had craters in them walls had chunks bitten out of them most windows stared with blind eyes the smell of death was old and faint but it was there his family had survived his house wasmostlyintact he supposed he ought to thank heaven for all that too as a matter of fact he did but he would have liked things better if the town and the way of life hed liked so well had come through the war in one piece they hadnt it wasnt just that us soldiers tramped through the streets of augusta now the life the energy were gone from the city like the rest of the csa it had done everything it knew how to do it didnt know how to do anything any more so many men were missing a lot were dead a lot were maimed some remained in us pow camps though every day more came back on the train but even the ones who were there seemed missing in action after a losing war how could you give a shit about putting things back together and making a living again jerry dover was one of the most hardheaded practical men around he had a hell of a time giving a rats ass about what happened next and if he did what about his countrymen he saw what about them they came back and they had no idea what the hell to do after that a lot of them drank good booze was in short supply and hideously expensive when you could find it there was plenty of rotgut and moonshine though the yankees didnt mind if taverns opened up maybe they figured drunks would be too bleary to bother them and maybe they were right maybe they werent too some of the drunken exsoldiers didnt care what happened to them any more they would pick a fight for the sake of picking it the yankees who werent exsoldiers had a simple rule shoot first augusta crackled with gunfire the us soldiers often didnt bother burying corpses they left them on the sidewalk or in the gutter to warn other hotheads because the united states played by the geneva convention rules and paid him at the same rate as one of their officers dover had money in his pocket when he got home green moneyus moneywas in desperately short supply in the conquered southern states no one knew what brown moneyconfederate cashwas worth any more or whether it was worth anything in the bad days after the great war one us dollar could have bought billions maybe trillions of confederate dollars it wasnt that bad now but it wasnt good not even the occupying authorities seemed sure what to do about the currency of a defunct country putting all that together made leaving the house an adventure every time jerry did it he needed to look for work his greenbacks wouldnt last forever or even very long but he was lucky if he could get more than a couple of blocks before jumpy kids in greengray challenged him on a typical hot muggy afternoon a yankee corporal barked hey you yes dover stopped in his tracks he didnt want to give the soldiers any excuse to do something hed regret later you fight in the war the corporal snapped yes dover said the noncom held out his hand lets see your release papers im going to reach into my left trouser pocket to get them out dover said he waited till the us soldier nodded before moving when he did he moved slowly and carefully he showed the yankee he was holding only papers here gimme the corporal examined the papers and then sent dover a fishy stare you were a light colonel and they let you go anyway no not me im still back in indianapolis dover answered funny guy im laughing my ass off the us soldier said dovers big mouth had got him into trouble before when will i learn he wondered unhappily the soldier in greengray went on how come they turned you loose and dont get cute with me or youll be sorry i was only in the quartermaster corps and i signed the papers that said i wouldnt give any more trouble hell i know we lost you guys wouldnt be here if we didnt dover said bet your balls buddy the corporal scratched his bristly chin doesnt seem like enough somehow not a lot of officers released yet well there is one thing more dover admitted reluctantly yeah the guy who shot jake featherston his father used to work in the restaurant i managed maybe he said i wasnt a total bastard maybe he was lying through his teeth or maybe you are the corporal gestured with his tommy gun cmon with me well get this shit sorted out right dover said resignation in his voice if he said no hed get shot so they went to the corporals superiors dover told his story over again a us second lieutenant with more pimples than whiskers called somebody on a field telephone the kidhe had to be younger than the corporaltalked listened and hung up theyll get back to us he said what am i supposed to do in the meantime dover asked wait right here the babyfaced officer answered dover didnt say anything but he couldnt have looked very happy the lieutenant said whats the matter pops you got a hot date stashed somewhere no jerry dover said with a sigh his last hot date down in savannah had blackmailed him and was probably some kind of yankee spy that didnt mean sitting around in a greengray tent made his heart go pitterpat with delight since his other choices seemed to be the stockade and the burial ground he sat tight after a while they gave him a couple of ration cans he ate without another word hed had us rations plenty of times during the war and in the pow camp eating them in his home town added insult to injury after two and a half hours the field telephone rang the lieutenant picked it up and listened really he squeaked in surprise all rightill take care of it he hung up and eyed jerry your story checks out it should its true dover said i know thatnow i wouldntve believed it before the junior officer scribbled something on dovers papers there ive written an endorsement that should keep them from hauling you in again thatd be nice dover said and then belatedly thanks maybe the endorsement would do some good maybe it wouldnt but at least the kid with the gold bars made the effort dover supposed a lot of yankees would have laughed to see him get in trouble time after time he put the papers back in his pocket youre done here the lieutenant said you can go thanks dover said again and ambled off he got stopped one more time before he made it to the huntsmans lodge this us patrol didnt haul him in so maybe the lieutenants endorsement really did help stranger things must have happened though dover had a hard time thinking of one the huntsmans lodge was open for supper that didnt surprise jerry dover the fancy places always made it most of the customers were us officers some of them were eating with pretty girls who definitely didnt come from the usa that didnt surprise jerry dover either it was the way the world worked most of the waiters and busboys were mexicans the ones who werent were whites a couple of sixteenyearolds and a couple of old men that was a revolution in the prewar csa most whites would sooner have died than served anyone one of the mexicans recognized dover the short swarthy man came over and shook his hand good to see you again seсor he said good to be seen by god dover answered willard sloan still running things here sнuh yes i take you to him dover grinned you reckon i dont know the way felipe all the same he let the waiter escort him to the tiny cramped office where hed put in so many years seeing sloan behind his battered desk was a jolt the current manager of the huntsmans lodge was in his late forties with a lean face a bitter expression and hard blue eyes when he sat behind the desk you could hardly tell he used a wheelchair his legs were useless hed got a bullet in the spine during the great war he eyed jerry dover with all the warmth of a waiter eyeing a patron sliding out the door without paying his check think you can take my job away from me do you he said thats not what i came here for dover answered which was at least partly true justwanted to see how things were i spent a lot of years here you know yeah sloan said glumly owners know youre back yet no dover said maybe i ought to plug you now then sloan sounded serious did he keep a pistol in a desk drawer the way things had gone in the csa maybe it wasnt such a bad idea the cripple gave dover another wintry stare or maybe i just ought to shoot myself save somebody else the trouble hey i only want to getstarted over dover didnt want to say get back on my feet again not to a man who never would doesnt have to be here but thisd suit you best willard sloan didnt make it a question if youve done a halfway decent job since i left the ownersll keep you on dover said i bet theyre paying you less than they paid me would he work for less than he had before damn right he would but he didnt tell sloan that yeah they jewed me down pretty good the present manager agreed what can you do though not much dover said what could he do he could let the owners know he was around hed likely taken care of that just by showing up here if they wanted him back theyd get word to himand too bad for willard sloan if they didnthed have to figure out something else that was all t hick wire mesh in the houston jails visiting room separated jefferson pinkard from the new damnyankee officer the us authorities had chosen to defend him as he had with isidore goldstein he growled dammit i didnt do anything in your country i didnt do anything to anybody from your country i didnt do anything the people in my country didnt want me to do either the damnyankeehe was called moss and he was about as exciting as his nameshook his head none of that counts theyre charging you with crimes against humanity that means you should have known better than to do that stuff even if they told you to my ass jeff said angrily goddamn coons always hated the confederate states they fucked us when they rose up in the last war hell first time i went into action it wasnt against you yankees it was against red niggers in georgia you reckon they wouldntve done it again like hell they wouldnt only we didnt give em the chance this time around moss shook his head again women children men who never did anybody any harm you wont get a court to buy it well shit tell me something i dont know pinkard said you assholes are gonna hang me anything i say is just a fuckin joke far as youre concerned whyd they even bother giving me a new lawyer when goldstein got hurt just to make it look pretty i bet i wish i could tell you youre wrong moss replied which took jeff by surprise chances are they will hang you but ill fight them as hard as i can thats my job thats what lawyers do im pretty good at it too jeff eyed him through the grating he still wasnt much to look at a middleaged man whod been through the mill he did sound like somebody who meant what he said though jeff knew professional pride when he heard it he thought moss would do the best job he could he also thought it wouldnt do him one goddamn bit of good can you give me anything to show there were negroes you didnt kill when you could have moss asked that kind of thing might help some nope pinkard shook his head i did what i was supposed to do dammit i didnt break any laws how many negroes went through your camps lieutenant colonel moss asked how many came out alive how many had trials trials nothing jeff said in disgust trials are for citizens niggers arent citizens of the csa never have been never will be now by god he spoke with a certain doleful pride hed helped make sure of that even there youre wrong moss said there were negro citizens in the confederate statesthe men who fought for them in the great war they went into your camps just like the rest us authorities can prove that well so what they were dangerous jeff insisted you leave out the ones who learned how to fight theyre the bastards wholl give you grief down the line when we take care of stuff we do it up brown the yankee sighed you arent making it any easier for meor for yourself what the hell difference does it make pinkard demanded you said it yourselftheyre gonna hang me any which way ill be damned if i give em excuses i did what i was supposed to do thats all are you sorry you did it moss said you might be able to persuade them to go a little easier on you if you make them believe you are easy enough to leave me alive jeff asked well the military attorney hesitated you are the one who started using trucks to asphyxiate negroes right and you are the one who started using cyanide in the phony bathhouses too arent you howd you know about the trucks jeff asked theres a confederate official in tennessee named the lawyer had to stop and check his notes named mercer scott he told us you were responsible for coming up with that is he lying if he is we have a better chance of keeping you breathing jeff considered so mercer was singing was he well he was trying to save his neck too chances were he wouldnt be able to do it not when he ran camp dependable after jeff moved on to camp determination the trucks first showed up at camp dependable they made life a lot easier for guards than taking negroes out into the swamps and shooting them was the mechanic whod made the first one still alive jeff didnt know it probably didnt matter other guards back at the camp by alexandria would be able to back mercer up as for the cyanide he had plenty of correspondence with the pestcontrol company that made it if he tried to deny things there he was screwed blued and tattooed and so with a heavy sigh he shook his head no i did that stuff all right i did it in the line of duty and i dont need to be ashamed of it you were trying to kill people as efficiently as you could moss said i was trying to dispose of niggers as efficiently as i could yeah pinkard said they were a danger to the confederate states so we had to get rid of em jake featherston could have settled on redheads or jews just as easily the lawyer said nah jeff shook his head thats just stupid redheads never did anything to anybody and jewshell i dont have a lot of use for jews but they pulled for us not against us look at saul goldman hes under arrest too moss said theyll hang him for all the lies he told and all the hatred he stirred up jefferson pinkard laughed you dumbass yankees reckon we need to get talked to to hate niggers we can take care of that on our own thank you kindly and so can youall otherwise you wouldve opened up the border and let em all in back before the war sure as hell didnt see that happening moss wrote himself a note ill bring it up at the trial some of the negroes blood is on our hands think itll help jeff asked no moss said itll just make the judges mad because theyll aim to lay all the blame on you but ill get it on the record anyhow hot shit jeff said the lawyer shrugged i cant promise to get you off the hook not when i dont have a chance in church of delivering theyre going to do what theyre going to do i can slow them down a little and piss them off a little and thats about it it aint fair jeff said you cant blame me for doing what my country wanted me to do its not like i broke any of my laws youre changing the rules after the game is over youre probably right but so what moss answered millions of people are dead millions of people got killed for no better reason than that they were colored the government of the usa has decided that thats a crime regardless of whether it broke confederate law or not i cant appeal against that decisionthey wont let me i have to play by the rules they give me now well i had to play by the rules they gave me then whats the goddamn difference jeff said moss reached into his briefcase and pulled out some photographs he held them up so pinkard could see them they showed the crematorium at camp humble and some of the mass graves back at camp determination this is the difference moss said doesnt it mean anything to you it means theyre gonna fuck me jeff said that lousy crematorium never did work the way it was supposed to i know ive seen your letters to the company that built it moss said the people in charge of that company are also charged with crimes against humanity the whole confederacy went around the bend didnt it nope if jeff admitted that he admitted hed done something wrong no matter what the damnyankees thought he was damned if he believed it we were just taking care of what we had to do thats all the us officer sighed you dont give me much to work with but ill do what i can he sounded as if he meant it anyhow thanks jeff said grudgingly right moss put papers back into the briefcase closed it pushed back his chair and got up weve done about as much as we can today looks like he left he could leave guards took jeff back to his cell he wasnt going anywhere not until the damnyankees decided it was time to try him and hang him the unfairness of it gnawed at him when you won the war you could do whatever you goddamn well pleased he imagined the confederate states victorious he imagined jake featherston setting up tribunals and hanging yankees from denver to bangor for all the nasty things theyd done to the csa after the great war thered be yankee bastards dangling from every lamppost in every town well he could imagine whatever he pleased things had worked out the other way and the sons of bitches from the usa were getting a brand new chance to work out on the confederacy where was the justice in that nowhere not as far as he could see of course he couldnt see very far not where he was he could see lots and lots of iron bars a forest of them they werent even damnyankee iron bars they came to his eyes courtesy of the city of houston what mattered though was his own cell it boasted a lumpy cot a toilet without a seat god only knew what kind of murderous weapon he could have come up with if theyd given him a toilet seat and a coldwater sink he knew why he didnt get hot waterthat would have cost money heaven forbid and he was an important prisoner too he had the cell to himself most cells held two men he wouldnt have minded the company but worrying about what he wanted wasnt high on anybodys list well his own but nobody gave a rats ass about that any more hed been a big wheel for a long time hed got used to shoving army officers around and arguing with the attorney general now he might as well have been a coon himself up on a drunkanddisorderly rap except they wouldnt hang a coon for that they were going to hang him higher than haman an attendant brought him a tray of food hed gone to jail in birmingham a few times in his younger days the chow then had been lousy it still was sorry buddy the attendant said if it was up to me id give you a fuckin medal for what you did with the nigs a medal doesnt do me a hell of a lot of good jeff said can you get me out of here instead the attendant shook his head nope no chance too many yankees around theyd hang me right alongside of you and i got five kids jeff could see the fear in his eyes he would have said no if he were a fairy with no kids and no hope of any the attendants were locals even though texas was calling itself the republic of texas these days they loved blacks no more than any other white confederate did but they loved their necks just fine nobody would help an important prisoner nobody at all m y name is clarence potter potter told the us interrogator in philadelphia my rank is brigadier general he rattled off his pay number under the geneva convention thats all ive got to tell you screw the geneva convention the interrogator answered he was a major named ezra tyler a real yankee from new england and screw you too you blew up half of philadelphia and you did it wearing a us uniform you get caught after that the geneva convention wont save your sorry ass you won you can do whatever you wantwhos going to stop you potter said but you know you used us soldiers in cs uniforms in front of chattanoogaother places too and you dropped two superbombs on my country not just one so who do you think youre trying to kid anyway major tyler turned red youre not cooperating damn straight im not potter agreed cheerfully i told youi dont have to not legally anyway do you want to live sure who doesnt are you people going to let me doesnt seem likely whether i cooperate or not professor fitzbelmont doesnt have that attitude professor fitzbelmont isnt a soldier professor fitzbelmont knows things you can really use and professor fitzbelmont is kind of a twit potter sighed none of which applies to me im afraid a twit one of tylers eyebrows rose without him you wouldnt have had a superbomb youre rightno doubt about it potter said put a slide rule in his hands and hes a world beater but when he has to cope with the ordinary world and with ordinary peoplehes kind of a twit you didnt have much trouble getting him to open up did you thats none of your business the interrogator said primly henderson v fitzbelmont in his tweedy innocence wouldnt have known what tyler meant but potter did ha told you so heappreciates the delicacy of his position you dont seem to tyler said my position isnt delicate in international law im fine whether you care about international law may be a different story were treating you as a pow for the time being you werent captured in our uniform youll have a trial major tyler said but if we charge you with crimes against humanity will you charge the kaiser what about charlie la follette like i said you used two superbombs on us we only had one to use on you thats different sure it is you won i already told you that too not what i meant dammit tyler went red again we dropped ours out of airplanes the way you would with any other bomb we didnt sneak them over the border under false pretenses over under around throughso what potter said shall i apologize because we didnt have a bomber that would carry one of the goddamn things im sorry majorim sorry we didnt have more and im sorry we didnt have them sooner if we did id be interrogating you ezra tyler changed the subject which was also the victors privilege speaking of crimes against humanity general what did you know about your governments extermination policy against your negroes and when did you know it fear trickled through potter if the yankees wanted cs officials dead they could always throw that one at them all i knew was that i was involved in sniffing out the negro uprising in which really did happen major and which really did go a long way toward losing us that war and i know there was a black guerrilla movementagain a real onebefore the start of this war those people were not our friends do you think your governments policy had anything to do with that of course i do youd have to be an idiot not to im not that kind of idiot anyway aloud potter said im a soldier soldiers dont make policy yes you are a soldier you returned to the cs army after the richmond olympics where you shot a negro who was attempting to assassinate jake featherston thats right before that time you opposed featherston politically yes i was a whig you traveled to richmond for the games you had a gun you were close to a president you opposed did you go there intending to shoot him yourself its not illegal to carry a gun in the csa any more than it is here the language in our constitution comes straight from yours for the past eight years potter had been automatically saying no to that question whenever it came up saying yes would have got him killedan inch at a time no doubt he needed a deliberate effort of will to tell the truth now scratch that major yes i went up there with that in mind maybe things would have gone better if i did it or if i let the coon do it they couldnt have gone much worse could they but its a little late to worry about it now major tyler grunted well maybe after all of course youd make that claim now amazing how many confederates always hated jake featherston and everything he stood forif you ask them anyhowwhats so funny potters laughter was bitter as wormwood hed lied convincingly enough to make a connoisseur of liars like jake featherston believe him all the other confederate big shots had too now he was telling the truthand this damnyankee wouldnt take him seriously if he didnt laugh he would cry you can believe whatever you wantyou will anyhow he said i believe plenty of people who yelled freedom when that looked like the smart thing to do will tell you now that they never had anything to do with anything they know whos on top and whos on the bottom life is like that the major wrote something in his notebook youre so cynical you could go any way at all without even worrying about it down deep you dont believe in anything do you fuck you tyler potter said the yankee blinked potter hadnt lost his temper before fuck you in the heart he repeated the one woman i ever really loved i broke up with on account of she was for featherston and i was against him will she testify to that the interrogator asked no shes dead potter answered she was in charleston when your navy bombers hit it back in the early days of the war he barked two more harsh notes of laughter and if she were there at the end she would have gone up in smoke with the rest of the city because of your superbomb major tyler gave him a deadfish look youre in a poor position to complain about that wouldnt you say mm you may be right potter admitted that made the yankee blink again he didnt know potter well enough to know his respect for the truth who does know me that well nowadays potter wondered he couldnt think of a soul that bespoke either a lifetime wasted or a lifetime in intelligence assuming the two werent one and the same if we were to release you would you swear a loyalty oath to the united states the interrogator asked no potter said at once you can conquer my country hell you did conquer my country but i dont feel like a good socialist citizen of the usa id say i was sorry i dont only im not besides why play games you arent going to turn me loose youre just looking for the best excuse to hang me we dont need excusesyou said so yourself and you were right tyler replied let me ask you a slightly different question would you swear not to take up arms against the usa and not to aid any rebellion or uprising against this country you dont have to like us for that one only to respect our strength and if you violate that oath the penalty just so you understand would be a blindfold and a cigarettea us cigarette im afraid talk about adding insult to injury potter said with a sour smile yes i might swear that oath theres no denying were knocked flat and theres also no denying that pretty soon ill get too old to be dangerous to you with the worst will in the world things will go the way they go and they can go that way without me by your track record general you could be dangerous to us as long as youre breathing and i think wed be smart to make sure you dont sneak a telegraph clicker into your coffin ezra tyler said you flatter me potter told him i doubt it the us officer replied if we were to release you where would you go what would you do beats me i spent a lot of years as a professional soldier and when i wasnt in between the wars i lived in charleston myself not much point going there not unless i want to glow in the dark potter took off his glasses and polished them with a handkerchief it bought him a moment to think why are you going on and on about turning me loose anyway are you trying to get my hopes up ive been on the other end of these jobs you know you wont break me like that if they started getting roughhe had no moviestyle illusions about his own toughness if they started cutting things or burning things or breaking things or running a few voltsyou didnt need manythrough sensitive places he would sing like a mockingbird to make them stop anybody would the general rule was the only people who thought they could resist torture were the ones whod never seen it oh there were occasional exceptions but the accent was on occasional major tyler shrugged our legal staff has some doubts about conviction though we may go ahead anyway if you were captured in our uniformbut you werent dont sound so disappointed potter said what did you think when that colored kid shot president featherston the yankee asked out of a blue sky i didnt know who did it not at first potter answered i saw him fall and ii knew the war was over he kept it going just by staying alive if hed made it to louisiana say i dont think we could have beaten you but wed still be fighting and id known him almost thirty years since he was an artillery sergeant with a lousy temper he made you pay attention to himto who he was and to what he was and when he got killed it was like there was a hole in the world we wont see anyone like him any time soon and thats the lords truth i say thank the lord it is tyler replied he damn near beat you all by himself he damn near did i know we all know tyler said and everybody who followed him is worse off because he tried he should have left us alone he couldnt he thought he owed you one potter said he was never somebody who could leave anybody alone he aimed to pay back the negroes for screwing him out of a promotion to second lieutenantthats how he looked at it he wanted to and he did and he wanted to pay back the usa too and youll never forget him even if he couldnt quite do it i hated the son of a bitch and i still miss him now that hes gone he shook his head major tyler could make whatever he wanted out of that but every word of it was true xvi t he doctor eyed michael pound with a curious lack of comprehension you can stay longer if you like lieutenant he said youre not fully healed you dont have to return to active duty i understand that sir pound answered i want to he and the doctor wore the same uniform but they didnt speak the same language why for gods sake the medical man asked youve got it soft here no snipers no mines no auto bombs or people bombs sir no offense but its boring here pound said i want to go where things are happening i want to make things happen myself i needed to be herei needed to get patched up now i can walk on my hind legs again they can put me back in a barrel and im ready to go i want to see what the confederate states look like now that theyve surrendered they look the way hell would if wed bombed it back to the stone age the doctor said and everybody whos left alive hates our guts good pound said the doctor gaped pound condescended to explain in that case its mutual he held out his hospitaldischarge papers you sign three times sir i know the regulations the medical man signed with a fancy fountain pen if you want a psychological discharge i daresay youd qualify for that too sir if i want a discharge ill find a floozy pound said as the doctor snorted pound went on but youve even got things to really cure vd now dont you as a matter of fact we do curing stupidity is another story worse luck the doctor kept one copy for the file and handed back the rest good luck to you thanks pound took the papers and limped across the street to the depot there for reassignment glutton for punishment sir asked the top sergeant who ran the chattanooga reppledepple he was not far from pounds age and had an impressive spread of ribbons on his chestincluding one for the purple heart with two tiny oakleaf clusters on it look whos talking pound told him the noncom chuckled and gave back a crooked grin pound asked what have you got for me armor eh the sergeant said and gave pound a measuring stare how long did you wear stripes on your sleeve instead of shoulder straps oh a little while they finally promoted me when i wasnt looking pound said thought that was how things might work the sergeant didnt have to be a genius to figure it out a first lieutenant with graying thinning hair and lines on his face hadnt come out of either west point or the training programs that produced throngs of ninetyday wonders to lead platoons every so often the school of hard knocks booted out an officer too the sergeant shuffled through papers whats the biggest outfit you were ever in charge of a platoon think you can swing a company pound always thought he could do anything he was right more often than he was wrong which didnt stop him from occasionally bumping up against a hard dose of reality but since he would never again be able to get back to the pure and simple pleasures of a gunners job he expected he could handle a larger command than any hed had yet sure where is it down in tallahassee florida the personnel sergeant said kinda tricky down there they didnt see any us soldiers during the war so a lot of them dont feel like they really lost no huh pound said well if they need lessons i can give em some there you go let me cut you some orders then ill send a wire to the outfit down there tell em theyve got their man and well give you a lift to the train station the sergeant sketched a salute pleasure doing business with you sir back at you pound returned the military courtesy seeing the train gave him pause it saidscreamed reallythat the fighting wasnt over yet a freight car full of junk preceded the locomotive if the track was mined the cars weight would set off the charge and spare the engine there was a machine gun on the roof of every fourth car and several more gun barrels stuck out from the caboose you didnt carry that kind of firepower unless you thought youd need it he already knew what georgia looked like hed helped create that devastation himself he was moderately proud of it or more than moderately he changed trains in atlanta walking through the station hurt but he didnt let on released confederate pows in their shabby uniforms now stripped of emblems also made their way through the place they were tightlipped and somber maybe the people in tallahassee didnt know the csa had lost the war but these guys did the new train also had a freight car in front and plenty of guns up top pound looked out on wrecked vehicles and burnt farmhouses and hasty gravesthe detritus of war he thought the devastation would have a sharp edge marking the us stop line but it didnt bombers had made sure of that towns had got leveled bridges were out he sat there for several hours waiting for the last touches to be put on repairs to one why dont we go back or go around somebody in the car asked because that would make sense pound said and no one seemed to want to argue with him he got into tallahassee in the late afternoon then and not the morning as hed been scheduled to do it wasnt remotely his fault but he didnt think it would endear him to his new co whoever that turned out to be a sergeant standing just inside the doorway held a sign that said lieutenant pound thats me pound said sorry to keep you waiting its all right sir i know the railroads on the way down here are really screwed up the noncom said ive got an auto waiting for you can i grab your duffel colonel einsiedel said you were coming off a wound afraid i am pound took the greengray canvas sack off his shoulder and gave it to the sergeant sorry to put you to the trouble but if youre kind enough to offer ill take you up on it dont worry about it sir all part of the service the sergeant was in his early twenties hed probably been a private when the war started if hed been in the army at all michael pound knew what his curious glance meant youre the oldest goddamn first looey i ever saw but the man didnt say anything except ive got it follow me the motorcar was a commandeered birmingham the sergeant drove him past the bombdamaged state capitol and then north and east up to clark park where the armored regiment was bivouacked it wasnt a long drive at all tallahassees the capital of florida isnt it pound said i thought thered be more of it its only about a good piss wide sure as hell the sergeant agreed christ the legislature only meets for a coupla months in oddnumbered years we had to call em back into session so we could tell em what to do how did they like that pound asked everybody hates us were yankees the sergeant said matteroffactly but if anybody fucks with us we grease him its about that simple all of our barrels have acaliber machine gun mounted in front of the commanders cupola and we carry lots of canister not so much he and ap were here to smash up mobs and we damn well do it sounds good to me pound had wished for a machine gun of his own plenty of times in the field now hed have oneand acaliber machine gun could chew up anything this side of a barrel and if god wanted a shotgun hed pick up a barrels cannon firing canister canister wouldnt just smash up a mobit would exterminate one barbed wire surrounded clark park so did signs with skulls and crossbones on them and a blunt warning message heads up mines us guards carrying captured cs automatic rifles talked to the sergeant before swinging back a stout wireprotected gate and letting the birmingham through had trouble with auto bombs or people bombs pound asked do they shoot mortars at you in the middle of the night they tried that shit once or twice sir his driver answered when we take hostages now were up to killing a hundred for one they know wed just as soon see em dead so they dont mess with us like they did when we first got here now theyve seen we really mean it that sounds good to me too pound was and always had been a firm believer in massive retaliation the sergeant drove him up to a tent flying a regimental flaga pugnacious turtle on roller skates wearing a helmet and boxing glovesthat looked as if some hollywood animation studio had designed it colonel nick einsiedel looked as if some hollywood casting office had designed him he was tall and blond and handsome and he wore the ribbons for a silver star and a purple heart good to have you with us he told pound i did some asking aroundyouve got a hell of a record shame you didnt make officers rank till the middle of the war i liked being a sergeant sir pound said but this isnt so bad as einsiedel laughed he went on how can i be most useful here sir thats the kind of question i like to hear the regimental co replied were trying to be tough but fairor fair but tough if youd sooner look at it that way sir if ive got plenty of canister for the big gun and a up on my turret along with the other machine guns you can call it whatever you want pound said the people down here will damn well do what i tell em to and thats what counts colonel einsiedel smiled youve got your head on straight by god ive been through the mill maybe it amounts to the same thing wouldnt be surprised einsiedel said one thing we dont do unless we cant help it thoughwe dont send a barrel out by itself too many blind spots too good a chance for somebody to throw a featherston fizz at you that didnt sound so good i thought the locals were supposed to be too scared of us to try any crap pound said they aresupposed to be the regimental co answered but in case they arent we dont want to lead them into temptation either does that suit you oh yes sir i want to know what im getting into thats all pound said einsiedel gave him a crooked grin whatever you get into down here make sure you go to a pro station afterwards cause chances are youll end up with a dose if you dont understand sir pound said thinking back to his joke with the doctor before he got released uhis there an officers brothel in town officially no officially all the brownnoses back up in the usa would pitch a fit if we did things like that unofficially there are two maudes is around the corner from the capitol miss lucys is a couple of blocks farther south i like maudes better but you can try em both i expect i will all the comforts of homeor of a house anyway pound said colonel einsiedel winced pound figured hed got off on the right foot l ike most congressional veterans flora blackford spent most of her time in philadelphia as summer swung towards autumn every other year though she went back to the lower east side in new york city to campaign for reelection and this was a presidential election year too she thought charlie la follette ought to win in a walk but the democrats had nominated a native new yorker a hotshot prosecutor named dewey to run against him dewey and his vice presidential candidate a blunttalking senator from missouri were running an aggressive campaign crisscrossing the country saying they could have handled the war better and would ride herd on the beaten confederacy harder president la follette and his running mate jim curley of massachusetts had to content themselves with saying that the socialists damn well had won the war would that be enough unless people were uncommonly ungrateful flora thought it would normally she wouldnt have wanted to see congressman curley on the ticket he came straight from the boston machine an unsavory if effective apparatus but deweys wouldbe veep was a longtime kansas city ward heeler and the kansas city machine was even more unsavory and perhaps even more effective than bostons visiting socialist party headquarters felt like coming home again the only difference from when she worked there thirty years earlier was that the butchers shop underneath the place was owned by the son of the man whod run it then like his father sheldon fleischmann was a democrat and like his father he often sent cold cuts up anyhow the district had changed far fewer people here were fresh off the boat than had been true in nativeborn americans tended to be more conservative than their immigrant parents all the same flora worried more about the national ticket than her own seat the fellow the democrats had nominated a theatrical booking agent named morris kramer had to spend most of his time explaining why he hadnt been in uniform during the war hes got a hernia herman bruck said hed been a socialist activist as long as flora had so all rightthey didnt conscript him but do you think anybody wants a congressman who wears a truss if he didnt wear it his brains would fall out somebody else said that got a laugh from everyone in the long smoky room half the typewriters stopped clattering for a moment the other half wouldnt have stopped for anything this side of the messiah i wont give him a hard time for not going into the service flora said the voters know the story if they didnt know it she would make damn sure they found out before election day i want to show them what having somebody whos been in congress for a while means to them well youve got a chance to do that bruck said i know flora answered unhappily during the great war cs bombers hardly ever got as far north as new york city they did little damage on their handful of raids it wasnt like that this time around worse luck most of the confederates bombs had fallen on the portmost but far from all some rained down on the city at random in a place so full of people the bombardiers must have assumed they would do damage wherever their explosions came downand who was to say they were wrong floras district had suffered along with the rest of new york bombs had blown up apartment buildings and clothing factories and block after block of shops incendiaries had charred holes in the fabric of the city rebuilding wouldnt be easy or quick or cheap one advantage incumbency gave flora was her connections down in philadelphia if she asked for money to help put her district back together she was more likely to get it than a congressman new in his seat her campaign posters got right down to business when they talked about that do you want a new kid on your block they asked and showed morris kramer in short pants pulling a wheeled wooden duck on a string that wasnt even remotely fair but politics wasnt about being fair politics was about getting your guy in and keeping the other sides guy out once youd done that you could do all the other neat stuff you had in mind if you stood on the sidelines looking longingly toward the playing field all the neat ideas in the world werent worth a dime we want to make this district a better place than it was before the war flora said to whoever would listen to her not the same as it used to be not just as good as it used to be better if we cant do that we might as well leave the ruins alone to remind us we shouldnt be dumb enough to fight another war herman bruck brought a blond kid in a captains uniform up to her one afternoon at the socialist party headquarters flora id like you to meet alex swartz he said hello captain swartz flora said what can i do for you she had no doubt that the earnest young officer with a roll of papers under one arm was on the up and up whether herman bruck had an ulterior motive in introducing himwell shed find out about that very pleased to meet you maam alex swartz said he had broad slavic cheekbones and a narrow chin giving his face a foxy cast i graduated from columbia with a degree in architecture two weeks before the war started im on leave right nowin a week i go back down to occupation duty in mississippi but i wanted to show you some of the sketches ive made for how things might look once we put them back together id like to see flora said not exaggerating too much if the sketches turned out to be garbage she could come out with polite nothings let the captain down easy and then get on with her reelection campaign and with taking care of the damage in the district but they werent garbage as he unrolled them one by one and talked about what he had in mind she saw she wasnt the only one whod been thinking along those lines the sketches showed a more spacious less jampacked less hurried place than the one her constituents lived in now this is a lot like what i have in mind she said i particularly like the way you use green space and the way you dont forget about theaters and libraries the next question is how much does it all cost that was the one that separated amateurs from professionals she wouldnt have been surprised if alex swartz hadnt worried about it at all he had though hereive made some estimates he said and pulled a couple of folded sheets of paper from his left breast pocket not cheap but i hope not too outrageous lets have a look flora peered through the bottoms of her bifocals she found herself nodding captain swartz had it just about rightwhat he was proposing wasnt cheap but it wasnt too expensive either if you wanted to do things right you had to spend some money not bad captain not bad at all do you thinktheres any chance it will happen he asked theres some chance that some of it will she answered i cant say any more than that nothing the government touches ever ends up looking just the way you thought it would before you startedyou need to understand that right from the beginning or else you start going crazy swartz nodded got you are you sure youd better or youll end up very disappointed most things end up as compromises as committee decisions that dont make too many people too unhappy some good stuff goes down the drain so does some crap which is whichdepends on whos talking a lot of the time getting some of this built is better than leaving it all as pretty pictures captain swartz insisted pretty pictures are too easy that sounds like the right attitude flora said one thing you find out pretty darn quick in the armyyou wont get everything you want swartz said its no different in politics flora said we dont always have to shoot at people to make that clear though which is all to the good captain swartz looked about sixteen when he grinned i bet then the grin slipped didnt i hear your son got wounded hows he doing hes getting better flora answered it was a hand woundnothing lifethreatening thank god and it kept him out of action while the war finally ran down maybe it kept him from stopping something worse she could hope so anyway hoping so made her feel not quite so bad when she thought about what did happen to joshua glad to hear it the architect said i admire you for not keeping him out of the army or getting him a job counting paper clips in nevada or something you wouldve had the clout to do iti know that captain ill tell you what isnt even close to a secret im his mother after all if hed let me do something like that i would have done it in a heartbeat flora answered but he didnt and so i didnt if god forbid anything worse would have happened i dont know how i would have looked at myself in a mirror afterwards well i can see that alex swartz said but i can see how he feels about it too you dont want to think your mothers apron strings kept you out of danger everybody else had to face no and you dont want to get killed either flora sighed he came through it and he didnt get hurt too bad that means i dont hate myselftoo much she tapped an unrolled drawing with the nail of her right index finger i really think youre on to something here with these sketches i hope we can make some of them more than sketches if you know what i mean the district will be better off if we can his eyes glowed thank you youre welcome she said remember i grew up here in a coldwater flat were too crowded i like the open space thats part of your plan we need more of it here wed be better off if the whole district had more not just the parts the confederates bombed using war as an engine for urban improvement captain swartz began is wasteful flora finished for him she didnt know if that was what he was going to say but it was the truth she went on but if its the only engine weve got not using it would be a crime and the way things are on the lower east side im afraid it is if i got out of the army before election day i was going to vote for you anyway he said now i want to vote for you two or three times from behind flora herman bruck said that can probably be arranged hush herman flora said though she knew he might not be kidding she turned back to captain swartz instead of doing that take your plans to morris kramer if he wins he can do his best to push them through too and theyre important they ought to go forward regardless of politics did she really say that did she really mean it she nodded to herself she did when it came down to the district you couldevery once in a while f rom virginia all the way down to floridaexcept the area around lexington virginia which was the most special of special casesirving morrells word was law military governor was a bland title but it was the one he had in the roman empire he would have been a proconsul that held more flavor at least to him a roman to whom latin came naturally might have disagreed morrell had always had a bitch of a time with latin he set up shop in atlanta it was centrally located for his current command and it also hadnt taken the pounding richmond had one of these days the states under his jurisdiction might rejoin the usa that was the longterm outlook in philadelphia morrell would believe it when he saw it right now his main job was making sure smoldering resentment didnt burst into flaming revolt thick tangles of barbed wire strengthened by iron and concrete pillars made sure autos couldnt come within a couple of hundred yards of his headquarters no auto bomb was going to take out the whole building everyone who approached on foot male or female was methodically searched security was just as tight at other us headquarters throughout the fallen confederacy neither that nor brutal retaliation for attacks had kept a couple of colonels and a brigadier general from joining their ancestors and these people are supposed to become citizens morrell said to his secondincommand how long do they expect us to wait the french and germans dont love each other either harlan parsons replied but they both know theyre foreigners morrell said the confederates speak english these states used to belong to the usa and because of that the bigwigs in philadelphia think it can happen again easy as pie and ive got one thing to say to that bullshit you get to try to make it work brigadier general parsons said arent you luckysir yeah im lucky like snow is black morrell answered his number two sent him a quizzical look youre the first officer i ever heard who used that line and wasnt jewish i knew i stole it from somebody i forgot who morrell said the telephone on his desk rang parsons picked it up general morrells office maybe he could protect his superior from the slings and arrows of outrageousor outragedidiots here though he listened for a little while and then said ill pass you through hold on putting his hand over the mouthpiece he told morrell its colonel einsiedel down in tallahassee thanks morrell took the telephone hello colonel whats gone wrong now he assumed something had people didnt call him to talk about the weather sure enough the local commander said were facing a boycott here all the locals are pretending we dont exist and they arent going into any of the stores that sell to us some of the merchants are starting to feel the pinch thats a new one morrell said any violence not aimed at us colonel einsiedel answered they may have used some strongarm tactics to get their own people to go along what are we supposed to do about it ignore them wait it out morrell said what else is there some of the storekeepers dont want to sell to us any more the colonel said theyre trying to get out of the deals they made its hard to blame them if they keep doing business with us they starve you cant let em get away with that if you do this time tomorrow there wont be a shop in the old confederacy where we can buy anything we arent niggers and our moneys good yes sir well try einsiedel said one of my lieutenants said we ought to shoot any storekeeper who wont sell to us morrell laughed damned if that doesnt sound like michael pound how the devil did you know sir the colonel in florida sounded flabbergasted you mean it is morrell laughed again well i cant say im surprised ive known pound for twentyfive years now he has a straightforward bloodthirstiness that would scare the crap out of any general staff officer ever born hes not always right but hes always sure of himself boy you can say that again einsiedel said all right sir well see what we can do to nip this stuff in the bud dont be too gentle morrell said we won the war if they think theyre going to win the peace they can damn well think again i sure hope so colonel einsiedel said which wasnt exactly the encouraging note on which morrell would have wanted the conversation to end but the colonel hung up after that so morrell couldnt pump him any more without calling him back deciding that would make more trouble than it saved morrell put the handset back into its cradle instead boycott huh brigadier general parsons said thatsdifferent yeah it lets them annoy us without giving us a good excuse to shoot them morrell said some of them are still fighting the war even if they dont carry guns any more every time they make us blink they figure theyve won a battle so we dont blink then parsons said thats about the size of it morrell hoped he could get his own officers to go along not all of them would see that this was a problem michael pound did by god morrell smiled and shook his head pound saw problems and solutions with an almost vicious clarity as far as he was concerned everything was simple and damned if watching him in action didnt make you wonder whether he had it right and everybody else looked at the world through a kaleidoscope that made everything seem much more complicated than it should have the telephone rang again general morrells office harlan parsons said this time he didnt hesitate in answering on his own hook thats right as of the surrender negroes have the same rights on exconfederate territory as whites do anyone who tries to go against that goes up against the us government yes that includes intermarriage as long as the people involved want to go through with it after he hung up morrell asked where rocky mount north carolina his secondincommand answered nice to know there are still some negroes there still some negroes all through the csa morrell said just not many hed heard so many stories of survival by luck and by stealth and by guerrilla war that they started to blur hed heard some of survival by the kindness of whites but fewer than he wished he had featherston turned a whole country upside down and inside out parsons said itll never be the same down here never how many dead six million seven ten morrell shrugged helplessly i dont think anybody knows exactly maybe they can figure out how many negroes the confederates shipped to their camps i bet itd be easier to count how many are left now though then subtract from how many there were before the freedom party started killing them and the number you get is how many bought a plot those freedom party bastards had to be out of their skulls parsons said far from the first time morrell had heard that opinion imagine all the effort they put into killing colored people all the camps they had to build all the trains they had to usethey would have done better if they aimed that shit at us they would have done a hell of a lot better if theyd put their negroes into factories to make stuff to throw at us or if they put them in uniform and pointed them at us morrell said or thats how it looks to me anyhow but they saw it different far as featherston was concerned getting rid of negroes was every bit as important as whaling the snot out of us parsons spiraled a forefinger by his right ear out of his skull he repeated yeah i think so toomost of the time but for people who were crazy they sure went at it like they knew what they were doing morrell shivered those camps ran like barrel factories negroes went in and corpses came out if that was what they were aiming for they couldnt have done a smoother job i know those phony bathhouses so the colored people wouldnt know they were gonna get it till too late parsons shuddered too but dont you have to be crazy to want to do something like that when the ottomans started killing armenians after the great war i sure thought so morrell answered maniacs in fezzesbut shit the confederates arent that different from us or they werent till they started yelling freedom all the damn time biggest difference is they had lots of negroes and we only had a few so could we do something like that too harlan parsons looked horrified christ i hope not yeah well so do i morrell said but whats that got to do with anything if we decide we cant stand negroes or jews or chinamen or whoever the hell do we fish the designs for these asphyxiating trucks out of the file and start making our own i dont think so sir his secondincommand replied for one thing the confederates went and did that maybe we can learn our lesson from them heres hoping morrell nodded you might have something there i sure hope you do whod want to go down in history as the next jake featherston he answered his own question nobody i hope now if only the people down here could get it through their damn thick heads that what the freedom party did was wrong parsons said if they would have thought it was wrong it never would have happened in the first place morrell said if they hadnt voted featherston in or if they hadnt let him go after the colored peoplethey did though and you said it general this is a whole different landscape here now how would the area that had made up the csa get along without negroes to do the jobs whites didnt want or felt to be beneath their dignity hed already seen part of the answer lots of mexicans had come north to work in the fields and to wait tables and cut hair and clean house unless the usa posted machine guns every few hundred yards along the rio grande the mexicans would keep on coming too they could do less and get more money for it here than they could in francisco josйs ramshackle empire without machine guns how were you going to keep them away well that wasnt his worry the secretary of state and the secretary of the interior and the secretary of war would figure out what to do about it and then theyd tell him and then he would have to do itor try to if it turned out to be one of the stupid orders that came out of philadelphia every now and then bang when morrell heard that noise he ducked first and thought later so did harlan parsons nothing else happened though parsons straightened with a sheepish smile i think it was only a backfire i think youre right morrell said thats a relief isnt it one of these days we may even be able to hear that noise without flinching one of these daysbut not soon parsons said morrell nodded the war hadnt just changed the confederate states it had changed his own country and it had changed him and changed every soldier on both sides who came through alive starting at loud noises was the least of it the last time around one confederate soldier came out changed enough to convulse his country a generation later who would change things this time aroundand how c ongratulations dr odoull congratulations lieutenant colonel odoull colonel tobin said he was the us officer in charge of this part of alabama and he was proud of it god help him he handed leonard odoull the little velvet box containing a lieutenant colonels silver oak leaves as if it were the holy grail thank you sir odoull was much less impressed he also suspected tobin had chosen to promote him to try to persuade him to stay in the army if so the man was barking up the wrong tree sir ive been away from my family a long time now with the war over and done id like to arrange to return to civilian life so would we all tobin said but you cant deny soldiers are still getting wounded can you and you cant deny theyre coming down with uh unpleasant diseases either he didnt want to come right out and say vd no sir i cant deny any of that still it is peacetimeformally anyhow and with our new antibiotics a medic can do just as much for syphilis and gonorrhea as i can colonel tobin winced when he heard the names but he didnt retreat im very sorry but the united states still need you you did sign up to serve at the countrys pleasure you know that was a trump against most men in us service against leonard odoull not necessarily sir meaning no disrespect but im going to have to get hold of my government and see what it thinks of your refusing to discharge me your government tobin had bushy eyebrows and got a good theatrical effect when he raised one you have a different one from everybody elses yes sir odoull said which made the colonels eyebrow jump againthis time odoull judged involuntarily he pulled a maroon passport out of his trouser pocket as you see sir im a citizen of the republic of quebec actually i have dual citizenship but ive lived in the republic since the last war i met a girl up there and i stayed and started a practice in riviиreduloup good god let me see that tobin took the quebecois passport as if it were a poisonous snake he found the page with odoulls picture and grunted in surprise as if he truly hadnt expected to see it there shaking his head he handed the passport back youd better get hold of your officials if they write me and say they want you to go on home i have a reason to turn you loose till then though youre a us military physician and we do need your services damn odoull thought he had no idea whether the authorities in the republic would send that kind of letter but he couldnt deny that colonel tobin was playing by the rules all right sir ill do that then odoull put the passport back in his pocket colonel tobin seemed glad to see him go well doc any luck goodson lord asked him when he got back to the aid station depends on what you mean odoull displayed his new rank insignia sergeant lord shook his hand as for getting out odoull went on well yes and no if i can get a letter from my mommyi mean from my governmenttobin will have a real live piece of paper to give him an excuse to turn me loose till then im here hope like hell they give it to you lord said if i had an angle like that you bet your sweet ass id use it playing a horn beats the crap out of this youre a good medic odoull said thanks i try some guy comes in bleeding you dont want to let him down you know what i mean lord said even if i am halfway decent though its not like i want to do it the rest of my life that seems fair odoull allowed he wondered how long the united states would be able to occupy the confederate states the government might want to do it but the soldiers on the ground were a lot less enthusiastic they chafed under the discipline theyd accepted without thinking when their country was in peril they drank whatever they could get their hands on they got into brawls with the locals and with one another despite all the thunderous orders against fraternizing with confederate women they chased skirt as eagerly as they would have back home and what they chased they caught they caught all kinds of thingsthe penicillin they got stuck with testified to that i dont know what the hell her name was said a private most unhappy about his privateshe had one of the drippiest faucets odoull had ever seen it was dark she said five dollars so i gave it to her then she gave it to me she sure did bend over im going to give it to you too odoull said the soldier whined when the shot went home odoull persisted where was this at a brothel we need to know about those no the soldier sighed with relief as the needle came out i was going back to my tent after i stood sentry you know and she called and i felt like it so i paid her and i screwed her in the bushes and the bitch gave me something to remember her by odoull sighed oh god i am so tired of this yeah well let me tell you somethin docits even less fun on this end of the needle the soldier did up his pants is that it am i done no you have to come back in three days for another shot odoull answered the other man groaned odoull felt like groaning himself this is why i need to get out of the army he thought glumly and i have to see your dogtags your superiors in the line need to know you came down venereal the soldier with the clap really didnt like that if goodson lord and eddie hadnt opportunely appeared he might have stormed out of the aid station and forgotten about the second half of his cure eddie held a wrench sergeant lord had a tire iron odoull got the information he needed as soon as hed written that down he started in on the letter to the powers that be in the republic of quebec finding an envelope for it was easy coming up with a postage stamp wasnt soldiers in confederate territory who were writing to the usa got free franking writing to quebec odoull didnt and hed used his last stamp a few days before on a letter to nicole he thought about using confederate stamps but theyd been demonetized eventually a mail clerk came up with the requisite postage and the letter went on its way and then he forgot about it he went back to being a busy army doctor because an auto bomb killed several us soldiers and wounded two dozen more he hated auto bombs they were a cowards weapons you could beand if you had any brains you weremiles away when your little toy went off and you could laugh at what it did to the people you didnt like digging jagged chunks of metal out of one soldier after another odoull wasnt laughing he didnt think the locals would be laughing very long either even though they probably were right now how many hostages will the authorities take after something like this he asked beats me goodson lord answered but theyll shoot every damn one of em you can bet your last nickel on that i know and that will make some diehard mad enough to build another bomb and then it just starts up again aint we got fun odoull said fun yeah lord said hows this guy doing we would have lost him in the last warthis kind of belly wound peritonitis and septicemia would have got him for sure but with the antibiotics i think hell pull through his colons more like a semicolon now but you can live with that ouch lord said the pun seemed to distress him more than the bloody work he was assisting with hed done the work lots of times the pun was a fresh displeasure odoull had pulled it on granny mcdougald before but not on him im getting old he thought im using the same jokes over and over after hed repaired as best he could the wounded who were brought to him he took a big slug of medicinal brandy and poured another for goodson lord he wouldnt have done that during the fighting no telling then when more casualties were coming in and hed wanted to keep his judgment as sharp as he could now he could hope he wouldnt have anything more complicated than another dose of clap to worry about for a while he lit a cigarette it was a niagara a us brand and tasted lousy but the cs tobacco firms were out of businessfor the moment anyway bad smokes beat no smokes at all puffing on a niagara made him think of heading north again out of the usa and back to the country hed adopted living in the republic of quebec meant returning to a backwater things happened more slowly there movies got to riviиreduloup months sometimes years after they were hits in the united states most of them were dubbed into french a few had subtitles odoulls english would have got even rustier than it had if not for the need to read medical journals and try to keep up with the miracles happening in the usaand the miracles the usa imported from germany back before the united states fostered quebecois independence canada tried ramming english down the locals throats older people still remembered the language but not fondly younger ones wanted nothing to do with it he could live with that if he had to he had lived with it for years you took the bad with the good wherever you went by now his college french had picked up enough of the local accent to let people who didnt know him think he was born in la belle province himself of course not many people in riviиreduloup didnt know him as far as he was concerned that was part of the good penny for em sergeant lord said thinking about going home again odoull answered figured you were lord said youre right here but your eyes were a million miles away better than the thousandyard stare the poor mudfoots get when theyve been through the mill odoull said lord nodded they both knew that look too well odoull stubbed out the cigarette and lit another one hed done something useful today anyhow if colonel tobin had sent him home it would have been up to goodson lord the guy with the shrapnel might have died then granny mcdougald could have pulled him through but odoull didnt think lord was up to it but if the confederates kept a rebellion smoldering for years was that reason enough for him to stay down here till it finally got stamped out if it ever did he shook his head hed paid all the dues he felt like payingmore than hed had to pay he wasnt so goddamn young any more hed had that thought not long before too he wanted the rest of his life for himself whether the us army or the authorities in the republic wanted him to have it might be a different question well hed done what he could along those lines off in the distance a train whistle blew he smiled if all else failed he could hop a freight what did the the soldiers say when you came out with something stupid and then you wake upthat was it doctor deserts heads for home in spite of orders he saw the headlines in his minds eye yes it would be a scandal it would if they caught him anyhow if they didnt he was home free the republic wouldnt extradite himhe was sure of that stop it he told himself youll talk yourself into it and then youll really be up the creek seventeen days after he wrote his letter one with a quebecois stamp came back he opened the envelope with a strange mix of apprehension and anticipation if they said nobut if they said yes and they did in stilted english a bureaucrat in quebec city proclaimed that he was a valuable medical resource and vitally needed to serve the populace of riviиreduloup he grinned from ear to ear hed been called a lot of things before but never valuable let alone a medical resource he hurried off to show colonel tobin the letter j onathan moss didnt like houston it was even hotter and muggier than georgia and alabama and that was saying something new orleans was supposed to be just as bad or maybe worse but you could have a good time in new orleans if you could have a good time in houston moss hadnt found out how defending a man he loathed sure didnt help defending a man who might be the biggest murderer in the history of the world made things worse and defending a man who might be the biggest murderer in the history of the world and didnt seem the least bit sorry about it who seemed proud of what hed done made things much worse defending canadians whod fallen afoul of occupation authorities was worth doing this on the other handmoss wished major isidore goldstein hadnt smashed his stupid motorcar and himself then he would be going through the torments of the damned right now moss would rather have been flying turbo fighters even though there was no one to fly them against any more would he rather have been sitting on the shelf sometimes he thought yes sometimes no pinkards trial and that of guard chief vern green and those of several other guards from camp humble and its predecessor farther west went on in what had been the confederate district courthouse in houston the exterior was modeled after the parthenon all elegant columns but it was built from cheap concrete not marble and it was starting to crumble in houstons savage weather filling in for confederate judges were us army officers theyd shot down moss arguments for getting jefferson pinkard off the hook one after another no he couldnt claim pinkard was only acting on orders from richmond the charge is crimes against humanity said the chief judge a craggy brigadier general named lloyd meusel the defendant is assumed to have been aware that regardless of orders it is illegal and criminal to have murdered innocent people in literally carload lots by various ingenious methods and then either burying them in mass graves or burning them so that their passing became a stench in the nostrils of mankind forever dammit they werent all that innocent pinkard saidhe wouldnt keep his mouth shut which was something any defendant needed to know how to do plenty of rebelsand they all hated the csa and of course that gave the military prosecutor a bright young major named barry goodman the chance to pounce he grabbed it may it please the court he said how many of the negroes who passed through these extermination camps were tried and convicted of any crime even spitting on the sidewalk is it not a fact that the only thing they were guilty of was being colored and that this became a capital crime in the confederate states general meusel leaned over backwards to be fair well major we are here to determine whether that is a fact we cant assume it ahead of time yes sir goodman replied i will endeavor to demonstrate and document its truthfulness i believe i can do that jonathan moss believed he could too moss had seen the photographs taken outside of snyder and the documents captured from the meticulous files kept at camp humble they offered overwhelming evidence of what the csa had done and goodman put them into evidence again and again he had letters where the gasketing of trucks was said to be tightened up to improve their asphyxiating efficiency jefferson pinkards initials said hed read and approvedand approved ofthose letters goodman had other letters about the construction of the bathhouses at camp humble and about the airtight doors that made sure negroes didnt escape from the termination chambers he had letters to and from the people who provided the cyanide for the termination chambers and he had a small mountain of letters complaining about the shoddy workmanship and design of the crematoria of camp humble just listening to those letters being read into evidence pissed pinkard off jonathan moss could tell and it wasnt because his client had written them it was because pinkard still wanted to slug the bastards whod sold him a bill of goods about the bodyburning ovens and their smokestacks after court adjourned that day moss badly needed a drink soldiers in us uniform were not welcomed with open arms in most of houstons watering holes out of consideration for that fact the army had set up an officers club and one for enlisted men in the courthouse basement moss hied himself thither for a snort barry goodman was already down there working on a double whiskey over ice that looked so good moss ordered the same thing every day when general meusel turns us loose i feel like i ought to go back to the barracks and take a bath he said tell me about it the prosecutor exclaimed youve got it worse than i do counselor because at least im on the side of the angels this time but i am so sick of wading through this shit you know what the worst part is moss paused to drink so the whiskey would put a temporary shield between him and his current duty im all ears goodman said talk about wading through shit weve barely got our feet wet we ought to hang the cyclone peoplethey knew what the cyanide was going for we ought to hang the people who fixed up the trucks and the people who made the bathhouses and the engineers who designed the airtight doors and the ones who designed the heavyduty crematoria even if they didnt know what the hell they were doing did you see your client colonel he still hates those people for botching the job goodman broke in i know i know moss said wearily but you cant put that into evidence thank god like i need to goodman said which was nothing but the truth he added besides dyou think the judges didnt notice they did moss knocked back the drink and signaled for another as the uniformed bartender made it he went on and we need to hang the guys who built the crematoria and the guys who installed them andwhere does it end major does anybody down here have clean hands good question the prosecutor finished his drink he also waved for a refill we cant kill all of them though i dont think we can anyway if we do how are we better than they are if we dont plenty of guilty bastards walk moss said when i was in alabama occupation officials were already starting to slide around the ban on using freedom party personnel to run things all the people with brains and energy were in the party they said those were the people who could get things done so they used them and they bragged about how things were coming back to life the bartender brought them their fresh drinks and took away the empty glasses goodman stared down into his whiskey as if hoping for answers there not just surcease he shook his head i dont know what you can do a lot of them are going to get off and theyll brag about what they did till theyre old and gray except when yankees are around moss said then theyll swear up and down that they didnt know what was going on some prick will probably write a book that shows how they didnt really massacre their negroes after all oh yeah then whered the smokes go goodman asked i mean they were there before the war and then they werent so what happened well we killed a bunch of em when we bombed confederate cities moss was a welltrained attorney he could spin out an argument whether he believed in it or not some died in the rebellion some went up to the usa some died of hunger and diseasethere was a war on you know but a massacre nah never happened barry goodmans mouth twisted thats disgusting thatd gag a maggot damned if it wouldnt bet your ass moss said you think it wont happen though give it twenty yearsthirty at the outside disgusting goodman repeated well were gonna hang some people anyway better believe we are maybe not enough but some and pinkards one of em ive got to do everything i can to stop you moss said and i will sure major goodman didnt despise him for playing on the other side the way several military prosecutors up in canada had that was something anyhow you have a job to do too but they arent just asking you to make bricks without straw theyre asking you to make bricks without mud for cryin out loud since moss knew exactly the same thing he couldnt very well argue he just sighed id feel better about defending him if he thought he was a murderer you know if he felt bad about it if he felt guilty about it hed be somebody i could give a damn about id want to get him off the hook it wouldnt be just an assignment but as far as hes concerned everything he did was strictly line of duty and every one of the negroes he got rid of had it coming i know ive seen the documents and ive seen him in court what he was doing it was a job for him he turned out to be good at it so they kept promoting him goodman shook his head and look where he ended up yeah look moss looked at his glass it was empty again how did that happen two quick doubles were making his head spin so that was how it happened if he got another oneif he got another one hed stagger back to boq and hed need aspirins and coffee in the morning his client deserved better than that on the other hand his client also deserved worse than that he glanced over to goodman ill have another one if you do that would even things upand salve his conscience the prosecutor laughed i was going to say the same thing to you i need another one by god they both waved to the barkeep stolidly the enlisted man built two more doubles moss got about halfway down his before a really ugly thought surfaced what if we elected somebody because he wanted to get rid of all the people with green eyes in the country do you think he could find guys like pinkard to do his dirty work for him barry goodman frowned itd be harder he said slowly we havent hated people with green eyes since dirt the way whites hate blacks in the csa yeah thats true moss conceded the point why not they werent in court now all rightsuppose we elected a guy who wanted to get rid of our negroes or our jews could he get help was goodman jewish with a name like that maybe yes maybe no his looks didnt say for sure either whatever he was he answered id like to tell you no but i bet he could too damn many people will do whatever the guy in charge tells em to they figure he knows what hes doing and they figure theyll get in trouble if they dont go along so yeah our featherston could get his helpers or do you think im wrong christ i wish i did moss answered but the turks did it to the armenians way back when and the russians have been giving it to the jews forever so its not just the confederates going off the deep end they were more efficient about it than anybody else has been but we could do that too now weve got this big ugly bad example staring us in the face goodman said maybe itll make everybody too ashamed to do anything like it again i sure want to think so anyhow itd give me hope for the goddamn human race ill drink to that to the goddamn human race moss raised his glass goodman clinked with him they drank together us authorities in hugo alabama took their own sweet time about trying the negro accused of raping a white woman there they wanted to let things calm down armstrong grimes approved of that hed managed to stave off one riot in front of the jail he knew he might not be so lucky the second time around hed lost his enthusiasm for the uniform he wore hed gone through the whole war from start to finish all right fine hed seen the elephant hed got shot hed paid all the dues anybody needed to pay as far as he was concerned somebody else could come down and occupy the csa the government cared for his opinion as much as it usually did it already had him down at the ass end of alabama and it would keep him here as long as it wanted to if he didnt like it what could he do about it not much not when his only friends for hundreds of miles were other us soldiers in the same boat he was so all right he was stuck here but he was damned if hed give the us army a dimes worth more than he had to sitting quiet and not stirring up the locals looked mighty good to him to his surprise squidface stayed all eagerbeaver you outa your mind armstrong asked the italian kid the more you piss these people off the more likely it is somebodyll shoot at you somebodys gonna shoot at us you can bet your ass on that squidface answered but if we keep these shitheads off balance like itll be pennyante stuff we let em start plotting then half the fuckin state rises up and we have to level everything between here and the ocean to shut it down you know what im sayin man armstrong grunted he knew and didnt like knowing he wanted to think like a shorttimer somebody whod escape from the army soon to squidface who wanted to be a lifer the problem looked different squidface wanted longterm answers ones that would keep this part of alabama not quiet but quieter for years to come armstrong didnt give a damn what happened in if hed be out of here by if that was the question the army seemed anything but eager to turn soldiers loose despite taking hostages despite shooting lots of them it hadnt clamped down on the diehards in the csa no matter what the surrender orders said everybody knew confederate soldiers hadnt turned in all their weapons or all their explosives and they were still using what theyd squirreled away you think they can make us sick enough of occupying them we give it up and go home he asked squidface the pfcs mouth twisted fuck i hope not well just have another war down the line if we do and they gotta have more guys down here who know how to make superbombs genies out of the bottle like so if its another war its a bad one yeah armstrong agreed unenthusiastically but he agreed but if they hate us forever and shoot at us from behind bushes forever how are we better off its like a sore that wont scab up maybe if we kill enough of em the restll figure keeping that shit up is more trouble than its worth squidface had an odd kind of pragmatism but armstrong noddedhe thought the same way two days later a sniper killed a us soldier when that happened these days people in hugo tried to get out of town before anybody could grab them as hostages the occupying authorities discouraged that by shooting at them when they saw them sneaking off armstrong ended up leading a firing squad the rifles issued to the men doing the shooting had one blank round per squad per victim if you wanted to you could think that maybe you hadnt really killed anybody you could also think you could draw four to a king and end up with a royal flush by the time youd pulled the trigger twenty times your odds of innocence were about that low after the shootings a us officer spoke to the people left in hugo get it through your headswe will punish you if you know beforehand that somebodys going to shoot at us youd better let us know if you dont well keep shooting people till we run out of people to shoot armstrong got drunk that night he wasnt the only one from the firing squad who did he hated the duty shooting people who could shoot back was one thing shooting blindfolded people up against a wall that was a different business and a much nastier one no wonder those confederate assholes invented all those fancy ways to kill niggers he said very far in his cups you shoot people day after day you gotta start going bugfuck dont you dont sweat it sarge said squidface whod also poured down a lot of bad whiskey youre already bugfuck you say the sweetest things armstrong made kissing noises for some reasonno doubt because they were smashedthey both thought that was the funniest thing in the world so did the other drinkers pretty soon everybody was pretending to kiss everybody else then somebody really did it and got slapped that was even funnierif you were drunk enough nothing seemed funny to armstrong the next morning strong coffee and lots of aspirins soothed his aching head and gave him a sour stomach instead he got a different kind of headache when he went into hugo to buy a ham sandwich for lunch instead of enduring rations i dont want your money said the man who ran the local diner i dont want to serve you i dont aim to serve any yankee soldier from here on out but especially not you what did i do armstrong was still hung over enough to be extra grouchy i dont need this shit he thought unhappily you told those bastards to shoot my brotherinlaw yesterday thats what your damn captain made me watch you do it too i ought to feed you by god and put rat poison in your sandwich id do it too if you bastards wouldnt murder more folks who never done you no harm youre gonna get your ass in a sling armstrong warned all he wanted was a sandwich not an argument i aint hurting nobody the local said i dont aim to hurt nobody neither but i dont want yankee money any more i dont reckon anybody in this here town wants yankee money any more if he hadnt said that last armstrong might have walked out in disgust as things were he growled conspiracy huh you are gonna get your ass in a sling he didnt just walk out he stomped out and he reported the conversation to the first officer he found a boycott eh the captain said well well see about that by god they did in short order by the end of the week nobody in hugo would sell us soldiers anything on friday an edict came down from the military governor in birmingham it banned failure to cooperate with us authorities if you tried going on with the boycott youd go to jail instead naturally the first question that went through armstrongs mind was if a girl doesnt put out can we arrest her for failure to cooperate sure grimes said the major who was getting the troops up to speed on the new policy then you can arrest yourself for fraternizing ah hell sir armstrong said i knew there was a snatchuh a catchto it thank you karl engels the major said dryly can we go on armstrong nodded grinning karl was his favorite engels brother hed even talked about growing a long blue beard and joining the comedy troupe himself maybe the people who joined the boycott figured they were safe because they werent doing anything violent the failuretocooperate order was announced over bullhorns and posted in notices nailed to every telegraph pole in the towns where boycotters were trying to show their displeasure as soon as somebody said he wouldnt sell a soldier something after that the offender disappeared where you taking old ernie a local asked armstrong when he was one of the men who arrested the man who ran the hugo diner to a camp armstrong answered a camp jesus god the local went pale armstrong laughed a nasty laugh what you think were gonna do to him like you did to your niggers thatd be pretty goddamn funny wouldnt it no the local said faintly well i dont think well waste his sorry assthis time armstrong said but you bastards need to get something through your heads you fuck with us you lose you hear me when the alabaman didnt answer fast enough to suit him he aimed his rifle at the mans face you hear me oh yeah the local nodded he was old and wrinkled himself but he was game i hear you real good you better charlie cause im not bullshitting you armstrong lowered the weapon and the boycott collapsed even faster than it had grown some of the men and women who got arrested came back to hugo others stayed disappeared armstrong didnt know what happened to them his best guess was that they were in prison camps somewhere but he couldnt prove that the united states werent killing them the way the confederate states had killed negroes neither could the locals it made them uncommonly thoughtful see squidface said this is how its supposed to work we keep these bastards on their toes they cant do unto us i guess armstrong said the next day a land mine ten miles away blew a truck full of us soldiers to kingdom come us authorities methodically took hostages and shot them when the fellow whod planted the mine didnt come forward rumor said that one of the soldiers whod done firingsquad duty shot himself right afterwards some guys just cant stand the gaff was squidfaces verdict i guess armstrong said but i dont like firingsquad duty myself i feel like a goose just walked over my grave that was the wrong thing to say around squidface who goosed him the wrestling match they got into was more seriousmore ferocious anyhowthan most soldierly horseplay squidface eyed a shiner in a steel mirror you really do have this shit on your mind he said armstrong rubbed bruised ribs i fuckin told you so how come you dont listen when i tell you something cause id have to waste too much time sifting through the horseshit squidface answered which almost started another round but armstrong decided his ribs were sore enough already they let soldiers vote whod you vote for he asked dewey squidface answered at once hes got a chickenshit mustache but the dems wouldntve been asleep at the switch the way the socialists were when featherston jumped on our ass how about you yeah i guess armstrong agreed i bet the socialistsd pull us out of here faster though just on account of you think like a shorttimer doesnt make you one squidface said armstrong sighed and nodded wasnt that the truth xvii h ey chester captain hubert rhodes called cmere a minute whats up sir chester martin asked got something from the war department that might apply to you the company commander answered youre over fifty right yes sir martin answered and some of the shit ive been through i feel like im over ninety well i can understand that rhodes took a piece of paper out of his tunic pocket he was in his early thirties at the mosthe didnt need to put on glasses before he read something says here the army is accepting discharge applications from noncoms over fifty who arent career military thats you right yes sir chester said again jesus have i got that straight theyll turn me loose if i ask em to thats what it says see for yourself rhodes held out the paper chesters current reading specs had cost him half a buck at a local drugstore hed lost track of how many pairs of reading glasses hed broken since reupping these werent great but they were better than nothing he read the order wading through the army bureaucratese it said what captain rhodes said it said all right where do i get this form it talks about he asked or is the catch that they havent printed any copies of it so im screwed regardless rhodes laughed for all the world as if the army would never pull a stunt like that but then like a magician with a top hat he pulled out a rabbitor rather a form came with the bulletin i wish i could talk you into sticking around but i know id be wasting my breath fraid so sir i got shot once in each war nobody can say i didnt do my bit i have a wife and a life back in la i want to get back while ive still got some time left chester looked at the form ive got to get my immediate superiors signature huh well lieutenant lavochkin wont be sorry to see me goive cramped his style ever since he got here good thing somebody did at least a bit rhodes said both men laughed more than a little uneasily chester didnt want to think about the massacre hed been part of officially rhodes didnt know about that but what he knew officially and what he knew were different beasts he went on if boris gives you any trouble send him to me ill take care of it thank you sir i appreciate it believe me chester said im gonna hunt him up right now sooner i get everything squared away happier ill be all right rhodes stuck out his hand its been a pleasure serving with you and thats the gods truth thanks chester repeated as they shook and back at you the lieutenant he shrugged no he wouldnt be sorry to say goodbye to the lieutenant he found boris lavochkin right where he thought he would on the battered main street of cheraw south carolina lavochkin carried a captured automatic tredegar and looked extremely ready to use it by the way he eyed chester as the veteran noncom approached he might not have minded using it on him lavochkin didnt like getting his style cramped chester pretended not to notice talk to you a second sir youre doing it lavochkin answered and lit a cigarette he didnt offer chester one and chester wasnt sure he would have taken it if lavochkin had right chester said tightly he explained about the war department ukase and about form so all i need is your signature sir and pretty soon ill be out of your hair for good youre bugging out boris lavochkin didnt bother hiding his scorn sir ive put in more combat time than you have martin answered like i told captain rhodes ive got a life outside the army and i aim to live it ive seen as much of this shit as i ever want to by god suppose i dont sign your stupid form well sir ive got three things to say about that first one is you better go talk to captain rhodes second one is you damn well owe me one on account of i kept you from killing all of us when we superbombed charleston and the third one is you can bend over and kiss my ass lavochkin turned a dull red chester stood there waiting he had a on his belt few us soldiers ever went unarmed in the former csa peace or no peace but the lieutenant could have shot him easily enough lavochkin didnt even if the tredegars muzzle twitched he was a bastard but a calculating bastard give me the damn thing itll be a pleasure to get rid of you he snarled believe me sir its mutual leaning the automatic rifle against his leg lavochkin pulled a pen from his left breast pocket and scribbled something that might have been his name he thrust form back at chester there thank you sir chesters voice was sweetsaccharinesweet boris lavochkin gave him a dirty look as he took the signed form back to captain rhodes rhodes signed too and without kicking up any fuss ill send this back to regimental hq and theyll move it on to division he said and then if all the stars align just right theyll ship you home thanks a million captain when chester spoke to hubert rhodes he sounded as if he meant it and he did you dont owe the country anything else chester rhodes said id like you to stick around cause youre damn good at what you do but im not gonna try and hold you where you dont want to be thats white of you martin listened to what came out of his mouth without thought he shook his head theres an expression we have to lose boy you said it rhodes nodded especially down here where the whites arent on our side and the negroes arewhats left of em yeah chester said grimly some negroes had come out of hiding now that us troops were on the ground here some more skinny as pipe cleaners had come back from the camps in texas and louisiana and mississippi back before the freedom party got its massacre going south carolina had had more blacks than whites it sure didnt any morenot even close the ones who had lived through everything wandered around like lost souls chester couldnt blame them how could they rebuild their shattered lives in towns and countrysides where whites had shown they hated them chester wouldnt have wanted to try it himself and he was a middleaged man with a decent education and a considerable sense of his own worth what chance did an illiterate sharecropper or his barefoot maybe pregnant wife have while he was wondering about that a white man in a snappy suit approached him and hubert rhodes and said talk to you captain youre doing it rhodes said whats on your mind my name is walker nigel r walker the man said up until the surrender i was mayor of cheraw now theres some foolish difficulty about letting me go back to my proper function in the community rhodes looked at himlooked through him really you were a party member werent you mr nigel r walker well sure walker said membership for officials was encouragedstrongly encouraged then youre out rhodes voice was hard and flat no freedom party members are going to run things down here any more and you can take that to the bank those are my orders and im going to follow them but youre being unreasonable walker protested i know of several towns in this state where men with much stronger party ties than mine are very actively involved in affairs chester knew of towns like that too some occupying officials wanted to put things back together as fast as they could they grabbed the people who were most likely to be able to do the job if some of those people had screamed freedom for a while they didnt care they thought of themselves as efficiency experts what chester thought of them wasnt fit to repeat in polite company i know some us officers are skirting those orders said captain rhodes who felt the same way he did and if they can do that with a clear conscience then they can i cant i cant come close as far as im concerned you disqualified yourself when you joined that pack of murderous goons is that plain enough mr nigel r walker sir or shall i tell you what i really think of you im going to take my objections to your superiors captain walker strutted off his stiff back radiating anger rhodes sighed he should have asked lavochkinboris would have plugged him you see chester he is good for something damned if youre not right martin said the nerve of this asshole though he was a big fish in a little pond rhodes said and chester noddednothing except possibly the apocalypse would ever make cheraw a big pond rhodes went on he thinks he has the right to go on being a big fish ought to ship him to one of those camps thatd teach him more about rights than he ever dreamt of the fucker chester said savagely yeah the company commander sighed again he may even be a decent guy for all i know he is plenty of people did join the party because it was a meal ticket ive never heard any negroes claim he was especially bad but ive never heard em say he was especially good either to me that means hes tarred with the party brush he might not have done anything much but he didnt try to stop anything either so screw him no thankstoo damn ugly chester said rhodes laughed chester started thinking of rita hed been a good boy ever since he put the uniform back on and he knew his right hand better than hed ever wanted to one day followed another the weather started turning cool and nasty that was what chester thought at first anyhow then he realized that compared to what he would have had to put up with in toledo it was pretty damn good hed lived in los angeles long enough to get spoiled he felt more alert now than he had since the very last days of the war he didnt want to get hurt just when he was about to head home well he didnt want to get hurt any old time but he especially didnt want to get hurt now and he knew too well that he could cheraw was no more reconciled to the stars and stripes than any other part of the dead but still writhing csa locals probed every day to see how much they could get away with us authorities clamped down hard that only gave the locals more reasons to hate damnyankeesas if they needed them at last his discharge orders came so did a travel voucher that would send him up to philadelphia and then across the country through us territory he couldnt have been happier the sooner he left the confederacy forever the happier hed be he was painfully hung over when he boarded the northbound trainbut not too hung over to notice the machine guns it carried he hoped it wouldnt have to use them they might make his head explode captain rhodes and a bunch of guys from his platoona lot of them the worse for wear toosaw him off lieutenant lavochkin didnt chester didnt miss him rhodes and the soldiers waved and shouted as the whistle screeched and the train pulled out of cheraw lucky stiff somebody called yeah chester thought gulping three aspirins he was going home a bner dowling knew more about uranium than hed ever imagined he would before the war he wasnt sure hed ever heard of the stuff oh maybe in chemistry back in the dark ages around the turn of the century yes it was an element so what you didnt do experiments with it the way you did with copper and sulfur and things like that and he knew about saturnium and jovium which was what the confederate physicists called elements and just to confuse the issue us scientists had named the same elements neptunium and plutonium he gathered they had different handles in every country that had found them back in the vanished days when he was at west point no one had dreamt they existed boy i didnt know how obsolete i was till i got here he complained to angelo toricelli most of what i thought i knew turns out not to be so and stuff i never imagined is what really counts you cant win sir if it makes you feel any better i didnt learn this stuff in school either his adjutant answered that did make dowling feel better misery or at least confusion loved company after they reassign us you know theyll have to put permanent bloodhounds on us to make sure nobody knocks us over the head and hijacks us on account of what we know he said maybe but maybe not toricelli said i mean you can bet your bottom dollar that everybody who wants a superbomb either has one by now or is already working on one as hard as he can what do those people need with us go ahead be that way dowling said but if i catch you talking to a jap in glasses or a beautiful russian piano player youll be in more trouble than you can shake a stick at and youd better believe it id like to talk to a beautiful russian piano player toricelli said wistfully hell id like to talk to a beautiful piano player from seattle if you were a career officer you often didnt have time to find a wife dowling never had and he was far from alone in the fraternity of war george custer had made it workalthough dowling often thought george was the steed libbie rode to glory irving morrell was married too and by all accounts happily it could happen odds against it were longer than they were in a lot of trades though just as long as you dont say too much to a beautiful piano player from lexington abner dowling warned i wouldnt do that sir his adjutant sounded hurt besides i havent seen a gal here id want to give the time of day to dowling nodded i know what you mean he didnt suppose confederates were uglier or handsomer than us citizens taken all in all but the war had hit hard here especially in the last few months when the usa tried to blast lexington flat to keep the csa from building a superbomb it didnt work but it did take its toll on the locals people hereabouts still looked haggard and hungry the shenandoah valley was some of the richest farmland in the world but it got hit tooand not so many folks were left to raise crops either and even if i did find a woman i liked here well i might want to lay her but i dont think id ever marry a confederate toricelli said id wonder why she wanted to marry me and all my superiors would wonder whether id gone out of my mind he wasnt wrong a marriage like that could blight his hopes for promotion it could also blight his life if it didnt work and it was much too likely not to even sodowling said you wouldnt be the first you know weve already had a couple of petitions from enlisted men to let them marry local girls id better know sir his adjutant said that paperwork crosses my desk before it lands on yours yes yes dowling didnt want the younger man to think he was forgetting things like that as soon as they started believing you were past it you were whether you knew it or not hastily dowling went on im the one who has to decide though thats one more thing they didnt teach at west point does this pfc really have good reason to marry a virginia woman should i ship him back to the usa instead or should i just hose him down with cold water till he comes to his senses cold water would put a lot of these proposals or propositions or whatever they are on ice lieutenant colonel toricelli said gravely dowling sent him a severe look toricelli bore up under it like the soldier he was dowling said if i do let them get married and things go sour theyll blame me plenty of perfectly normal marriages go bad god knows usually its nobodys fault but the bride and grooms figure anybody would remember that fat chance toricelli said sir i know but the one where the guy knocked the gal upi am going to approve that one hell with me if im not if i say no her fathers liable to use a shotgun on our soldier and then well have to take hostages and itll just be a goddamn mess ill pay for an unhappy marriage to stay away from firing squads that makes sense sir toricelli said kind of a coldblooded way to look at things but it makes sense you get as old as i am if youre hotblooded youre either dead or youre george custer one dowling said i know damn well im not custerthank godand i wasnt dead last time i looked soi try not to blow my cork unless my cork really needs blowing his adjutant returned a sly stare like with general macarthur right i wont waste my time answering that even if it is true dowling stood on his dignity a shaky position for a man of his bulk before his adjutant could call him on it a noncom stuck his head into the office and said sir that professor guy wants to see you fitzbelmont dowling asked the sergeant nodded thats him dowling didnt want to see the physicist he said send him in anyway sometimes what you wanted was different from what you needed if this wasnt one of those times he could have the pleasure of throwing henderson fitzbelmont out on his ear when fitzbelmont came in he looked as angry and as determined as a professorial man could general when am i going to get my life back he demanded it is now almost four months after the surrender but your interrogators continue to hound me to be frank sir i am tired of it to be frank sir i dont give a flying fuck abner dowling didnt blow his cork but he didnt need to waste politeness on fitzbelmont either when you went to work for jake featherston you sold your soul to the devil now youve got to buy it back one nickel at a time if the boys arent finished with you too bad you have a train to catch or what i would like to be a normal human being in a normal country not aa bug under a microscope the professor didnt have the force of personality to hold anger together very long his voice went high and shrill and petulant sorry but thats what you are get used to it dowling said youre going to be under the microscope for the rest of your life youre too dangerous for us not to keep tabs on you if you dont believe me ask whats left of philadelphia i cant do that again youve made very sure i cant fitzbelmont said and some of your interrogators are nothing but idiots you know more about the physics of fission than they do god help them if thats true dowling hadnt known anything about and and the other magic numbers till this assignment landed on him he hoped hed learned enough to be effective but he wouldnt have sworn to it well it is professor fitzbelmont said one imbecile asked me why we didnt use iron instead of uranium it was easier to find and to make he said and much cheaper too the frightening thing is he was serious and the answer is dowling asked very simple general im sure you can figure it out for yourself you can do whatever you please to iron but youll never make a superbomb out of it the same goes for lead or gold or most other things you can think of not all of them dowling said sharply professor fitzbelmont hesitated if i didnt know for a fact that your physicists were already working on this i wouldnt say a word not ever well you already did now go on dowling told him its theoretically possible using isotopes of hydrogen with a superbomb for a fuse you might say to make a bomb a thousand times as powerful as the ones we have now a bomb that burns the way the sun burnsa sunbomb you might say a thousand times as strong as a superbomb dowlings mind bounced off that like a rotary saw recoiling from a spike driven into a tree trunk good god in the foothills you could blow up a thousand philadelphias or petrograds you could blow up an area more than thirty times as wide as the area those bombs destroyed fitzbelmont said area varies as the square of the diameter of course of course dowling agreed in a hollow voice so aa sunbomb could pretty much blow rhode island off the map how big is rhode island by the way fitzbelmont said it he didnt waste time keeping track of us geography i dont know exactly dowling said a thousand square milesmaybe a little more henderson fitzbelmont got a faraway look in his eyes doing the math dowling realized fitzbelmont finally nodded yes thats about right one of those bombs should destroy most of it why do you have such a small state beats me dowling couldnt recall enough colonial history to come up with the reason it didnt matter anyhow what did matterhow long would it take to build one of these sunbomb things i dont know fitzbelmont said i would be surprised if anyone had them in five years i would be surprised if no one had them in twentyfive good god dowling said again if god wasnt in the foothills he was probably running for them the general tried to imagine a world where six or eight countries had sunbombs how would you fight a war if a bunch of your neighbors could blow you into next week if you got frisky general i wouldnt fitzbelmont said bleakly whether that will stop the politicians ha dowling stabbed out a forefinger at him youve got your nerve saying something like that after you went and worked for jake featherston the professor turned red he led my country in time of war what should i have done not helped him that wasnt a question with a simple answer had the csa won us scientists would have asked confederate interrogators the same thing hoping to stay out of trouble yeah but we werent gassing our own people by the millions dowling thought to which victorious confederates would have replied so what and if all or even most physicists felt the way fitzbelmont didthe world was in big trouble in that case w hen jorge rodriguez could he walked into baroyeca to meet the train he couldnt always farm work had no peaks and valleys the way soldiering did you needed to keep at it every day the damnyankees still hadnt let miguel out of their pow camp jorge hoped he was all right maybe hed been wounded and word never got to sonora maybe he was dead and word never got here he hadnt written since the end of the war and things inside the csa were falling apart by then but maybe he would get off the train one afternoon good as new or somewhere close the hope kept jorge walking hed seen enough to know you never could tell and if he stopped in at la culebra verde for a glass of beer before he came home well it was nothing his father hadnt done before him every so often nobody got out when the train stopped in baroyeca it wasnt a big city and never would be if not for the silver and lead mines in the hills back of town it wouldnt have been a town at all when the mines closed between the wars the town almost died even the trains stopped coming for a while jake featherston had fixed that hed fixed lots of things you couldnt say so not unless you wanted to get in trouble with the yankees jorge had enough sense to keep his boca cerrada a couple of people who didntdisappeared one afternoon a tall balding fellow whose remaining hair was yellow mixed with gray stepped down and looked around in wonder anybody with that coloring and those beaky features stood out in swarthy mestizofilled baroyeca seсor quinn jorge exclaimednot his brother but another familiar face he hadnt seen for a long time hola quinn said and then went on in his deliberate englishaccented spanish youre one of hip rodriguezs boys but im damned if i know which one im jorge jorge answered in english pedros back too i was hoping miguel would be on the train thats why i came but the damnyankees are still holding him how are you seсor quinn tired whipped quinn said just like the rest of the country the train pulled out of the station heading south quinn and jorge both coughed at the dust it kicked up jorge looked around nobody was in earshot in a low voice he asked are you going to start the freedom party up again seсor quinn not officially anyway id put my neck in the noose if i did quinn answered hed lived in baroyeca a long time building the party up from nothing and nowhere also quietly he continued as far as los estados unidos know im nothing but another pow if they find out i was an organizer god knows what theyll do to me they wont hear from me jorge promised my father he always thought you were a good man well i always thought he was a good man too robert quinn said i was sad to hear hed passed away and even sadder to hear how ive wondered about that a lot and it doesnt make much sense to me it doesnt make much sense to anybody jorge didnt mention camp determination the way things were nowadays you kept your mouth shut about what went on in places like that what could his father a good party man have seen or felt that made him decide those camps werent doing the right thing it had to be something on that order jorge was sure no personal problem would have made hipolito rodriguez eat his gun tell you what quinn said still softly if nobody down here rats on me well well see what we can do if the damnyankees step on our toes too hard we may not be able to hold meetings and stuff but that doesnt mean the freedom partys dead its not dead unless we decide its dead hows that sound good to me jorge didnt say freedom or ўlibertad or give the party salute you were asking for trouble if you did things like that but he knew he wouldnt be the only one watching the united states to see what they did and he also knew the united states would be watching baroyeca as they would be watching all of the csa or as much of the country as they could if they sensed trouble they would land on it with both feet you played the most dangerous game in the world if you even thought about rising up against the damnyankees can i buy you a glass of beer seсor quinn jorge asked no but you can let me buy you one by god the party organizer answered ive got plenty of money believe me some of the people who think they can play poker havent got the sense god gave a duck jorge smiled all right do you remember where la culebra verde is id damn well better quinn said ўvбmonos amigo it was dark and cool and quiet inside the cantina a couple of men looked up from their drinks when jorge and robert quinn walked in it stayed quiet in there but now the silence was one of suspense slowly and deliberately the bartender ran a damp rag over the counter in front of them what can i get for you seсores he asked dos cervezas por favor quinn set a us halfdollar on the bar he sat down on a stool jorge perched next to him the bartender made the silver coin disappear he drew two beers and set them in front of the new customers thanks jorge put down another quarter one for you too or whatever you want gracias bartenders didnt always want the drinks customers bought them this time though the man in the boiled shirt did pour himself a beer ўsalud quinn raised his glass he and jorge and the bartender drank madre de dios thats good quinn said was he even a catholic jorge didnt know hed never worried about it till now one of the men at a table in the back raised a finger to show he and his friends were ready for a refill the bartender filled glasses and set them on a tray a barmaid picked them up and carried them off her hips swinging jorge followed her with his eyes so did robert quinn they grinned at each other once you got out of the army you remembered how nice it was that the world had pretty girls in it as the beers emptied the bartender murmured good to have you back seсor quinn we didnt know if we would see you again good to be back quinn said there were some times when i wondered whether anybody would see me again but war is like that sн jorge remembered too many close calls of his own the man behind the bar was about his fathers age had he fought in the great war jorge didnt know again hed never wondered till now what are we going to do here jorge robert quinn asked are you ready to live quietly under the stars and stripes or do you remember what your country really is he hadnt been so bold in the train station could one beer have done it to him jorge looked down at his glass he looked around the cantina his minds eye took in the rest of baroyeca and the family farm outside of town all that made him feel less determined than he had over at the station seсor quinn he said sadly i have seen all the fighting i want to see for a long time i am sorry but if the damnyankees do not bother me then i do not care to bother them either if they do bother me the story will be different well thats a fair answer quinn said after silence stretched for more than half a minute youve done your soldiering if you dont want to do it again who can blame you i wish you felt different but if you dont you dont he drained his glass and strode out of la culebra verde did you make him unhappy the bartender asked im afraid i did he doesnt want the war to be over but ive had enough ive had too much he wondered how gabe medwick was getting along he hoped the us soldiers had picked up his wounded buddy back in the virginia woods was gabe back in alabama by now or did he still languish in a pow camp like miguel and what about sergeant blackledge jorge would have bet anything that he was raising trouble for the yankees wherever he was that man was born to bedevil anybody he didnt like and he didnt like many people the bartender drew another beer and set it in front of jorge on the house he said i dont want to go to the hills i dont want the united states shooting hostages here i dont want to be one of the hostages they shoot por dios jorge enough is enough some men will eat fire even if they have to start it themselves jorge said looking at the door through which robert quinn had gone he will find hotheads people like that always do look at jake featherston the bartender never would have said such a thing while the freedom party ruled baroyeca it would have been worth his life if he had he went on i dont think anyone will speak to the soldados from los estados unidos if seсor quinn stays here quietly but if he goes looking for stalwartsthen hes dangerous was the bartender saying he would turn in robert quinn if quinn tried to raise a rebellion if he was what was jorge supposed to do about him kill him to keep him from blabbing but that was raising a rebellion too and jorge had just told quinn he didnt want to do any such thing he also didnt want to sit by while something bad happened to his fathers old friend sometimes nothing you did would help he had the feeling that that was true for much of the csas last war against the usa he also had the feeling it would be true if confederates tried to mix it up with the usa in the wars aftermath yes they could cause trouble could they cause enough to make us forces leave he couldnt make himself believe it when he came back to the farm alone late that afternoon his mothers face fell the way it always did when he came back alone no miguel she asked sadly no miguel im sorry mamacita then jorge told of meeting robert quinn as the freedom party man got off the train his mother only sniffed next to her missing son a man who wasnt from the family didnt cut much ice the news excited pedro though does he want to he didnt go on yes he does jorge answered i told him i didnt he spoke elliptically as pedro had to keep from making their mother flabble pedro looked discontented but pedro hadnt done a whole lot of fighting hed spent most of the war behind barbed wire he didnt have such a good idea of what the united states could do if they decided they wanted to jorge did what hed seen in virginia as the war wound down would stay with him for the rest of his life the overwhelming firepower and the will to use it scared him more than he was willing to admit even to himself what are we going to do sit here quiet for the rest of our lives pedro asked you can do what you want jorge answered me im going to stay on the farm and see how things go we have a crop this year and thats enough for now if things change later if the united states make life too hard to standthen ill worry about it not until what kind of patriot are you his brother asked a live one jorge answered thats the kind i want to go on being too los estados confederados are dead pedro dead i dont think theyll come back to life no matter what we do you think were beaten sн thats right dont you pedro didnt answer he stormed out of the farmhouse instead jorge started to go after him then checked himself his brother could figure out what was going on without him jorge hoped he could anyhow t he oregon cruised off the florida coast the weather was fine it felt more like august than october to george enos back home in boston the leaves would be turning and it would be getting cold at night everything stayed green here he didnt think autumn would ever come all the same he didnt want to stay stuck on the battleship the rest of his life he wanted to get home to connie and the boys fighting in a war was one thing yeah you needed to do that he could see as much occupation duty as far as he was concerned they could conscript somebody else for it he griped most of the sailors on the oregon who werent career navy guys were griping griping let off steam and did no other good he could see nobody who mattered would pay attention nobody who mattered ever paid attention to ratings that was how the navy operated hey you sorry bastards are stuck wally fodor said we cant just pretend the fucking confederatesll be good little boys and girls the way we did the last time around we know better now right all i know is this aint what i signed up for george answered i got a family my kids hardly remember who i am as soon as you swore the oath and they shipped your sorry rear end to providence they had you they had you but good the gun chief said you might as well lay back and enjoy it ive been screwed long enough george said too damn long to tell you the truth i want to go home im not the only one eithernot even close congressll pay attention whether the brass does or not dont hold your breaththats all ive got to tell you fodor gave what was much too likely to be good advice in the meantime there was miami right off the starboard bow if anybody got out of line the oregons big guns could smash the city to bits that was what battleships were good for nowadays blasting the crap out of people who couldnt shoot back in the great war theyd been queens of the sea now they were afterthoughts think well get liberty one of the shelljerkers asked a certain eagerness in his voice miami had a reputation almost like habanas didnt hot weather produce hot women that was how the stories went anyhow george didnt know whether to believe the stories he did know hed been away from connie long enough to hope to find out if they were true he could hope it would be his last fling before he went back to his wife for good that would help him feel not so bad about doing what he wanted to do anyway but wally fodor repeated dont hold your breath besides do you really want to get knocked over the head if you go ashore they dont love us down here chances are theyre never going to either hey i dont care about love the shelljerker said long as i can get it in thats good enough laughter said it was good enough for most of the gun crew they didnt get liberty they did get fresh produce boats came alongside to sell the battleship fruit and meat and fish fresh orange juice and lemonade appeared in the galley so did fresh peas and green beans and salads with tender lettuce and buttery avocados and tomatoes and celery the sailors ate fried shrimp and fried fish and spare ribs and fried chicken george had to let his belt out a notch the chow beat the hell out of any navy rations hed had before bumboats brought out fresh water too enough so the crew didnt have to use seawater and saltwater soap when they showered if that wasnt a luxury hed never known one peace had its advantages all right hed just stripped off his uniform to get clean when an enormous explosion knocked him ass over teakettle the fuck he said which was one of the more coherent comments from the naked sailors klaxons hooted he ran for his battle station without thinking about his clothes bodies lay on the deck hed worry about them later right now he had a job to do and he could do it with pants or without he wasnt the only naked man heading for dutynot even close petty officer fodor had a cut on his face and another one on his arm he didnt seem to notice either one they blew up a goddamn bumboat he said right alongside us they blew up a goddamn bumboat theyre idiots if they did george said the oregon like any modern battleship had sixteeninch armor belts on either side to protect against gunfire and torpedoes they werent perfect as the melancholy roll of torpedoed battlewagons attested but they were a hell of a lot better than nothing a blast that might have torn a destroyer in two dented the oregon and killed and hurt people exposed to it without coming close to sinking her this is the captain speaking the pa blared oddnumbered gun stations aid in casualty collection and damage assessment even numbers hold your posts as the skipper repeated the order george and the other men from his twinmm mount dashed off to do what they could for the sailors who hadnt been so lucky there were a lot of them anybody whod been on deck when the bumboat exploded was down and moaning or down and thrashing or down and not moving at all which was worst some of the paint was burning men already had hoses playing on the fires the stink made georges asshole pucker when your ship got hit that odor was one of the things you smelled and he almost fell on his face skidding through a puddle of seawater from the firefighters he knelt by a burned man who was clutching his left shoulder cmon buddyill give you a hand he said thanks the wounded sailor groped for him sorry i cant see a goddamn thing dont worry about it the docsll fix you up george had no idea whether they could or not the other mans face didnt look good which was putting it mildly your legs all right im gonna get you on your feet if i can give it a try the injured man said which might have meant anything he groaned and swayed when george hauled him upright but he didnt keel over again george got the fellows good arm around his own shoulder he also got blood on his own bare hide but that was something to flabble about later helping the other sailor down three flights of steep narrow steel stairs when the poor guy couldnt see where to put his feet was an adventure all by itself george managed other sailors and groups were carrying injured men and trying to get them down in stretchers without spilling them out in the sick bay and in the corridors outside it the battleships doctors and pharmacists mates were working like foulmouthed machines one of the mates took a quick look at the sailor george had brought down put him there with them he said pointing to a group of other men who were hurt but not in imminent danger of dying well get to him as soon as we have a chance to good luck pal george said as he eased the wounded sailor down it was painfully inadequate but it was all he could offer thanks go help somebody else the other man said somebodymaybe a pharmacists mate maybe a rating one of the doctors had dragoonedstuck a needle into him morphine sure wouldnt hurt george was helping to get another injured man down to first aid when someone said i wonder what well do to miami for this blow the fucking place off the fucking map the wounded sailor said that sounded good to george hed heard of people bombs and auto bombs but a boat bomb the son of a bitch who thought of that one had more imagination than he knew what to do with george hoped hed been on the boat and pressed the button that blew it up if he had maybe the scheme would die with him or was that too much to hope for hell of a note if weve got to inspect every boat that brings us supplies a cpo said sure looks like we will though when george got down to sick bay this time he noticed a group of badly hurt men nobody was helping they had to be the ones the doctors thought wouldnt get better no matter what no time to waste effort on them then that was cruel logic but it made sense the oregon he learned later lost dead and more than wounded in response the us army seized miamians some of the attempted seizures turned into gun battles too the locals knew what the soldiers were coming for and werent inclined to give themselves up without a fight because of the casualties the army took rounding up the hostages it rounded up more hostages still guns aimed toward the city the oregon sailed close inshore the sharp dry cracks of rifle volleys came across the water one after another after another they got the message across if you messed with the usa you paid and paid and paid some of the sailors werent satisfied even so we ought to blast the shit out of that place wally fodor said those assholes fucked with us not with the army we ought to give them a fourteeninch lesson sure works for me george said all right so battleships were shorebombardment vessels these days there was a shore that needed bombarding and it was lying there naked and undefended in front of them but the order didnt come the men pissed and moaned that was all they could do they couldnt open up on miami without orders oh maybe they couldthe men on the smaller guns anyhowbut they were looking at courtsmartial and long terms if they did nobody had the gall to try it discipline tightened up amazingly theyd taken it easy after the confederate surrender they didnt any more you never could tell what might happen now george would have bet skippers and execs all around the fleet were preaching sermons about the battleship that was just what he wanted all right to serve aboard the uss object lesson isnt it great he said to fodor all those guys are going see you better not be a bunch of jerkoffs like the clowns on the oregon otherwise the confederatesll blow your nuts off too yeah thats about the size of it all right the gun chief agreed they can fix up the scar on the side of the ship and slap fresh paint all over the place but the scar on our reputation aint gonna go away so fast goddamn confederate cockknockers took care of that in spades fuck it george said i just want to get back to boston in one piece goddamn war was supposed to be over months ago you think we were down here for no reason fodor patted the gun mount i wish they wouldve lined up the hostages right there on the beach then we coulda opened up on em with the mms boy we wouldve gone through em in a hurry yeah george hadnt thought of the antiaircraft guns as weapons that could substitute for a firing squad but wally fodor wasnt wrong you turn these babies on people you know what youve got youve got grim reapers thats what i like it fodor said and damned if he didnt show up the next day with a can of white paint and some stencils grim reaper went on the righthand gun barrel grim reaper on the gun on the left way to go enos now theyve got names oh boy george tried not to sound too gloomy he was stuck on the oregon though and he wished to god he werent a fter so long in the war zone cincinnatus found des moines strange sleeping in his own bed sleeping with his own wifethat was mighty good getting used to a peacetime world wasnt so easy he flinched whenever an auto backfired or a firecracker went off he automatically looked for somewhere to hide he noticed white men half his age doing the same thing they noticed him too you go through the mill pop one of them called when they both ducked walking down the street after something went boom drove a truck all the way through kentucky and tennessee and georgia cincinnatus answered wasnt right at the front but i got bushwhacked a couplethree times oughta do it the white man agreed i was in virginia and i got shot then they sent me to alabama i dont think ill ever stop being jumpy man i know what you mean cincinnatus said with feeling they gave each other waves that werent quite salutes as they passed cincinnatus knew just where he was going to the recruiting station where hed signed up to drive a truck it was right where it had been uncle sam still needs you said the sign out front he went inside damned if the same recruiting sergeant wasnt sitting in there doing paperwork with a pen held in a hook the man looked up when the door opened well well he said smiling i know you and your name will come to me in a second if i let it youre mrdriver thats right sergeant cincinnatus smiled too i first came in here i called you suh you didnt know the ropes then i see you do now the noncom answered im glad you came through in one piece i bet you cussed the day you stuck

sergeant got to his feet can i grab you a cup of coffee id thank you if you did cincinnatus replied stuff s startin to taste good again were getting real coffee beans for a change not whatever kind of

dutchman but at your service youve got a fancy handle i remember that but youd better remind me what it is cincinnatusthats me thank you kindly cincinnatus sipped from the paper cup the coffee was strong but it hadnt been sitting on the hot plate long enough to get bitter yet he took another sip then he asked the question hed come here to ask sergeant konstamuh dickhow the hell do i get myself to fit back into things wasnt near so hard the last time around konstam paused to light a cigarette it was a niagara he made a sour face tobacco still sucks he blew out smoke you sure you want to talk about that with me cincinnatus what makes you think ive got any answers you done it yourself and youve seen plenty of other fellows come and go through here cincinnatus said if you dont know whos likely to well i hated everything and everybody when i caught this sergeant konstam held up the hook cincinnatus nodded he could see how that might be so the white man took another draghe handled a cigarette as deftly as a pen after he exhaled a gray stream of smoke he went on but life is too short you know whatever youve got you better make the most of it you know oh yeah i hear that real good cincinnatus said figured you did youre a guy who busts his hump you made something out of yourself and thats pretty goddamn tough for somebody your color probably a lot easier to be a shiftless noaccount nigger the way most people expect know somethin cincinnatus said the sergeant raised a questioning eyebrow cincinnatus explained think maybe this is the first time i ever heard a white man say nigger an i didnt want to punch him in the nose yeah well some colored guys are niggers its a shame but its true and some jews are kikes and some dutchmen are goddamn fuckin squareheadsnot me of course konstam flashed a wry grin we got rid of all those assholes wed be better off good fuckin luck thats all i got to tell you were stuck with em and we just have to deal with em the best way we know how like them freedom party goons cincinnatus said sergeant konstam nodded they fill the bill all right only good thing about them is we can shoot the fuckers if they step out of line nobodys gonna miss em when we do either amen cincinnatus said if i was whole myself he didnt want to go on and on about his physical shortcomings not when he was talking to a mutilated man my work was messed up after i got back from covington aint gonna get no better now remind me what line you were in had me a hauling business had it yeah till before the war damned if i know how to put it back on its

achilles he graduated high school an hes clerking for an insurance company he dont want to get all sore and sweaty and dirty like his old man and you know what else im damn glad he dont fair enough good for him and good for you too insurance company huh he must take after his old man thenwants to make things better for himself any way he can maybe his kidsll run a company like that instead of working for it thatd be somethin dont reckon itd be against the law up here the way it would in the csa dont reckon itd be easy neither achilles babies theyre half chinese konstam laughed out loud aint that a kick in the head who flabbled more when they got hitched you and your wife or your sons new inlaws nobody was what youd call happy about it cincinnatus said but achilles and grace they get on good and it aint easy stayin mad at people when theres grandbabies things are easier than they were a while ago i got to say that glad to hear it dick konstam whistled through his teeth i wasnt exactly thrilled when one of my girls married a jewish guy ben hasnt turned out too bad though and youre sure as hell right about grandchildren his face softened want to see photos if i can show you mine they pulled out their wallets and went through a ritual as old as snapshots if people had carried around little paintings before cameras got cheap and easy they would have shown those off too cincinnatus and the sergeant praised the obvious beauty and brilliance of each others descendants cincinnatus didnt think he was lying too hard he hoped dick konstam wasnt either the sergeant stuck his billfold back in his hip pocket any other problems i can solve for you today mr driver he hadnt solved cincinnatus problem he had to know it too but he had helpedand he sounded like a man who wanted to get back to work one more thing cincinnatus said then i get out of your hair how can i keep from wantin to hide behind somethin every goddamn time i hear a loud noise boy you ask the tough ones dont you konstam said all i can tell you is dont hold your breath that took me years to get over some guys never do poor bastards stay nervous as cats the rest of their days dont want to do that but it might have more to do with luck than with what he wanted slowly and painfully he got to his feet i thank you for your time sergeant an for lettin me bend your ear your tax dollars in action konstam replied take care of yourself buddy i wish you luck you havent been back all that long remember give yourself a chance to get used to things again i reckon thats good advice cincinnatus said thank you one more time my pleasure the sergeant said take care now yeah cincinnatus headed for home a work gang with paste pots were putting up red white and blue posters of tom dewey on anything that didnt move hell tell you whats what they said they were covering up as many of charlie la follettes socialist red posters as they could those shouted a oneword message victory cincinnatus still hadnt decided which way hed vote yes the socialists were in the saddle when the usa won the war but they also helped spark it when they gave kentucky and the state of houston back to the csa after their dumb plebiscite the promise of that vote helped get al smith reelected in the colored quarter in covington was empty because of the plebiscite if cincinnatus wanted to he could blame the auto that hit him on the plebiscite oh he might have had an accident like that here in des moines chasing after his senile mother he might have yeah but he did have it down in covington how much did that count he laughed at himself it counted as much as he wanted it to no more and no less nobody could make him vote for the socialists if it mattered a lot in his own mind nobody could make him vote for the democrats if it didnt freedom he murmuredin the real sense of the word not the way jake featherston used it cincinnatus grinned and nodded to himself im here to tell you the truth the truth was he was free when he got back to the apartment he found his wife about ready to jump out of her skin with excitement half a dozen words explained why amandas fella done popped the question do jesus cincinnatus sank into a chair when he left des moines not quite two years earlier his daughter hadnt had a boyfriend she did now calvin washington was a junior butcher a young man serious to the point of solemnity he didnt have much flashhell he didnt have any flashbut cincinnatus thought he was solid all the way through she said yes elizabeth nodded she sure did fast as she could she thinks she done invented calvin you know what i mean expect i do thoughtfully cincinnatus added hes about the same color she is uhhuh his wife nodded again it dont matter as much here as it did down in kentucky but it matters it does cincinnatus agreed that an american negros color did matter was one more measure of growing up in a whitedominated world which made it no less real had calvin been inky black cincinnatus would have felt his daughter was marrying beneath herself he didnt know whether amanda a modern girl would have felt that way but he would have were calvin high yellow on the other hand he might have felt he was marrying beneath himself since they were both about the same shade of brown the question didnt arise when do they want to get hitched cincinnatus asked pretty soon elizabeths eyes sparkled theyre young folks sweetheart they cant hardly wait huh cincinnatus said it wasnt as if his wife were wrong whether he was ready or not the world kept right on going all around him t he first thing irving morrell said when he got into philadelphia was this is a damned nuisance john abell met him at the broad street station as he had so many times before if you want to get it quashed sir im sure we can arrange that no no regretfully morrell shook his head the mans a coldblooded son of a bitch but even a coldblooded son of a bitch is entitled to the truth indeed the general staff officer murmured abell was a coldblooded son of a bitch too but one of a rather different flavor he had two virtues as far as morrell could see they were on the same side and abell didnt go around telling the world how goddamn right he was all the time right now he asked shall i take you over to boq and let you freshen up before you go on morrell looked down at himself he was rumpled but only a little he ran a hand over his chin not perfectly smooth but he didnt think he looked like a skid row bum either he shook his head no lets get it over with the sooner its done the sooner i can head west and see my wife and daughter however you please abell said which meant he would have showered and shaved and changed his uniform first but he left the editorializing right there my driver is at your disposal thanks morrell followed him off the platform they didnt have far to go morrell didnt have to look at the slagged wreckage on the other side of the schuylkill which didnt mean he didnt know it was there its being there in fact was a big part of why he was here there was no fresh damage in philadelphia now that the war was over some of the wrecked buildings had been bulldozed and the rubble hauled away repairmen swarmed everywhere glass was beginning to reappear in windows looksneater than it did before morrell remarked were starting to come back some abell said it wont be the way it was for a long time as a matter of fact it will never be the way it was well no you cant step into the same river twice some greek had said that a couple of thousand years before morrell he didnt remember who john abell probably did morrell no great lover of cities didnt much care how philadelphia rose again as long as it had peace in which to rise that suited him the war department had set up a tribunal for accused confederate war criminals in a rented office building not far from the government buildings that dominated the center of town despite the stars on morrells shoulder straps and those on john abells getting in wasnt easy security was tight and no doubt needed to be a neatly lettered sign outside a meeting room turned courtroom said united states of america vs clarence potter brigadier general csa i would never tell you to perjure yourself abell said as they paused outside the door but i wouldnt hate you if you did either im irving morrell and im here to tell you the truth morrell said abell winced morrell went on in inside the makeshift courtroom everyone except a few reporters and the defendant wore greengray the reporters were in civvies clarence potter had on a butternut uniform that even without insignia singled him out at a glance morrell knew of him but had never seen him before he was a little older and more studiouslooking than the us officer expected which didnt mean he wasnt dangerous hed already proved he was his defense attorney a us major got to his feet since general morrell has chosen not to contest our subpoena i request permission to get his remarks on the record while he is here he faced a panel of five judgesa brigadier general sitting in the center three bird colonels and a lieutenant colonel the general looked over to the light colonel who seemed to be the prosecutor any objections no sir that officer replied im stuck with it his expression said very well the chief judge said come forward and be sworn general morrell and then take your seat when morrell had taken the oath and sat down potters defense counsel said you are aware that general potter is on trial for conveying the confederate superbomb to philadelphia while wearing the us uniform for purposes of disguise yes i know that morrell said this is considered contrary to the laws of war as set down in the hague convention thats right had the confederates ever used soldiers in us uniform before yes they had their men in our uniforms helped get a breakthrough in eastern ohio in they even picked men who had us accents it hurt us i see the defense attorney looked at some papers were the confederates alone in using this tactic no morrell said tell the court about some instances when us soldiers under your command used it well the most important was probably the rd special reconnaissance company morrell replied we took a page from the csas book we recruited men who could sound like confederates we armed them with confederate weapons and put them into confederate uniform where did you get the uniforms asked the major defending potter some from prisoners others off casualties morrell said i see and the rd special reconnaissance company was effective yes it spearheaded our crossing of the tennessee in front of chattanooga surprise and deception made it more effective than it would have been otherwise i would certainly think so thank you general no further questions the chief judge nodded to the prosecutor your witness colonel altrock thank you sir altrock got to his feet you say you were imitating confederate examples when you dressed our men in enemy uniform general i believe thats true yes morrell said would you have done it if the enemy hadnt altrock asked objectionthats a hypothetical the defense attorney said after the judges put their heads together their chief said overruled the witness may answer the question would i would we morrell pursed his lips probably its too good a moveand too obviousto ignore no further questions altrock said one had done him enough damage anything on redirect the chief judge asked potters lawyer who shook his head the judge nodded to morrell you are dismissed general we appreciate your testimony clarence potter spoke for the first time if i may say so i appreciate it very much his own accent might have inspired him to dress up yankeesounding confederates in us uniforms i dont love you general but if they hang you it should be for something you did and we didnt morrell got to his feet he nodded to the judges and left the courtroom john abell wasnt waiting there any more morrell hadnt expected him to hang around the driver was where to sir he said wherever you need to go ill take you there back to the train station quick before somebody else here decides he needs me morrell answered by god i am going to see my wife and daughter the driver grinned i know how you feel sir lets go two and a half hours later morrell was on a train bound for kansas city he traveled through the stretches of western pennsylvania ohio and eastern indiana that had seen the hardest fighting inside the usa looking out the window at the devastation was like falling back in time down in the occupied confederacy hardly anyone looked out of train windows what people saw there was too likely to hurt the united states was luckier but this one stretch of terrain had suffered as much as any farther south morrell breathed easier when he neared indianapolis cs bombers had hit the city but nowhere near as hard as theyd pummeled washington and baltimore and philadelphia and the only soldiers in butternut whod made it to indianapolis went into the pow camps outside of town some of them still languished there most had gone home by now some of the ones who had would make us authorities sorry theyd ever turned them loose morrell was as sure of that as he was of the scars on his thigh and shoulder but what the hell could you do st louis had taken a beating and missouri went up in flames whenever war broke out even three generations after the war of secession it had some stubborn confederate sympathizers lines were fluid in the west too cs raiders had little trouble sneaking up from arkansas and raising hell kansas city and leavenworth as well as the fort nearby had also suffered but as the war went on the confederates found troubles of their own closer to home morrell knew agnes and mildred had come through without a scratch to him selfishly that was all that mattered they were waiting for him when he got off the train agnes was about his age but her black hair showed not a streak of gray maybe that was a miracle more likely it was dye morrell didnt care either way his wife looked damn good to him and she had ever since they met at a dance right here in town he was amazed at how shapely mildred had got she was nineteen now but the years had gone by in a blur for him he eyed agnes in mock severity youve been feeding her again he said sternly didnt i warn you about that see what happens im sorry irv agnes sounded as contrite as he was angrywhich is to say not very daddy mildred was just plain indignant he gave her a kiss its good to see you sweetheart youve grown up as pretty as your mother that he meant mildred was certainly better off with agnes looks than with his own longfaced longjawed countenance he wasnt an ugly man but a woman with features as harsh as his wouldnt have been lucky how long can you stay agnes asked they promised me a couple of weeks but you know what army promises are worth morrell answered the rueful twist to his wifes mouth said she knew much too well he went on well just have to make the most of the time however long it turns out to be of course we will agnes looked at mildred thats good advice any old time she had her own bitter experience shed lost her first husband in the early days of the great war mildred wasnt impressed with a toss of the head she said i thought i graduated from high school morrell started to give her a swat on the behind for sass but checked himself she was too big these days for a man to spank he contented himself with asking have you been giving your mother lip all the time ive been gone every single minute mildred answered proudly that took the wind out of his sails lets go home agnes said we have a lot of catching up to do she winked at morrell he grinned he looked forward to trying to catch up anyhow all over the countryand all over the wreck of the csa toosurvivors were trying to catch up with their families and trying to make them grow some reunions would be smooth some anything but morrell put one arm around his wife the other around his daughter they walked off the platform that way so far so good he thought xviii c larence potter took his place in the yankee courtroom the yankee kangaroo courtroom he feared it was the judges had let his lawyer question witnesses and even bring in irving morrell but how much difference would any of that make hed superbombed the town where they were trying him evidence who gave a damn about evidence if they felt like convicting him they bloody well would he nodded to major stachiewicz whod defended him you did what you could i appreciate it i didnt do it for you exactly i did it for duty the damnyankee said i understand that i dont want to marry you either but you made an honest effort and i want you to know i know it potter said all rise said the warrant officer who doubled as bailiff and recording secretary everyone in the courtroom got to his feet as the judges came in as soon as the judges sat down brigadier general stephens said be seated potter sat he didnt want to let the enemy know he was nervous in the rows of seats in the spectators gallery behind him reporters poised pens above notebooks verdict day today the chief judge fixed him with an unfriendly stare the defendant will please rise yes your honor potter stood at attention without a doubt general potter you caused greater loss of life than any man before you in the history of the north american continent general stephens said that was cleverly phrased it ignored the hell the usas german allies unleashed on petrograd earlier and it also ignored the hell the united states visited on newport news and charleston all the same it remained technically true also without a doubt stephens continued you were able to do what you did thanks to a ruse of war one frowned on by the geneva convention carrying on the fight in the uniform of the foe skates close to the edge of the laws of war he looked as if his stomach pained him however he paused to pour himself a glass of water and sip from it as if to wash the taste of the word from his mouth then he had to say it again however another long pause it has also been demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that us forces utilized the identical ruse of war executing a man on the other side for something we also did ourselves strikes the court as unjust however much we might wish it did not this being so we find you not guilty of violating the laws of war in bringing your superbomb to philadelphia hubbub in the courtroom as reporters exclaimed some rushed out to file their stories no one paid any attention to the chief judges gavel through the chaos potter said may i tell you something sir go ahead no brigadier general stephens was not a happy man and over at the prosecutors table lieutenant colonel altrock looked as if hed just found half a worm in his apple i want to thank the court for its integrity general potter said i have to say i didnt expect it not from yankees was in his mind if not on his tongue stephens had to know it was there too his mouth twisted your enemies are men like you general he said that i believe is the principal meaning of this verdict potter inclined his head the point is well taken sir happy day stephens said bleakly please understand we dont approve of you even if we dont convict you you will be under surveillance for the rest of your life if you show even the slightest inclination toward trouble it will be your last mistake do i make myself clear abundantly clarence potter might have complained that he was being singled out for discriminatory treatment he might havebut he wasnt that kind of fool anyhow very well i gather the men who debriefed you have now finished yes sir potter said they have squeezed me flatter than a snake in a rolling mill hed told them everything about his trip up from lexington to philadelphia why not come what might he wouldnt do that again hed told them a lot about confederate intelligence operations too but not everything they thought hed told them more than he really had if they wanted to ferret out cs operatives up here though he thought theyd need more than hed given them the us brigadier general didnt laugh or even smile you may collect the balance of the pay owed you as an officer pow under the geneva convention and then you maygo he drank more water go where potter wondered nothing left of charleston not any more and not much left of richmond either not much left of the csa come to that he was a man without a country turning him loose might have been the cruelest thing the usa could do all the same he preferred it to getting his neck stretched may i ask a favor of the court sir before i return to civilian life he said what sort of favor if you needed a dictionary illustration for suspicious general stephens face would have filled the bill may i beg for a civilian suit of clothes this uniformpotter touched a butternut sleeve with his other handis less than popular in your country right now there are good and cogent reasons why that should be so too the chief judge said but he nodded a moment later he was at bottom a fairminded man i admit your request is reasonable you will have one if however you had asked for a us uniform in place of your own i would have refused you youve already done too much damage in our clothing my country is no longer at war with yours general my country no longer exists while our countries were at peace i lived peacefullyenoughin mine i intend to do the same again the suit they gave him didnt fit especially well the widebrimmed fedora that went with it might have looked good on a twentyfiveyearoldpimp the kindest thing he could say about the gaudy tie was that he never would have bought it himself he knotted it without a murmur now the less he looked like his usual self the better he judged his chances of getting out of philadelphia in one piece green banknotesno they were bills up herefilled his leatherette wallet he wondered what the economy was like down in the ruins of the csa would inflation run mad the way it had after the great war or were the yankees ramming their currency down the confederacys throat this time either way a wallet stuffed with greenbacks looked like good insurance they even gave him a train ticket to richmond that settled where he would go at least for the time being if he didnt have to pay for the ticket he could hang on to some more of his pow pay that seemed a good thing because he had no idea how to make more money all his adult life hed been either a soldierand the bottom had been blown out of the market for confederate soldiersor a private investigatorand he was at the moment one of the least private men on the continent his chuckle was sour but not sour enough to suit one of the us mps keeping an eye on him whats so damn funny the yankee asked i may be reduced to writing my memoirs potter answered and thats the kind of thing you do after you dont expect to do anything else the mps glance was anything but sympathetic you want to know what i think mac you already did too goddamn much that only shows i was doing my job yeah well if i was doing my job the us sergeant swung his submachine gun toward potter but only for a moment discipline held a good thing too potter thought they hustled him out of the courthouse through a back door a crowd of reporters gathered at the front of the building none of them paid any attention to the aging man in tasteless clothes who went by in the back seat of a ford us train stations didnt work exactly the same way as their cs equivalents did but they were pretty close potter found the right platform at the broad street station and waited for the train to come in some of the men on it turned out to be released confederate pows some looked like yankee hotshots on their way down to the csa to see what they could make by picking the corpses bones some just looked likepeople potter wondered what they thought of him in his present getup he thought he looked pretty shady he got to richmond late in the afternoon a us first lieutenant stood on the platform holding a sign with his name on it he thought of walking by but why give the united states excuses to land him in trouble im clarence potter he said my name is constantine palaiologos the us officer said call me costaeverybody does his rueful smile probably told of lots of childhood teasing since i got word youd be coming here i found an apartment for you howefficient potter murmured lieutenant palaiologos didnt even try to misunderstand him we do intend to keep an eye on you he said the building wasnt badly damaged during the war and its been repaired since its better than a lot of people here are living thanksi suppose potter said he smelled death in the air as the lieutenant drove him through the battered streets hed smelled it in philadelphia too it was part of the aftermath of war it was stronger here not surprisingly people looked shabbier than they did in the usa they walked with slumped shoulders and downcast eyesthey knew they were beaten all right for the first time since the early days of the lincoln administration the stars and stripes flew all over the city not just above the us embassy the apartment building didnt look too bad some of its neighbors still showed bomb damage but it even had glass in the windows again freshly painted spots of plaster probably repaired bullet holes but there werent a whole lot of buildings in richmond that a bullet or two hadnt hit sois this where you keep all the old sweats potter asked no general palaiologos answered seriously we try to separate you people as much as we can the further apart you are the less youll sit around plotting and making trouble in the usas shoes potter probably would have arranged things the same way he let the young lieutenant show him his new digs it wasa furnished apartment he could stand living here once he got a wireless and a phonograph and some books it might not even be too bad did i see a stationery store around the corner he asked i think so lieutenant palaiologos said as long as youve got a motorcar will you take me over there and run me back all right palaiologos spoke without enthusiasm but he didnt say no potter bought a secondhand typewriter a spare ribbon and two reams of paper not much better than foolscap he got the us officer to lug the typewriter up to the flat which was on the second floor i said i might write my memoirs potter told him after he put it on the kitchen table i may as well maybe the bookll make me enough money to live on palaiologos grunt was nothing if not skeptical and wearythe typewriter weighed a ton potter didnt care he ran a sheet of paper into the machine how i blew up philadelphia he typed in all caps by clarence potter brigadier general csa retired he took out the title page and put in another sheet i first met jake featherston late in o ne more election day in new york city one more trip to socialist party headquarters over the butchers shop one more tray of cold cuts from the democrat downstairs flora blackford put corned beef and pickles on a bagel one more term flora maria tresca said alevai flora knocked wood one reason she kept getting reelected was that she never took anything for granted she wasnt too worried this time around not for herself she hadnt been worried about the national ticket either not till the past couple of weeks nowi hope charlie la follette does what he ought to on paper the president of the usa had the world on a string the war was over hed been at the helm when his country won it the united states bestrode north america like a colossus the stars and stripes flew from baffin island to below the rio grande surely people would be grateful for thatwouldnt they not if they listened to the democrats they wouldnt tom dewey and his running mate were saying the war was all the socialists fault in the first place if al smith hadnt given jake featherston his plebiscite the confederate states wouldnt have got kentucky and the state of houston back how could they have gone to war without kentucky nobody now seemed to remember thered been guerrilla war in kentucky and houston and sequoyah before the plebiscite flora agreed that al smith might have chosen better but what he did choose wasnt halfway between idiocy and treason no matter how the democrats made it sound they were saying they could have fought the war better too and they were saying the united states went into it unprepared because the socialists spent years gutting war department budgets those budgets hadnt been exactly luxurious when democrat herbert hoover ran things either because of the economic collapse nobodyd had much money to spend on gunsnobody but jake featherston the democrats blamed the collapse on the socialists too more to the point they blamed it on hosea blackford that made flora see red yes her husband was president when it happened that didnt make it his fault except in too many peoples minds it did hosea was a oneterm president herman bruck looked at his watch every two years he seemed a little plumper a little grayer oh and i havent changed at all flora thought that would have been nice if only it were true seven oclock herman said ceremoniously the polls are closed he turned on a wireless set none of the results from the east coast would mean anything for a while that wouldnt stop the broadcasters from reporting them and pontificating over them it wouldnt stop inexperienced people from flabbling over them if they were bad or from celebrating too soon if they were good dewey jumps out to an early lead in vermont a reporter said breathlessly flora had to fight the giggles of course dewey led in vermont the sky would have to fall for him to do anything else vermont had been a rockribbed democratic stronghold for years do you think we can hold new york maria asked that was a more important question new york had a ton of electoral votes it went socialist more often than not but dewey the democrat was a popular governor how many people would vote for him for president because of that enough to swing the state i hope so flora said she didnt know what she could say past that polls called the race close but she didnt have much faith in them pollsters had proved spectacularly wrong before maine held its elections early and had already gone for dewey a moment later new hampshire also fell into his column again none of that was too surprising only in landslide years did upper new england fall out of the democratic camp but when early returns showed dewey with a substantial lead in massachusetts and connecticut flora began to worry both states were in play in most elections herman bruck said all depends on where the returns are coming from which put the best possible face on things he wasnt wrong but they shouldnt have needed to fret so soon new jersey seemed to be going socialist and by a solid majority that made flora breathe a little easier anyhow any year the socialists lost new jersey would probably not be a year where they held on to the presidency to drive her crazy returns from pennsylvania started coming in before any from new york those showed the race there neck and neck how many people in western pennsylvania were blaming the socialists for the confederate invasion two years earlier flora thought that would have happened regardless of who was running the country at the time but she could see how others might see things a different way here is some of the early tally from new york the newsman said everybody yelled for everybody else to hush these results show governor dewey with votes to president la follettes in the race for senator where are they coming from this time bruck wasnt the only one to ask the question several people shouted it at the same time the newscaster he went blithely on to results from west virginia ill find out herman bruck said and got on the telephone with the canvassing headquarters downtown when he hung up he might have been a balloon that had sprung a slow leak whats the matter flora asked seeing his face those are city returns not upstate he answered the news felt like a blow in the belly to flora new york political battles centered on whether socialist new york city could outvote the democratic hinterland if new york city leaned democratic if new york city leaned that way it was liable to be a long unhappy night and it was the air in socialist district headquarters went blue with tobacco smoke and bluer with profanity state after state fell to the democrats the republican candidate the energetic young governor of minnesota stole his home state and wisconsin from the socialists in threecornered races and also took traditional republican strongholds like indiana and kansas flora held her own seat her margin was down from the last election but she still won upwards of fiftyfive percent of the vote all the samei dont think were going to do it she said somewhere around one in the morning how could they be so ungrateful herman bruck said we won the war for them what more could they want a country too strong for the confederates even to think of attacking thats what flora looked around in the gloomy smoky headquarters no the ghost of robert taft wasnt sitting right behind her but it might as well have been the old democratic stalwart had an answer for the socialist cri de coeur after another hour the newsman said governor dewey and senator truman are going to claim victory the vice presidentelect spoke first his high twangy voice full of good humor he said im holding in my hands a copy of the chicago tribune the headline reads la follette beats dewey i dont know where they got that headline from but tonight tom dewey and the democratic party are winners cheers interrupted him he went on and tonight the american people are winners too more cheers it is now my privilege to introduce the new president of the united states tom dewey thank you harry the presidentelect said i am humbled and honored to be chosen to lead the united states in these tense and trying times i call on all peopledemocrats socialists and republicansto unite behind me to bind up the wounds of war and help guide the country into an era of peace and one of renewed prosperity and hope applause almost drowned him out he said all the right things charlie la follette could have used his speech without changing more than a couple of words flora would rather have heard it from la follette than dewey la follette had gone back to wisconsin to vote he didnt even carry his home state a few minutes after the democrats he came on the wireless the people have spoken he said i congratulate governor deweypresidentelect dewey as he is nowand wish him the best of luck in the next four years i did not expect to be president of the united states during the most profound crisis of the twentieth century under jake featherston the confederate states aimed not merely at beating us but at crushing us and subjecting us so we could never rise again instead we triumphed in the hardest war ever fought on this bloodsoaked continent perhaps we did not do everything as well as we might have that is easier to see in hindsight than it was through foresight but the people have called us to account for it as is their right may the new president fare well in ruling the territories we have gained and in the complex field of international relations with superbombs everyone is suddenly everyone elses nearest neighbor i will serve president dewey in whatever capacity he may find useful or in none if that be his pleasure serving the people of the united states has been the greatest privilege of my life thank you god bless you and good night that was charles la follette the outgoing president of the united states the announcer said unnecessarily a good goodbye herman bruck said as the wireless started catching up on races that remained close i wanted a good victory speech dammit flora said all through the crowded socialist headquarters heads bobbed up and down changeover time maria tresca remarked and it would be it looked as if the democrats would also capture the house though the senate would stay in socialist hands but an earthquake would hit the executive branch since only herbert hoovers single term had broken the socialists hold on the presidency lots of new and untested officials would try out lots of new and untested policies flora might have been in line to chair the house judiciary committee not now back to the minority that hadnt happened very often since the end of the great war if the democrats proposed foolish laws now that they ruled the roost she would do her best to keep them from passing why are the people so ungrateful bruck wondered out loud theres a story maria said back in the days when athens held ostracisms to get rid of politicians they didnt like an illiterate citizen who didnt recognize aristides the just came up to him and asked him to write aristides on a potsherd he did but he asked why the man answered im tired of hearing him called the just and thats what happened to us or something like it flora found herself nodding she said still its a shame to run on a platform where the main plank is throw the rascals in she got a laugh if it was tinged with bitternesswell why wouldnt it be she thought the socialists deserved better than theyd got from the people too no matter what she thought though she couldnt do anything about it every so often the government turned over the world wouldnt end the country wouldnt go down the draineven if the party in power always tried to make the voters think it would if the opposition won shed lost a brotherinlaw to war her own brother had lost a leg her son lost only a finger other than that joshua was fine and it wouldnt much affect the rest of his life next to important things like that how much did elections really matter a ll the arguing was over jonathan moss had done everything he could hed tried his damnedest to convince the us military court that jefferson pinkard had followed his own superiors legal orders when he ran his extermination camps in louisiana and texas hed done his best to persuade them that the usa had no jurisdiction over what the confederates did to their own people now the military judges were deliberating pinkard sat in the courtroom large and blocky and stolid only the way his jaw worked on some chewing gum showed he might be nervous you gave it everything you had he told moss i thought that jew who got hurt was hot stuff but youre good too dont reckon he couldve pulled any rabbits out of the hat that you didnt thanks moss said if hed satisfied his client his own conscience could stay reasonably clear that was just as well because he had no doubt in his own mind that pinkard was guilty if they didnt hang him would theycould theyhang anybody all rise the warrant officer who transcribed the proceedings intoned as the panel of judges entered the courtroom moss stood and came to attention jeff pinkard stood but didnt hed loudly denied that the court had any jurisdiction over him that wouldnt endear him to the men who judged him everyone sat down again we have reached a verdict in united states vs jefferson davis pinkard the chief judge said beside moss pinkard stiffened his jaw set he might claim he was ready for the army to convict him but he wasnt not down deep who could be no one was ever ready to face his own death the defendant will please rise the chief judge said pinkard did this time without being asked he did come to attention maybe the solemnity of the moment pressed on him in spite of himself hed fought in the great war nobody said hed been anything but brave nobody said that about jake featherston either bravery wasnt enough not by itself the cause for which you showed courage counted too jefferson davis pinkard we find you guilty of crimes against humanity the chief judge said pinkards shoulders sagged the breath hissed out of him as if hed been punched in the gut the officer pronouncing his fate continued we sentence you to be hanged by the neck until you are dead at a date to be set by competent military authority may god have mercy on your soul jonathan moss jumped to his feet your honor i appeal this conviction and the sentence youve imposed you have that privilege the chief judge said appeals will be heard by the secretary of war and no doubt by the president of the united states i do not believe the upcoming change in administrations will affect the process he was bound to be right the outgoing socialists wouldnt show mercy to someone like jeff pinkard they were the ones whod brought him to justice in the first place and the democrats had campaigned by saying if we were running things we would have been even tougher still you had to go do everything you could do you have any statement for the record mr pinkard the chief judge asked damn right i do pinkard saidhe had no quit in him you can hang me you won and you caught me so you can but that dont make it right i was doing a job of work in my own country following orders from the attorney general of the csa ferdinand koenig has also been sentenced to death among other things for giving those orders the chief judge broke in jeff pinkard shook his head he was furious not bewildered its none of your goddamn business what we did it wasnt your country and they werent your people we made it our business the chief judge replied we want people everywhere to get the message doing things like this is wrong and you will be punished for it and besides mr pinkard you know as well as i doif youd won the war you would have started in on us next pinkard didnt even waste time denying it he just said yeah and youdve had it coming too fuck you all assholes take him away the chief judge said and several burly soldiers did just that with a weary sigh the chief judge used the gavel this court is now adjourned major goodman came over to moss you did everything you could colonel you had a losing case and a losing client hes a coldblooded hardnosed son of a bitch and he deserves everything hes going to get yeah i know moss said you still have to try hes got courage i was just thinking that a minute ago courage is overrated how many brave butternut bastards did we just have to kill the military prosecutor said you have to understand what youre fighting for otherwise youre an animala brave animal maybe but an animal all the same i wont argue with you i feel the same way moss said he cant complain he wasnt well represented the chief judge said you did a fine job colonel you did everything we let you do and you would have done more if wed left more in the rules not letting me do more will be part of the appeal moss said the question of jurisdiction still troubles me you saw the evidence the chief judge said did you go to camp humble and see the crematoria and the barracks and the barbed wire did you go out to snyder and take a look at the mass graves no sir i didnt want to prejudice myself against him any worse than i was already moss said all right i can understand that it speaks well of you as a matter of fact but what are we supposed to do with him tell him not to be naughty again and turn him loose id break every mirror in the house if we did well so would i when you put it that way moss said one of the reasons i dont feel worse about defending him is that i knew he wouldnt get off no matter what i did still technically the chief judge made a slashing motion with his right hand the law is about technicalities a lot of the time not here we arent about to let quibbles keep us from making pinkard and koenig and the rest pay for what they can i hear we were going to shoot featherston without trial if we caught him but that got taken care of didnt it just moss said that colored kids got it made hell be a hero the rest of his life too damn bad all the other blacks had to pay such a price he suspected one reason the united states were making so much of cassius was to keep from noticing their own guilty conscience what about you colonel the chief judge asked youre going through the motions with the appeal and we both know it what are you really going to do once this case winds down looks like private practice moss answered without enthusiasm in wartime the army didnt mind using pilots with gray hair i even got to fly a turbo in combat and that was something no two ways about it but they dont want to keep me in that slot now and i cant even say i blame em fighter pilot is really a young mans game i was impressed with the way you handled yourself here the judge said are you interested in joining the judge advocates staff full time this is one of those places where you can count on skill to beat reflexes look at me for instance his hair was grayer than moss huh moss said an exclamation of thoughtful surprise hadnt even thought of that sir dont know why not probably because i got this assignment taking over from the poor guy in the motorcar crash it always felt temporary to me the chief judge nodded i take your point and if youve had enough of living on an officers salary i can see that too youll eat steak more often if you go civilian moss started to laugh ill tell you another reason you took me by surprise i spent my whole career between the wars trying to kick military justice in the teeth up in canada i know i checked up on you the chief judge said calmly if you wanted to you could do the same thing here lord knows youd have plenty of business that crossed my mind sir moss said cant say it thrills me though far as i can see the canucks got a raw deal i think id say the same thing if i didnt fall in love with a canadian girl but the white confederates i was on the ground in georgia for a couple of years remember those people deserve everything theyre getting and another dollars worth besides think about switching sides then the chief judge said plenty more trials coming up not all of them will be as cutanddried as jefferson pinkards either we do need people who can conduct a good defense and youve shown you can do that and then some but we need prosecutors too he was bound to be right about the upcoming trials how many people had helped shove negroes into cattle cars how many had run up barbed wire and put brick walls around colored districts in the csa how many had done or might have done all the things the confederacy needed so it could turn massacre from a campaign promise to reality and what would they say now i was at the front or i was working in a factory or i never liked the freedom party anyway some would be telling the truth some would be telling some of the truth some would be lying through their teeth sorting out who was who and giving the ones who deserved something what they deserved would take years god only knew it would take plenty of lawyers too i dont think id want to defend vern green say any time soon moss said the guard chief at the texas camps pinkard had run was on trial here too and it was a sure thing his neck would stretch along with his boss one of these is about as much as i can stomach at least from this side somebody where there really was some doubt about what he didthat might be a different story nobody wants to do many of these the chief judge said i dont think you can do many of these not if youre going to stay sane we try not to drive our staff members loopyon purpose think about it you dont have to make up your mind right away in fact if you want to think about it over a drink down in the officers clubgod knows i need one and i bet you do too sir that is the best idea ive heard in a long time moss said whiskey probably didnt do much for the thought process it worked wonders on moss attitude though and attitude mattered here at least as much as actual thought was this what he wanted to do with the rest of his working life halfway down the second drink he asked will the judge advocates staff handle claims by negroes against whites in the csa i dont know the chief judge looked startled therell sure be some wont there only way thered be more was if more negroes lived moss answered but if youre involved in that count me in and if youre not you ought to be ashamed of yourselves i cant think of anything down here that needs doing more now that you mention it neither can i the chief judge said hed sentenced jefferson pinkard to hang that was hisand the usasobligation to the dead that the usa might also have an obligation to the living didnt seem to have crossed his mind till now moss wondered how many other important peoples minds it also hadnt crossed too manyhe was sure of that people in the usa kept doing their best not to think about negroes or have anything to do with them the same as they had ever since the csa seceded moss finished that second drink and waved for another one he was also sure of something else he was sure hed found himself a new cause w hat happened to your legs by the way the girl at miss lucys eyed michael pound he might have come down with a horrible social disease he shrugged i got caught in a burning barrel oh she was about twentyfive cute enough even if she wasnt gorgeous and plainly not long on brains that must not have been much fun sweetheart you said a mouthful and speaking of which pound gestured with a small sigh the girl dropped to her knees he liked officers brothels a hell of a lot better than the ones enlisted men had to use the girls were prettier nobody hurried you here either that was best of all he could take his time and enjoy it he could and he did afterwards he left the girlher name was bettya couple of dollars for herself you dont need to say anything to miss lucy about em well ill try but when it comes to cash that old bitch has a yranging set like you wouldnt believe betty spoke with more resignation than rancor pound got back into his uniform see you again maybe he said she nodded if she was enthusiastic she hid it very well she didnt mind his money but she sure wasnt thrilled about him well he was old enough to be her father and he was a damnyankee and she was a whore and he was a trick that left it fourth down and time to punt miss lucys had a bar tooone more amenity enlisted mens brothels didnt enjoy maybe the assumption was that officers wouldnt get plastered and smash whiskey bottles over each others heads from everything pound had seen whoever made that assumption was an optimist things seemed peaceable enough in there now pound stepped in and asked for a whiskey over ice comin up said the woman behind the bar she was one of the working girls maybe she had her monthlies or something thanks he said when she gave it to him did this place have a regular bartender back before the war sure did but hadrian he uh dont work here no more right pound knocked back the drink the booze wasnt bad but it tasted foul in his mouth with a name like hadrian the exbartender had probably been colored and the odds that he was dead now were pretty damn good pound set the glass on the bar let me have another one sure will the woman poured whiskey into a fresh glass and added a couple of ice cubes boy you drank that last one in a hurry yeah pound said she didnt know what was eating him she didnt have the faintest idea as a matter of fact that she didnt was a measure of the csas damnation two good knocks of whiskey made pound a little less graceful on his burned legs than he would have been without them he walked back to boq through deepening twilight there was a nip in the air tallahassee lay in the northern part of florida it got cool in the wintertime unlike places farther south but the weather wasnt the biggest thing on his mind his head kept going back and forth he wished he had an eye that would let him see to the rear this was the time of day when us soldiers got knocked over the head by the time anyone found them the bushwhackers were long gone that didnt keep hostages from being taken and shot but killing innocent people also made the guerrillas have an easier time recruiting he got back to boq without any trouble most people did most of the time anything that could happen though could happen to you anybody who didnt understand that never went to war being carelessbeing stupidmade living to a ripe old age less likely pound aspired to getting shot by an outraged husband at the age of when he went to breakfast the next morning he realized something was up he didnt know what colonel einsiedel wasnt letting on something was cooking though a few people in the know were all excited about it whatever it was pound and the others who noticed that tried to get it out of them the rest of the officers shoveled in bacon and eggs oblivious to the drama around them the doublechinned major sitting next to pound was one of those dammit they should have had hash browns he complained i dont like grits he might not have liked them but hed put away a goodsized helping pound didnt like them either he also hadnt taken any hed doubled up on toast instead to him that was simple common sense it seemed beyond the major dear god how did we win the war he thought that answer seemed only too obvious there were just as many thumbfingered blundering idiots on this side of the former border as on the other one no matter where you went you couldnt escape the dullards life would have been easier and happier if you could that afternoon the other shoe dropped harry truman was coming to tallahassee to talk to the troops and to any locals who wanted to listen to him an officer who was with pound when the news got out knew exactly what he thought of that they better frisk these bastards before they let em within rifle range of the guy amen pound said and then a beat later dibs on the girls he held out his hands as if he were cupping breasts the other officer laughed truman arrived by airplane two days later that was judged safer than traveling by train sabotaging railroad tracks was easy but confederate diehards didnt have much in the way of antiaircraft guns pounds barrel was one of the machines guarding the airport as the vice presidentelects airliner touched down on the runway pound stood up in the cupola and peered at truman through binoculars the senator from missouri wasnt young but he walked with crisp stride and straight back an almost military bearing fair enoughhed been an artillery officer in the great war not many healthy men in the usa had missed military service in one war or the other even fewer in what had been the csa the vice presidentelect spoke in front of the state capitol they set up a podium and lectern for him by a palm tree on the lawn in front of the italian renaissance building sure enough military policemen and female auxiliaries searched people in civilian clothes before letting them past rope lines half a mile from the podium they also searched uniformed personnel the war had shown that people had no trouble getting their hands on uniforms that didnt belong to them and doing unpleasant things in the other sides plumage what sort of floridians would listen to the vice presidentelect of the usa michael pound eyed them curiously some he recognizedcollaborators they figured they knew which side their bread was buttered on thered been some of that flexible breed north of the ohio a couple of years earlier they caught hell when they turned out to have guessed wrong these plump fellows and their sleek women were less likely to be mistaken othersmore ordinary folksseemed honestly curious that gave pound at least a little hope if they could get used to the idea of being part of the usaitd take a miracle and when was the last one you saw the cynical part of his mind jeered the rest of him had no good answer colonel einsiedel stepped up to the mike mounted on the lectern ladies and gentlemen it is my pleasure and my privilege to present the honorable harry s truman of missouri vice presidentelect of the united states of america along with the other soldiers pound clapped till his palms stung applause from the local civilians seemed much more measured well that was no surprise metalframed eyeglasses gleaming in the sun truman looked out over the crowd if anybody would have told me ten years ago that i would come to florida to speak to my countrys soldiers here i would have said he was crazy to pounds ear shaped in the northern midwest trumans missouri twang had more than a little in common with the local drawl didnt jake featherston say give me five years and you wont recognize the confederate states the vice presidentelect went on his jaunty grin invited soldiers and locals alike to see the bitter joke well the man was right but not quite the way he expected to be and now the united states have to pick up the pieces the buck stops with us if we do this wrong our grandchildren will be down here fighting guerrillas if we do it right maybe we can all remember that we started out as one country we have a lot of things to put behind us before were one country again but we can try his voice toughened that doesnt mean the usa will be soft down here you people who spent your lives as confederates have no reason to love us not yet and we have to be careful about trusting you too you stained yourself with the darkest crime a people can commit and too many of you arent sorry enough so things wont happen in a hurry if they happen at all but for the past eightyodd years people in the usa and people in the csa have all called themselves americans maybe if we work together one day that will mean what it did before the war of secession maybe it will mean we really are all part of the same country once again i hope so anyhow thats what president dewey and i will work for well be as firm as we need to be but we wont be any firmer than that if people down here work with us maybe well get where we ought to go god grant we do he stepped away from the lectern this time the applause from the soldiers was less enthusiastic that from the civilians more so pound didnt think it was a bad speech truman was setting out what he hoped would happen not necessarily what he expected to happen if the survivors in the csa got rambunctious the army could always smash them the vice presidentelect didnt just go away he plunged into the crowd shaking hands and talking with soldiers and locals alike reading the ribbons on michael pounds chest he said you had yourself a time lieutenant well sir thats one way to put it pound said i just want you to know that what youre doing here is worthwhile truman said we have to hold this country down while we reshape it it wont be easy it wont be quick it wont be cheap but weve got to do it what if we cant pound asked if we cant some time around the turn of the century the new vice presidentelect will come down here to tell your grandson what an important job hes doing and theyll still search the locals before they let them listen pound had no children he knew about the army had been his life but he understood what truman was talking about what do you think of our chances he asked i dont know truman didnt seem to have much patience with beating around the bush weve got to try though what other choice do we have treating these people the way they treated their negroes michael pound sounded perfectly serious he was he faced the possibility of massacring twentyodd million people as a problem of ways and means not an enormity the army had been shooting hostages since it entered the csa now the whole confederacy was a hostage but truman shook his head no not even these people will ever turn me into jake featherston id sooner blow out my own brains he passed on to another officer had pound worried about his career he would have wondered if hed just blighted it he didnt he could go on doing his job right where he was even if they busted him down to private for opening his big mouth he could still help the country and they wouldnt do that he knew it he had his niche he fit it well he aimed to stay in it as long as he could w inter in riviиreduloup started early and stayed late after close to three years in warmer climes leonard odoull had to get used to the weather in the republic of quebec again he tried not to grumble too loud people here would just laugh at him they took month after month of snow in stride theyd never known anything else odoull had to get used to a new office too he hadnt sublet the other one when he rejoined the army hed just let it go he reached for things in places where they had been only to find they were somewhere else little by little he made such mistakes less often and he had to get used to a practice that wasnt nearly so frantic as what he had been doing a sty on the eye or a boil on the butt hardly seemed exciting not after all the quick and desperate surgery hed performed in a way that was heartening in another wayhe felt like a man whod gone from ten cups of coffee a day to none all at once some of the energy had leaked out of his life his wife was convinced that was a good thing youre home you can relax she told himand told him and told him after a while he got better at pretending to believe her one freezing morning in early december his receptionist said a monsieur quigley is here to see you she made a hash of the name as any francophone would have odoull had had to get used to speaking french again too that came back fast these days he sometimes switched languages without noticing he was doing it send him in he said at once jedediah quigley had to be well up into his seventies now the retired us officer was a little stooped but still seemed spry your country owes you a debt of gratitude dr odoull he said in elegant parisian french the backcountry patois spoken here had never touched his accent the way it had odoulls thats nice odoull replied in english he waved to the chair in front of his desk then pulled out a couple of habanas cigar dont mind if i do quigley said whered you come by these friend of minea sergeant named granny mcdougaldis a medic in the force occupying cuba he sent me a present odoull answered they both lit up and filled the air with fragrant smoke quigley eyed the cigar with respect smooth that was mighty kind of him ill say leonard odoull nodded the box got here a few days ago granny and i worked together for a long time till he took a bullet in the leg he remembered the name of my home town and sodamn kind of him odoull smiled mcdougald didnt have to do anything like that if he did it it was because he wanted to because he thought the doc hed worked with was a pretty good guy knowing somebody you thought well of figured you were a pretty good guy would make anybody feel good im glad you came through in one piece quigley said i would have felt guilty if you stopped something odoull didnt laugh in his face but he came close tell me another one he said youve got the conscience of a snappy turtle why doctor you say the sweetest things damned if jedediah quigley didnt bat his eyes it was as ridiculous as watching michelangelos david giggle and simper this time odoull did laugh well what can i do for you you old fraud he said or what are you trying to do to me do to you if i hadnt taken lucien galtiers land for that hospital you never would have met your wife is this the thanks i get quigley said merci beaucoup there and you sent me off to war and i almost got ventilated more times than i can count id call that a push or close enough odoull returned and you never come around for no reason whats your game this time game quigley was the picture of offended innocence i dont know what youre talking about and then you wake up now tell me another oneone ill believe odoull blew a smoke ring i never could do that jedediah quigley complained he tried and blew out a shapeless cloud of smoke he puffed again and again managed only a smoke blob odoull sat and waited smoking his own habana sooner or later the retired colonel would come to the point if he wanted to go slow he could go slow maybe a patient would come in that would give odoull an excuse to throw him out time stretched quigley smoked his cigar down small he eyed the glowing coal odoull kept on waiting here in riviиreduloup nothing was likely to happen in a hurry relearning that had taken odoull a while if you were going to improve us army medical care how would you go about it quigley asked at last simple odoull replied i wouldnt get in a war youre not as funny as you think you are the older man told him whos joking odoull said its the gods truth and im a citizen of the republic you cant do anything horrible to me unless im dumb enough to decide ill let you the way you were when you put on the uniform again oui certainement just like that odoull said and i damn well was dumb too calisse was i ever how many lives did you save quigley asked a good many but any other doc could have done the same hell granny mcdougald could have saved most of them an experienced medic gets to where hes just about as good as an md he makes up in experience what hes missing in education thats something wed want to know can you write it down along with anything else you can think of why are you picking me why are you picking on me odoull asked youve got lots of doctors down in the usa and csa who still belong to the army let them crank out the recommendations some of them will if anything fazed quigley he didnt let on but we want you too exactly because youre an outsider you dont have a military career to care about you dont need to worry about stepping on toes whos we odoull inquired you and your tapeworm weve got some new medicines for that too he couldnt get a rise out of his not especially welcome guest come on doctor dont be silly you know i still have connections sure you do youre the guy the usa uses to tell the republic which way to jump odoull said but im not the republic and youre not in quebec city so you can play nice or you can get lost i am playing nice quigley said i could be much less pleasant than i am but if i browbeat you you wouldnt do a good job you really would be helping here if youd take the time to do it how nasty could jedediah quigley be if he set his mind to it odoull wasnt sure he wanted to find out the thought reshaped itself he was sure he didnt want to find out yes that was a lot more accurate you talked me into it he said quigley didnt even look smug he knew he was a power in the land all right grumpily odoull went on you know youll be making me remember some things id rather forget people here didnt understand what this war was like they didnt understand how lucky they were to be ignorant either odoull would have been happy to let his memories slide down into oblivion too but quigley damn him was going to make sure that didnt happen once you started putting things down on paper they were yours forevermore all quigley said was this is for your countrys good odoull wasnt having that guys get their balls blown off for their countrys good you think that makes them feel any better about it no of course not quigley said i doubt this will hurt quite so much though he was right dammit sighing odoull asked when do you want this report two weeks with another sigh the doctor nodded youll have it and stay out of my hair after that thank you kindly by the way quigley said it odoull was taking care of something he wanted to do not something hed been browbeaten into taking on the older man rose nodded and went on his way outside snow would lie at least ankle deep this was riviиreduloup all right odoull had grown up in massachusetts he was used to rugged weather riviиreduloup outdid everything hed ever known back in the states it wasnt even close half an hour later he had a patient hello doctor said martin lacroix a plump prosperous baker whose shop lay down the street from odoulls new office bonjour odoull replied what seems to be your trouble monsieur well i have this rash lacroix pulled up his shirt sleeve to display his left biceps ive tried home remedies on it but they dont do much good im not surprisedthats ringworm odoull said you should keep it covered as much as you can because it can spread ill give you a prescription to take to the pharmacy put it on twice a day and it should clear things up in a month or so a month the baker said in dismay why not sooner if you give me a shot or some pills cant i get rid of it in a few days people knew there were new medicines that could cure some ailments quickly and easily naturally people thought the new medicines could cure any ailment quickly and easily but things didnt work that way odoull spent a while explaining the difference between microbes and fungi he wasnt sure lacroix got it the baker left carrying the prescription but shaking his head after a case like that writing about the work odoull had done during the war didnt seem so bad that at least had mattered this while he was sewing and splinting and cutting hed looked forward to this with a fierce and simple longing now that he had it again he discovered the danger of getting exactly what you thought you wanted it could prove as unfortunate in real life as in fairy tales he was home with nicole that was as good as it always had been but his practiceafter youd spent time as a battlefield surgeon prescribing ringworm salve didnt seem the same another patient came in franзoise boulanger had arthritis and well she mightshe was seventyseven and shed worked hard all her life she hurt and she had trouble moving odoull didnt have much to offer her aspirin to take the edge from pain and inflammation heating pads and warm baths to soothe a little he would have given her the same advice before the great war if hed been practicing before the war of secession he would have substituted laudanum for aspirin franзoise might have got hooked on the opiated brandy but it would have done as much for her pain as the little white pills did maybe more leaning on her cane she shuffled out of the office is this what ive got to look forward to for the rest of my professional life god if he could have brought nicole with him he would have run for alabama and a military hospital a little boy with strep throat made him feel happier penicillin would take care of that and would make sure the kid didnt come down with rheumatic fever or endocarditis odoull felt hed earned his fee there and done some real good all the same he wasnt used to taking it easy any more he wondered if he ever would be a corporal waited on the platform when abner dowling got off the train at the broad street station saluting the noncom said ill take you to the war department sir obliged dowling said the corporal grabbed his suitcase too it wasnt heavy but dowling didnt complain ten years earlier he knew he would have he still wasnt as old as george custer had been when the great war broke out but he needed only another six years philadelphia looked better than it had the last time he was there more craters were filled in more ruined buildings were torn down of course the superbomb hadnt gone off right here how are things on the other side of the river he asked sir theyre still pretty uh fouled up the corporal would have said something strong talking with one of his buddies as he braked for a red light he added thats such a big mess god knows when theyll set it to rights i suppose dowling said believe it sir its the truth the corporal sounded missionary in his zeal to convince dowling already believed hed spent too much time talking with henderson v fitzbelmont to do anything else fitzbelmont wasnt the most exciting man ever bornan understatement but hed put a superbomb together while the united states was doing their goddamnedest to blow lexington off the map dowling didnt like him but did respect his professional competence so did the us physicists whod interrogated him they were impressed hed done as much as he had under the conditions in which he had to work the war department looked a lot better than it had when the confederates tried their best to knock it flat now repairmen could do their job without fighting constant new damage the concrete barriers around the massive structure remained in place no cs diehards or mormon fanatics or stubborn canucksrebellion still flared north of the bordercould grab an easy chance to autobomb the place dowling walked from the barricades up to the entrance he wheezed climbing the stairs his heart pounded he was carrying a lot of weight around and hed just reminded himself how young he wasnt i made it through the war though thats all thatwell most of whatreally counts despite the stars on his shoulder straps he got frisked before he could go inside the soldiers who patted him down didnt take anything for granted when dowling asked about that one of them said sir the way things are well be doing this forever too many assholes running around looseuh pardon my french ive met the word dowling remarked the enlisted men grinned a corporal in a uniform with creases sharp enough to shave with took dowling down into the bowels of the earth to john abells office these days the more deeply you were buried the bigger the wheel you were and abell was a bigger wheelhe now sported two stars on his shoulder straps congratulations major general dowling said and stuck out his hand thanks the general staff officers grip was stronger than his slender build and pallid face would have made you think hed been fair almost to the point of ghostliness even before he started impersonating a mole but he had to be really good at what he did to rise as high as he had without a field command well that was nothing dowling hadnt already known whats the latest dowling asked we finally have a handle on the rising in saskatoon abell answered they surrendered on a promise that wed treat them as powsand that we wouldnt superbomb the place good god dowling said were we thinking of it nobut the canucks dont need to know that the younger man replied well well a use for superbombs i hadnt thought of dowling said just knowing weve got em on inventory is worth something indeed abell said speaking of which how is professor fitzbelmont before answering dowling asked am i allowed to talk about that with you abells smile was cold but his smiles usually were oh yes thats one of the reasons you were ordered back here hes a more than capable physicist and he had some good engineers working under him dowling said thats the opinion of people who ought to know what with as much of this town as he blew up id say theyre right what do we do with him abell asked hes kind of like a bomb himself isnt he all that stuff he knowsdamn good thing featherston didnt want to listen to him at first damn good thing if the japs or the russians kidnapped him id flabble dowling said and hed sing hed sing like a nightingale hed probably think it wasinteresting our german allies dont want the russians getting a superbomb abell said nobody wants the japanese getting one except them dowling said yes except them john abell jotted something in a notebook even upside down his script looked clear and precise probably about time for him to have an unfortunate accident dont you think then we wont have to worry about what hes up to and where he might goor as you say might be taken what had he just written down kill henderson fitzbelmont the way someone else might have written eggs salami ѕ pound butter dowling didnt know but that was what he would have bet and abell wanted his opinion of the idea too what was he supposed to say what came out of his mouth was well i think weve learned about as much from him as were going to abell nodded that was my next question if were going to do this it really does have to look like an accident dowling said we give the diehards a martyr if we screw up dont worry about it the people we use are reliable abell said very sad but if the professor tried to cross the street in front of a command car i see dowling wondered if he saw anything but the tip of the iceberg how many confederates have already had uh unfortunate accidents i cant talk about that with you the general staff officer answered some people we cant convict for crimes against humanity still dont deserve to live though or will you tell me im wrong dowling thought about that he thought about everything that had happened in the csa since jake featherston took over slowly he shook his head nope i wont say boo good i didnt expect you would abell gave another of his chilly smiles tell me general have you given any thought to your retirement the question might have been a knife in abner dowlings guts so this is the other reason they called me to philadelphia he thought dully he didnt know why he was surprised not many men his age were still serving but he thought hed done as well as a man could reasonably do of course when you got old enough that didnt mean anything any more theyd kick you out regardless if it had happened to george custerand it hadit could happen to anybody with that in mind dowling answered custer got over sixty years in the army ive had more than forty myself that doesnt match him but its not a bad run im not ready to go but i will if the war department thinks its time im afraid the war department does abell said this implies no disrespect only the desire to move younger men forward your career has been distinguished in all respects and no one would say otherwise if id held ohio but dowling shook his head even that probably wouldnt have mattered much the only way you could keep from getting old was by dying before you made it the past three years far too many people had done that its not personal or political abell said i understand that you feel general custers retirement was both oh it was dowling said i was there when the socialists stuck it to him there was blood on the floor by the time n matoon thomas got done i shouldnt wonder custer was a ah vivid figure abell wasnt lying and the sun was warm and the ocean was moist the general staff officer went on i repeat though none of those factors applies in your case bully dowling saidslang even more antiquated than he was i get put out to pasture any which way if youd been asked to retire during the war it might have shown dissatisfaction with your performance we needed your experience then now we have the chance to train younger men abell said he was putting the best face he could on it he wasnt a hundred percent convincing but he didnt miss by much even sohow long before they put you out to pasture dowling asked brutally i may have a few more years or they may ask me to step down tomorrow abell answered with every appearance of sangfroid i hope ill know when its time to say goodbye i dont know that i will but i hope so time to say goodbye dowling echoed when i started no one was sure what the machine gun was worth now fitzbelmont talks about blowing up rhode island with one bomb best thing that could happen to it abell observed heh dowling said maybe it is time for me to go believe me the army appreciates everything you did abell said your success in west texas changed the whole moral character of the war dowling knew what that meant not even us citizens who didnt like negroes could stomach killing them in carload lots that was why jefferson pinkard would swing dowlings eleventh army had shown that the massacres werent just propaganda the confederates really were doing those thingsand a lot of them were proud of it wellthank you dowling said it wasnt exactly what hed hoped to be remembered for when he graduated from west point but it was better than not being remembered at all as custers longtime adjutant hed been only a footnote the one time hed been important was when he lied to the war department about what custer and morrell planned to do with barrels that he hoped wouldnt go down in history in this war hed carved out a niche for himself it wasnt a custersized niche if anybody had that one this time around it was irving morrell but a niche it was you might do worse than think about publishing your memoirs in timely fashion abell said a lot of highranking officers will be doing that if you get yours out there before most of the others it can only work to your advantage if i do that dowling thought i will have to talk about lying to the war department a good many people would read a memoir of his precisely because hed worked with custer for so long but work with custer wasnt all hed donenot even close didnt the world deserve to know as much ill think about it he said all right abell nodded briskly hed solved a problem dowling wouldnt be difficult not the way custer had the general staff officer went on do you want to head over to the press office to help them draft a release about your retirement do i want to dowling shrugged not especially i will though what did proverbs say one generation passeth away and another generation cometh but the earth abideth forever he hadnt passed away yet but he was passing the united states like the earth would abide and hed helped make that so xix h i hon sally dover said when jerry came back to the house you got a telephone call maybe half an hour ago oh yeah dover gave his wife the kind of absentminded kiss people whove been married a long time often share good thing we didnt take it out yet then that was coming soon he feared you could pretend to stay middleclass for a while when you were out of work but only for a while after that you started saving every cent you could every way you could the dovers werent eating meat very often these days and most of the meat they did eat was sowbelly heres the number she gave him a scrap of paper hed hoped it would be the huntsmans lodge it wasnt he knew that number by heart of course he knew the numbers for just about all the restaurants in augusta by heart this wasnt any of them if it was anything that had to do with work whether in a restaurant or not he would leap at it now he dialed the operator and gave her the number she put the call through it rang twice before someone on the other end picked it up this is mr broxtons residence the voice was unfamiliar the accent wasntif the man hadnt been born in mexico jerry dover was an eskimo hope was also unfamiliar charlemagne broxtonand wasnt that a name to rememberwas the principal owner of the huntsmans lodge heart thuttering dover gave his name im returning mr broxtons call he said oh yes sir one moment please thebutlersaid back before the war charlemagne broxton had had colored servants who among the wealthy in augusta hadnt where were they now nobody whod lived through the war wanted to think about things like that nobody on the confederate side anywaythe damnyankees were much too fond of asking such inconvenient and embarrassing questions broxton here this voice was deep and gruff and familiar that you dover no my names reilly and i sell lampshades the mad idiot quip flickered through dovers mind and fortunately went out yeah its me mr broxton what can i do for you sir well i hear youre looking for work broxton said how would you like your old job back id like that fine mr broxton but what happened to willard sloan jerry dover asked shut up are you out of your mind sally mouthed at him he ignored her no matter how tight things were he didnt want to put a cripple on the street that could have happened to him if a bullet or a shell fragment changed course by a few inches well we had to let him go broxton answered how come dover persisted not for my sake i hope he could do the job sally looked daggers at him he went right on pretending not to see didnt have anything to do with that broxton said jerry dover waited the restaurant owner coughed can you keep this quiet i dont want to hurt his chances somewhere else cmon mr broxton how many years have you known me do i blab dover said well no charlemagne broxton coughed again we caught him taking rakeoffs from suppliers big rakeoffs and so if some food disappeared from the restaurant well that was part of the overhead the manager and the cooks and the waiters and the busboys all stole a little skimming cash was something else again if you got caught you got canned the one might not cost more than the other but it went over the line dover wondered why sloan needed to do it was he a gambler was he paying somebody else off dover knew too much about that or did he just get greedy if he did he was pretty dumb and so people were dumb all the goddamn time if you need me back you know ill be there dover said good i hoped youd say that charlemagne broxton coughed one more time ahthere is the question of your pay he named a figure just over half of what dover had been making before he went into uniform you can do better than that mr broxton dover said i happen to know you were paying willard sloan more than that sally gave him a freedom party salute he scowled at her that was dangerous even in private and if you did it in private you might slip and do it in public his wife stuck out her tongue at him broxton sighed business isnt what it used to be but all right ill give you what i was giving sloan he named another figure which did indeed just about match what jerry dover had heard then he said dont try fooling around to bump it up the way sloan did if you think i will you better not hire me dover replied if i thought you would i wouldnt have called broxton said but i didnt think sloan would either dammit when do you want me to start dover asked fast as you can get over to the restaurant the owner answered ive got luis tending to it now and i want him to go back to boss cook fast as he can a greaser in that spotd steal me blind fastern sloan did from what jerry dover had seen honesty and its flip side had little to do with color he didnt argue with charlemagne broxton though be there in half an hour he promised and hung up sally flew into his arms and kissed him they want you back she said he nodded her smile was bright as the sun shed worked in a munitions plant during the war but times had been lean since money coming in was a good thing after dover detached himself from her he put on a tie and a jacket and hustled off to the huntsmans lodge he didnt want to be late even by a minute as he hurried along augustas battered streets he contemplated ways and means he didnt want the head cook pissed off at him that was trouble with a capital t hed have to find a way to keep luis sweet or else get him out of the restaurant to his relief the mexican didnt seem angry id rather cook he said the suppliers all they do is try to screw you you want to take it seсor dover you welcome to it dovers grin was pure predator i dont take it man i give it luis blinked then he grinned too before dover could give it he had to find out what was there he checked the refrigerators and the produce bins the menu had changed a little since he went into the army part of that was because some things were unavailable part of it was because the damnyankees who made up such a big part of the clientele these days had different tastes from the regulars whod filled the place before the war a glance at the list of telephone numbers in the managers office said a good many suppliers had changed too some of the old bunch were probably dead some were more likely out of business and some of the new ones had been giving sloan kickbacks damned if you dont sound like jerry dover said a butcher jerryd known for a long time yeah its me all right phil dover agreed so your days of fucking the huntsmans lodge are over through finished got it i wouldnt do that phil the butcher sounded painfully pure of heart he gave dover a pain all right yeah and then you wake up he said sweetly he also enjoyed introducing himself to the new suppliers if they gave him what they said they would and gave him decent prices he didnt expect to have any trouble with them if they tried to palm crap off on himhe chuckled in anticipation theyd find out boy would they ever for tonight the place would run on what luis had laid in from what dover had seen the boss cook hadnt done badly if he didnt want the jobwell that made things easier all the way around most of the time jerry stayed behind the scenes he would only come out and show himself to the customers if somebody wasnt happy and the waiters couldnt set things right by themselves tonight though he felt not just an urge but an obligation to look around and make sure things ran smoothly he didnt want charlemagne broxton to regret hiring him back everything seemed all right the mexican waiters and busboys sounded different from the negroes whod been here before but they knew what to do hed started hiring mexicans during the war hed already seen that they werent allergic to work the customers seemed happy some of them were locals one or two even recognized him which left him surprised and pleased more were us officers they didnt know him from a hole in the wall which suited him fine if the local women with them did know him they didnt let on then around ten oclock a woman waved to him she wasnt local which didnt mean he didnt know her he wished hed stayed in his office melanie leigh waved again imperiously this time he didnt want to go over to the table she shared with a us colonel but he feared he had no choice hello jerry she said as brightly as if she hadnt been his blackmailing mistress and a likely yankee spy don this is lieutenantcolonel jerry dover weve been friends a long time jerry this is don gutteridge im very retired colonel gutteridge dover said hesitantly offering his hand gutteridge shook it he was about fifty in good hard shape for his age you were in the quartermaster corps isnt that right he said dover nodded uhhuh how did you know he looked at melanie her blue eyes might have been innocence itselfor they might not have knowing her they probably werent let me buy you a drink dover and ill tell you about it gutteridge said wars over we can talk about some things now that we couldnt before at his wave a waiter appeared he ordered whiskey all around asking dover with his eyebrows if that was all right dover nodded the waiter went away before the drinks came back dover asked were you melanieshandler isnt that what the spies call it yeah i was and yeah thats what we call it gutteridge answered easily you almost got her caught you know jerry dover shrugged as impassively as he could i gave it my best shot i could afford the moneyand i got value received for it too he said melanie turned red she was fair enough to make that obvious even in the low light inside the huntsmans lodge dover went on i could afford that yeah but i didnt want to pass on any secrets and so i talked to some of our own intelligence boys and i didnt even wait for the answer to the letter i sent you melanie said something didnt feel right so i took a powder the drinks arrived dover needed his howd you land on me anyway he said in the trade its called a honey trap gutteridge answered for his former lover we ran em all over the csa with people we might be able to squeeze if push ever came to shove again it wasnt like your people didnt run em in the usa either a honey trap oh boy jerry dover said in a hollow voice he looked at melanie i thought you meant it with youi came a lot closer than i did with some others melanie said great terrific he finished the drink in a gulp what did they say a fool and his money are soon parted hed parted with money and hed been a fool hed needed a while to realize how big a fool hed been but here it was in all its glory he got to his feet scuse me i have to go back to work well he wouldnt be that kind of fool againhe hoped he hurried away from the table y ou know what mobile is sam carsten said tell me lon menefee urged him mobile is what new orleans wouldve been if it was settled by people without a sense of humor sam said new orleans was supposed to be a town where you could go out and have yourself some fun people in mobile looked as if they didnt enjoy anything boy youve got something there the exec said laughing even the goodtime girls dont act like theyre having a good time yeah i know sam had seen that for himself he didnt like it pretty crazythats all ive got to tell you this was a navy town too if a bunch of horny drunk sailors wont liven you up what will beats me menefee said sam pointed crap thats their naval academy right over there it and the whole town lay under the josephus daniels guns several cs navy ships and submersibles lay at the docks us caretaker crews were aboard them sam didnt know what would happen to them people were still arguing about it some wanted to take the captured vessels into the us navy others figured the spares problem would be impossible and wanted to scrap them instead academys out of business menefee said sam nodded all the cadets had been sent home they werent happy about it some wanted to join the us navy instead some wanted to shoot every damnyankee ever born they werent quite old enough to have had their chance at that the exec waved toward the confederate warships what do you think we ought to do with those sir razor blades sam said solemnly millions and millions of goddamn razor blades menefee grinned anything large metallic and useless was only good for razor bladesif you listened to sailors anyhow here on the gulf coast winter was soft sam had wintered in the sandwich islands so hed known softer but this wasnt bad things stayed pretty green it hadnt snowed at allnot yet anyhow a couple of more days and its he said another year down a big one lon menefee said never been a bigger one he wasnt old enough to remember much about maybe that had seemed bigger in the usa nobody then had known how awful a war could be a lot of people were inoculated against that ignorance now and had shown the usa could beat the confederate states and their allies up till then the united states never had nowmaybe now the usa wouldnt have to go and do this all over again sam could hope so anyhow he didnt feel like arguing with the younger man nor was he sure he should what with the superbomb and everything id have a devil of a time saying youre wrong weve got it the exec said germanys got it the confederates had it but theyre out the limeys had it but maybe theyre out sam put in you never can tell about england yeah menefee said japan and russia and france all have the hots for it i would too if somebody else had it and i didnt sam said i remember how rotten i felt when featherston got philly if hed had a dozen more ready to roll he might have whipped us in spite of everything good thing he didnt the exec said but how are you supposed to fight a war if everybodys got bombs that can blow up a city or a flotilla all at once nobody knows sam answered i mean nobody the board that talked to me when we came in for refit right after the war ended asked if i had any bright ideas me he snorted at how strange that was i mean if theyre looking for help from a mustang with hairy ears theyre really up the creek maybe the kaiser will be able to keep england from building any more and france from getting started japan and russia though good luck stopping em menefee said uhhuh that occurred to me too i dont like it any better than you do carsten said its going to be trouble any which way menefee predicted no kidding sam said of course you can say that any day of the year and be right about nine times out of ten but just the samehell if germany and the usa were the only countries that could make superbombs how could we stay friends itd be like we mopped the floor with everybody else and we had to see whod end up last man standing hard to get a superbomb across the ocean menefee said we dont have a bomber that can lift one off an airplane carrier and the kaiser doesnt have any carriers at all we dont have a bomber that can do it now five years from now itll be different sam said theyll shrink the bombs and build better airplanes turbos i guess thats how those things always work i remember the wood and wire and fabric twodecker we flew off the dakota in we thought we were so modern he laughed at his younger self lon menefee nodded yeah youre probably right skipper but the germans still dont have carriers maybe theyll build em maybe theyll decide they dont need em maybe theyll make extralongrange bombers instead if i were fighting the russians id sure want some of those or maybe theyll make rockets the way the damn confederates did i bet we try that too hows anybody going to stop a rocket with a superbomb in its nose the exec gave him a peculiar look you know what skipper i can see why the board asked you for ideas you just naturally come up with things well if i do the pharmacists mates have always been able to treat em sam answered praiseespecially praise from a bright annapolis gradnever failed to make him nervous he got a grin from menefee but the younger man persisted if youd gone to college youd be an admiral now sam had heard that before he didnt believe it for a minute i didnt even finish high school didnt want to either all i wanted to do was get the hell off my old mans farm and by god i did that and if i was the kind of guy who went to college chances are i wouldntve been the kind of guy who wanted to join the navy nope im stuck with the school of hard knocks maybe but its still a shame the exec said dont flabble about me lon youre the one wholl make flag rank i like where im at just fine sam wasnt kidding two and a half stripes lieutenant commander not bad for a man up through the hawse hole not even a little bit and his superiors still wanted him around maybe he could dream of making commander at least when they finally retired him he sure hadnt wasted any time sewing the thin gold stripe between the two thicker ones on each cuff hed flustered menefee in turn flag rank talk about counting your chickens i just want to see what i can do with a ship of my own i understand that sam had waited a long long time for the josephus daniels but doors opened to young annapolis grads that stayed closed for graying mustangs menefee pointed across the water supply boats coming up before sam could say anything the bosuns whistle shrilled away boarding parties sailors armed with tommy guns went down into a whaleboat at the archaic command others manned the destroyer escorts twin mms after that bumboat attacked the oregon nobody took chances if the boat didnt stop as ordered the guns would stop it but it did the boarding party checked every inch of the hull before letting it approach sam hadnt had to say a word he smiled to himself this was the way things worked when you had a good crew sooner or later conscripts would replace a lot of his veteran sailors by now he knew what he needed to know about whipping new men into shape he didnt look forward to the job but he could do it meat and fresh vegetables started coming aboard the destroyer escort the chow was better than it had been when she spent weeks at a time at sea sam had never been one to cling to routine for its own sake if he never tasted another bean as long as he lived he wouldnt be sorry im going to my cabin for a spell lon he said the paperwork gets worse and worseand if something disappears now we cant just write it off as lost in battle the way we could before damn shame if you ask me sure did make the ships accounts easier menefee agreed have fun skipper fat chance sam said but its got to be done dealing with the complicated paperwork of command might have been the toughest job for a mustang whod never been trained to do it you could end up in hock for tens of thousands of dollars if you didnt keep track of what was what or if you absentmindedly signed the wrong form because hed had to start from scratch sam was extra scrupulous about doublechecking everything before his name went on it he absently scratched the back of his left hand which itched then he went back to making sure of his spareparts inventory some of that stuffthe part that petty officers found usefulhad a way of walking with jesus a few minutes later he noticed his hand was bleeding he swore and grabbed for a tissue he must have knocked off a scab or something when he looked he didnt see one the blood seemed to be coming from a mole instead after a while it stopped sam went back to work things on the josephus daniels were just about the way they were supposed to be if he had to turn the ship over to a new co tomorrow he could without batting an eye his accounts were up to date and they were accurateor where they werent nobody could prove they werent people said there was a right way a wrong way and a navy way hed used the navy way to solve his problems about missing things sam grinned of course hed used the navy way what other way did he know hed given the navy his whole life he hadnt known he would do that when he signed up but he wasnt disappointed hed sure done more and seen more of the world that he would have if hed stayed on the farm the only way hed leave now was if they threw him out or if he dropped dead on duty hed been scared they would turn him loose when the war ended but what did they go and do they promoted him instead nope only way im going out now is feet first he murmured and even then the bastardsll have to drag me a us warship under his command anchored in mobile bay hed never dreamt of that when he signed on the dotted line he hadnt imagined he could become an officer not then and he hadnt imagined the usa would ever take the csa right off the map the way it looked to him thenthe way it looked to everybodyboth countries and their rivalry would stick around forever well nothing lasted forever hed found that out you went on and did as well as you could for as long as you could when you got right down to it what else was there m iguel rodriguez saidsomething what was that jorge asked his brother tried again water he managed at last ill get you some jorge hurried to the sink and turned the tap when he was a little boy he would have had to go to the well this was so much easier bringing the water back to miguel seeing his brother again was so much harder now he understood why the yankees had kept miguel so long miguel sat in a usissue military wheelchair he would never walk again so said the letter that came with him and jorge believed it his body was twisted and ruined so was his face us plastic surgeons had done what they could but they couldnt work miracles the shell that didnt quite kill him damaged his thinking tooor maybe he was trapped inside his own mind and his wounds wouldnt let him come out the us doctors had kept him alive but jorge wasnt even slightly convinced theyd done him any favors he gave miguel the cup his brother needed to take it in both hands he couldnt manage with one even then jorge kept one of his hands under the cup in case miguel dropped it he didnt not this time but he did dribble water down what was left of his chin jorge wiped it dry with a little towel how long could miguel go on like this ten years twenty thirty fifty would you want to go on like this for fifty years if somebody took care of you though what else would you do pedro came in and looked at miguel then quickly looked away what had happened to his brother tore at him even worse than it did at jorge and what it did to their motherjorge tried not to think about that but he couldnt help it shed be taking care of and mourning a cripple for as long as she or miguel lived those bastards pedro said savagely damnyankee bastards i think they did the best they could for him jorge said if they didnt hed be dead right now pedro looked at him as if he were an idiot who do you think blew him up in the first place damnyankee pendejos thats who he was probably rightprobably but not certainly jorge had seen men wounded and killed by short rounds from their own side he didnt try to tell his brother about thatpedro was in no mood to listen he just shrugged its the war we all took chances like that what can you do about it now what can anyone do pay them back pedro insisted seсor quinn says we can do it if we dont give up i think hes right i think youre loco jorge said what happens if you shoot somebody they take hostages and then they kill them they take lots of hostages theyve already done it here once you think they wont do it again so what pedro said it will only make the rest of the people hate them suppose they take susana or her kids suppose they take lupe flores jorge said and had the dubious satisfaction of watching his brother turn green yes pedro was sweet on lupe all right jorge pressed his advantage suppose they take mamacita will you go on yelling freedom then its over pedro cant you see that pedro swore at him and stormed out of the farmhouse again jorge noticed his own hands had folded into fists he made them unclench he didnt want to fight pedro he didnt want his brother doing anything stupid and useless either the army had taught him one thing anyhow you didnt always get what you wanted miguel had listened to everything how much hed understoodhow much miguel understood was always a question it probably always would be he struggled with his damaged flesh and damaged spirit trying to bring out words not good he managed not good no it isnt good jorge agreed just how his injured brother meant thatwho could say but miguel wasnt wrong any which way if pedro went and did something stupid people for miles around could end up paying for it miguel tried saying something else but it wouldnt come out whatever it was sometimes jorge thought miguel knew everything that was going on around him but was trapped inside his own head by his wounds other times he was sure miguels wits were damaged too which was worse he had no idea both were mighty bad if pedro really was planning on doing something idioticwhatever jorge did he would never betray his own flesh and blood to the occupiers if you did something like that you might as well be dead because you were dead to all human feeling but that didnt mean he couldnt do anything at all the next time he went into baroyeca he did it then he went into la culebra verde and drank much more beer than he was in the habit of putting down he didnt walk back to the farmhousehe staggered if the electric poles hadnt marched along by the side of the road to guide him back he might have wandered off and got lost his mother looked at him with imperfect delight when he came in your father didnt do this very often she said severely i wouldnt stand for it from him i wont stand for it from you either shorryuh sorrymamacita jorge said and dont think you can sweettalk me either his mother went on you can call me mamacita from now till forever and ill still know youve come home like a worthless drunken stumblebum i told you once and ill tell you againi wont put up with it jorge didnt try to argue he went to bed instead he woke up with his head feeling as if it were in the middle of an artillery barrage aspirins and coffee helpedsome pedro eyed him with amused contempt that was almost half admiration you tied a good one on there he remarked sн jorge didnt want to talkor to listen for that matter he poured the coffee cup full again how come pedro asked him you dont usually do that miguel sat in the wheelchair watching both of them or maybe just lost in his own world everything jorge said sometimes it gets to you thats all he wasnt even lying or not very much pedro nodded vigorously it does it really does but i dont want to get drunk on account of it i want to do something about it you want to do something stupid about it jorge thought he kept that to himself if you got into an argument when you were hung over you were much too likely to get into a brawl he didnt want to punch pedromost of the time anyhow the bible said a soft answer turned away wrath no answer seemed to work just as well when jorge didnt rise to the bait pedro left him alone he wondered whether he ought to remember that lesson for later a shrug was all he could give the question maybe he would maybe he wouldnt he went on about his business even in winter the farm needed work he tended the garden and the livestock he went into baroyeca once more and came back sober magdalena rodriguez nodded to him in somber approval then pedro went into town a few days later when he came home he was wild with rage the yankees theyve taken seсor quinn i was afraid of that jorge said but how could they know what he stands for pedro demanded he talks too much jorge answered which was true and too many people know he was the freedom party man here someone in town must have blabbed to the soldados from los estados unidos most of that was true but not all what can we do his brother cried i dont know i dont think we can do anything the yankees have machine guns and automatic rifles i dont want to go up against them if you do you have to be out of your mind pedro frowned that wasnt what he wanted to hear i hope nobody decides to inform on me he said all weve got here are a couple ofs and you cant fight anybody with those of course not thats why the yankees let us keep them jorge said then his brother brightened maybe we could get some dynamite from the mines and we could could what jorge broke in you cant fight with dynamite either what are you going to do throw sticks of it well no but if we made an auto bomb out of what we dont have an auto jorge reminded him besides do you know how many the yankees shoot for every auto bomb that goes off weve got to do something for seсor quinn pedro said bueno what do you want to do what can you do that will set him free and wont get us into trouble pedro thought about it the longer he thought the more unhappy he looked i dont know he said at last well when you answer that then maybe you can do something now we have to worry about keeping ourselves safe and keeping mamacita safe and keeping miguel safe jorge said miguel sat in the wheelchair was he listening to his brothers argue or not paying any attention at all jorge was never sure how much miguel understood sometimes he even thought it varied from day to day now though miguels eyes came alive for a moment stay safe he said clearly get down was that the last thing he said or the last thing he heard before the shell crashed down and ruined his life jorge wouldnt have been surprised pedro gnawed on the inside of his lower lip you can put up with things easier than i can jorge sometimes maybe jorge said but it gets to you doesnt it it gets to you too his brother pointed an accusing forefinger at him otherwise why did you need to go to the cantina and get drunk jorge spread his hands well youve got me there i thought so pedro sounded smug not many things anyone liked better than being sure he knew what someone else was thinking careful miguel said maybe at random maybe not was he still thinking about getting shelled or was he warning pedro not to think he was so smart how could anyone outside the wreckage of his body and mind and spirit guess with a sigh pedro said i will be careful i wont do anything that gets us into trouble or gets us hurt thats the idea jorge hoped his brother would keep the promise maybe things will get better we just have to wait and seewhat else can we do thats safe seсor quinn didnt talk that way pedro wasnt ready to give up not quite no he didnt jorge agreed and look what happened to him if hed just tried to fit in the yankees would have let him alone i bet but he started running his mouth and some dirty puto ratted on him pedro said savagely sн it only goes to show it can happen to anybody who isnt careful jorge said he knew what he was talking about he knew more than he would ever talk about hed written the anonymous letter that betrayed robert quinn to the us authorities he hadnt been happy about it not then that was why he came home drunk that evening but he wasnt sorry now that hed done it hed kept pedro safesafer anyhow hed done the same thing for the whole family they could go on after you lost a war that would do g eorge enos and wally fodor and most of the other guys at the twinmm mount had their shirts off they basked in the warm sunshine like geckos on a rock january george said to the gun chief fuckin january i tell you man floridas been wasted on the confederates too goddamn long you got that straight fodor agreed it was somewhere close to eighty up in boston the snow lay thick on the ground george had just got a letter from connie talking about the latest blizzard he missed his wife he missed his kids he sure as hell didnt miss massachusetts weather when i get old and gray ill retire down here he said good luck buddy the confederatesll blow your old gray ass from here to habana wally fodor said do you really think these guysll be glad to see us even by the time we get old probably be glad to take our money george said the gun chief laughed like thats the same thing a whores glad to take your money but that doesnt mean shes in love with you fodor laughed again hell with me if you aint blushing hell with you anyway wally george smiled when he said it but he knew how uneasy the smile was he always felt bad about going to brothels that didnt stop him but it made him flabble afterwards all the joking stopped when a supply boat approached the oregon the mm crews and even the men on the battlewagons fiveinch guns covered the vessel while sailors searched it that was of course locking the door with the horse long gone but what else could you do the diehards might hurt other warships but they wouldnt get the oregon again everybody hoped like hell they wouldnt anyhow this particular boat proved harmless so the searchers said if they were wrong if the locals had outfoxed themgeorge did his best not to think about that he breathed a sigh of relief when hams and flitches of bacon and sides of beef came aboard nothing explosive there he wasnt the only one who relaxed after seeing everything was on the up and up we keep eating awhile longer wally fodor said yeah george nodded we keep breathing awhile longer too aint it a pisser that we arent getting combat pay any more hey were at peace now right fodor said and the whole gun crew laughed sarcastically he went on sides all the bookkeepers in the navy department are a bunch of damn jews and they make like its their own personal money theyre saving for chrissake you ask me were fuckin lucky we still get hazardousduty pay what would you call it when the bumboat blows us halfway to hell george said hazardous enough for me by god amen brother the gun chief said as if george were a colored preacher heating up his flock the gun crews also covered the supply boat as it pulled away from the oregon if its crew were going to try anything logic said theyd do it while they lay right alongside the battleship but logic said people down here shouldnt try anything at all along those lines they were well and truly licked didnt they understand as much by the evidence no a few minutes after the boat drew too far away to be dangerous the oregons pa system crackled to life george enos report to the executive officers quarters george enos report to the executive officers quarters on the double as george hurried away from the gun wally fodor called after him jesus enos what the fuck did you do i dont know george fought to keep panic from his voice if the exec wanted you it was like getting called to the principals office in high school here george figured hed be lucky to come away with only a paddling but he wasnt lying to fodor eitherhe had no idea why he was getting summoned like this did they think hed done something he hadnt god forbid had something happened to his family he found the rosary in his trouser pocket and started working the beads going up into officers country gave him the willies on general principles he had to ask a jg younger than he was for help finding the execs quarters the baby lieutenant told him what he needed to know and sent him a pitying look as he went on his way by now the whole ship would be wondering what hed done and he was wondering himselfhe had no idea he knocked on the open metal door enos reporting sir come in enos commander hank walsh was about forty with hard gray eyes and what looked like a prussian dueling scar seaming his left cheek do you know a boston politico named joe kennedy name rings a bell george had to think for a couple of seconds yeahuh yes sir he used to get my mother to do work for the democrats sometimes what he really remembered was his mothers disdain for kennedy piecing together some stuff he hadnt understood when he was a kid he suspected kennedy had made a pass or maybe several passes at her family connection is there walsh said george only shrugged he hadnt thought so the exec eyed him well whatever there is hes pulled some strings you can have your discharge if you want it go back home and pick up your life again ive got the papers right here you mean it sir george could hardly believe his ears i mean it commander walsh didnt sound delighted but he nodded its irregular but its legal no hard feelings here i know youre not a regular navy man i know you have a family back in boston youve served well aboard the oregon and your previous skippers gave you outstanding fitness reports if you want to leave youve paid your dues george didnt hesitate for a moment walsh might change his mind wheres the dotted line sir ill sign the exec shoved papers across the desk at him and handed him a pen this is the navy enos you cant get away with signing just once so george signed and signed and signed he would have signed till he got writers cramp but it wasnt so bad as that when he got to the bottom of the stack of papers he said there you go sir some of these are for you for your records and to show the shore patrol and the military police to prove youre not awol walsh handed him the ones he needed to keep show them to your superiors too were sending a boat ashore at can you be ready by then by the clock on the wall behind the exec he had a little more than an hour to let people know and throw stuff into a duffel i sure can thank you sir dont thank me thank joe kennedy walsh raised an eyebrow i wouldnt be surprised if you get the chance to do just that once youre home if kennedys like most of that breed hell expect favors from you now that hes done you one nothings free not for those people from what george knew of joe kennedy he figured the exec had hit that one dead center ill worry about it when it happens sir oh could you have somebody wire my wife and let her know im coming home commander walsh nodded well take care of it get moving you dont have a lot of time aye aye sir george jumped to his feet and saluted thanks again sir when he showed wally fodor his discharge papers the gun chief made as if to tear them up george squawked grinning fodor handed back the precious papers here you go good luck you lucky stiff a sailor in the waiting boat grabbed georges duffel at on the dot george climbed down into the boat the sailor steadied him the boats outboard motor chugged it pulled away from the oregon george didnt look back once when he came ashore he got a ride to the train station in an army halftrack nice to know they love us down here he remarked to the soldier sitting across from him yeah well fuck em the guy in greengray said which only proved the army and the navy had the same attitude about the confederates the station was a young fortress with concrete barricades keeping motorcars at a distance there were barrels near the entrance and machine guns on the roof george showed his papers at the ticket counter and got a voucher for the trip up to boston when the train came in it had machine guns atop several cars all the same bullet holes pocked the metalwork most of the men aboard were soldiers going home on leave when they found out george didnt have to come back they turned greener than their uniforms you lucky stiff was the least of what he heard from them george just smiled and didnt let them provoke him he didnt intend to end up in the brig instead of in connies arms nobody fired at the train while it worked its way through the wreckage of the confederacy as george had when he traveled through the usa during the war he eyed the damage with amazementand with relief that he hadnt had to fight on land hed seen plenty of danger but it might have been nothing next to this connied got mad at him for joining the navy but he figured he was more likely never to have come home if hed waited for the army to conscript him of course his old man had made the same calculation what now he wondered now he would go out to t wharf hope his boat didnt hit a mine loose from its moorings and come home to watch the kids grow up and to watch connie get old it wasnt the most exciting way to pass the next thirty or forty years he could think of but hed had enough excitement to last him the rest of his days fishing was honest work what more could you want really the stretch from the border up past philadelphia was as battered as anything down in the csa he didnt see any of the damage from the superbomb in phillyor miss it the towns closer to new york city hadnt been hit so hard from new york city north he saw only occasional damage the main exception was providence the confederates had plastered the navy training center as hard as they could and then he got into boston on other leaves hed seen the pounding his home town had taken now he had other things on his mind and hardly noticed he slung his duffel over his shoulder and pushed out of the train car lots of peoplesailors soldiers civilianswere getting off here george connie yelled at the same time as the boys were squealing daddy he hugged his wife and squeezed his kids and kissed everybody jesus its good to be home he said you know that kennedy guy pulled wires for me i hoped he would connie said i wrote him about how youd been in long enough and who your folks were and everything and it worked she beamed he kissed her again except on a fishing boat im never leaving this town again he said connie cheered the boys clapped they tried to carry the duffel bag between them they managed that let him put one arm around them and the other arm around connie it was an awkward way to leave the platform but nobody cared a bit r ain drummed down out of a leaden sky chester martins breath smoked whenever he went outside it was nasty and chilly and muddy he only laughed hed lived here long enough to know this was nothing out of the ordinary january in los angeles he said rita laughed too the chamber of commerce tries not to tell people about this time of year yeah well if i were them i wouldnt admit it either chester said they do better with photos of orange trees and pretty girls on the beach ive never seen a photo of an orange tree on the beach carl said while chester was off being a top kick his son had acquired a quirky sense of humor chester sometimes wondered where the kid had got it knowing carl hed probably won it in a poker game you might as well hang around the house today rita said there wont be any work boy you got that right chester agreed rain in la left construction crews sitting on their hands in the army they just went ahead and built stuff and the heck with the lousy weather yeah but youre not in the army any more good thing too if anybody wants to know what i think by the way rita said it hed better want to know what she thought hey you get no arguments from me it wasnt a whole lot of fun chester still didnt want to think about what hed done in that little south carolina town oh he wasnt the only one he could blame lieutenant lavochkin for most of it he couldand he did but he was there too he pulled the trigger lots more than once that was one thing he never intended to talk about with anybody carl asked if it wasnt any fun why did you do it good question rita said maybe you can get a decent answer out of him i never could she gave chester a dirty look she still resented his putting the uniform back on chances were she always would he shrugged if jake featherston beat us this time around i was just wasting my time in the last war i didnt want that to happen so i tried to stop it oh yeah you were going to whip jake featherston all by yourself and then you wake up rita said not all by myself that colored kid did though chester shook his head boy am i jealous of him me and all the other guys who put on the uniform but everybody who fought set things up so he could do it he looked at his son is that a good enough answer for you no rita said before carl could open his mouth all it did was get you shot again youre just lucky you didnt get your head blown off im fine chester had to speak carefully ritas first husband had bought a plot during the great war wound i picked up doesnt bother me at all except in weather like this then it aches a little thats it though luck nothing but luck rita said stubbornly and chester couldnt even tell her she was wrong how many people did you shoot dad carl asked that made chester think of the massacre again it also made him think of firingsquad duty neither of those was what his son had in mind which didnt mean they hadnt happened some chester answered after a perceptible pause i dont always like to remember that stuff i should hope not rita made a face why dont you carl asked you joined the army to kill people right rita made a different face this time a seewhatyougotinto face chester sighed yeah thats why i joined he said as steadily as he could but its not so simple you look at a guy who got wounded and you listen to him and it doesnt matter which uniform hes wearing he looks the same and he sounds the samelike a guy whos been in a horrible traffic accident you ever see one of those carl nodded yeah it was pretty bad blood all over the place all right then youve got half an idea of what im talking about anyway well imagine you just ran over somebody thats kind of the way you feel when youve been through a firefight but when youre in a wreck the other guy isnt trying to hit you carl objected i know knowing hes trying to get you tooi think thats why you can do it at all its a fair fight like they say that means you can do itor most people can do it most of the time it doesnt mean its a game or you think its fun chester said unless youre boris lavochkin he added but only to himself maybe that was what made the lieutenant so alarming killing didnt bother him the way it did most people carl was full of questions this morning what about guys who cant do it any more is that what they call combat fatigue this time around yeah last war they called it shellshock same critter different names chester hesitated sometimesa guy sees more horrible stuff than he can take thats all if you can you get him out of the line let him rest up awhile hes usually all right after that wars like anything else i guess its easier for some people than it is for others and some guys go through more nasty stuff than others too so it all depends you sound like you feel sorry for soldiers like that i thought youd be mad at them his son said not me chester shook his head i went through enough crap myself so i know how hard it is a few guys would fake combat fatigue so they could try and get out of the line i am mad at people whod do something like that because they make it harder for everybody else did you run into anybody like that rita asked not in my outfit chester answered it happened though youd hear about it too often for all of it to be made up over on the confederate side they say general patton got in trouble for slapping around a guy with combat fatigue what do you think of that rita and carl said the same thing at the same time if the guy really was shellshocked patton should have left him alone you cant help something like that chester said all the same he was sure lieutenant lavochkin would have done the same thing having no nerves himself lavochkin didnt see why anybody else should either before chesters wife and son could come up with any more interesting questions the telephone rang he stood closest to it so he got it hello hello mr martin harry t casson here what can i do for you mr casson chester heard the wariness and the respect in his own voice ritas eyes widened harry t casson was the biggest building contractor in the los angeles area before the war hed wrangled again and again with the construction union chester helped start they didnt settle things till well after the fighting started nowwho could guess what was on cassons plate now if he wanted to try to break the unionwell he could try but chester didnt think hed get away with it he started off in a friendly enough way glad youre back safe i heard you were woundedhappy it wasnt too serious yeah the only wound that wasnt serious was the one that happened to the other guy chester asked did you ever put the uniform on again yourself a few weeks after you did casson answered i was bossing construction projects mostly up in the northwest im embarrassed to say i didnt come anywhere close to the sound of guns well once but that was just a nuisance raid nothing aimed my way you paid those dues last time around chester knew the building magnate had commanded a line companyand briefly a line regimentin the great war generous of you to say so casson replied so whats up chester asked latest contract still has a year to run i know all the more reason to start talking about the new one now casson said easily that way we dont get crammed up against a deadline everything works better he was smooth all rightsmooth enough to make chester suspicious youre gonna try and screw me and you wont respect me in the morning either harry t casson laughed i dont know what youre talking about chester now tell me another one chester answered cmon man we both know what the games about why make like we dont all right you want it straight ill give it to you straight during the war you got a better contract than you really deserved casson said not a lot of labor available and there was a war on we didnt want strikes throwing a monkey wrench into things but its different now lots of guys coming out of the army and going into the building tradeslook at you for instance and its not unpatriotic to care a little more about profit these days either so how hard are you going to try to hit us chester asked when harry t casson told him he grunted as if hed been hit for real well fight you if you do that he promised well fight you every way we know how i think youll lose the building magnate said dont bet on it mr casson you know how big our strike fund is chester said casson named a figure chester laughed harshly make it three times that size youre lying casson said at once in a pigsear chester replied weve been socking it away since we figured youd try to give us the shaft first chance you got well fight all right and well make your scabs sorry they were born we whipped pinkertons before with all the vets back like you say sure as the devil we can do it again piece of cake the flyboys call it siccing the pinkertons on you was a mistake i said so at the time but my colleagues didnt want to listen harry t casson said slowly do you swear youre telling the truth about your strike fund swear to god martin made his voice as solemn as he could damnation casson muttered that could be difficult not just a hard strike but bad publicity when we dont need itwill you agree to extend the present contract unchanged for another two years then come both sides can take a long look at where they are and where they want to go you can get your friends to go along with that chester asked yes if youre sure the rank and file will ratify it they will chester said some of them might want a raise but theyre doing all right staying where were ats a good enough deal a good enough deal harry t casson echoed im not thrilled with it but i think youre right it will do good talking with you chester so long he hung up so did chester he also started laughing like a maniac what was that all about rita asked new contract two years same terms as the wartime one chester got out between guffaws but whats so funny rita demanded chester didnt tell her one more thing he never intended to tell anybody the real strike fund was smaller than harry t casson thought not three times as big hed raised casson with a busted flush and hed made the magnate fold rain so what if this wasnt a good days work for him and for everybody else in the union hed never done one the sooner we sign the papers the better he thought but they would after the war a contract wasa piece of cake e lizabeth clucked at cincinnatus arent you ready yet i been ready for twenty minutes so has my pa he answered youre the one keeps checkin her makeup an makin sure her hats sittin just the right way im doin no such thing his wife said and cincinnatus prayed god would forgive the lie elizabeth added not every day you marry off your onliest daughter well thats a fact cincinnatus allowed that sure enough is a fact amanda was at the beauty parlor or maybe at the church by now cincinnatus reached up and fiddled with his tie hed never worn a tuxedo before the suit was rented but the clothier assured him plenty of white men rented tuxes too seneca driver wore cincinnatus ordinary suit it was a little big on him but he didnt have one of his own hed got away from covington with no more than the clothes on his back and moneyd been tight since you look mighty handsome elizabeth said glad you think so what i reckon i look like is one o them fancy servants rich folks had down in the csa cincinnatus said theyre the only ones i ever seen with fancy duds like this here his wife shook her head their jackets always had brass buttons to show they was servants she snorted like them bein colored wouldnt tell you but anyways they did your buttons is jus black like they would be if you wore them clothes all the time on account of you wanted to cincinnatus couldnt imagine anybody wanting to the tux fit well yes but it was uncomfortable on a hot summer day it would be stifling with the high wing collar and the tight cravat he didnt even want to think about that i aint sorry amanda didnt want to wait till june he said do jesus me neither his wife exclaimed she try an do that maybe she have herself a baby six seven months after they do the ceremony people laugh at you an talk behind your back when somethin like that happens they do cincinnatus agreed there was something he hadnt worried about well his wife had taken care of it for him he sent her a sidelong look and lowered his voice so his father wouldnt hear only fool luck we didnt have that happen our ownselves you stop it you and your filthy talk elizabeth said also quietly he only laughed which annoyed her more it wasnt as if he wasnt telling the truth plenty of courting couples didnt wait till the preacher said the words over them before they started doing what they would have done afterwards for that matter cincinnatus had no way of knowing whether amanda had a bun in the oven right now he almost pointed that out to his wife too but held his tongue at the last minute maybe elizabeth was already worrying about that too if she wasnt he didnt want to give her anything new to flabble about someone knocked on the door ready or not youre ready now cincinnatus told elizabeth theres the changs when elizabeth opened the door she might have been ready to meet presidentelect dewey and his wife come in she said warmly oh isnt that a pretty dress thank you mrs chang said she didnt know a whole lot of englishless than her husbandbut she understood enough to nod and smile and say the right thing here joey chang had on an ordinary suit not a tuxhe wasnt father of the bride only father of the brides sisterinlaw i bring beer to reception right he said right cincinnatus said mr chang was also one of the best homebrew makers in des moines since iowa remained legally dry that was an important talent the authorities didnt seem to be enforcing the law the way they had before the war but you couldnt just go round to the corner package store and pick up a couple of cases of blatz i do it then chang said you have colored people at your wedding right well i think so cincinnatus said dryly you have chinese people too chang nodded and pointed to himself and his wife their and cincinnatus grandchildren could have gone into either category chang went on you have white people too yeah we will cincinnatus replied some of the guys from the butcher shop where calvin works little bit of everything maybe not so bad joey chang said considering how hard he and his wife had resisted graces marriage to achilles that was a lot from him he insisted they would have liked it just as little had grace married a white guy cincinnatusalmost believed him grandchildren had softened the changs as grandchildren have a way of doing we should go elizabeth said dont want to be late the church was a block and a half away so there was very little risk of that but elizabeth would flabble it was a wedding after all long as amanda and calvin are thereand the ministerdont hardly matter if we show up or not cincinnatus said he made his wife sputter and fume which was what hed had in mind joey chang tipped him a wink cincinnatus grinned back the changs made much of seneca driver as they walked to church they took old people seriously mighty nice greatgrandchillun seneca said mighty nice i dont care none if theys half chinese neither i wouldnt care if they was red white an blue mighty nice cincinnatus wished he could move along with his back straight and without a stick in his right hand his leg still hurt so did his shoulder the steel plate in his skull made mine detectors go offan amused army engineer had proved that one day beat up or not though he was still alive and kickingas long as he didnt have to kick too hard with a little luck hed see more grandchildren before long compared to most of the surviving negroes in the conquered confederacy he had the world by the tail calvins father and mother were already at the church they were pleasant people a few years younger than cincinnatus abraham washington ran a secondhandclothes store it wasnt a fancy way to make a living but hed done all right calvin had a brother luther a year younger than he was luther wore a greengray uniform and had a pfcs chevron on his sleeve he looked tough and strongand proud of himself too i didnt see any combat sir he said to cincinnatus heard stories about what you truck drivers went through though what was it like son you didnt miss a thing cincinnatus answered thats the honest to god truth getting shot at when they miss is bad if they hit you its worse i told him that abraham washington said i told him but he didnt want to listen he went and volunteered anyway he got the chance to show he was as good as a white man and he went and took it cincinnatus said how you gonna blame him for that luther washington grinned from ear to ear somebody understands why i did what i did his father only sniffed by the way abraham washington sounded his people had lived in des moines for generations he was used to being thought as good as a white manor nearly as good anyhow having grown up in the csa cincinnatus could see why luther was willing to lay his life on the line to get rid of the nearly during the great war plenty of negroes joined the confederate army to win citizenship for themselves plenty more would have this time around if only jake featherston had let them that urge to prove himselfthat feeling you had to keep proving yourselfstayed strong in negroes on both sides of the old border cincinnatus didnt want to think about jake featherston not at his daughters wedding he looked around the church the changs had gone over with achilles and grace and their grandchildrenwho in cincinnatus considered and unbiased of course opinion were the brightest and most beautiful grandbabies in the whole world and there were a few whites as hed told joey chang there would be they were doing their bestsome doing better than othersto be friendly with the colored people sitting around them cincinnatus smiled to himself the whites were a small minority here they were getting a tiny taste of what negroes in the usa went through all the time but it was better here than it ever had been down in the confederacy not good necessarily but better cincinnatus had experience with both places he knew when he was better off hed voted here his children had graduated from high school maybe his grandchildren would go to college down in the csa back before the great war hed been unusualand an occasional object of suspicionbecause he could read and write a burly young man whose shoulders strained the fabric of his tuxedo jacket came up his name was amos somethingorother he was one of calvins friends and the best man wedding processions forming up he said thats us elizabeth said cincinnatus couldnt very well tell her she was wrong amanda seemed ready to burst with glee that was how the bride was supposed to act on her wedding day calvin didnt look ready to run for his life for a groom on his wedding day that would do the organist struck up the wedding march down the aisle everybody went a photographer fired off one flashbulb after another yellowpurple spots danced in front of cincinnatus eyes up at the front of the church he and the rest of amandas supporters went to the right those of calvin washington to the left the minister did what ministers do after a while he got to who giveth this woman i do cincinnatus said proudly amanda and calvin got to say their i dos a couple of minutes later amandas ring had a tiny diamond on it tiny or not it sparkled under the electric lights it shone no brighter than amandas smile though the kiss the new husband and wife exchanged was decorous but not chaste down the street three doors to the reception joey changs good beer was highly unofficial but also highly appreciated the minister drank several glasses and got very lively cincinnatus hadnt expected that preachers were supposed to be a straitlaced lot werent they but if this one wanted to let his processed hair down why not one of the white men congratulated cincinnatus your daughters a pretty girl and she seems mighty nice he said thank you kindly cincinnatus was ready to approve of anybody who approved of amanda this is a good bash too the white man said people get together and have a good time theyre all pretty much the same you know he seemed to think hed come out with something brilliant i wont quarrel with you cincinnatus said and youve got to tell me who makes your beer the white man added that fella right over there cincinnatus pointed to joey chang who held a glass of his own product his daughters married to my son well how about that the white man said which was safe enough under almost any circumstances stir everything around huh why not cincinnatus waited to see if the ofay would go any further but he didnt he just said how about that again good cincinnatus thought he wanted no trouble not today he never wanted trouble but hed landed in some he wouldnt worry about that either this was amandas day and it should be a good one he smiled he wanted her night to be better yet xx y ou pinkard after jeff pinkard got convicted in the yankees military courtkangaroo court he thought of it stillus personnel replaced all the texans at the houston jail he hated those sharp harsh quick accents yeah he said what is it get up the guard told him you got visitors it was only a week till they hanged him yeah he said again heaving his bulk off the cot visitors that roused his curiosity the only person hed seen lately was jonathan moss here to tell him another appeal had failed he had none leftthe president of the usa and the us supreme court had declined to spare him who youll find out when you get there wont you the guard unlocked his cell other men in greengray stood by with submachine guns at the ready if jeff got cute hed die a week early that was all and nobodyll miss me either he thought miserably when you were going to hang in a week selfpity came easy he went down the hall in front of the guards was getting shot a quicker cleaner way to go than the rope he didnt want to go at all dammit as far as he was concerned he hadnt done anything to deserve killing when he got to the visiting room he stopped in his tracks there on the other side of the wire were edith and willie and frank and little raymond in his wifes arms all of them except raymond started to cry when they saw him aww jeff said and then you shouldnt have come we wouldve done it more papa jeff willie said only the damnyankees wouldnt let us for a long time were here now edith said we love you jeff yeah well i love yall too jeff said and a whole fat lot of good its gonna do anybody he went up to the mesh that separated him from his family he pressed his hands against it as hard as he could they did the same thing on the other side try as he would he couldnt quite touch them its not right papa jeff frank said they got no business messin with you it was only niggers for heavens sake well you know that and i know that and everybody down here knows that too jeff answered only trouble is the yankees dont know it and theyre the ones who count cant anybody do anything edith asked doesnt look like it oh people could do something but nobody wants to what do you expect theyre yankees his wife started crying harder its not fair its not right just on account of they won the damn warwhat am i gonna do without you jeff youll do fine jeff said you know you will what am i gonna do without me he wondered that unfortunately had no good answer he was going to die was what he was going to do and dont you worry none about me ill be up in heaven with god and the angels and stuff he didnt really believe in heaven not with halos and harps and white robes playing the harp all day got old fast anyway but edith was more religious than he was if he could make her feel better he would she went on crying though which made willie and frank snuffle more too i dont want to lose you i dont want it to happen either but i dont have a whole lot to say about it he replied youve got a baby youve got me youve got my boys who you raised like you were their daddy edith said all of that was true it cut no ice with anybody up in yankeeland the yankees went on and on about all the negroes hed killed as if theyd cared about those negroes alive they sure hadnt wanted them going up to the usa from what he heard they still didnt want negroes from the csa going up to the usa they were going to hang him anyhow they could and they would a guard came in on the other side the free side times up he said we love you jeff edith said through her tears she carried raymond out the boys were still crying too come on pinkard said a guard on jeff s side of the visiting room back to the cell you go back he went the cell was familiar nothing bad would happen to him while he was in it pretty soon though theyd take him out one last time he wouldnt be going back after that well what else did one last time mean two days later he had another visitor jonathan moss again thought you gave up on me he said through the damned unyielding mesh i dont know what else i can do for you moss said i wish i did i havent got a hacksaw blade on me or anything even if i did they would have found it when they searched me yeah pinkard said sono reprieve from the governor hell no governor son of a bitch thinks hes president of texas now no reprieve from the president of the usa no reprieve from the assholes on the yankee supreme court so what else is there well youre not the only one theyre coming down on if that makes you feel any better jonathan moss replied you mean like misery loves company jeff shrugged id love it if i didnt have the misery but yeah go aheadtell me about the others i dont have a wireless set and they dont give me papers so i dont know jack shit about whats going on out there they hanged ferdinand koenig and saul goldman yesterday goddamn shame pinkard said they were good men both of em confederate patriots why else would you yankees hang people for murdering millions for telling lies about it in papers and magazines and on the wireless moss suggested we didnt get rid of anybody who didnt have it coming jeff said stubbornly and like your side didnt tell any lies to your people during the war yeah sure the military attorney sighed we didnt tell lies about things like that we didnt do things like thatnot to negroes not to jews not to anybody he undercut what jeff would have said next that the usa didnt have many negroes to get rid of the united states were crawling with jews everybody knew that instead he said what other kind of good news have you got for me if it makes you feel any better you arent the only camp commandant and guard chief to get condemned moss told him vern green goes right with you here andyou knew mercer scott back in louisiana right yeah pinkard scowled at him you know what it doesnt make me feel one goddamn bit better im sorry if there were anything else i could try id try it if you have any ideas sing out jeff shook his head whats the use nobody in the usa cares nobody in the usa understands we did what we had to do thats all it looked like a good idea at the time moss sounded like somebody quoting something then he sighed that isnt enough to do you any good either didnt reckon it would be jeff said go on then you tried i said that before i expect wont be long now in some ways the days till the hanging crawled past in others they flew the last days of his life and he was stuck in a cell by himself not the way he would have wanted things to turn out but what did that have to do with anything he asked the guards for a copy of over open sights wouldnt you rather have a bible one of them said if i wanted a bible dont you reckon i wouldve told you so jeff snapped a little to his surprise they brought him jake featherstons book he paged through it everything in there made such good sense a damn shame it hadnt worked out for real but the negroes in the csa were gone or most of them were and the damnyankees couldnt change that even if they did win the war the night before they were going to hang him the guards asked what he wanted for supper fried chicken and fried potatoes and a bottle of beer he answered they gave it to him except the beer came in a tin cup he ate with good appetite he sleptsome anyhow they asked him what he wanted once more at breakfast time bacon and eggs and grits he told them and he got that too he cleaned his plate again and poured down the coffee that came with the food want a preacher a guard asked pinkard shook his head nah what for ive got a clean conscience if you dont you need a preacher worsen i do they cuffed his hands behind him and led him out to the prison yard theyd run up a gallows there hed listened to the carpentry in his cell now he saw it was a gallows built for two another party of us guards led vern green out from a different part of the jail vern looked like hell his nerve must have failed him at last he gave jeff a forlorn nod how come you aint about to piss yourself like me whats the use jeff answered id beg if i thought itd do any good but it wont so ill go out the best way i know how why give these assholes the satisfaction of watching me blubber reporters watched from a distance guards made sure they stayed back otherwise they would have got up to the condemned men and yelled questions in their faces jeff figured yankee reporters had to be even worse than their confederate counterparts and the confederates were pretty bad a guard had to help vern green up the stairs to the platform jeff made it under his own power his knees were knocking but he didnt let it show pride was the last thing he had left and much good it does me too he thought along with more guards and the hangman a minister waited up there will you pray with me he asked jeff no jeff shook his head i made it this far on my own ill go out the same way vern talked with the preacher they went through the twentythird psalm together when they finished vern said im still scared no one can blame you for that the minister said a guard held out a pack of cigarettes to jeff thanks he said youll have to take it out for me i will the guard said the smoke was a raleigh so it tasted good vern also smoked one the guards let them finish then walked them onto the traps the hangman came over and set the rope around jeff s neck then he put a burlap bag over jeff s head make it quick if you can jeff said the bag was white not black he could still see light and shadow through it his heart pounded nowevery beat might be the last im doing my best the hangman answered his footsteps moved away but not far theyve got no right damn them jeff thought theyvea lever clacked the trap dropped s tuck in fucking alabama armstrong grimes grumbled what could be worse than this squidface was cleaning his captured automatic tredegar he looked up from the work well you could be in hell he said who says im not armstrong said its a godforsaken miserable place and i cant get out of it if thats not hell what do you call it pittsburgh squidface answered which jerked a laugh out of armstrong after guiding an oily rag through the tredegars barrel with a cleaning rod squidface went on if youre gonna get screwed any which way lay back and enjoy it you know tell me another one armstrong said army chow the people fucking hate us were not careful we get scragged even the broads are scared of us now if they get friendly they end up dead and we dont take hostages for that so theres nothing to hold the locals back army chows not so bad squidface said theres always enough of it nowadays anyhow back before i went in i couldnt always count on three squares he was skinny enough to make that easy to believe but armstrong was in the mood to bitch and he wasnt about to let anybody stop him youre just saying that cause youre turning into a lifer yeah so you oughta do the same squidface answered god knows how long youre gonna stay stuck here you make a pretty good soldier even if you are a big target why not leave the uniform on you go back to civvy street youll end up bored outa your skull all the goddamn time id sooner be bored than boresighted armstrong said squidface ignored the joke that pissed armstrong off because he thought it was better than most of the ones he made but as if he hadnt spoken the pfc continued besides you cant tell me you arent getting any down here up in the usa the girlsll slap your face if you try and cop a feel you want to fuck you gotta get married theres still whorehouses in the usa armstrong said yeah so squidface said again he left it right there armstrong grunted with a whore it was nothing but a business deal some of the gals down here were looking for love they wanted to think they mattered to you so you mattered to them they werent just going through the motions that did make it better all the sameyou figure because you want to stay in everybody ought to want to stay in my ass squidface retorted plenty of the cocksuckers in this company i wish theyd get the fuck out raw recruits who dont know their nuts from wednesdayd be better but youre all right you could do it you might even end up an officer christ whatre you smoking armstrong laughed out loud whatever it is i want some im serious man squidface said me im a noncom its what im made for youve got more of the yes sir they like when they promote people oh man give me a fucking break armstrong said you do squidface insisted shit youre armstrong you never got a gross nickname hung on you or nothin thats cause ive got a gross name instead armstrong said hot damn all the same squidface wasnt about to let up i can see the newspaper story now its fucking and colonel armstrong grimes gets a medal of honor for leading the regiment that takes paris away from the germans if the germans want the place theyre welcome to it far as im concerned armstrong said its full of frenchmenor it was till they blew it up so dont listen to me like i ever did as long as they were zinging each other armstrong was happy enough but theyd come much too close to getting serious there and getting serious made him nervous he wasnt the only us soldier who got nervous in alabama somebody well up the chain of command had the bright idea that a football game between occupiers and locals might show people that men from the usa werent so different from anybody elseno horns no tails no pitchforks the company co asked armstrong didnt you play football in high school some he answered i was second string i wasnt that great or anything you want a chance to knock confederates on their ass without getting gigged for it where do i sign up squidface wanted nothing to do with that im glad im a little guy he said those assholes on the other side theyre gonna be lookin for a chance to rack you up this aint gonna be no friendly game yeah well well work out on them too armstrong said they better have plenty of ambulances ready squidface said darkly they got uniforms whoever was in charge of what they were calling the peace bowl had clout us soldiers wore blue suits their confederate counterparts red they got cleats to take the place of their boots they got helmets armstrong wondered if he wouldnt do better with his regular steel pot than with this leather contraption the athletes on the us team were in much better shape than the highschool guys had been armstrong felt hed earned something when he got named a starting tackle they had a quarterback who could really throw and a couple of ends who could catch the ends werent the swiftest in the world but theyd do they played the peace bowl at a highschool stadium us soldiers filled half the stands locals the other half to make sure the bowl stayed peaceful the locals got frisked before they could go inside armstrong got his first look at the red team then he didnt like what he saw they were slimmer and rangier than the us players they looked fast that wasnt what worried him though one glance told him these guys were going to play as if they were fighting to hold the us army out of chattanooga squidface had it straight peace bowl nothing this wouldnt be football this would be war the red teamthey seemed to call themselves the wolveswon the toss when the us kicker booted the ball armstrong thundered down the field the first collision was always welcome he slammed into a guy in red yankee cocksuckin motherfucker the man said and tried to lift a knee into his family jewels kiss my ass charlie armstrong twisted and took the knee on his hip pad you want to play like that well play like that bring it on the other guy said and they did both sides did the whole game long armstrong got punched and elbowed and gouged and kicked every tackle was a pilingon penalty it was trench warfare only without trenches the confederates were faster the us team was a touch stronger one confederate broke his leg as far as armstrong could tell that was an accidentthe tackle looked clean one us player had his shoulder dislocated on the next play the wolf who dislocated it got racked up armstrong couldnt see just what happened to him somebody was trying to step on his face whatever it was the guy in red got carried off on a stretcher with four minutes to go the confederates punted to the us team the blues were on their own thirty down this is it the quarterback said in the huddle we get a touchdown we win we fuck up we look like chumps in front of these shitheads and in front of our own guys we gonna let that happen no they chorused all right short pass into the left flat on three lets go get em you shot my brother asshole said the guy across the line from armstrong dont worry cuntlips armstrong said sweetly youre next and he was right but not the way he meant it the first mortar bomb hissed in then and burst right on the midfield stripe but the red team shielded the blue from most of the fragments as soon as armstrong heard the bang he flattened out so did the alabaman who didnt like him but the guy in red was bleeding from his back and his leg fuck he said hoarsely another confederate player was down with a ghastly head wound it proved again what kaiser bills army had found out the hard way in the great warleather helmets didnt do one damn thing to stop shell fragments a couple of us soldiers clutched at themselves and groaned too their uniforms showed the blood more than their opponents armstrong crawled over to the closer one he didnt want to rise up in case more mortar rounds landed on or near the football field and they didone near the far end zone and another gruesomely in the side of the stands filled with people cheering for the red team screams and shrieks and wails rose high and shrill son of a bitch armstrong said not entirely displeased we may not even have to take hostages this time theyre doing it to themselves the wounded us player expressed an opinion that would have assigned every white person in the former confederacy to an even warmer if less humid clime then he said i wish i could bandage myself this cloth doesnt tear for shit hang on armstrong extracted a small clasp knife from his right sock ill fix you up what are you doing with that the other soldier asked never can tell when itll come in handy armstrong said slicing at the fellows shirt if i couldve got my hands on a derringer i wouldve packed one of those too he cut at the soldiers tight trousers so he could see the wound not too bad looks like youre sliced up some but i dont think theres any iron in there oh boy the injured player said armstrong knew it was easier to be optimistic if you werent the guy whod stopped one another round burst on the far side of the field and then another one in the confederate side of the stands the bastards with the mortar could have done much worse to the people they were trying to harm instead they unleashed horror on the men and women who would have applauded had damnyankees been sliced to cats meat i think the games over somebody not far away said boy i bet he had to go to college to be smart like that armstrong said heh said the wounded football player lying beside him i hope they drop on that fucking mortar crew pretty damn quick good luck armstrong said mortars didnt make a great big bang when they went off if you drew a mileandahalf circle around the football field the crew wassomewhere in there if they wanted to throw their weapon in a birmingham go somewhere else and set up again they could do that too and most of the soldiers who could be chasing them were here at the game instead the guys in greengray were emptying from the stands as fast as they could without panic medics came out to get the injured off the field theyd been there for the football injuries but they knew how to deal with battlefield wounds too theyd had plenty of practice armstrong stayed right where he was he wished he could have stashed an entrenching tool in his sock like every us soldier in the csa he felt pinned down e verything faded cassius found that out the hard way he could remember the fierce incredulous joy hed known when he shot jake featherston but he couldnt feel it any more all he had now was the memory and it wasnt the same thing fame faded too it wasnt that people didnt recall what hed done here more than half a year later he got greeted with smiles and nods wherever he went but he wasnt fresh news any more too much had happened since the united states was about to get a new president that was why hed been invited down to washington dc to see tom dewey inaugurated he wondered if his would be the only black face at the inauguration he feared it might down in the csa hed always been among his own kind but negroes in the united states were thin on the ground he had to get used to dealing with white people a lot of them didnt know how to deal with him either the ones who treated him like an eightyearold who wasnt very bright were easy to avoid even the ones who plainly meant well though often acted as if they couldnt expect much from him in some ways they bothered him more than the other kind because they were harder to shake off such neat handwriting gushed the desk clerk at willards hotel when cassius checked in the evening of january he looked at his signature cassius madison it said in his ordinary script which was not too bad and not too good everybody in the usa needed a surname hed taken his from the town outside of which he shot jake featherston only later did he learn it also belonged to a us president from before the war of secession were cassius white the clerk never would have remarked on how he wrote the man had to be surprised he could write at all once hed checked in cassius knew what to do at a hotel he tipped the man who carried his bags up to his room watching a white man do what would have been nigger work in the csa was a kick thanks the fellow said pocketing the halfdollar you want a girl buddy you talk to me ill get you a lulu i will fifteen bucks and youll be a happy guyi guarantee it not right now cassius answered right after he came to the usa he couldnt keep women away from him not that he tried very hard but they didnt throw themselves at him like that any moreanother sign his fame was wearing thin and one he really regretted the bellhop shrugged you change your mind you can find me my names pete see you around he strode out of the room cassius shrugged he didnt like paying for it he did like doing it though so maybe hed hunt up pete and maybe he wouldnt in the meantime he looked at the roomservice menu he ordered a steak and a salad and fried potatoes experience had taught him that those were hard for even a kitchen asleep at the switch to screw up too badly another white man this one with a foreign accent brought the dinner into his room on a cart cassius tipped him too with a nod that was almost a bow the waiter left cassius attacked the steak theyd got mediumrare right and the meat was pretty tender hed had plenty worse he went to bed without looking for pete he felt more tired than virtuous he didnt know why sitting on a train for the trip down from boston should have worn him outhe hadnt done anything but sit but hed seen several times that traveling long distances could be as wearing as a march with gracchus guerrillas after the alarm clock woke him he showered and shaved and dressed in a sober suit set off by a bright red tie then he went downstairs for breakfast willards at the corner of fourteenth and pennsylvania avenue was only a couple of blocks from the white house on whose battered grounds the inauguration ceremony would take place it was even closer to the security perimeter which featured barbed wire machinegun nests and search points even though cassius had one of the most recognizable faces in the usa and an official invitation he got frisked i shot the president of the csa he complained you reckon im gonna shoot the president of the usa not our job to take chances answered the soldier patting him down but ill tell you somethingcongresswoman blackford came through this checkpoint a few minutes ago she was married to a guy who was president one of our gals searched her anyway he paused youre clean go on through thanks cassius said if they were searching members of congress they hadnt singled him out because he was a negro hed wondered he showed his invitation to an usher who might have been a soldier dressed up for the occasion oh yes sir the man saidhe couldnt have been more than a year or two older than cassius come with me weve got you a place right near the podium cassius went past bleachers filling up with dignitaries and their wives a woman waved to him that was congresswoman blackfordthe soldier hadnt been lying to him he waved back there was a special grandstand right behind the podium where the new president would be sworn in newsreel cameras in front of the podium would capture the moment so people all over the country could see it they were sure to capture cassius he didnt mind till he learned some skill to help him get through the rest of his life all he had to trade on was the one moment when his rifle spoke for him some of the people sitting around him were generals and admirals others had to be important democratic dignitaries their party had been out of office for eight years now they got to run things again they were friendly to him they shook his hand and congratulated him then they went back to chatting with one another talking about all the things they would do now that they could do them the seats on the podium started to fill up there were the incoming vice president and his wife there was the chief justice of the us supreme court there were outgoing president la follette and his wife and there at last were incoming president dewey and his wifeand a flock of hardeyed bodyguards around them vice president truman was sworn in first he gave no speech and had no counterpart to shake his hand president la follette had been vice president before the confederate bomb killed his predecessor and the office stayed empty after he left it when truman sat down dewey stood up so did la follette who took his place beside the chief justice the new president took the oath i do solemnly swear that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states as soon as dewey finished the oath presidentno expresidentla follette took a step forward and shook his hand then he sat down on the podium the chief justice also shook hands with president dewey he too sat down dewey stood behind the lectern and its undergrowth of microphones all the wireless webs would be sending his words live across the country it is a privilege to be here dewey said you have entrusted me with the great responsibility of winning the peace i would like to congratulate my distinguished predecessor president la follette for winning the desperate war jake featherston started cassius clapped along with everybody else now that dewey had won he could afford to be gracious to the man whod gone before him the new president looked out at the crowd he was young and smartly dressed he looked eager to get on with things he sounded the same way now that peace has come we will be prosperous and we will stay strong some in what were the confederate states may think they can drive us out i stand before the people of the united statesi stand before the people of the reunited statesto tell them they are wrong more applause rose cassius clapped harder this time than he had before he wanted the confederates to get everything that was coming to them and then some people around him clapped again too he didnt think most of them clapped as loud as they had before he did think that was too bad and i stand before the foreign powers of the world to remind them that the united states are strong and to remind them that we shall protect ourselves come what may and with whatever means seem necessary dewey went on the superbomb is an awful terrifying weapon we shall not use it unless provoked but those who might provoke us had better know they do so at their peril this time the hand he got was loud and long was he telling japan to watch out or was he warning the kaiser cassius had found out more about foreign countries since coming to the united states than he ever knew down in georgia the only foreign lands hed ever thought of there were the usawhich wasnt foreign any moreand the empire of mexico because mexicans had come to work in augusta and mexican soldiers had tried to kill him the world seemed a wider more complicated place than it had in the days before he shot jake featherston my administration will seek to prevent nations that do not now possess the superbomb from acquiring it dewey said we have seen at first hand the devastation it inflicts the german empire walks side by side with us in this effort both germany and the united states recognize the danger to world peace if irresponsible governments gain the ability to split the atom japan thennot the kaiser after all cassius thought he also wondered how president dewey knew the united states and germany would be responsible cassius decided he probably didnt but they already had the superbomb and they didnt aim to let anyone else join their club wasnt dewey whistling in the dark about his chances of succeeding the thought had hardly crossed cassius mind before the president said i know preventing others from building superbombs will be neither easy nor cheap we do intend to try however the safety of the world is at stake behind cassius a general leaned over to his wife and murmured when it doesnt work he can say we gave it our best shot cassius was sure he wasnt supposed to hear that he was also sure it made more sense than he wished it did dewey continued we will cleanse the old confederate states of the evil influence of the freedom party we will ensure that the negroes surviving there gain full rights as citizens and that the atrocities of the past can never come again as cassius applauded that a newsreel camera swung toward him he was here not least as deweys object lesson he didnt mind or not very much if the new president kept his pledge or even came close the negroes who remained south of the masondixon line would be better off than they ever had before dewey made more promises about all the wonderful things he would do within the united states cassius didnt know whether they would be wonderful or not he hoped so what could you do but hope after the speech ended dewey turned to the crowd people came up to congratulate him he and truman shook hands and smiled while photographers flashed away cassius went down with the rest of the people in his special grandstand good luck suh he said when he worked his way up to dewey thank you the new president gave his hand a quick professional pump thank you for everything youve made my job much easier i was mighty glad to do it suh cassius replied no nobody would ever think of him without thinking of his one moment he didnt mind that very much either it was one moment more than most of his luckless people ever got a tlanta again irving morrell would rather have stayed home with his family but even leave was welcome the atlantic military district hadnt come to pieces while he went back to the usa well he supposed that technically atlanta was part of the usa again too the locals didnt believe it for a minute morrell had trouble believing it himself things could have been worse none of the morale officersthere were such thingsin his command had had the brilliant idea of a soldiersagainstlocals football game the way that maniac in alabama had why not issue any confederates with a grudge an engraved invitation plenty of damnyankees to shoot at right here the only lucky thing was that the mortar crew hurt their own people worse than the us soldiers they were aiming at morrell didnt know what the co of the gulf coast military district had done with his intrepid footballplanning officer he knew what he would have done himself if it were up to him that major or whatever he was would be running the coast defenses of colorado right now he had his own problems railroad sabotage just wouldnt stop there were too many miles of track and not enough soldiers to keep an eye on all of them the war department didnt think that kind of offense justified executing hostages which was the only thing that might have ended it morrell supposed the military bureaucrats in philadelphia had a point if the us army murdered confederates for any little thing how did it differ from jake featherstons regime except in choice of victims but not killing confederates for any little thing sure made morrells life harder then there were the two dozen command cars in and around rocky mount north carolina that somehow got sugar in their gas tanks as good a way of wrecking an engine as any ever found the local co had dealt with that one on his own and sent atlanta a report later morrell approved of officers with initiative this one had commandeered motorcars from the locals to make up the lack and fined the whole town even fines got tricky though confederate silver and gold were still legal tender weight for weight those coins matched their us counterparts confederate paper wasnt not for dealings with the occupying authorities brown banknotes stayed in circulation among the locals there werent enough green bills to go around yet pretty soon all confederate paper would be illegal then squeezing the occupied states would get easier anyhow right now the situation with money was the same as it was most ways wherever the us authorities reached they ruled where they didnt or where they turned their backs even for a moment the old ways went on heres an ugly one sir a light colonel from the judgeadvocates office set a manila folder on morrells desk from greenville south carolina they strung up a negro for coughing at a white woman coughing morrell said thats what they do a lot of the time down here instead of whistling like we would the younger officer explained do we know who did it morrell asked sounds like those people need stringing up themselves yes sir but the lieutenant colonel sounded unhappy want to tell me more or do i need to go through all this stuff morrell set a hand on the folder well i can give you the short version the military attorney said good morrell was drowning in paperwork do that then right for one thing we know who did it but we cant prove anything everybody denies it everybody who was there swears he wasnt and nobody else was either as far as theyre concerned that colored guy hanged himself no us witnesses no sir all right you said for one thing that means theres something else doesnt it yes sir that town will go off like a bomb if we arrest these people greenville does not want to put up with the idea that a negro can get fresh with a white woman no matter what i dont know if the dead guy really did or he didnt but the whites may have surrendered to us they sure havent given up on the way things were before they did no huh morrell had heard that song too many times before it made up his mind for him send orders to the officer in charge there tell him to get his heavy weapons ready and make sure he has air support ready to fly then tell him to arrest those people and get them out of there if greenville rises well level the place are you sure sir the lieutenant colonel asked if i had a superbomb handy id drop it on those bastards thats how sure i am now lets get cooking uh yes sir the military attorney saluted and left his office in a hurry us soldiers arrested seventeen men and two women in greenville the town didnt rise morrell hadnt thought it would diehards here bushwhacked and raided and made godawful nuisances of themselves they showed no signs of being ready or able to fight pitched battles against us troops he called in a couple of writers from stars and stripes the army newspaper i want you to draft a pamphlet for me he told them aim it at whites in the former csa we can call it equality tell these bastards they dont have to like negroes but they cant go pissing on them the way they did before the war yes sir the men chorused one of them added when do you want it sir say a week morrell answered then ill get war department approval for it and then ill issue it ill issue it by the millions by god from now on nobodys going to be able to say well i didnt know what the rules were well tell em just what the rules are if they break em after that its their own damn fault he got the first draft six days later he didnt think it was strong enough and suggested changes when it came back he sent the text to philadelphia he wondered how long things would take there with the new administration coming in the bureaucracy was even bumpier than usual but he not only got approval four days later he also got a message saying that the powers that be had sent his text to the us commandants in the gulf coast military district the midsouth military district and the republic of texas they had orders to print and distribute equality too what the written word could do it would as soon as the pamphlet hit the streets complaints hit his desk he might have known they would hell he had known they would the former mayor of atlanta was in prison for aiding and abetting the removal of negroes from the town the new town commissioner was a fortyish lawyer named clark butler he would have been handsome if his ears hadnt stuck out hed always cooperated with us authorities before he was hopping mad now you mean we have to put up with it if a uh colored fellowhed learned it wasnt a good idea to say nigger around morrellmakes advances to a white woman as long as hes peaceable about it yes morrell asked do you mean to tell me white men never make advances to colored women butler turned red thats different how it just is morrell shook his head sorry no im not going to budge on this one maybe it was different before the war or you thought it was because you were on top and the negroes were on the bottom things arent like that any more butler scratched the edge of his thin mustache some of the states in the usa have miscegenation laws why are you tougher on us than you would be on them because you abused things worse morrell answered bluntly and i dont think theyll keep those laws much longer you gave them such a horrible example theyll be too embarrassed to leave em on the books youre going to cause a lot of trouble butler predicted in doleful tones ill take the chance morrell by contrast sounded cheerful if people here start trouble i promise well finish it its not fair butler said were only doing what we always did yes and look where that got you morrell retorted lets take you in particular for instance i know you didnt have anything to do with shipping negroes to campsweve checked you wouldnt be sitting there if you did youd be in jail with the old mayor but you knew they were disappearing didnt you well butler looked as if he wished he could disappear yes good well done morrell made clapping motions that were only slightly sardonic see you can own up to things if you try i wouldve thrown you out of my office if you said anything different but treatingcolored folks like white people equality the city commissioner pronounced the name of the pamphlet with great distaste peoplewhite peoplewont like that not even a little bit frankly butler i dont give a damn morrell was getting sick of the whole sorry business those are the rules youve got now youre going to play by them and thats flat if you try to make some poor negro sorry we will make you sorrier if you dont think we can do itor if you dont think we will do itgo ahead and find out you wont like what happens next i promise you that wake the town and tell the people we mean it colored folks in the same church colored kids in the same school plainly butler was picking the most hideous examples he could think of and morrell nodded as if his head were on springs thats right negroes working the same jobs as white people too and getting the same pay oh i dont expect colored lawyers right awayyou didnt let them get the education for that but theyll get it from here on out i dont reckon well put up with it butler said i truly dont segregation now segregation tomorrow and segregation forever are you saying that in your official capacity mr butler morrell asked if you are you just resigned clark butler reconsidered he had a wellpaying responsible job at a time and in a place where jobs of any kind were hard to come by well no i wasnt speaking officially he said after a brief pause i was just expressing the feelings of a lot of people in this part of the continentand you know thats so general morrell knew all right much too well after a pause of his own he replied i dont care what people feel i cant do anything about that but i damn well can do something about how people behave if you want to hate negroes in your heart go ahead while youre hating them though i will make you sorry if you treat them any different from whites have you got that equality enforced at the point of a bayonet butler jeered sounds pretty silly doesnt it morrell said with a smile the city commissioner nodded but morrell wasnt finished still when you get right down to it it beats the hell out of camps and ovens and mass graves i wasnt involved with that butler said quickly you wouldnt be talking with me now if you were morrell replied but you think youre serious about what youre going to do so are we you can find out the easy way or the hard way up to you butler left in a hurry after that morrell wasnt sorry to see him go and resolved to keep a closer watch on him from here on out he wondered whether the united states could enforce anything like equality on the old csa he still wasnt surebut he aimed to try t he only way clarence potter could have avoided seeing the pamphlet called equality was to stay in his apartment and never come out the yankees plastered the damn thing all over richmond during the war that common a propaganda leaflet would have meant the quartermaster corps didnt need to issue toilet paper for a while when he first read the pamphlet he thought it was an anumberone asswipe nothing else but after he looked at it again he still thought it was an asswipe but it was a clever asswipe and a determined one the damnyankees werent out to change hearts or minds in the dead csa they were out to change behavior if they rammed different behavior down peoples throats from richmond to guaymas they figured hearts and minds would eventually follow what worried potter most was they had a fighting chance of being right hed watched the same thing happen when the freedom party took over the csa even people who didnt like jake featherston and the party started greeting one another with freedom it was safer you couldnt get into trouble if you did it and after a while you didnt even feel selfconscious about it you took it for granted pretty soon you took the truth of everything the party said for granted and you and the confederate states of america with you followed jake featherston into the abyss now the yankees wanted to push what was left of the confederacy intoequality they didnt ask whites to love negroes they just said treat them the way youd treat yourselves or well make you regret it was there ever a more perverted application of the golden rule potter was sure lots of people hated the idea of negro equality even more than he did hed spent sixtyodd years in the csa he knew what was what here but he also knew he was being watched the damnyankees didnt waste subtlety showing him thatwhich didnt mean there werent also subtle spies ones he didnt notice right away he assumed his telephone was tapped and his mail read and so he sat tight and worked on his memoirs a generation earlier hed done what he could to free the csa from the onerous terms of the armistice after the great war but the confederacy wasnt crushed then it wasnt occupied either the usa had learned a bar fighters lesson since once you knocked a guy down you needed to kick him in the head so he couldnt jump up and come after you with a broken bottle one day in early march when spring was just starting to be in the air he went over to capitol square to look around woodrow wilson had declared war on the usa there in potter himself and nathan bedford forrest iii had halfheartedly plotted against jake featherston there too forrest was dead now because you needed to be a better plotter than he ever was to go up against the wily president of the csa featherston never found out potter was involved in that scheme if he had potter knew he would have died himself capitol square had been battered when the two generals sat on a park bench and talked about where the confederacy was going down the drain though neither of them knew it at the time the square looked even worse now than it had then which wasnt easy the grass was still mangy and leprous from winters freezes no one had mowed it for a long time it softened the outlines of bomb and shell craters without hiding them signs with big red letters shouted blunt warnings watch where you step and mines amp live ammo thus cautioned potter didnt walk across the square to the remains of the capitol a neoclassical building it had been bombed into looking like an ancient ruin from the pictures hed seen the colosseum and the parthenon were both in a hell of a lot better shape than this place workmen were hauling away the wreckage of albert sidney johnstons heroic statue like the confederacy it was good for nothing but scrap metal these days george washingtons statue now out from under its protective pyramid of sandbags had come through better even the yankees still respected washingtonsome anyhow two blue jays screeched in a tree a robin hopped on the ground eye cocked for bugs a skinny red tabby eyed the robin from behind a low mound of earth go get it potter murmured the cat had to eat too but the robin flew off the cat eyed potter as if it were his fault it was a catit wouldnt blame itself potter sketched a salute youre a loser too he said fondly the cat yawned showing off needle teeth it ambled away hed been looking for the bench where forrest first broached getting rid of featherston and getting out of the war once he sold his memoirs that bench would become a historical monument of sorts or rather it would have because he saw no sign of it one more casualty of war he found another bench deeper into capitol square despite the signs he didnt blow up getting to it he sat down getting out of the apartment felt good so did the sun on his face though hed grown used to being pasty during the war a man in a filthy confederate uniform was sleeping or passed out drunk in the tall grass not far away some newspapers did duty for a blanket potter didnt think the derelict was watching him though you never could tell somebody was somewhere he was sure of that he looked around to see if he could spot the spy not this time that proved exactly nothing of course after the end of the last war jake featherston had spent some time in capitol square as a drifter one more piece of flotsam washed up by the armistice then he ran into the freedom partyand it ran into him before he joined it was a tiny hopeless outfit that could keep its membership rolls and accounts in a cigar box afterwards now it was more than twentyfive years afterwards potter could see that everybody would have ended up better off if jake featherston went down some other street and never met the hopeless chucklehead who founded the freedom party once upon a time hed known that chuckleheads name he couldnt remember it now to save his life well it sure didnt matter any more he closed his eyes he wished he could close his nose the stench of death still lingered in richmond it would only get worse as the weather warmed up too how many years would it need to go away for good hey friend you got any change you can spare clarence potter opened his eyes the sleeping soldierhe still had a sergeants chevrons on his sleevehad come to life he was filthy and badly needed a shave god only knew when hed bathed last but potter didnt smell whiskey along with thewhat did that yankee soap ad call itbo here he dug in his pocket and found a halfdollar buy yourself something to eat he tossed it to the man much obliged sir the vet caught it out of the air he eyed potter you went through it i reckon twice potter agreed not always at the front but yeahtwice youve got the look all right the demobilized soldier stuck the fat silver coin in a trouser pocket you reckon well ever get back on our feet again sooner or later im sure of it when potter shrugged it may be later i dont know if ill live to see it i hope you do the younger man eyed him you talk kinda like a yankee he probably came from alabama or mississippi with another shrug potter answered i went to college up there yeah you like the yankees then if you do ill give you your money back on account of i dont want it keep it son its no secret that i dont care for the united states we cant fight them nowwere licked i dont know if well ever be able to fight them again but i wont like them if i live to be a hundred and my bones tell me i wont huh the vet said gravely and then we oughta fight em we oughta kick the snot out of em for what they done to us was he another jake featherston still unburst from his chrysalis of obscurity it was possible hell anything was possible but long odds long odds how many tens of thousands had there been after the last war potter had no idea he did know only one rose to the top he also knew this grimy fellow might be a provocateur not an embryo featherston the yankees wouldnt be sorry to have an excuse to stand him against a wall with a blindfold and a last cigarette no not even a little bit i have fought the usa as much as i intend to he said keeping it up when its hopeless only makes things worse for us who says its hopeless the young vet demanded i just did werent you listening even if we rise even if we take richmond what will the damnyankees do pull their people out of the city and drop a superbomb on it how do you aim to fight that they wouldnt but the mans voice suddenly held no conviction sure they would and if wed won wedve done the same thing to chicago if it rebelled and we couldnt squash it with soldiers what else are the damn bombs for the man in the shabby filthy butternut uniform looked up into the sky as if he heard the drone of a us heavy bomber one would be all it took the cities of the conquered csa lay naked before airplanes no antiaircraft guns any more no hound dogs waiting to scramble either the only reason the damnyankees hadnt done it yet was that nobodyd provoked them enough teddy roosevelt used to talk about the big stick potter said quietly theyve got the biggest stick in the world right now and theyll clobber us with it if we get out of line we lost i wish like hell we didnt i did everything i knew how to do to keep it from happening we cant get too far out of line now though it costs too goddamn much what am i supposed to do with myself then the veteran asked tears filled his voice and glistened in his eyes i been living on hate ever since we gave up dont hardly got nothin else to live on clean up find a job go to work find a girl plenty of em out there and not so many men help build a place where your kids would want to live potter shrugged where we are now what else is there a place where kidsd want to live under the stars and stripes likely tell the young man said scornfully right now its the only game in town maybe things will change later on i dont know youll see more of that than i do potters hair was nearer white than gray these days but if you go on feeling sorry for yourself and sleeping in the square maybe get drunk so you dont have to think about things who wins you or the usa i need to think about that the vet said slowly potter rose from the bench youve got time dont take too long though its out there grab with both hands he never would have had to say that to jake featherston jake always grabbed and look what it got him look what it got all of us clarence potter walked back toward the street the way hed come trying to step just where he had before again nothing blew up under him but how much difference did that make now jake featherston had blown up his whole country f lora blackford loved the smell of a kosher deli the meaty odors of salami and corned beef harmonizing with the brine and vinegar of the pickle barrel and contrasting with the aromas of bagels and freshbaked bread philadelphia had some decent delis but you needed to go back to new york city for the real thing her brother waved from a table in the back david hamburger had a double chin these days his brown hair was thinning and going gray flora was graying too she thought the thirty years just past would have grayed anybody even if theyd somehow happened in the blink of an eye dont get up she called as she hurried over to david i wasnt going to its too much like work he said the artificial leg hed worn since stuck out in front of him unnaturally straight good to see you you still talk to me even though we won for a change maybe flora said they both smiled david had been a democrat and a conservative one ever since he got hurt violence had done its worst to him so he seemed to think it would solve anything after this round of war that seemed less foolish to flora than it had before sometimes nothing else would do she sat down a waiter came up nu he said she ordered corned beef on rye and a bottle of beer david chose lox and bagels with his beer the waiter scribbled scratched his thick gray mustache and went away how are you flora asked hows your family everybodys fine me im not too bad her brother answered hows joshua doing she told him what joshua had said about not being able to give anyone the finger with his left hand david laughed an old soldiers laugh flora went on hes lucky i know but i still wish it never happened well i understand that her brother said ive had a pretty good life taking it all in all but i sure wish i didnt stop that one bullet david sighed im lucky too look at poor yosselthe first yossel i mean he never got to see his son at all i know flora said i was thinking about that every minute after joshua got conscripted but he wanted to join what can you do nothing david answered part of watching them grow up is figuring out when to let go when joshua got old enough for conscription he got too old for you to stop him he told me the same thing flora said ruefully he wasnt wrong but what did it get him a stretch in the hospital and an idea of what the countrys worth david said the waiter brought the food and the beer david piled his bagel high with smoked salmon and bermuda onion and ignored the cream cheese that came with them flora thought that was perverse but no accounting for taste david hamburger proved as much continuing now that hes bled for it he wont want to let it get soft flora had seen reactionary signs in joshua since he got wounded and didnt like them tartly she answered you dont have to get wounded to love the united states or be a patriot her brother was busy chewing an enormous mouthful he washed it down with a swallow of beer i didnt say you did he replied at last but you sure dont see things the same way after you catch one now flora was eating and had to wait before she could say anything putting on the uniform doesnt turn everybody into a democrat plenty of socialist veteransquite a few of them in congress in fact i know i know david said still if theyd sat on that featherston mamzer before he got too big to sit on who was president when featherston took over flora asked indignantly and answered her own question hoover was thats who the last time i looked hoover was a democrat yeah yeah david did his best to brush that aside who gave away kentucky and houston al smith was no democrat and he handed the confederates the platform they needed to damn near ruin us that was a mistake flora admitted the trouble was nobody here really believed featherston wanted a war the great war was so awful for both sides why would anybody want to do that again he didnt he wanted to win this time and he almost did her brother said he wanted to get rid of his shvartzers too who would have believed that you were ahead of everybody there flora i give you credit for it sometimes you dont want to be right it costs too much flora said nobody in the usa wanted to let cs negroes in when he started persecuting them the democrats were worse about it than the socialists though all right so we didnt have things straight all the time either david answered deweyll do a better job of holding down the csa than la follette would have thats the plank he ran on well see if he means it flora said david laughed was there ever a politician you wouldnt say that about i can think of three flora replied debs teddy roosevelt and robert taft when they said theyd do something they meant it it didnt always help them sometimes it just left them with a bullseye on their back after a moments thought david nodded and two more he said you and hosea thank you flora said softly i try so did hoseaand he never got the credit for it he deserved he never would either and she knew it not when the economic collapse happened while he was president after a pull at her beer she went on ill give you another one myron zuckerman he was an honest man her brother agreed flora nodded he was and if he didnt trip on the stairs and break his neck i never would have run for congress my whole life would have looked different i would have stayed an organizer or worked in the clothing business like the rest of the family zuckermans bad luck the countrys good luck you say that with your politics youll make me blush its only because im your sister flora tried not to show how pleased she was hey i disagree with you sometimeswell a lot of the time so what you are my sister and im proud of you david answered besides i know i can always borrow money from you if i need it he never had not a penny flora had always shared with her parents and sister and younger brother but david stubbornly made his own way im doing all right he would say it seemed to be true for which flora was glad he grinned at her so what does it mean what weve been through since the great war started youre the politician tie it up for me you dont ask for much flora exclaimed her brother laughed he picked up his beer bottle discovered it was empty and waved for another one flora drank from hers if she was going to try to answer a question like that she needed fortifying well for starters weve got the whole united states back if we can ever stop the people in the south from hating us like rat poison since when do they like us that much david said a painfully true joke he went on we can hold them down if we have to them and the canadians a negro who got out of the csa before the great war said that if you hold a man down in the gutter you have to get into the gutter yourself flora said do we want to do that do we want the confederate states back in business do we want them building superbombs again david asked adding the one they used almost got you i know flora said dont remind me well then by the way david said it he thought hed proved his point but flora answered do we want our boys down there for the next fifty years bleeding a little every day it would be like a sore that wont heal better that than worrying about them blowing us off the map david said and they would too weve fought them four times in the past eighty years you think they dont want to try to get even because we won the last two no i dont think so not for a minute flora knew some socialists had thought such things after the great war it was unfortunate but it was true nobody thought that way any more though once bitten twice shy twice bittenstill if we cant turn them into people who belong in the united states what are we going to do with them do we want people like that in our country people who murdered eight or ten million negroes even when the tsar turns loose a pogrom its not as bad as that a choleriyeh on the tsar flora hated the idea of russia with a superbomb too germany would have to deal with russia though the usa just didnt have the reach she got back to the business at hand they didnt kill all the negroes no but they didnt try to stop the freedom party goons either they cheered them on for crying out loud david said and you know what scares me nu flora asked if it happened down there it could happen here it could happen to negroes here or god forbid it could happen to jews if you get enough people hot and bothered anything can happen anything at all god forbid is right flora said i like to think we wouldnt do anything like that yeah me too and how many shvartzers thought their white neighbors wouldnt do anything like that how many of them are left to think anything now her brother answered his own question not many maybe seeing what the confederates did will vaccinate us against it flora said we can hope so anyway alevai david said alevai omayn flora nodded but can you imagine a politician saying i want to do the same thing jake featherston did look how well it worked down there mm maybe notnot for a while anyway david smiled crookedly lets hear it for bad examples i always aimed to be one for my children but massacring people goes a little too far a little sure flora reached out and set her hand on his he looked astonished she realized she hadnt done that inoh much too long and some bad example you are hey im a democrat how can i be anything but a bad example youll have to work harder than that flora hoped he wouldnt get angry he had worked hard all his life he didnt here ill give it my best shot he pulled out a pack of cigarettes and lit one how am i doing i think you need to try something else flora fought not to laugh dont know what i already drink dont want to chase womenim happy with the one i caught and youre the family politician well i like that davids smile got crookeder yet you know what me too flora pointed to the pack give me one of those you dont smoke so what right now i do he handed her a cigarette then leaned close to light it from his she thought it tasted terrible but she didnt care not just then they blew out smoke together
