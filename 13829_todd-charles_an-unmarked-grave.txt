charles todd an unmarked grave the fourth book in the bess crawford mystery series for the national world war i museum in kansas cityfor gathering in one place the record of a war that changed a generation and even a century in gratitude for asking us to speak there and for hours exploring a remarkable and moving collection chapter one france spring i stopped just outside the ward and leaned my head against the cool wood of the doorframe i couldnt remember when last id slept or for that matter eaten anything more than a few biscuits now and again with a hasty cup of tea the spanish influenza had already cut down three of our nursing sisters and two doctors were not expected to live through the night the rest of us were struggling to keep men alive in the crowded wards and losing the battle hourly depressing to watch the bodies being carried out one more soldier lost to an enemy we couldnt even see it was an insidious killer this influenza id watched men in the best of health in the afternoon gasping for breath by the next morning tossing with fever lying too ill to speak then fighting to draw a next breath id watched nurses and orderlies work with patients for days on end without showing a single sign of illness only to collapse unexpectedly and join the ranks of the dying the young were particularly vulnerable on the other hand private wilson close to forty seemed to be spared even though he handled the dead gently wrapping them in their soiled sheets and carrying them out to await interment the shed just beyond the wards was filled with bodies sometimes stacked like lumber the burial details couldnt keep up and those men too were dying the influenza epidemic was already being spoken of as a twentiethcentury plague and no one was safe i feared for my parentsthere had been no word from somerset for over a fortnight even simon brandon hadnt written and that was more worrying was he too ill or trying to find a way to tell me that the colonel sahib and my mother had died every post seemed to bring sad news to the wounded or the staff and word was that people in britain as well as france were dropping in the streets or dying before they could reach hospital entire families wiped out matron had told me that the posts were delayed because so many of the censors had fallen ill and there was no one to take their place cold comfort but all i had and as time went on i wasnt really sure that i wanted to hear sister burrows came out the door and i moved aside she slipped off her mask as i had done and took a deep breath of the evening air dear god she said and it was half a prayer i dont know how much more i can face theres nothing we can do for them nothing and there are the wounded to nurse as well itsits rather overwhelming she was pale with exhaustion dark circles beneath her eyes a mirror of my face i thought if i had had the time to look at my own reflection i ache with weariness she went on after a moment how are you bearing up as well as anyone else i answered it will have to end soon the influenza there will be no one else to infect two officers leaning on canes limped past nodding to us and another man turning his back to us disappeared into the canteen his shoulder was swathed in bandages and i couldnt help but notice how stained and ragged they were i knew i ought to hurry after him and ask to have a look at the wound but i didnt have the energy let him drink his tea undisturbed then report to matron today we received more influenza patients than battlefield wounded i commented as the heavy odor of french tobacco followed in the wake of an orderly carrying a mop and pail i hope the germans are suffering as badly as we are if not in a few weeks theyll be able to walk unimpeded to paris i smiled if they try theyll be struck down as well all the lines are reporting influenza cases on a more somber note i said seeing that orderly reminds me when he has time private wilson has been carrying linens to the laundry and bringing back fresh supplies and still were running short ill pass the word she said when he comes back this way she cocked her head to one side i can hear the guns again youd think the germans would have the decency to stop fighting until this influenza is over there was an hour of blessed silence earlier i even heard a lark somewhere i pulled my mask back into place i must look in on the major his fever is soaring go on ill bring cool water to you to bathe his face i thanked her and went inside we did what we could to help each other as well as our patients even matron had taken her turn bringing round the tray of tea i wasnt sure whether it was in the middle of the night or early morning when lieutenant benson died i had sat by his bed for an hour or more knowing the end was near but refusing to give up my head ached from leaning forward to hold his hand at the last as hed asked me to do and i was rather dizzy from missing my dinner but there had been no time to spare for it lieutenant bensons death had not been a tranquil oneinfluenza never lets its victims slip easily awayand as i closed his eyes i felt a crushing sadness dr timmons came then and confirmed that the patient was dead i went to ask the orderlies to bring the stretcher to our ward private wilson was on duty as he so often seemed to be and as he followed me back to the lieutenants bedside with his stretcher bearers in tow he leaned forward and said in a low voice sister will you come to the shed with us i couldnt bear the thought the next time perhaps i offered please sister crawford he said urgency in his voice as he quickly looked over his shoulder i reluctantly nodded it wasnt like private wilson to be so insistent or so secretive the lieutenant was carefully placed on the stretcher covered by a sheet and our wretched little party made its way between the rows of cots to the ward door private wilson passed his torch to me and in the chilly darkness i led the way across to the shed a distance of about forty feet opening the doors for the others to pass inside i shone the torch ahead of them trying not to think about the men who lay here men i had watched die i waited uncertain why i was supposed to be in this place but still trusting private wilsons judgment while the lieutenant was added to the rows of the dead when it was done private wilson cast a glance in my direction then turned to his stretcher bearers they were as holloweyed with fatigue as the rest of us take yourselves off for a cigarette lads the sister wishes to say a few words over the dead this one was special like i nearly denied it but caught myself in time simon brandon would have called private wilson a steady man whatever he was about he wanted privacy grateful for the opportunity his men touched their caps to me and disappeared in the direction of the canteen when they were out of hearing private wilson said in a low voice sister what im about to ask you to do wont be pleasant but i think youll agree afterward that its necessary mystified i said very well he guided me deeper inside the shed the torch beam picked out the sheetshrouded remains on either side of me this way he said and took me to the back row in the far left corner in spite of the disinfectant the shed smelled of death and i felt like turning on my heel and hurrying out again as quickly as i could but i followed him as he added the burial detail will be here in an hour and hell be gone who would be gone he steadied the beam of the torch and then knelt over his shoulder i could see a mans arm just visible in an opening in the sheet wrapping him i was surprised and then i realized why the sheet was unwindingit hadnt been done up properly in the first place reaching beneath the corpse above private wilson managed to uncover the body so that i could just pick out a shoulder throat and finally the side of a face hes not an influenza victim private wilson said look at him he reached out to pull the sheet wider for a better view shifting the body above this one and nearly starting an avalanche of the dead i caught my breath until the swaying stopped he was right this one corpse among so many showed none of the darkening of the skin of the spanish influenza victim instead his head lolled as private wilson worked with him and i realized that his neck must have been broken that was odd for one thing we seldom saw such a wound and for another he would have died instantly there would have been no reason for the forward aid station to send him on to us i dont understand i began doubtfully then stopped as private wilsons torch settled on the face of the corpse i knew this man even in the shielded light of the torch i was sure and i was just as sure that hed never been a patient here i would have recognized him straightaway or if hed been in another ward one of the other sisters would have said something to me they knew i was always on the lookout for anyone who served in my fathers old regiment then why was he lying among our dead i stood there my tired mind trying to absorb this shock finally it occurred to me that hed indeed been wounded and that in the ambulance something had happeneda freak accident when the driver hit a deep hole a fall from the upper berth onto the steel floor but if that was true where were the bruises to support it i leaned forward to search for an identification tag to my surprise there was none and he wasnt in uniform it was true we sometimes got patients so badly wounded we had no idea who they were or what regiment theyd served with a tunic already torn in the trenches cut off in the forward aid station for a better look at the site or removed entirely for emergency surgery and any hope of identifying him could be lost well before a man arrived in our ward but as a rule the ambulance driver could tell us his unit or there were other wounded from his sector who could give us a name and rank until the patient was able to speak for himself please i need a little more light i whispered trying to see where hed been wounded we need to mind the time sister the burial detail will be here soon and we dont want to attract anyone elses attention still he brought the light nearer i couldnt find any other marks on the mans body except for a few scars some of them half healed others from before the war i looked at him again death had changed his features of course but not so much that i could have doubted the evidence of my own eyes i hadnt been wrong and there was only one conclusion i could draw i stepped back thoroughly shaken dear god it was all i could manage to say what should i do my first inclination was to call someone and have the majors body taken out of the shed to somewhere the circumstances of his death could be looked into it was then i realized that he hadnt been dead for very long rigor hadnt set in yet which meant that whoever had killed him was very likely still somewhere in the vicinity but who could have done this why should major carson have been murdered there i had put it into words murder private wilson had already come to that conclusion hed brought me here to be his witness my mind refused to function where to start matron of course begin with matron i told myself pulling the sheet back over the body and then the face i said how did you discover him by accident private wilson answered i was doing a count of the bodies as i always do for the burial details records and i found there were fiftyseven not fiftysix i started again and actually walked by each of the rows to be sure thats when i saw the arm he wasnt put here by my men sister i see to it that those who died of their wounds are on the far side of the shed the influenza patients over here its been my way of doing things since this epidemic began in earnest how did he come to be here in the first place this far behind the lines thats a very good question my guess is its likely whoever killed him thought to hide him here but he didnt know how it was done did he how to wind the sheet properly or which side to put him on or that my count would be off he hesitated do you know him sister can you put a name to him i its been quite a few years but he was a lieutenant in my fathers old regiment id been told that hed been promoted again and was now a major his name is vincent carson i didnt wish to speak to anyone else about this business until id talked to someone i could trust i didnt wish to find myself accused of putting him here after all im the one in charge of the dead you might say no of course i understand matron is finally sleeping im to wake her in an hours time ill tell her then shell know whats best to do can you put off the burial detail just for a bit once hes taken away theres no hope of proving he was here how he died or even who he is hell be in an unmarked grave ill do my best perhaps we shouldnt waitperhaps we should go to one of the doctors i shook my head theyve got their hands full with the living more wounded just arrived no matron is the best choice ive seen her cope in every sort of emergency you can imagine but could she cope with murder it was my turn to hesitate you do understand dont you it hasnt been very long since major carson was killed whoever put him here could be one of usan orderly someone from the canteen you me one of the ambulance drivers not a pleasant thought is it private wilson said he helped me finish wrapping the major as best we could so that he appeared to look more or less like his neighbors id been dizzy before but the disinfectant in here seemed to be aggravating it i was finding it hard to concentrate was eager to leave the shed and step out into the fresh air to clear my head but duty was duty i stood there for a moment longer remembering lieutenant carson hed been young and eager his shock of unruly red hair setting him apart and his grin had been contagious now his hair was shortcropped and showing signs of graying and it was a mans face id looked into thinner deeply etched by his years in the trenches dark circles beneath his eyes from lack of sleep and too many horrors witnessed the face of war my father had called it i felt a pang for my father when the news reached him hed thought highly of lieutenant carson and hed told me once that he wouldnt be surprised to see lieutenant carson in command of the regiment one day even then his knowledge of military strategy and tactics had been outstanding and i had believed the colonel sahibs prediction wed best be going sister private wilson said urging me toward the shed doors we dont want to arouse curiosity lingering here like he was right i turned and in silence walked with him to the door thank you for confiding in me private wilson i shivered in the chilly air of the night as i crossed the bruised grass ill bring matron as soon as possible with any luck the burial detail will be late anyway but hold them off as long as you can tell themtell them that matron wishes to speak to them rather a dirty business murder he said grimly i couldnt believe the evidence of my own eyes when i found him then turning to me he asked are you all right sister i think i forgot to eat ill just go across to the canteen and have some tea thank you sister it was a brave thing to do coming with me in that shambles ill be close by on call if matron wishes to see the man for herself and ill keep an eye on the shed and then he was gone tramping off in the darkness to where he could watch for the burial detail as promised i hastily swallowed a cup of tea then went back into the ward stumbling on the threshold i must get some sleep i told myself as soon as ive spoken to matron and weve contacted the proper authoritiesi must write to the colonel sahib also as well just then one of the other nursing sisters called to me asking me to help her change the bedding of a patient whose fever had broken in a cold sweat glancing at my watch i went down the ward to where sister marshall was waiting it was only a little more than forty minutes before the hour was up not long at all now before i could wake matron i blinked my eyes as the face of the watch seemed to swim in front of them shaking off my fatigue i smiled at sister marshalls patient this is a good sign youll feel like drinking a little broth later to begin healing i made a mental note to bring the lieutenant a cup as soon as he was settled again my head was pounding as i bent over the bed to tuck in the sheets and my shoulders were beginning to ache i ignored the pain moving on to the next bed to hold a patient upright as he went into a paroxysm of coughing hardly able to draw the next breath thirty minutes now until i could wake matron when the time came i didnt wake up matron after all nor tell her about the extra body in the shed instead i was being carried to an empty cot on a stretcher and i was soon fighting for my life chapter two it was my turn to be nursed and i remember very little about it feverish and choking on the fluids that threatened to overwhelm my struggling lungs i was ill for days slipping in and out of consciousness once it seemed i heard matron saying shes strong i thought shed be all right i tried to rouse myself to tell her about private wilson and the body in the shed but i couldnt put the words together and must have made no sense another time i heard dr wright speaking i opened my eyes and saw his thin haggard face as he bent over me to listen to my lungs her father is colonel richard crawford hell want to know know what that i was dying but i couldnt let them down by dying i couldnt imagine my mothers face when word came a telegram a letter i couldnt hold the thought long enough to decide later still it was simon brandons voice that reached me in the dim recesses of illness and pain urging me to drink a little broth to keep my strength up but simon was in england and i was in france confused i let myself drift once more wanting to cry with the agony in my chest that was threatening to kill me he was there again bathing my face and hands as the fever peaked and finally as i lay so weak that opening my eyes seemed to be too great an effort even to contemplate his voice said bracingly it was a closerun thing bess but youre going to live im taking you to england tomorrow hang on a little longer and youll be home a while later it was an australian voice that spoke to me and i felt my hands gripped tightly but i couldnt respond i was told afterward that id slept most of the journey back to england because of that and the fact that in somerset it had been raining for a week or more it was decided that the longer journey home would be too much for me instead as soon as we landed in dover i was settled into a motorcar amongst a mountain of pillows and carried by easy stages to eastbourne on the southern coast of sussex there my father had taken rooms at the grand hotel i was aware in doveronly justof my mothers hands touching my face and her voice saying my darling and then my father telling her dont cry my love shes safe now and simons voice said she was exhausted to begin with even before she was taken ill it will be some time before shes herself again i hoped i wasnt dreaming in delirium that they really were there i awoke one morning in a lovely room filled with sunshine the sound of the sea rolling across the shingle strand a soothing backdrop to living in the present once more as i opened my eyes i found it difficult to imagine where i was not at home nor in london or france not even in the cramped little stateroom on a crossing around me now were the elegant furnishings and high ceilings of a firstclass hotel or was it an hotel india the maharanis palace but i was lying in a bed not on silvershot silk cushions just then my gaze found my mothers face surprised i said hullo my voice sounded rusty from disuse all the same i could almost watch the strain fade as she smiled at me my darling girl she exclaimed and her fingers reached out to brush a strand of hair from my forehead could you drink a little more broth do you think and for once i drained the cup before i lay back against the pillows too weak to do more than watch the shadows of sunlight on water that danced across the ceiling above my head the sea air was heavenly the sun bright no guns thundering in the distance too close for comfort i took a deep breath and smiled as she took the cup away my mother must have said something to my father because he came in almost at once taking up my hands as they lay on the coverlet and kissing them gently welcome home he said his voice husky much later i understood how hard it had been for him this illness of mine for once in his life he had faced an enemy a regiment with all its might couldnt defeat he sat for a time by my bed watching me as i drifted quietly into sleep again and when i woke it was simon sitting there in his place the colonel is resting your mother as well he told me softly i dont think theyve closed their eyes for days i was sure he hadnt either for the lines of worry in his face told their own tale smiling he fed me more broth and held my hand as my father had done while i slipped in and out of a healing sleep they took it by turns the three of them staying constantly by my side plumping pillows feeding me until i could manage a spoon for myself and talking of things that had nothing to do with war or sickness gradually i understood where i was and was even carried to the window to lie there for a while and watch the sea below when i was stronger i was allowed to sit on the sunny balcony swathed in blankets and shawls my father read to me sometimes and simon sat by me in companionable silence my mother tried not to treat me like her small daughter recovering from measles and that was a measure of how frightened she had been for me i on the other hand was unspeakably grateful that the three people dearest to me in the world had not been struck down by this merciless killer i learned too that mrs hennessey who let the flat where i stayed in london on my leaves had also come through unscathed mary one of my flatmates had been ill but it was a milder case and she had survived diana had been just as lucky there was no accounting for the way the disease had chosen its victims one evening we were sitting together simon and i watching the moon rise over the water and enjoying the milder weather earlier the band had been playing in the openair stand close by the strand and the music had drifted up to us along with the soft whispers of the waves rolling in there had been old favorites as well as martial tunes and i had hummed along with some of the selections then reluctantly breaking the mood i said simon i had the most vivid dream while i was ill it had to do with major carson do you remember him in fact i saw him in france not three months ago he said what brought him to mind im not quite sure hesitatingly i added he was dead his body hidden amongst the influenza victims i thinkit appeared that his neck had been broken in the pale light of the moon i saw his gaze turn toward me after a moment he said fever does odd things with the mind and you were very ill yes i know still i dreamed i needed to tell matron about finding him but she was sleeping and i couldnt remember where and i could hear the burial detail coming for him and i had to stop it but i couldnt move i couldnt speak as if i were paralyzed or strapped down to my cot it was all rather frightening i shouldnt worry about it my dear he said gently the dream will fade as you heal im glad i told him smiling grateful for the lovely evening and the peace of england not everyone was as fortunate as i had been leaning my head back against the pillows i watched the moon ride through a cloudless night sky before drifting into a dreamless sleep i awoke in my own bed the next morning and felt better than i had for weeks but the influenza epidemic was still raging and i knew how desperately i was needed in france i concentrated on getting well and recovering my strength which seemed to have flown out the window we began to walk my parents or simon taking it by turns to accompany me at first it was only a few dozen feet across reception before i succumbed to a weakness so profound i had to lean on someones arm to make what seemed to be an interminable return journey to my room determined to heal three times a day i sallied forth and soon i could stroll to the music stand and then nearly as far as the pier before very long i could even walk out to the piers end and then back to the grand hotel without weakness or shortness of breath the next day simon dismissed the carriage that was paid to follow us wherever we went in the event i tired when first i had brought up returning to the war the colonel sahib vigorously opposed it and i saw the fright in my mothers eyes at the very thought and so i had said nothing more they were right it was too soon eager as i was to resume my duties and spell the overworked staff that so desperately needed experienced nursing sisters i mustnt become a burden for them instead holding on to my patience i had concentrated on recovering and regaining my strength a few days after simon dismissed the carriage my mother and i walked to the west of the hotel for a closer look at the seven sisters the great white chalk cliffs that ranged beyond beachy head light the wind whipping at our skirts as my mother and i stood looking at the line of headlands the lighthouse itself was invisible down along the waterline and tucked out of sight sometimes great chunks of the cliff faces fell into the sea but today in hazy sunlight they shone so white it hurt the eyes to stare at them i said i shall have to go back you know without looking at me my mother said bess when you are stronger next week or the week after well let the doctor decide shall we but dr everett was a family friend and not to be trusted if my mother asked him to keep me in england longer hed do it for her i tried another tack id be willing to spend a week in a clinic to test my strength i can feel the wind shifting shall we turn back and as we did she added ill speak to the colonel sahib bess dear i left it at that hoping that the seed was planted and with luck would grow and i hoped as well that i could count on my father to back me up this time but i was wrong there nothing was said that evening and early the next morning a summons came from somerset my parents bade me a guilty goodbye and set out for home leaving me in simons care for a few days a memorial service id almost forgot darling my mother said bending to kiss my cheek ive been so worried for you it slipped my mind but thank heavens the rector sent to remind us whose service i asked trying to keep a note of suspicion out of my voice at the sudden and alltooconvenient disappearance of both my parents my suspicion was wiped away by my mothers answer i thought richard or simon had told you perhaps they felt it was too soon after your own illness its vincent carson bess hes dead he was killed just after you left france the original service had to be postponed because large gatherings were discouraged the family feels its safe enough now to hold it the colonel sahib is delivering the eulogy i was about to tell her that major carson was dead well before i sailed for dover but just in time i remembered that i had only dreamed it it hadnt recurredi was thankful for thatbut it hadnt faded the way dreams usually do and that was worrying simon and i wished them a safe journey and watched them out of sight hed only just come back from london and my father had taken him off for a brief report before setting out and then to my surprise without a word he walked off down the promenade toward the pier i thought perhaps he wished to be alone that something had happened in london or wherever hed been because i had noticed a grim set to his mouth as he and my father had emerged from simons room but when he returned to the hotel he waved to me as i sat on my balcony i went down to meet him and we walked on to one of the benches set out on the lawn my mother just told me that major carson had been killed he was a fine officer i spoke to his widow just last week shes resigned i think if this war lasts much longer there will be no one left to come home how did he die i fought to keep the anxiety from my voice surely not according to julia he was struck by shrapnel and died instantly a kindness she said everyone in england wished a kind death on their loved ones no lingering no crying out for mothers or wives no painfilled last moments it wasnt always that easy whatever a sympathetic commanding officer wrote to the next of kin id held too many men during their last moments i didnt intend to carry it any furtherthis was not the best time to bring up the dream indeed i should have felt immense relief that it was no more than that but the images in my mind suddenly vivid and disturbing wouldnt go away i needed to exorcise them once and for all before i could stop myself i said simon remember i told you once that i believed id seen vincent carsons body amongst the spanish influenza victims but it didnt belong there yes it was a dream you said does it still worry you in a way i try to put it out of my mind but sometimes i question whether it was real or fever for one thing why should i dream that hed been murdered and i felt that his murderer must still be nearby that it was urgent to report his body its that sense of urgency that makes it impossible to let go of the dream please i dont want it to be true i just wish there was some way to settle this for good then i could tell myself to stop being silly ive dealt with patients who were delirious and their nightmares fade with time mine hasnt i need to know why i made a gesture of frustration not certain how to explain the confusion i felt part of it is my fault i should have told you when you first mentioned it that he was dead that might have helped but i thought it wasnt the best time to give you such sad news i smiled wryly theres one solution when im back in france ill find private wilson and speak to him he might be able to tell me why i thought id gone into that shed there will be a simple explanation i could already imagine private wilson saying in his gruff kind way sister you fell ill just after lieutenant benson died you were that upsetsmall wonder you imagined oh i said my hand flying to my mouth in bewilderment simonit was just after one of my patients had died that i fell ill and when the body was removed private wilson wanted me to see what hed discovered in the shed that part must be true he wasnt certain what should be done about it it still doesnt explain why i should have thought it was major carson a dead man amongst dead men he said after a moment have you thought bess that if there was someone in the shed who didnt belong there private wilson has already dealt with the problem while you were ill and if he didnt without your confirmation whoever it was has long since been buried murdered or not if there was no identification with the body finding it now will be nearly impossible in an unmarked grave sadly there isnt much that could be done youre right of course i said wishing i could keep the doubt out of my voice julia told me carson had died instantly was that a kind lie was he brought in dying of his wounds do you remember seeing him in the ward i shook my head he was never one of my patients its just an uncomfortable coincidence that major carson died about this same time as if id foreseen his death he stared at me in the sunny warmth of the morning i wish youd come to me sooner or id pursued this when you first mentioned your dream i didnt thinkthere has to be a way to resolve this for you i cant do as i did at eight i cant open the closet door and see for myself that no monsters live inside i smiled making light of my feelings theres no need to wait until youre back in france ill look into this what was the orderlys name private wilson he should be easy enough to find thank you i replied feeling a wash of relief shall i ask your fathers help no please at leastnot yet i had other issues to face with my parents consider it done meanwhile its too fine a day to waste well take a drive in the afternoon shall we and ill ask the hotel to put up a lunch for us at a little past eleven oclock simon knocked at my door as promised and i went down with him to his motorcar the drive out of eastbourne was lovely climbing through narrow twisting lanes where trees overhung the road and cast cool shadows we came into the little village of jevington where pretty cottages lined the road and wildflowers bloomed along the low walls i saw an elderly man stooped and gnarled by rheumatism hoeing between his roses unexpectedly i was reminded of melinda crawford who like me had lived in india as a child but much much earlier at the time of the indian mutiny melindas mother had survived the unspeakable horrors of the siege and subsequent battle for lucknow struggling to keep her small daughter safe and when it was over and she had come back to her house on the outskirts of the town she found it burned to the ground and her english garden in ruins she had knelt in the torn earth and wept for her lost roses it was the only time melinda had seen her mother cry until the death of her father a small link with home that garden and its destruction seemed to epitomize all she had suffered in a foreign country i wondered who the old man was keeping those roses alive for through these awful years of war a sona grandson simon took a turning to the left up a twisting road that led to a knoll and there before us was the church of st marys set above its sloping churchyard overlooking the back gardens of houses below it nearer the lane a stretch of clipped grass offered a view of the weald crystal clear in the noon air the church was partly saxon and we went inside to look at their stonework in the tower and then moved down the aisle there had been a service here only this morning the flowers at the altar not yet wilted the air of sorrow still lingering in the dim silence outside simon spread our rugs on the grass by the view and brought out the large wicker basket provided by the hotel inside were sandwiches bread and cheese even banbury buns we ate in companionable silence and there was a thermos of tea for me a bottle of wine for simon although i noticed that he didnt open it we had just finished the last crumbs of the banbury buns when he shattered the tranquil spell bess your parents have asked me to speak to you they were already late starting for somerset but they wanted you to know that they fully understand your eagerness to return to nursing after all its what youve trained for what you do so well my heart leapt with joy but he was still speaking and so its been arranged for you to be posted to a clinic in somerset beginning at the end of next week it shouldnt try your strength too far and youll be close enough to come home occasionally i stared at him then interrupted him not wanting to hear any more buti told mother that im needed in france not to belittle the demands of working in a clinic devoted to convalescents but it wasnt why i had trained to be a nurse as long as the war lasted i wanted to serve the men fighting and dying in the trenches simon was examining the view as if trying to memorize it unwilling to meet my gaze you must understand bess they came close to losing you twice once on britannic when she went down at sea and again when you nearly died of the spanish influenza and you came close my dear girl too close for our comfort his voice changed as he said the words and it was a measure of how id frightened those i loved yes i understand of course i do but if i were a soldier in my fathers regimentas i could have been if i were his son and not his daughterhe would want me to return to my duty third times unlucky bess thats how they see it i bit my lip then asked quietly because im their daughter essentially yes youre all they have vincent carson was all that julia had he was her husband no one made any effort to keep him in england thats different bess and you know it im sure julia would have tried if she could is it different simon i got up and walked across the lane to stare up at the stonework of the saxon church tower simon followed me after a moment standing just behind me for the first time i could remember i was furious with my father and then with my mother for not taking my part in this argument they had supported me from the beginning when i chose to go into nursing reluctantly yes but they had understood the call of duty why not now i knew why of course simon was right twice id had close calls nurses did die at the front of illness of gunshot wounds from aircraft that made it behind the linesid had experience of that myselfof shells gone astray nurse edith cavell had died before a german firing squad there were no guarantees but i could have just as easily died of the influenza in somerset never having set foot in france yes i was their only child but how many mothers had lost their only sons how many wives had grieved for their husbands how many children had lost their fathers i needed to go back i needed to do what i could for the torn bodies that came to the forward aid stations or to the hospitals just behind the lines i couldnt sit out the rest of the war in what amounted to the comfort of a somerset clinic it was unimaginable had my parents given simon this onerous task of breaking the news to me rather than face up to it themselves they must have thought you very brave to take on this charge for them i said over my shoulder unable to keep the bitterness from my voice it was almost as if simon had betrayed me too the colonel and his lady had to leave for somerset bess julia carson particularly asked your father to deliver the eulogy its expecting too much i said turning to him in the sunlight framed by the rolling green land of the weald he looked every inch the soldier a tall strong very attractive man with more courage than most give it a try bess you can save lives in a clinic you know a handful compared to whats happening in france youve been to the front you know how they are dying ive seen it he said shortly it was the first time hed admitted that hed been sent into the thick of the fighting for reasons he never spoke of he took a deep breath and i realized that for the first time in all the years hed been close to my family that i was asking him to divide his loyalties to go against my parents express wishes and help me do what they didnt want me to do i stood there waiting all the while knowing how cruel it was even to ask a choice between the colonel sahib and my mother on one side and me on the other i knew i would remember the expression in his eyes for the rest of my life bess he began and then choosing his words carefully he gave me a name i make no promises that your appeal to this man will succeed your father has more authority than i ever will but its worth a try he turned away from me looking down the sloping churchyard with its row after row of gravestones under shady trees and on to the rooftops of the village beyond my head tells me you should go back to france no one will ever know the number of men who owe their lives to you and women like you at the same time my heartbess call me superstitious if you like but i dont wish to find out if the third time you come close to dying we will lose you he moved his gaze to the window high in the saxon tower as if looking for answers there when i got to france i was told you were dying that there was nothing more to be done and with that he turned on his heel and went to pack up the remains of the picnic basket folding the rugs neatly and stowing the lot in the boot of the motorcar i stayed where i was blindly looking at the church porch wishing i could take back the words id spoken wishing i hadnt had to make him choose and then he was calling to me and i walked slowly across to the motorcar and he helped me inside we drove in silence all the long distance to eastbourne chapter three when we arrived at the grand hotel simon passed the picnic basket to one of the staff handed me down from the motorcar and said as i prepared to go inside ill see what i can discover about private wilson it may take several days and then with a nod he was gone i watched him out of sight knowing that he had left not for an hour or so but for days there had been someone with me ever since i had reached englandmy mother my father simon i felt suddenly alone separated from those i loved separated by more than distance turning i went up to my room and sat down at the little white desk between the windows intending to write my first letter requesting reinstatement at the front and i found the words wouldnt come setting the sheets of hotel stationery to one side i walked out to the balcony and for a while watched the sea green and blue and in the distance almost black there was a slight haze in the direction of the seven sisters but toward hastings and france the sky was clear we were too far away to hear the guns but i could imagine them and imagine too the damage they were doing to flesh and bone it was difficult to go against my parents wishes we had always been of the same mind about important things i could understand their feelings i doubted that they could understand mine or was i being selfish and willful where wiser heads knew better i told myself that it was the wounded and dying who should be weighed in the balance not my own wishes in the end i put the letteror what was to be the letter but was now only a blank sheetin the desk drawer and went down to take my tea in the enclosed veranda some hours later i dined alone i couldnt have said afterward what i had chosen from the menu or how it had tasted there was a woman at the next table she sat there staring into space as if her mind were a thousand miles away picking at her food as if it had no more flavor than mine had had fair and rather pretty in an elegant way she appeared to be older than i was and i put her age at thirty i hadnt noticed her here before this whether because she had sat somewhere else or because shed just arrived the headwaiter came over as she pushed her plate aside and asked is everything to your liking mrs campbell yes it was lovely ive no appetite im afraid not bad news i hope he ventured frowning you werent yourself last evening either bad news was more common than good these days yet hed asked as if he knew her from another visit and felt free to inquire she laughed but not convincingly no nothing to worry about perhaps the sea air will improve my spirits and my appetite he cajoled her into trying the pudding although it was clear to me that she wasnt hungry enough to care and she ate a little of it stoically then signaled the waiter again rose and left the dining room the grand hotel had an excellent reputation it catered to people like my parents and they had had no qualms about leaving me here to dine alone i was well looked after and so it wasnt surprising to see another woman alone i walked through great doors leading out to the veranda and stopped by one of the vases of fern for a few minutes to watch the waves roll in i could sympathize in a way with mrs campbell i too needed to make a decision i was just on the point of turning to go up to my room when i overheard someone mention her name there were two women sitting together just by the balustrade they couldnt see me for that fern but i could just glimpse mrs campbell a shawl over her shoulders walking down to the drive and moving on to one of the benches set out beneath specimen trees it was the one where simon and id sat that morning there she is one of the women said in a low voice i told you i thought it was she yes youre right shocking that she should show her face in such a place as this not after all the publicity surrounding the petition for divorce unfaithful he said yes but it couldnt be proved could it sordid all of it i mean to say hes at war youd think she could put aside her personal feelings and remember that i turned and went indoors i remembered too vividly lieutenant banner at forward aid station no dying of his wounds and saying in a whisper that held a world of despair because time had run out she wont have to go through the divorce now will she shell be a widow instead ive made it easy for him whoever he is hell step into my shoes without a qualm but if he mistreats her by god ill come back and haunt him i shivered as i remembered his vehemence but it had cost him his last breath and he was gone i wondered sometimes if mrs banners new husband had ever looked over his shoulder and listened for a footstep the thought followed me into sleep the next morning i took my pride and my courage in my hands and wrote the letter to london i put the direction on the envelope took it to the front desk for stamps and when they offered to put it in the post bag for me i thanked them and said no for in spite of everything i felt that i was betraying simon i paced the veranda before lunch and after tea and happened to see mrs campbell leave the hotel the manager himself seeing her into her hired car had the whispers been too much for her two days later i scolded myself for my reluctance to post that envelope my parents would be returning to eastbourne shortly and i would surely lose my nerve altogether once they were there to persuade me in person i was on my way down to reception to see to it personally when i met simon himself just coming through the hotel door it had been raining somewhere along the road for the shoulders of his coat were wet his face was grim and i suddenly had a premonition of bad news nodding to me he took my arm and said shall we walk along the seafront it wont rain for another hour or more you wont need a coat yes i simon whats wrong not here and so it was we walked down to the water and stopped halfway to the pier standing for a moment to watch dark clouds building far out to sea lightning was playing in them bright flickers against a gunmetal sky the air was oppressively warm even though the wind was just picking up we were out of hearing of anyone simon leaning his shoulders on the parapet of the seawall seemed lost in thought my mind was running through a mental list of our acquaintance who was dead why couldnt he find the courage to tell me please i said baldly dontid rather you didnt try to find the right words to break the news he straightened and looked down at me as if he hadnt realized that i was there no it isnt bad news bess its i dont quite know what to make of it he turned and led me to a bench after wed sat down he said busy with his driving gloves i inquired of london where private wilson could be reached i thought perhaps you could write to him even if you couldnt return to france my contact was reluctant to tell me anything at first and i had to use your fathers authority to pry the information out of him which was odd in itself but then i understood why the army isnt eager to give out such information it seems i was told that private gerald wilson who was an orderly in the hospital where you were working when you fell illa man close to fortyone years of age just as youd described him to mewas found hanged in the shed where bodies were left to await burial the doctor who declared him dead felt that his work had turned the mans mind fearful of falling victim to influenza himself hed decided to die by his own hand i sat there aghast after a moment i said are you sure you were given the correct information there must be a dozen men by that name and of the same rank but looking at simons face i could already read the answer i knew him simon i said earnestly i worked with him every day he wasnt the sort to kill himself he recognized the sadness of his work but he understood too that a man of his age was more useful as an orderly than at the front he handled the deadwounded and influenza victims he knew the risks i realized that i had fallen into the past tense as if i had already accepted the truth but i refused to believe it its in the official record bess yes but its wrong i tell you it must be wrong we sat in silence while i dealt with the turmoil in my mind finally i said it isnt true yes it may well be that private wilson was found hanging that part i cant question because i wasnt there and of course someone had to cut him down which means the record is correctas far as it went but it wasnt suicide he must have been killed because hed seen that body in the shed when i fell ill so suddenly he must have had to speak to someone else and so he had to die bess youre assuming what you dreamed was real the official report on carsons death was shrapnel wounds i looked into that as well they wouldnt have got that wrong either very well i wont go on claiming it was major carson i saw but part of my dream must have been real i must have seen a body i must have done and there were no other wounds only a broken neck which means whoever he was he was murdered why else would private wilson be killed simon i was thought to be dying and so i was no danger to anyone but he was someone made certain that what hed seen was never reported the killer was still there waiting to be sure the body was buried it occurred to me just then that if i hadnt fallen ill i might also have been killed because id been in that shed whats more the burial detail would have come and gone and the fiftyseventh body would be well out of reach if by chance i did survive and remembered some wild and feverish tale instead of relieving my mind private wilsons suicide seemed to confirm that what i thought id dreamed was true i thought about that kindly man who saw to the dead with such infinite gentleness could he have seen too many bodies could he have been driven to killing himself to stop having nightmares about the rows and rows of dead that he dealt with day after day it was possible of course it was but the two deaths in tandem all the more reason to hurry back to france and find out as if hed followed my reasoning simon said quietly even if you go back you cant be certain youll be sent to the same hospital and that was true assignments were based on need not personal preferences still id be in france i could eventually find out what i wanted to know about private wilson again simon followed my logic it isnt wilsons death that matters is it he asked thats to say he wasnt the primary target was he carson appears to have been if this is true why should anyone kill him he was a respected officer and careful of his men i have no answer to that i said slowly who are his enemies simon pressed who stands to gain the most from his death i sighed since he died in france it could be that someone at the front wanted him dead its happened before that scores have been settled there if it wasnt in france then the reason will lie in somerset where major carson lived i remembered mrs campbell and lieutenant banner do you know if the carson marriage was a happy one he wouldnt be the first soldier to fall in love with another mans wife she wouldnt be the first woman to fall out of love after a hasty wartime marriage i cant believe that of either julia or vincent i couldnt help but think that neither of the carsons would have told simon if there was marital trouble or my parents for that matter i understand but stay out of it bess the last thing you want to do is cause julia carson any more grief and ive told you theres no proof that there was anything or anyone in that shed or that private wilson killed himself too much time has passed i would never hurt her but what about private wilsons family how do they feel about his death i took a deep breath if i dont pursue this who will in my pocket was the letter id written i handed it to him what shall i do simon all right go to somerset and learn what you can about carson julia likes you shell talk freely to you and if you discover anything come to me let me handle it thats fair if its possible to clear private wilsons name of the charge of suicide ill find it in his own way hed been a very brave man a thought struck me what was the date of his death do you know with reluctance simon told me it was the night after i fell ill where did private wilson come from before the war i was ashamed that i didnt know had never thought to ask from cheddar gorge or just outside it to be more accurate and cheddar gorge was also in somerset it explained perhaps why he had chosen to confide in me rather than go directly to matron id have sworn he didnt know hadnt recognized the dead man but how fallible was my memory i hadnt been watching private wilsons face whats more hed seen that of the corpse before i had the trouble was there was so little to go on only my belief that private wilson wouldnt have killed himself and the timing of his death simon waited as i digested that another thought crossed my mind and immediately i was ashamed of it but i had to know i searched his face was this a conspiracy to force me to choose somerset for myself but simon had never lied to me he wouldnt have lied about private wilsons death or where he lived even to convince me that i had every reason to go to somerset i got up and walked a little way on my own simon stayed where he was on the bench by the parapet his gaze was on the confection that was the pier for all the world an exotic place filled with wonders but in fact it was only a way for those visiting the seaside to amuse themselves i wanted desperately to go back to france but setting that aside could i spend a week or two at the clinic as everyone seemed to want me to do it would permit me to learn something about major carson and private wilson going back to france sooner might put me closer to where events had taken place but id be walking blindly into something i knew little about uncertain where to put my trust and if murder had been done id be vulnerable it shouldnt take too long should it to learn what i needed to know and then ask to be sent back to france simon had put my letter into his pocket i didnt feel i could ask him to return it on the other hand if id written it once i could write it again when the time came and i wouldnt be putting simon squarely in the middle i paced as far as the pier then turned and walked back again simon was standing by the parapet now his gaze on the hotel he didnt want to read in my face what decision i had made and i realized in that moment how worried he was how much my return to france concerned him there were very few things that frightened simon brandon it was a measure of how much he cared for me that he couldnt face me now i said when id reached him it appears that my decision has been taken out of my hands the clinic in somerset it is his relief was well concealed but still i saw it this doesnt mean that i wont go back to france simon you do understand that yes was all he said as he offered me his arm for the walk back to the hotel i thought perhaps things had turned out for the best it was difficult to be at odds with those i loved but the time would surely come when id have to face making the decision again chapter four shortly after my parents returned from the majors memorial service we set out for the clinic in somerset no one mentioned my aboutface on serving there it would have been gloating and my parents would never do that we spent one night at home and the following morning it was my father who drove me to my next posting i asked to pass the time how he had felt about the memorial service difficult at best of course but i think it went off rather well and it gave julia carson a little comfort hes buried in france you know vincent i remember him before he met julia he was half in love with mother for a time my father chuckled so he was but then a good part of the regiment thought they were in love with her your mother has an air about her that binds men to her did you know his family well i remember vincents father as a rather stern man on one visit he found me in an upstairs passage looking for mother and he quickmarched me back to the nursery ordering nurse to see that i stayed there did he indeed he was a barrister a formidable opponent in a courtroom but outside of it he had a stiff manner that sometimes put people off vincent confided to me that it was a great shock to his father when his only son chose the army over the law hed assumed that vincent would be eager to follow in his footsteps and for a time he blamed me for that decision his mother on the other hand was from devon her family connected with the raleighs in some way i think she was known for her good works and her flamered hair a beauty in her day she was very fond of your mother do you remember her shed carry me off to the kitchen where they looked after me until nurse could fetch me there were small cakes iced in different colors and a cream cake with a rum and sultana sauce for tea rum he asked his brows flying up i never heard of that i laughed yes well i was sworn to secrecy it was quite lovely actually odd that vincent carson had married just the opposite womanpretty but not a beauty and a homebody her fame such as it was lay in her gardens where she enjoyed spending hours to the despair of her gardener she had wanted children a house full of them but there hadnt been any and wouldnt be now the major had two sisters they were a little older than i and treated me with kindness there had been some gossip about that amongst the women from the garrison in india who called on my mother from time to time one of vincents sisters had married beneath her causing a family breach the other had married well her husband something to do with banking in bristol do you thinkif my duties allowedthat i could call on julia not right away of course but id like to do that unless shes not receiving visitors yet i think shed be delighted to see you it was clear from what my father was saying that simon hadnt told him about my belief that the major had been murdered i was grateful medford longleigh was a small village in the rolling country that led to the cotswolds and high brick walls kept the houses and shops from sliding downhill into the road they gave a very secretive air to the village but in fact it had been the only way the area could be settled the clinic was in longleigh house which was just on the outskirts where the twisting main road straightened itself out for a quarter of a mile or more allowing the gates to the park to appear to be even more stately than they were tall capped with stone then curving down in a graceful sweep to connect to the walls that surrounded the grounds they promised a grand house ahead and the promise was fulfilled three stories high with an elegant roofline tall chimneys and a wing set to either side the house was lovely stone faced the windows and the portico was grecian with wide steps leading down to the drive my first thought was that if id lived here id have found it hard to give it up to the army and the hordes of doctors nursing sisters orderlies and patients who inhabited it now of course it was the size that had made it ideal for a convalescent clinic it could accommodate dozens of wounded and the staff to serve them my father said gently as we drove up the winding drive through the park im pleased that you made this choice very sensible of you my dear beneath the words lay the hope that there had been no lasting harm done to our relationship smiling in return i assured him that i was satisfied with this decision and then we were pulling up in front of the house he came around to my side of the motorcar and handed me out while an orderly bounded down the shallow steps to fetch my valise from the boot colonel crawford was welcomed by matron herself as a courtesy due his rank and we had tea in her small office then he was given a tour of the clinic while a young woman sister harrison took me to my quarters and settled me in we had been assigned to what in better times had been the servants bedrooms made more habitable now with odd bits from the more fashionable rooms downstairs we dont have much time to ourselves sister harrison was saying as she looked around my quarters but the bed is quite comfortable and youll be glad of that matron told me that the majority of your patients are orthopedic cases with a few surgical cases as well yes all officers of course officers and men of other ranks were not mixed in clinics it isnt arduous work there are enough of us to share it out some of the patients are difficult others meek as lambs but i must warn you about the yank he can be quite a handful her smile told me that she liked the man in spite of that an american i asked surprised he joined the canadian army when war broke out didnt want to miss it he said while waiting for his own country to come into it hes quite popular with the men someone told me he had a pocket full of medals and should have been put in for a vc but then hes american you see victoria crosses were not handed out lightly she helped me unpack my uniforms and as i went down to report for duty my father was just leaving i wondered if hed been at his most charming in order to smooth my path here that would be like him and explained why he chose to bring me to longleigh house rather than send me off with simon not that simon couldnt have smoothed my path as well but rank had its privileges and that was pointed out as matron said watching his motorcar disappear down the drive a fine man your father i took up my duties just after luncheon had been served my first assignment reading to the men it was difficult to keep them amused anxious as they were to return to duty if they could broken legs cracked ribs shoulder injuries back wounds all of them the sort of thing that took time to heal like it or not and sister harrison was blunt about it a new pretty face is just the thing she told me handing me a conan doyle mystery and light fare nothing heavygoing sad or reminding them of the war when i walked into what had once been the drawing room of the house i found some forty patients there waiting for me their expectant faces told me that word had already made the rounds regarding a new sister being assigned to the clinic a tall fair man with a welcoming smile stepped forward limping to hold my chair for me and as i sat down i wondered if he was the american he lacked the reserve i was accustomed to in british officers his manner open and rather cheeky i thought i read the story and for the most part my audience was attentive i saw two or three men gingerly stirring in their chairs as if in pain and made a note of it one fell asleep almost on the first page which i took to mean he had been given medication before the midday meal his face was slack as if the relief from suffering was a blessing the others applauded mr holmess acumen in solving the case and then it was time for exercises patients were divided into groups where the affected limb was strengthened i assisted the doctor in charge of one such group helping men work on the muscles in damaged arms clenching and unclenching their fists gently encouraging their bodies to remember how to respond to lifting and carrying without dropping things and to learn anew the skills to compensate for weakness and the pain they were still experiencing next i made the rounds with the sister in charge of giving medicines after that i walked with three men recovering from broken limbs their canes tapping across the drive as we headed toward the park we moved slowly chatting as we went and i learned that one had been wounded by shrapnel another had had a bullet through his knee and the third had broken his tibia in a fall down a shell hole catching his boot in the loose earth and bending his leg back in such a way that the bone snapped after dinner where i fed several patients who hadnt yet recovered their dexterity with fork and knife i was asked to help change bandages for the night for the most part the wounds were healing well although i could see dr gainess concern over one patient whose wound was still draining i dont want to operate again he muttered to himself no that wouldnt be at all wise still by the time i got to bed that first night i was very tired and all too aware of the fact that i was not yet healed enough myself to keep up the pace i wondered how i would have managed in france where we were chronically short of staff and sometimes worked fourandtwenty hours without relief still i settled into my routine easily and soon discovered what sister harrison meant about the american he was polite always there to open doors or carry heavy burdens though his limp grew more pronounced when he did and i scolded him for not taking proper care of his injury he smiled im bored to tears sister and you shouldnt be hauling those baskets of linens down to the laundry there are orderlies to handle the heavy work it was true of course but the orderlies were busy enough that i sometimes preferred not to wait for them and i shall be blamed if you inflame that wound while being chivalrous he grinned my mother he said taught me to treat the fairer sex with deference and courtesy whatever the cost yes well she wouldnt be best pleased with me captain if your leg has to be amputated because you were being silly but there was no discouraging him my leg he said loftily is healing better than expected ill be back in france before the summer his name i soon learned was thomas barclay his father had made a fortune in railroads especially running lines north through the state of michigan and then he had had the foresight to realize that a ferry could carry the new flood of holidaymakers across to mackinac pronounced i was informed mackinaw island to the famous hotel there or to the upper peninsula which abutted on canada railroads shipping even a monopoly on the horses used in lieu of lorries and even motorcars on the island had been quite lucrative and a yearly regatta which he claimed hed won more than once brought even more guests to the north this explained to some extent his decision to join the canadian forces as did the fact that he and his father had often gone north across the border to hunt with friends living there sister harrison said one morning as she settled her cap over her sleekly brushed auburn hair you have made a conquest the yank follows you about like a forlorn puppy have you looked at his leg he refuses to let me see it im rather worried about him dont be dr gaines gives him a tonguelashing when he doesnt take care of it properly i think he rather likes making you fret over him one way to be certain of your attention she added with a grin the next day was my free afternoon and i had given some thought to my plans it was not more than twenty miles to where julia carson lived in a village called nether thornton twenty miles was farther than even i could manage on a bicycle dr gaines owned a motorcar which he kept in an outbuilding on the grounds i had been told this in passing by one of the officers and i had seen it as well when he drove to london with a patient to consult a specialist i went to his office and asked respectfully if i could borrow the motorcar for a few hours explaining that an officer in my fathers old regiment had been killed recently and that i should like to offer my condolences to his widow having been unable to attend the memorial service he peered at me over the rims of his glasses ah you had the spanish influenza he said as if that was how he remembered who i was yes sir can you drive a motorcar sister i shouldnt like to lose mine at the hands of a wellmeaning novice i understand sir ive driven motorcars ambulances and even lorries yes thats in france i think where roads are rather poorly defined and theres room for error this is somerset where brick walls and hedgerows tend to hem one in i smiled i have driven in england where the roads are often nearly as narrow twisting and ill made as in france so they are well i shall allow you to borrow it this time on the condition that you take someone with you i didnt want anyone with me while i spoke to julia humor me sister he said reading my expression all too clearly it will give me peace of mind to know you are well protected should any problems arise matron would not enjoy informing your father that we have misplaced you or injured you on our watch reviewing the patients i had come to know i cast about for a suitable escort but dr gaines had already made up his mind take the yank with you hes impatient trying to push his recovery an outing of this sort will do him good and hes presentable enough you neednt worry about upsetting the family the last person i wished to have with me but it was clear that i shouldnt be allowed to take the motorcar at all if i insisted on going alone and there werent many patients for that matter well enough to accompany me i tried to put as good a face on it as possible and thanked him for the use of his vehicle and so it was that thomas barclay and i set out for nether thornton in early afternoon captain barclay was in good spirits glad to be free of longleigh house for even a few hours my fathers greatgrandfather was english he said happily as if this forged a bond between us a great many americans have english forebears i replied repressively turning out of the drive onto the main road after all it was once a british colony was it not there are germans living in michigan he informed me lutherans most of them i find it hard sometimes to think that the germans im ordered to shoot arent their cousins or former neighbors when we take prisoners i cant tell the difference i too had met germans who were not the ogres of the popular press yes i understand my father told me once that nations are often at war but people are not a wise man your father army is he yes his regiment was sent to india shortly after i was born and my parents took me with them i was educated there rather than being sent home to school im very grateful to them for that decision id been to canada of course but otherwise i was never out of the states until i sailed for france still ive traveled widely in my own country my father saw to that he had many interests in railroads and shipping and my mother and i went with him as often as not i know charleston and new orleans san francisco and new york denver and boston ever been to america i havent well when the war is over youre invited to visit my mother and sisters would like you theyd take you to mackinac island youd explore on horseback sit on the famous veranda to watch the sunset over lake michigan and have a real english tea in the lobby i think youd enjoy that thank you he was relaxing in his seat now and i realized that hed been quite tense after wed reached the main road waiting for me to overturn the motorcar on a curve or run us into one of the high walls in the surrounding villages smiling i said i do drive well i was taught by simon brandon who never does anything by halves you must have been he replied grinning sheepishly neither of my sisters drives there was a pause and then he asked who is simon brandon a family friend i said not wishing to go into the whole of my relationship with simon he had been my fathers batman when he first joined the regiment and later rose to the post of regimental sergeantmajor he and my father had always been close despite the difference in their ages for simon was nearer to mine than to his i had known him all my life he lived in a cottage near our house in somerset and like my father retired from active duty he was often employed by the war office in matters that were never discussed they disappeared for hours or even days at a time came home weary sometimes bloody and often grim from the way you said that he must be more than simply a family friend he pointed out i turned to him are you jealous captain i expected him to deny it but he said slowly i think i am we drove in silence the rest of the way to nether thornton and on the outskirts i said im here to call on mrs carson her husband was killed recently i explained the connection and was casting about trying to think of a kind way to ask him not to come in with me when he solved the problem himself then you dont want a stranger underfoot just aheadthe pub the pelican drop me there just dont forget to retrieve me when youre ready to go back to longleigh house i smiled grateful i shant forget dr gaines would be furious if i lost my minder and i should like to borrow the motorcar again anytime sister just ask me he paused can you use the crank or would you prefer that i come to fetch you either way i shant say a word to the good doctor thank you but i can manage i assured him the colonel sahib had taught me the safe way to use a crank i drew up halfway along the high street setting the captain down in front of the handsome halftimbered pub he had more difficulty descending from the motorcar than hed had getting into it i looked away as he struggled knowing he wouldnt take kindly to an offer of help finally standing straight his cane in his hand he said ill be as sober as a judge whenever you come for me you neednt worry and with that he walked in front of the motorcar and entered the pub i was beginning to learn how much effort such bravado required on his part and the cost in pain i drove on through the center of the village and to the house close by the church where the major had lived after his marriage leaving the motorcar by the front gate i walked up to the door black silk draped the knocker and i let it fall gently against the brass plate after a moment the door was opened by tessie who had been with the family from the time of their marriage tall and rawboned and kind she said miss crawford its so good to see you mrs carson will be delighted that youve come are you feeling stronger you look quite yourself you know and i am i explained about the clinic as she ushered me inside and down the passage to the sitting room julia rose from her desk as i came in exclaiming as tessie had done and coming to embrace me im so happy to see you how are you your father told me youd had quite a severe bout with this terrible illness i was one of the lucky ones i responded it quite ravaged france come sit down tessie will bring us tea i was glad that vincent died quickly we also lost our cook to the influenza and it was a terrible death nineteen people died here in nether thornton and we were told we had only a mild outbreak but we were warned that it could return because of that the possibility doesnt bear thinking about we sat and reminisced for a bit and then when the tea was brought in she said i thought my world had ended when the news came about vincent his commanding officer wrote to me a colonel prescott a lovely letter assuring me that vincent hadnt suffered and how much my letters had meant to him to the very end he must have known my husband well little things are such a comfort at a time like that and he told me that vincent was liked by his men and that they had been brokenhearted by his death that they had asked to see his body and pay their respects before it was taken away vincent cared for his men it would have meant so much to him all this was very interesting to me how could colonel prescott have known so much about the majors death in the lines unless it was true i felt a twinge of doubt it was indeed thoughtful erhad he served under colonel prescott for some time well there were the censors of course and he seldom mentioned names in his letters it was private j and captain h and colonel r he kept a journal too and he used the same code so to speak in that in the event he was taken prisoner and the germans could use the information against us im told journals are discouraged for that very reason piecing together such small bits of information could sometimes lead to a picture of a regiments strength and position did colonel prescott send his journal home with the rest of his possessions i dont believe he knew about it or he would have looked for it it wasnt in the box of his belongings i wept when they came they still carried the scent of vincents pipe tobacco do you remember he had it made up for him in london i could bury my nose in them and feel that he was close again there was the pipe his testament and his shaving kit and so on two of his books one a volume of poetry another a history his other uniforms so few things to mark a mans life and death i had to agree with her her husband had been an energetic intelligent and caring man hard to capture those qualities in the small packet of his possessions still curious about the journal i brought the subject back to that did he ever show you his journal when he was on leave he read to me bits and pieces the parts that he said wouldnt disturb me the pages on his short leave in paris were wonderful he promised to take me there after the war well after france was herself again and he read me a section about his first crossing to france and some of his feelings about leaving me and facing death i remembered those lines when the news came i vowed to love honor and cherish julia until death parted us but this separation feels like a small death if it should come to the worst and be the real thing if i am capable of carrying any thought into the grave with me it will be i shall love you until the end of time just as if id been at your side until we were old and gray and still slept in each others arms the tears came then and i chided myself for being the cause of them but she said as i comforted her i find i do well for the most part and then suddenly i am bereft and i find myself crying uncontrollably its so silly it isnt silly at all indeed it showed me that there was no trouble in this marriage you miss him terribly and i wont promise you it will get any easier but with time it will be a different pain she looked up at me your mother said something like that to me i was so grateful for her understanding when she was calmer i asked was there anyone in france that vincent was particularly close to someone he confided in he and andrew were closethey were at sandhurst together but andrew died early on at mons after that vincent was reluctant to make friends it was too painful to send them into certain death the price of promotion he called it when he had to give such orders himself id heard other officers who felt the same way was there anyone he particularly disliked what an odd question not really vincent was always such a good judge of character and as i remember he wasnt one to suffer fools lightly she smiled at that no he wasnt was he i asked him oncewell war is rather terrible isnt it people wounded and dying in front of ones eyes and i thought perhaps petty things no longer mattered he answered that whatever a man was before the war he usually brought with him to france good or bad but he particularly disliked those who let down the side who couldnt be counted on in pinch a frown replaced the smile its odd now that youve brought this upthere was trouble with one of his sergeants vincent was very angry with the man i never knew what it was about just that later he was angry with himself for having lost his temper fortunately soon afterward this sergeant was shifted to another part of the line vincent seldom lost his temper but when he did he could be quite furious it went with his red hair i think his mother also had a lively temper i laughed agreeing with her and to my surprise she added there was also that brotherinlaw of his sabrinas husband vincent called him a slacker a disgrace to the uniform he wasnt in our regiment as i recall oh no he joined the royal engineers god knows what they saw in him but he has been serving under vincent something to do with mines he had been serving she caught herself and changed the tense i cant seem to stop thinking that vincents death was confused with someone elses and hell write soon to tell me hes well and not to worry i had stayed as long as i should in politeness and so i set my teacup back on the tray and took my leave julia begged me to come again if i could and i promised i would were vincents sisters at the memorial service i havent seen them since your wedding i hope they are well she made a face sabrina didnt come shes very likely poor again you never know with that man she married i think he must gamble or something of the sort they always seem to be short of money but valerie was here she and vincent were only a year apart she stayed with me and we comforted each other im glad with another embrace we said goodbye and i drove dr gainess motorcar sedately back to the pelican where the captain must have been watching for me he came out at once smiled as he nodded toward the crank and said well well dont be silly he got in beside me and i saw the grimness of his mouth as he settled into his seat this outing had tried his leg as impatient as he was to leave the clinic and get back to the fighting it was clear to both of us that he wasnt ready yet perhaps i thought this explained why dr gaines had sent him with meto measure his readiness in a way that he could face rather than listening to a doctor telling him a hard truth i found myself with a new respect for dr gaines we drove out of nether thornton in silence mainly because captain barclay was in no mood for light conversation but as his leg stopped throbbing quite so viciously his spirits returned and he said was it a good visit yes indeed julia had unwittingly given me food for thought my confidence had been shaken by colonel prescotts letter and yet there was the evidence of private wilsons death and what had become of vincents journal if it was in his tunic pocket when he was killed someone should have discovered it and put it with his other belongings a doctor wouldnt have undressed him if he had died instantly of his wounds sadly there was no time for the dead because there were so many living in need of attention penny for your thoughts captain barclay said after several miles of silence i smiled ruefully sorry i was distracted this wasnt simply a courtesy call was it the captain asked after a few minutes theres something on your mind why did you go to visit mrs carson that was too close to the truth for comfort actually i was thinking about major carsons journal he kept one according to julia shed seen it hed read her a few passages from it but it didnt come home with his other possessions is it important idont quite know for julia it is it could have been lost when he was wounded and every effort was being made to save his life he died instantly according to his commanding officer its what were taught to write no mother or wife wants to hear that a loved one died screaming and writhing in agony when he was hit his men would have done what they could and whatever falls into the unspeakable muck in the bottom of a trench is lost forever or it could have been buried with him true i said doubtfully unable to tell him that it could all have been a lie how vincent carson had died you dont believe me why do women fix on tangible things he could have given instructions for the journal not to be sent home its possible he wrote what he believed to be the truth at the time but still words that perhaps it would pain his wife to read after he was dead and unable to explain or perhaps his commanding officer read enough to feel it was unwise yes i do believe you i said threading my way through a flock of sheep that was taking up the road thinking about it in that light but it once more raised the specter of marital problems there was nothing about julia even to hint that she was glad to be free to marry someone else but if vincent had fallen out of love with his wife and there was someone else he could have written about his struggle with himself a very good reason to order it destroyed if he was killed good anything else worrying you im always happy to make your burdens lighter i had to laugh for the rest of the journey we talked about himhow hed come to join the canadian army when and where he was wounded and what he hoped to do when the war finally ended we had come within sight of the gates to longleigh house when thomas barclay said again without warning tell me again who simon brandon is chapter five i wrote to simon that evening in the quiet of my room a storm was blowing up and i listened to the distant thunder reminded again that i ought to be in france by telling simon what i had learned i was able to put it in better perspective was there anything really suspicious in what julia had told me or was it my imagination looking to support my own belief about how major carson had died i sealed the letter and set it out for the post then went to bed i was kept busy over the next few days one patient was on the brink of developing gangrene and with my battlefield experience matron asked me to work in the surgical theater with dr gaines when i went to read to the ambulatory captain lawrence had been scanning a newspaper and as he set it aside i glimpsed a photograph on the page turned up it was mrs campbell i couldnt see the full caption but the first part read divorcee arrested for for what when the hour was over i was summoned to the surgical theater again an abscess required draining as the patient was being taken away for recovery dr gaines said to me you really ought to be in france you know your skills are wasted here surprised by his praise i said my family was frightened by my illness i think they pulled strings to keep me in england he nodded and said nothing more i realized id been too honest but i didnt want him to believe that i had run away from the nightmare of nursing there pride i told myself sometimes had much to answer for but then my ancestress who had sent her husband off to face napoleon at waterloo and danced through the night to conceal the fact that experienced officers had been called to duty would have appreciated my dilemma she had helped keep the townspeople of brussels calm and unsuspecting it was her duty to the cause even though she knew she might never see her husband alive again perhaps i had inherited a little of her strength id like to think so the following day we faced a long and very difficult surgery as we fought to clean a suppurating wound and save a mans leg it had been a near run thing and the smell of the infection had filled the tiny surgical theater nearly sickening us but when the last stitch had been taken the wound dressed dr gaines nodded to me and walked out of the room i could see how exhausted he was but i was impressed with his skills and dedication it would have been much easier simply to amputate the lower part of the leg and be done with it there was always the shadow of gangrene hanging over such cases but he had done what he could to leave the patient whole i had hoped this morning might bring simons response to my letter but there was nothing for me in the post instead summoned to matrons office as i finished changing into a fresh uniform i found him waiting for me there matron said your father has sent a message by sergeantmajor brandon ill leave you to speak to him in private simon thanked her waiting until the door had closed behind her and the sound of her footsteps had faded down the passage before saying to me in a low voice will you walk in the park with me is anything wrong not at home he said briefly i nodded and we left matrons office and went out into the park where we couldnt be overheard even by chance the only colonel prescott i could find in the lists is an officer in the royal engineers as youd expect he never commanded major carson i cant say whether or not they ever met but i doubt it carsons commanding officer was colonel travers julia must have been mistaken i said doubtfully but she was impressed by his kindness in his letter and surely shed have got his name right when she spoke to me this tends to support your dream im beginning to believe there was indeed a murder have you said anything to my father about this matter no hed order an immediate inquiry and i dont think we have sufficient proof to make this public besides it would be cruel to upset mrs carson if none of this turns out to be true early days i should think that letter of condolence to a family giving false information about an officers death would be a place to start to start yes id like to see this carried to a conclusion yes but simon what about the journal he read portions of it to julia it must exist theres no certainty that it has anything to do with his death i know one can hope there must be answers somewhere i must speak to private wilsons family not that i expect to learn anything from them but if they also find it hard to believe that he killed himself then it supports my own feeling i did one other bit of research while i was in london remember sabrina carson who married a reprobate your mother told me she wasnt at the memorial service whether its against his will or not william morton is in the army most likely called up and threatened with desertion if he didnt appear at the proper time there was contempt in simons voice he had no sympathy for a man who refused to serve his country in its hour of need his wife is living on a private soldiers pay that may explain why she couldnt afford to travel to the memorial service or to dress appropriately i added that would matter to her i hadnt considered that possibility nevertheless morton was in a wiltshire regiment that was depleted and it was combined with ours it could have caused friction between the two men but julia told me he was in the royal engineers sabrina could have lied to her wasnt he an actor and not a very good one at that attached to a thirdrate touring company that barely stayed one step ahead of the bailiffs i shouldnt put it past him to tell his wife what she wanted to hear my mother told me once that he reminded her of the snake charmers in india luring unsuspecting girls out of their homes the way the snake charmer lured the cobra out of its basket depend upon your mother to make an apt comparison what am i to do now nothing let me explore several avenues and see what i can discover london has sent for me and im on my way there now give me a few days to attend to that and ill be back in touch we had nearly reached the house in our walk i wouldnt make too much of this yet bess he warned me but morton might not have passed up a chance to rid himself of his brotherinlaw im torn i admitted id rather not have to tell julia that her husband was murdered remember that youre the only other person to have seen that body simon reminded me take care at this stage im damned glad you arent in france i sighed theres that all right be safe simon whatever it is that london wants is my father summoned as well i wont know until i get there and he was gone in a hurry to reach london because he had already taken precious time to come and speak to me i watched his motorcar out of sight then turned to find the yank standing in the doorway behind me the family friend mr brandon i presume why isnt he at the front its a long story i said and not for your ears he followed me inside sorry i was more than a little jealous you dont hang on my every word the way you hang on his i turned did you just arrive with news of my family i did not i misjudged the visit why do i seem always to be apologizing to you because you tend not to look before you leap i retorted and left him standing there on my next free afternoon i once more asked dr gaines to allow me to borrow his motorcar he didnt quiz me on my skills as a driverapparently hed received a good report from captain barclaybut again he insisted that i take an escort with me and once more it was the american captain waiting for me at the door when i came down from changing into a fresh uniform where to this time i glanced over my shoulder but no one was within hearing were going to see one of the wonders of britain cheddar gorge its a deep natural ravine slashed through stone amazing really ill drive the length of it and show you but first theres someone id like very much to visit another widow of an officer in your fathers old regiment there was an undercurrent of suspicion in his voice as if i found that to be a handy excuse for my assignations the family of a man i served with just before i was taken ill hes dead i had to smile to myself at the thought of the captain feeling jealous of private wilson but he only nodded as we set off down the drive as if time would tell as the crow flew cheddar gorge was not all that far from longleigh house but the crow didnt always fly the way the road makers went it was a twisting turning route that led us to where we were going the gorge is some three miles long narrow at some points wider at others with towering limestone ramparts on either side quite a spectacular drive really through a place where it was said early cave dwellers found sanctuary as we approached the gorge i could see the small house that sat to one side if this was not where private wilson lived the occupants could tell me where to look old and weathered the house must have been freshly painted shortly before the war because it appeared to be in better condition than some of its neighbors behind it rose a small barn and i glimpsed several sheds as well there were blackandwhite cows grazing quietly in a meadow on our left this is where cheddar cheese comes from i told the captain it was aged in the coolness of the caves youll see in a bit after weve finished here i thought cheddar cheese came from new york he told me with a grin thats where we buy it at least theres no pub that i can see just here i said ignoring his attempt at humor but would you mind terribly waiting for me in the motorcar mrs wilson will be shy enough finding me on her doorstep youll frighten her dont worry go speak to her ill be fine i thanked him got down and went up the walk to the front of the house marigolds bloomed in clay pots on the steps and a cat slept on a cushion by the door it rose at my approach stretched and yawned then waited to be let into the house when mrs wilson answered my knock she wasnt quite what id expected a pretty woman in her late thirties she said pleasantly are you lost love the entrance to the gorge is just down the road over there my name is sister elizabeth crawford ive come to see a mrs wilson i knew her husband in france i was a nursing sister in the aid station where he served as an orderly im joyce wilson she said after a moment will you come in yes thank you i followed her into a neat parlor where nothing was out of place except a yarn ball that obviously belonged to the cat it had come with us into the room and jumped into a tall rocker that stood by the cold hearth that was my husbands favorite chair she told me reaching down to touch the cats head i could hear it purr from where i stood toby remembers and often sits there of an evening hes company he is her somerset accent was nearly impenetrable do you have children i asked a daughter ive sent audrey away to live with my sister i didnt want her to hear what was being said about her father it was my opening i had wondered how to bring up such a difficult subject for what its worth mrs wilson i cannot in good conscience believe that your husband killed himself i worked with him day in and day out you see and i knew how he felt about what he was doing yes it was depressing work sad work often heartbreaking work tending to the dead but he took pride in doing it well and with respect i hadnt meant to be so forceful but as i sat in that tidy parlor with a woman whose husband had been branded a suicide i couldnt stop myself her face crumpled at my words she said after a moment her voice husky i never believed it myself not jerry he knew he was too old to fight but he felt he could do something to help stop the hun even as an orderly when did you see him last i was nursing our influenza patients as well as the wounded and then without warning i myself was stricken with it i remember a soldier named benson dying and your husband bringing in the stretcher bearers to carry theerhim out to the place where we took the dead while they were awaiting the burial detail he was himself that evening and i saw nothing in his face or his bearing to warn me that he was distressed in any way or worried about his own health there were many peoplesisters doctors orderlieswho worked with the ill and never fell ill themselves he had no reason to think he might be the next victim im grateful to you for coming so far to tell me this sister it was very kind of you i shall take comfort from it ive had precious little of that since jerry died i can tell you but why would anyone report my husband hanged himself when neither you nor i believe he would or even could i dont know there must be times when there are so many dead and dying that the rolls are confused its all i can offer you as a reason it wasnt true but i wasnt prepared to add to her burden the possibility that private wilson was murdered yes but he hasnt written to me so he must be dead how did he die then from overworkexhaustion we werent sleeping at all and we ate only when we remembered and there was time it took a toll on all of us and private wilson was nearing forty wasnt he he was fortyone his last birthday that could explain it i still dont see how a mistake could have been made she insisted i dont know myself but im going back to france as soon as possible and ill find out what i can you may not hear immediately but i shall write after ive spoken to matron and some of the others he and i served with ill be forever in your debt sister if you could do that for me for him it isnt fair for him to be treated like a leper if he did nothing wrong or for audrey to be singled out as the daughter of a suicide there was nothing at homeyou or your childto worry him nothing at all weve done better than most having only a small farm too small to have our crops taken from us we eat what we grow and we manage very well theres hardly anything to buy is there with shortages everywhere one turns and so his pay was enough for us i dont know as i get a pension under the circumstances what worries me now is finding someone to help with the cows and the milking and general handiwork what jerry always did i cant pay now you see and theres other farms that do all the more reason to get to the bottom of what happened to private wilson aloud i said did he write often your husband his last letter came barely a week after he died it wasnt anything out of the ordinary he sounded like himself though tired as youd expect and he gave me advice about matters here on the farm as he always did remembering what time of the year it was i was that shocked when the word came i sat here until three oclock in the morning trying to take it in except for toby i told no one and cats dont talk do they but soon enough word got round i dont know how they found out but people did and so i sent my daughter out of harms way that left just toby and me to do all that needs to be done but well survive somehow our kind always does it was a sad commentary on the future we talked a little longer and at one point she said id give anything to have my man back again and then that woman in london behaves so badly shes divorced it doesnt make sense does it why couldnt her husband have died if she was so eager to be free not wishing him harm you understand but let me keep mine i did understand i rose to leave soon after and she went with me to the door thanking me again for coming to tell her what i believed i walked to the motorcar with a heavy heart whoever had killed private wilson had much to answer for as promised i drove the rough track that passed for a road running through cheddar gorge the limestone walls often sheer rose over four hundred feet high and in places were honeycombed with shallow crevices or deep caves the entrance was half hidden by cheese shops tea shops and souvenir stalls most of them closed for the duration but beyond we could crane our necks and see the tops of the ramparts id always found it an impressive sight even though id viewed the great peaks of the himalayas the deeper into the gorge we went the more wild and mysterious it seemed to be only the sounds of our motorcar breaking the silence and the calls of a crow that resented it even as we drove out into lower but still hilly countryside i felt as i always did that people had lived here for a long time it would have offered sanctuary in a time of uncertainty beside me captain barclay stared about with interest and i thought for once he had been struck speechless this american who had an answer for everything when finally we reached the far side of the gorge where the land evened out i turned to him and said isnt it a marvelous sight he agreed although his praise was rather subdued i was pleased id brought him here on the way back to longleigh house he cleared his throat and said sister if you want the truth theres really nothing like this in michigan although theres a small ravine on mackinac island but ive been to the grand canyon you see and its stunning your gorge for all its fine enough cant hold a candle to the one in arizona i just didnt want to belittle yours by comparing them put out with him all the same i said nothing he grinned you have to remember he said that englands a little country later before taking up my evening duties i wrote to simon telling him what id learned talking with joyce wilson and reminding him that it wasnt just major carson whose fate needed to be clarified i expected to hear from him any day now hoping that hed been able to find out more information somehow something that would lead us to the next step but there was no news when it came the letter i did receive shocked me it was from the headquarters of queen alexandras imperial military nursing service and inside were my orders to return immediately to france chapter six i really didnt know how to respond to the news it was what i had wanted from the moment in eastbourne when i felt well enough to consider my future had simon pulled strings to make this possible i couldnt imagine my mother and father having a change of heart and what was i to tell them when these orders hadnt been any of my doing i went to matron to speak to her about my concerns but when i broached the subject she smiled warmly ah i see theyve come through i didnt wish to say anything until we could be sure we shall be very sorry to lose you my dear but dr gaines spoke to me and i must say i agreed with him you should be in france not here and so he wrote to the proper people expressing his feelings in the matter and i am glad to learn that they decided in your favor i could only sit there stunned it was as if a godmother in a fairy tale had granted a fervent wish but left the recipient to deal with the aftermath of that wish being granted you seem surprised sister crawford i should have thought you would be delighted by such news i am i told her truthfully iits just that im not sure how to break it to my father hes been a serving officer all his life hell understand the importance of duty if anyone does she said bracingly now to particulars youll finish the week with us take three days of leave to visit your family and prepare for this posting and then report to france it occurred to me that i had promised julia carson that i would come to see her again and now there would be no opportunity im very grateful matron its such a surprise it will take some time to get used to the smile returned of course and i neednt ask you not to tell your patients until the last day we find that staff leaving often unsettles them ill say nothing i promised but where was simon and what would he think when he came here to see me after finishing whatever it was that had taken him to london only to find me out of reach and how would i learn whatever it was he might have discovered given the censorship of the post to and from france there was another worry would i be in danger but no one knew what i suspected at least i hoped no one knew except for simon and private wilsons widow changing the subject matron was now discussing a patient and i forced my thoughts back to the present when i was dismissed i knew i should seek out dr gaines at once and thank him for his intercession instead i went outside to the park where simon and i had spoken privately and as i walked i tried to think i couldnt turn down my orders they had been cut and even the colonel sahib as my mother and i called him would find it difficult to cancel them now i should have to make the best of it go to france and do what i did so well help save lives i met dr gaines as i was walking back to the house hed come in search of me and he said as i approached there you are matron tells me your orders have been cut yes thank you dr gaines it was very kind of you nonsense youre a good nurse now come inside and well unwrap that leg and have a look tell me what you think he was being polite of course but i went with him and the lieutenants leg was looking much better we cleansed it again and put on fresh bandages dr gaines nodded to the owner of the leg who had been watching us with such anxiety that my heart went out to him a yorkshireman he said little but his eyes spoke for him youll keep it lieutenant and live to fight another day if you follow instructions for the next few weeks we made rounds looking at captain scotts damaged shoulder lieutenant frasers badly fractured hand major donovans shrapnelshattered hip and a dozen more cases the doctors were watching closely when wed finished i was released from duty and allowed to go up to my room halfway to the stairs i encountered the american he said without preamble youre leaving you shouldnt be listening at doors i informed him you seldom hear the truth its something in your face he said never mind ill be back in france before you know it keep watch for me captain dont be silly youll lose that leg if you arent more careful how many times does dr gaines have to warn you i know i have an incentive now to take my exercises seriously and he added with a gleam in his eye simon brandon will still be in england without waiting for me to reply he hobbled away dr gaines himself drove me home when the time came i was rather surprised by that but then i remembered what i had told him about going back to france i expect he felt that his presence would in some fashion soften the blow for my parents i hadnt called to warn my parents that i was coming i saw my mothers face as she opened the door and found us standing there the succession of emotions touched my heart surprise fear anger resignation they were all there i presented dr gaines and she took us to the drawing room rather than to her sitting room a measure of her feelings but she was politeness itself apologizing for the fact that the colonel sahib was away at the moment asking the doctor about the clinic and carefully channeling the conversation away from the reason for my being there finally when there was nothing else to be said dr gaines cleared his throat and told my mother precisely what had happened and why she didnt argue with him instead she thanked him with apparent sincerity and asked if hed care to stay for dinner alas no i have my evening rounds and i shall be late for them as it is but thank you for your kindness he turned to me and wished me well write to us if you will i know that matron the staff and the patients who know you will be delighted to hear how you are faring and one patient in particular who asked me only this morning to find a reason to keep you at longleigh house i smiled in return i shall i promised and with that and a last glance at my mother he was gone she closed the door behind him and said well as i have always said things have a way of working out i didnt ask dr gaines to intercede i assured her darling i know and he made that quite clear so that there would be no doubt in our minds she put her arm around my shoulders and pulled me close for a moment love sometimes sees the future crookedly it tries to convince us we know whats best when the call came from franceit was that australian of yours sergeant larimore i dont quite know how he learned that you might be dying but he felt someone would wish to be with you at the endi couldnt quite think what to do your father was in london he wouldnt be home for another fourandtwenty hours and i didnt have the proper papers to allow me to go to france on my own simon had just landed in dover and so we sent him to you i dont know what mountains he and your father moved to make it possible for him to go at once when he got word to us that you would live it was a miracle as if god had granted us a reprieve at the last possible moment when all hope had gone it took some time to recover from that shock perhaps we were wrong to want to keep you safe in england but we too had to heal i hadnt known all this i had assumed that ill as i was and being the colonels only child id been sent back to england to recover properly i had attended sergeant larimore in the winter when he was wounded and because of him i had learned firsthand how swiftly word could travel at the front i felt a rush of gratitude for what hed done it was a measure of my parents fear that no one had told me until now as if it would bring back for them what must have been long terrifying hours of not knowing if i had been in france and was told that one of my parents was dying i would have felt much the same helplessness and so i could understand indeed there had been a fortnight when i had had no news and feared the worst we must consider what to have for dinner she said bracingly changing the subject before we were both brought to tears i was planning to dine alone and now here you are lets talk to cook and see whats possible i left somerset before my father came back from whatever mission had taken him away this time my mother made the best of what she must have considered to be a bad bargain and sent me off with freshly ironed uniforms a packet of sandwiches and her love as shed always done when i reached portsmouth after a long and wearing journey on the train shunted from siding to siding as troop trains hurtled through given precedence i was walking through the dark and crowded port to find my own transport when i saw a tall figure in uniform making his way toward me it was my father calling to me as he recognized me enveloping me in an embrace that expressed more than anything his belief that he wouldnt be in time there you are he said ive moved heaven and earthand more to the point the war officeto get here before you sailed and i thought id missed you in spite of everything how did you know i asked did mother reach you someone from the canadian army reached me he told me where to find you that ridiculous american i thought hoping to stop me from leaving by summoning my father to meet me here but i was wrong about his motives my father was saying god knows how he found out where i was i am most grateful he did of course i shall most likely be sent to the tower for leaving london so precipitously he must know people in very high places perhaps he will also arrange my pardon i laughed as i was intended to do i never told him that you were away i wasnt aware of it myself until mother told me you know him then do you this canadian its a long story and hes an american serving with the canadian forces i cant think why he should even guess where or how to find you somewhere down the quay a blast of a ships horn muffled but still loud in the damp night air reminded me that i hadnt yet located my transport look there isnt much time simon told me about vincent carson i dont want you involved with this business bess leave it to us i have ways of finding out what we need to know about this colonel of his and if i can track down his grave i can ask to have the body exhumed in the hope of discovering the cause of death are you quite certain that his journal wasnt there when you found him hed been stripped of his uniform and there was no way to know even what rank he held or in what regiment the burial detail would have no choice but to put him in a grave marked unknown whats more there were no possessions to be sent to his family if i hadnt recognized him when private wilson showed me the body no one would have known the truth wed have believed hed died in the trenches just as it was reported the colonel winced at that and as far as simon could discover private wilson never officially reported finding the majors body which means if he did speak to someone else it cost him his life listen to me if anyone approaches you trying in any way to discover what you knoweven someone you believe you can trustsend word at once but let them believe your high fever erased any memory of what happened the evening you fell ill ignorance will keep you safe my dear remember that yes i understand i told him and only a few minutes later he was waving to me from the quay while i stood by the rail watching until the crowded docks blocked him from view why had simon chosen to tell the colonel sahib about vincent carsons death there hadnt been time to ask but i could think of two reasonssimon needed my fathers authority to open doors shut to him or he was going into danger and felt that the time had come to protect me by bringing my father into the picture pray god this was not the reason but it had been too long since last i heard from him and in ordinary circumstances he would have found a way to get in touch and it worried me as well that captain barclay had reached my father even my mother had had no idea where he was although i was offered a cabin i had too much on my mind to rest and so i remained at the rail of themermaid a former ferry turned transport ship and watched the long dark shape of the isle of wight slip by in the night the wind was unseasonably cold coming off the water and i looked up at the bridge to see the watch scanning the seas for german raiders all lights were out and the only sounds beside the wind were the engines a deep and reassuring throb i was not the only recovered invalid on board a good few officers and other ranks i saw on deck were in my opinion still too pale and too thin to return to active duty but there was that other driving force a soldier understood only too well the need to be there with those hed had to leave behind for the duration of his recovery i read it there later in the intensity of their gaze watching for the first faint blue haze that was france looming on the horizon the determination not to let the side down even if it meant dying with them someone found a chair for me and i sat there waiting patiently for the journey to end i was not going back to the hospital where the body of vincent carson had been discovered by private wilson still it was possible for me to get there if i looked for the opportunity patient transfers picking up suppliesthere was always traffic of some sort between forward aid stations and those behind the lines and then the buffeting of the channel ceased and we were moving up the seine our destination rouen i stood at the rail picking out landmarks gripping my valise i watched men on the quay bringing the mermaid in close and tying her up then we were ordered to prepare for disembarkation troops to report in companies one of the officers nodded to me indicating i should be among the first to land but the way had no more than been cleared when the tall fair australian whod contacted my mother appeared out of nowhere coming up the gangway in long swift strides to enclose me in a huge embrace swinging me off my feet youre alive i had to see it for myself he said your mother bless her is a rare lady laughing i commanded him to put me down behind me an english officer said angrily ill have you on report for that sergeant sergeant larimore set me down turned to him and said blandly lying through his teeth shes my english cousin sir and then leaning closer to whisper in my ear he said im that glad youre alive my lass i couldnt contemplate a world without your shining face now i know youre safe i must report to my unit ive been on leave without permission for the past two days watching for you and he was gone disappearing into the crowded quayside before i could say a word or ask him who had told him i was even sailing to france it must have been my mother the american didnt know about sergeant larimore cousin indeed snorted the officer behind me alas sir the black sheep i replied with that i nodded to the ships officer and walked sedately off the mermaid and into rouen i was back in france at last as i made my way toward the american base hospital where i was to meet my convoy i could hear the guns in the distance someone jostled my shoulder apologized in rough french and another man appearing to be in a great hurry brushed past me nearly causing me to drop my valise i realized all at once how vulnerable i was alone in a city of this size i hadnt really taken thought to the danger i might be in until now where i was surrounded by people on their way to market or the port or the waiting trains i didnt know the face of my enemy if he was that but it occurred to me that i could disappear here and even my father with all his authority couldnt find me in the muddy bottom of the river i was glad to see my next transport waiting just beyond the portan ambulance packed with supplies to replace the depleted stocks of aid units closer to the front the driver was someone i didnt know a taciturn man who told me his name was sam and we were late already sister so dont dawdle please miss i took the seat beside the driver my valise tucked into a tiny space in the back and we set out steadily moving north as the roads the traffic and the terrain allowed i asked what news he had of the war and he said the germans are winning all along the line thats what it feels like sister when i drive the dying here it was a bleak assessment and i hoped that it was wrong the americans were supposed to be turning the balance toward the allies we fell silent and i watched the trains of mules and guns and columns of troops making their way toward the shooting and the line of wounded being transported to the rear in rouen there had been heavy rain the day before according to sam and the roads were a morass we bumped and jerked and skidded over them until my head was beginning to ache from all the jolting there was nothing for it but to endure at length we were close enough to the trenches that in the darkness i could actually see the muzzle flashes the noise was deafening when we reached the aid station i could pick out the long line of wounded standing or lying on stretchers outside the nearest tent and a doctor with a haggard face looked up anxiously as he heard the rumble of the ambulance coming in and then shouted to me hurry there was no time to find my tent or change my clothes i left my coat and valise in a corner borrowed an apron from someone and began to sort the cases as they arrived the driver was offloading supplies and hands were reaching for bandages and septic powder almost as quickly as they were unpacked hours later when i was finally replaced i walked out into the pale light of another dawn working those long hours had cost me dearly for my parents were right i wasnt at full strength yet the clinic had been almost too easy with its regular hours and quiet evenings and now too tired to sleep i nursed a cup of tea in the cool of sunrise and considered the problem of finding the elusive colonel prescott i could hardly go about asking officers who came to the aid station if they had served under him i knew too well how quickly word got around whoever he was how could he have known when he wrote that glowing letter to julia that major carson was dead unless he had had something to do with whatever had happened why else would he have written it except to allay worry at home it had sounded genuine enough compassionate sympathetic and of course it had had to sound that way in order not to arouse suspicion after all julia carson had the regiment behind her and my father once its colonel as well if the major simply disappeared questions would be raised and then there were the men under the major what had they been told i was to have my answer to that a few days later we had been busy all morning and well into the afternoon then there were a few blessed minutes of grace and i went to my quarters to change my bloody apron for a fresh one when a womans voice called my name i turned to see diana hurrying toward me because our own homes were scattered across england four other nurses and i had taken a flat together in mrs hennesseys london house converted to flats for the duration of the war a widow mrs hennessey was strict with her young ladies and it was a comfort to know that we were in good hands when one of us arrived late at night tired and thankful not to have to find an hotel or face a longer journey elsewhere when we had scarcely twentyfour hours of leave diana threw her arms around me crying i cant believe its you bess we were so worried when your mother wrote to say you were recovering i was afraid to open the letter for two days she scanned my face still a little tired i see i was afraid you might come back too soon i held her at arms length youre absolutely blooming yourself she blushed a little bess wish me happy ill be married this time next year i wasnt sure youd seen the announcement in the times but thats tremendous news i wish you both a glorious life together you deserve it thank you im so grateful you didnt want him for yourself you could have had him you know i laughed diana the instant he saw you i was forgotten love at first sight if ever i witnessed such a thing and how are the others mrs hennessey she is flourishing mary is back in france after her bout with influenza and the others are due for leave any day now im so glad your family my dearest simon it was a longstanding joke between us simon sometimes took her to dinner when i wasnt in london and diana swore he did it to make me jealous and i could see that she thoroughly enjoyed those invitations perhaps more so than she had been willing to admit until another man had come into her life theyre well thank goodness i hoped it was true in simons case i was still waiting for word we exchanged news of other friends and then diana said wasnt major carson in your fathers regiment surprised to hear her bring up his name i replied warily yes indeed in fact i called on julia carson just before i returned to france what im about to tell you wont be for her ears but the colonel might wish to know theres a whisper going around that hes deserted she was using the present tense as if she hadnt heard that vincent carson was dead my shock must have been reflected in my face ii cant imagine such a thing major carson no there must be some mistake i let my voice trail off encouraging her to go on the story i overheard was that he was pulled from his sector for a special assignment and never made his rendezvous good heavens it was all i could think to say collecting my wits i added hehes such a very conscientious man theres even talk that one day hell follow my father as colonel i cant think what would cause him to desert yes well you know how gossip is the only thing i could think of was shell shock and that he has no idea who or where he is i met him at that dinner party your mother gave just after war was declared if he hadnt already been married to julia id have set my cap at him the two of you would never suit i said drily grateful shed changed the subject true well i must drive an ambulance to rouen the man who should be doing it collapsed two hours ago pneumonia and then i have ten days leave i could fly to dover at the very thought i said quickly could you carry a message for me if i was quick about it i dont want it going through the censors a love letter bess who is the lucky man id heard there was an australian in your life is he history now this is to simon i have to get information to him and have been racking my brain to find a way i have less than two minutes yes of course i ran to my quarters scrabbled in my valise for pen and paper and an envelope then scribbled what diana had told me on the sheet there was no time to reread it i sealed it in the envelope and wrote the direction on it praying that he would be at his cottage to receive it if he wasnt my parents always collected his post in his absences so that no one would realize he was away so often breathless i hurried back to diana gave her the letter and watched her drive off with her usual care for the patients in the back one of them the regular driver quickly changing i went back to my duties regretting only that diana and i had had so little time together id have liked to hear more about her wedding plans and remind her that i would like to be included in the wedding party i was dazed with fatigue when i finished my shift and collapsed on my cot falling into a deep sleep toward morning i dreamed that i had gone into the shed where the dead were taken to look for major carson anxious to find his body before the charge of desertion was brought against him certain that if i could show his broken neck to his commanding officer i could clear his name but what i found instead was private wilson hanging there his body already limp in death his face gorged with blood making him nearly unrecognizable id had to peer at him and as the corpse swung at the end of the rope his hand touched me and i screamed sister colter said really bess you told me to wake you at six i came awake with a start looking up at her im so sorry i managed to say i must not have heard you calling me you were so deeply asleep you wouldnt have heard a cavalry charge she agreed and was gone leaving me to wash my face and put on my uniform i was still shaken by the dream as i gulped a cup of tea then hurried to deal with the line of men waiting for attention there was still no response from simon by the end of the week and i wasnt sure where he was a letter had come from my mother letting me know that everyone was well and there had been no mention of simon being away so long either he was at home and safe or she was being circumspect and then the next morning as i walked into the surgical tent i saw his tall figure just ahead of me simon was making his way down the row of severely wounded men stopping at each cot speaking quietly to the men who were conscious simply looking down at the ones who were not when he reached the end of the line he turned back and saw me according to my mother both simon and my father visited the wounded often and without fanfare wherever they happened to be there was something about both men that made them popular wherever they went and their compassion for the ill and the dying was infinite they had been soldiers with impressive records themselves but it went beyond that war seemed to forge a brotherhood that made someone like captain barclay claim he was healing even when it was a lie even when he knew that going back to france might well end in his own death i watched as simon had a word for each man making one or two of them smile and he offered comfort to those who were suffering in grim silence i waited until he came up to me nodding he said outside i followed him into a dusk lit by artillery flashes once or twice i could see bursts of machinegun fire he turned his back to that saying i must be brief im supposed to be in dover i got your message it seems that orders came down from hq to send carson as liaison to the french forces he must never have reached the meeting with his opposite numberbut the odd thing is whoever that was he never reported carson missing whats more no one can be certain where the order originated the signature is a scrawl that explains how his murderer got to him doesnt it i responded softly once out of the lines following a guide he didnt know he could have been lured to his death but why why kill major carson there are bodies and wounded men everywhere no one notices one more private wilson did and was killed because of it i want you to make a list as comprehensive as you can of everyone who was in and out of that aid station simon do you realize how impossible that is i expostulated i dont mean the dead and dying orderlies who were there for a week or more are not likely candidates either and a sister couldnt break carsons neck he was too strong too tall private wilson would have known such things i shut my eyes searching faces in my memory after a moment i shook my head i may not have seen him this killer has no face so far i said finally ill keep trying but its a needle in the proverbial haystack and possibly the only lead well have he touched my shoulder in a comradely gesture take care bess whatever you do i dont want to have to explain to your mother how it was you got hurt and then he was gone disappearing into the night when the next ambulances went south with wounded who could be moved i asked if i could be the nurse in charge dr hicks looked at me said you could use a few hours of respite and it was arranged i rode in the last ambulance prepared to do what i could if we were forced to stop and attend to one of the men it was a hard jolting ride through mud and craters and ruts deeper than most axles and was warm enough for the miasma to rise and envelop us with the unforgiving smells of the battlefield i held on for dear life to avoid being shaken to death but we reached our destination without mishap blessedly everyone still alive here was where id fallen so ill here was where private wilson had died had the staff changed how many of them had survived i felt a wave of relief when i saw that matron was the same woman id served with she would be able to tell me about private wilson after id turned my charges over to her she invited me to her room for a cup of tea i hadnt expected the rush of emotion that id felt as the aid station had come into view i couldnt help but wonder if matters would have been very different if my collapse had come an hour even two later and id had an opportunity to speak to her about what private wilson had shown me in the shed would he be alive now or would i simply have put matron at risk too i tapped at her door was admitted and offered a chair i cant tell you how good it is to see you healthy once more she said warmly you gave us a terrible fright you know in the lamps light i could see how worn she looked and how tired im so sorry ive read about the great plagues of history she said i never dreamed i would experience one we lost so many good people did private wilson survive i asked and immediately felt a surge of guilt for letting her assume i knew nothing about his death he handled so many bodies i often wondered havent you heard my dear hes dead i wasnt told i answered which was trueid asked simon to find out what had become of him he was always ready to do whatever we asked such a good man was it a lingering death or a kind one frowning she said odd that you should ask she looked down at the chart in front of her then raised her eyes to meet mine after you were taken ill he came looking for you but you were too feverish to answer whatever question he had intended to ask instead he left a message for me id been awakened earlythere was an emergency you seeand before i was free to speak to him one of his stretcher bearers came rushing into my office to say that private wilson had hanged himself in the shed dr harrison suggested that hed begun to feel ill thats why hed sought a nurse then as his symptoms progressed and he realized what lay in store he decided to end it while he was still able i was there when he was cut down and i myself closed his eyes did you agree with dr harrisons view a surgeon hed worked mainly with the wounded looking away toward the door she said i must say as far as anyone knew he didnt appear to be presenting symptoms no fever no aches no dizziness and so ive wondered you know if id been available rather than having to put him off perhaps i could have done something for himgiven him an opportunity to tell me what was on his mind i dont know if i could have helped but id have tried i did wonder if there was a problem at home several people asked for compassionate leave when their wives or a child died of the influenza but there had been no problem at home id spoken to mrs wilson i dont know that anyone could have helped him i said gently do you remember the onset of your symptoms she asked turning back to me not really great fatigue but we were all unbelievably tired werent we a headache i think dizziness you told sister burrows that you felt cold unable to warm yourself and then you fainted your temperature climbed rapidly surprised i said i dont remember fainting or being so cold but perhaps dr harrison is right private wilson knew what was coming and that he had to act quickly ive tried to comfort myself with that thought but there will always be that little niggling doubt there was no way i could assuage that sense of guilt not without telling her the whole truth i could only agree that he was the last person i could imagine doing such a thing we cant read minds can we she took a deep breath i was glad it was not my duty to write to his wife dr bennett broke the news as gently as he could i dont remember dr bennett i said no hed hardly arrived here when he was ordered to another station three of their doctors died in the epidemic she finished her tea i must make my rounds she said and you are needed elsewhere it was good of you to come and see me sister crawford and five minutes later the ambulance washed down and ready to go back the way wed come was there at the ward door i had remembered nothing useful by coming here i thought as we bounced and skidded over the broken ground all i had confirmed was that private wilson had indeed killed himself or so it appeared and perhaps he had after all and then as if once id stopped trying the memories crowded in memories i hadnt looked for because i hadnt remembered they were there the man with the bandaged shoulder id been standing outside the ward for a moment on that last evening before i fell ill another sister had joined me there both of us struggling with exhaustion and hoping to find in the fresh air away from the odors of death and disease a brief desperately needed renewal yes and i could almost see again how stained and frayed the bandaging was the man had gone into the small makeshift canteen and id wanted to stop him and tell him to see to that wound before it turned septic beneath the filthy dressing had he for that matter was it truly a hasty field dressing or was it a disguise there were so many men coming and going all of them wounded that one more hardly warranted notice with two sisters standing not twenty feet away why hadnt he come to either of us to ask for help sister ive been waiting two hours or more and nobodys had a look at this shoulder im fair famished for my tea but its hurting like the very devilbegging your pardon sisterand im that lightheaded from the pain we could have brought him his tea while the wound was being seen to why had he turned away there had been two officers passing by limping were they the reason hed turned aside because he wasnt wounded after all and had just put a dead man in the shed where he should never have been found by private wilson or seen by me it was a shocking possibility stop i said to the driver of the ambulance we must go back iive forgot to pick up something for dr hicks we had not come so great a distance that we couldnt turn back but ambulances were badly needed at the front and as the driver was reminding me i ought not be using one for personal errands but the question i needed to ask matron would only take a moment no more unless of course the sister was still there grumbling my driver did as he was told motioning the remainder of the convoy to continue on its way and reversing as soon as he could i sat there trying to recall which sister id been talking with so much of those last few hours before my collapse seemed to be shrouded in a haze sister burrows that was it id liked her wed worked very well together the driver stopped not far from the ward where matron had her office and said i shant turn off the motor a reminder that time was passing i splashed through the muddy torn yard and scraped my shoes before knocking at her door come she called and i stepped in sister crawford she said surprised to see me is there an emergency i had forgoti have a message for sister burrows it was the only thing i could think of to explain my returning so impetuously matron frowned emphasizing how much these last weeks had aged her didnt you know she died of the influenza not a week after you left us i didnt know what to say stammering i finally replied no i hadnt been told remembering my hasty improvisation i added nor had the young lieutenant im so very sorry she was a fine nurse matron agreed she kept you alive i think until the crisis came it was devotion to duty more than hope but here you stand living proof of her skill diddid nursing me contribute to her own illness i doubt it like you when the influenza struck she had been on her feet for nearly thirtysix hours working with a new convoy of the infected although the doctor had told her to take a few hours for sleep they had turned the corner most of them when she fainted outside my door that too is to her credit i shall write to her family i said thank you matron i had turned to the door when her next words stopped me in my tracks youre the second person this week who has asked for her i forced myself to turn again slowly who was he i asked how did you know it was a man matron demanded the frown returning i assumed it must be a patient or a former patient yes i see it was rather odd his name was prescott he said colonel prescott he told me sister burrows had nursed his son and that hed come to thank her its always possible of course that he has a son in the army but colonels seldom arrive without an entourage she regarded me not related to your young lieutenant by any chance is he id feel more comfortable if he were the last thing i wanted was to claim a connection with him i think not my young lieutenant was named hennessey and he came from her village i could feel myself flushing as i lied so boldly i expect sister burrows is the only one who could have told us what this was about do you recall what he looked like the colonel prescott mustache dark hair very cold gray or perhaps blue eyes i noticed them in particular possibly an inch or so short of six feet a bulky man i tried to remember what id seen of the man with the bandaged shoulder surely hed been fair i shook my head i dont think i remember a prescott in our ward perhaps the son was one of those she nursed after id gone to england did you look at the lists we kept records of our patients i was praying she would tell me he was there no the colonel explained that his son was carried to the aid station where sister burrows had served before coming here hed had difficulty tracking her down thats why it had taken so long to speak to her he said that could be true i replied thinking aloud still id have thought he was too busy to come in person i wondered myself but its possible hes a better officer than he gave me the impression of being i could hear the ambulance horn sounding now id been here longer than id expected i wonder if his son could have confused sister burrows with someone else i suggested for matrons sake i didnt want her to be too curious about this colonel prescott and find herself his next victim wounded men are so often in and out of consciousness i should have thought of that myself it makes sense take care sister crawford she said dont work yourself into a relapse i promise and i was racing back to the ambulance slipping quickly into my seat almost as the driver let in the clutch and we were off this was the second appearance of colonel prescott i needed to pass the information along to simon or my father but it wasnt the sort of thing i could trust to the censors he and my father had access to the military pouch on occasion but i didnt i couldnt ask for leave with the warming weather the influenza epidemic seemed to be waning for we were beginning to see more wounded than feverish patients still we were working around the clock and nurses couldnt be spared but what to make of this visit from colonel prescott whoever he was when i reached the forward aid station i was told i wasnt on call for six hours and i was gratefuli could feel every mile in that ambulance in the stiffness of my body from clinging to my seat but instead of sleeping i found myself lying there mulling over what to do simon had assured me that there was no colonel prescott presently on the rolls he was seldom wrong about such things the fact that there were rumors that major carson had deserted explained why his own commanding officer hadnt written to julia why had a colonel prescott and why had this same colonel prescott come looking for sister burrows had she seen him later that night when id been taken ill spoken to him i was finally drifting off into sleep when i remembered the orderly carrying a mop and pail hadnt sister burrows promised to speak to him when he came by again to ask him to bring a basket of clean linens to our ward and if id come asking questions she might have remembered that especially if hed never brought them she could have described the man surely but why had he risked coming openly to speak to matron because she would have no way of connecting him to that night the next thing i knew someone was shaking my arm trying to wake me out of a deep sleep i said is it six oclock already for it was still very dark outside as far as i could tell dr hicks wants you at once sister hanby told me hurry its an emergency i dragged myself out of bed and into my clothes before i was fully awake running across to the tent where emergencies were dealt with dr hicks was standing in the doorway waiting for me theres a patient here who claims he knows you youd better come quickly hes in a bad way my first thought was the australian sergeant wounded again but when i saw the face of the man on the stretcher his uniform cut off and dark blood pulsing from the wound on his shoulder in spite of what the nursing sister could do i felt the world spin around me and thought for a moment i was going to faint chapter seven steadying myself by an effort of will i crossed to the stretcher and looked down into the dark painfilled eyes of simon brandon i could see him relax as he recognized me be glad the hun is a damned poor shot he said quickly and then lost consciousness i took over the pressure bandage as dr hicks prepared to operate saying as he worked the bullet is still in there thats the trouble keep the pressure just there while sister evans prepares him he hadnt even asked me how i knew the man lying in front of him or why he had demanded to see me we worked for an hour or more but dr hicks was good at what he didhed had long years of practiceand he managed to remove the bullet and find the tiny bit of uniform that had gone into the wound with it probing carefully without adding to the damage already there for the shot had clipped a corner of simons lung and we were fearful that it had clipped an artery as well but the bleeding stopped as we began to close the wound and his color was better next would come the fight against deadly infection although we had cleaned the wound as thoroughly as we could what was he doing here wounded by a german bullet i was just putting the final touches to the bandage that covered his chest and shoulder when simon opened his eyes they were dazed and confused at first and then as the ether continued to wear off he quickly regained his senses hello he said hoarsely recognizing me again i thought id dreamed you not likely how did you come to be shot i thought when i saw you last that you were on your way to dover a convenient lie he murmured i knew better than to press for more but thinking through where our aid station was locatedhow close to the firing it wasand where in this particular sector we were it suddenly occurred to me that simon had gone behind enemy lines it was the only explanation for his getting shot i felt cold if the germans had captured him he would have faced a firing squad simon would consider that a lesser problem than being caught by some of the tribes of the northwest frontier in india but he would have been just as dead although not as quickly the gurkhas the fiercely trained and ferocious little men of the king of nepals army were often sent behind the lines because they could move in the night like the wind barely heard and always unseen if they had brought him here they had not waited to see how he fared and that was not unexpected either simon knew the gurkha officersalways english not nepaleseand there could well have been a mission that required someone of simons experience and skill to accompany the native soldiersor to guide themwherever it was they had had to go there were whispers about their prowess id heard a few myself that they brought back german officers for interrogation that they took out snipers or machinegun nests that couldnt be reached any other way even that they crawled to the lip of the german trenches and listened to the conversation of the unsuspecting occupants if only half the stories were true they were remarkable almost as if hed followed my thinking simon added get me to england fast as you can youve just had very serious surgery you cant be moved doesnt matter i knew that he would find a way somehow whether i helped him or not thats when i gave him something without his knowledge that made him sleep for five hours my conscience was clear whatever it was simon knew or had learned it could wait his life was more precious to me than his service to england and for a colonels daughter brought up to put the regiment first above all else even ones own feelings this was tantamount to treason my ancestress at waterloo would have been appalled my mother would have understood completely it was several days before we could move simon and his fever fluctuated enough that we were afraid to do so even then in addition to my own duties i kept the bandages clean kept the wound itself as antiseptic as i could and saw to it that he slept as much as possible it wasnt until the third day that he realized id been giving him something to keep him asleep he was absolutely furious with me insisting that his information was critical but i let his anger wash over me without answering him and when he had exhausted himself i told him that i had sent word straightaway to the colonel sahib telling himobliquelywhat had transpired it did little to pacify him for as he told merightly enoughmy father might not receive my news for a week or more therefore i was both relieved and glad when my father came striding into the aid station just after dusk followed by four tall highlanders he greeted me with a nod and turned to simon you look like the very devil sergeantmajor thank you sir ive brought people with me if the good doctor here gives his consent were to carry you by easy stages to rouen thence to england it was the way id been taken out of france my father was gone in an instant and i turned on simon brandon and you were saying sergeantmajor about my decision to write the colonel sahib he gave me a sheepish grin weak but with something of his old spirit showing you did well bess bless you but this truly is important you frightened me simon i told him unable to stop myself then were even and i realized how worried hed been on that slow uncertain progress to the ship as i lay so ill i looked around and saw that we were alone still i leaned close to his ear and told him what i had learned from matron hes tidying up simon warned fighting to stay awake and coherent it must mean he knows youre back in france watch yourself dont ask too many questions damn it bess did you give me something again this time its your body trying to heal you mustnt think you can go haring off to london as soon as you reach england my father can deal with any matters for you yes all right simon promise i demanded i promise he said faintly and then they were bundling him up in bedding and carrying him out to the waiting ambulance that my father had somehow commandeered it would be a rough journey simon would be wishing for release by the time he reached rouen my father came to me rested his hand on my shoulder and gripped it strongly thank you my dear and this is from your mother he bent his head and kissed my cheek keep me informed please dont let me worry well do our best he told me and then they were gone as the ambulance drove slowly past me avoiding the lines of wounded dr hicks said from just behind me i gave him a little morphine hell not remember the journey whats more he will not reopen that shoulder fighting to avoid the jostling stubborn man sergeantmajor brandon what was he doing here in france in the first place i said as offhand as i could hes responsible for training recruits i expect he comes sometimes to see firsthand how to do it better satisfied dr hicks nodded then he said dont stand there staring after them sister crawford theres work to be done and there was a letter came from my mother quite soon after my father had reached england sent in one of the hq pouches that were secure i collected it while on a run to replenish supplies still she was circumspect saying only that our dear neighbor was slowly recovering after a small relapse and i was not to worry she went on to talk about ordinary household mattershow cook had not smoked the bees sufficiently before stealing a little of their hoard of honey for our table how the new calf was faring how the roses had bloomed beautifully this spring reminding her of the summer of and how she hoped that i was not overextending my strength cautioning me that a relapse on my part was still possible and then she added a few lines that i knew must have come straight from my father thank you my dear for your latest news your letters are always so precious and that reminds me weve just learned that your cousin is being sent back to france we thought youd want to know that nasty broken leg has mended sufficiently for him to return to light duties if you run into him he brings our best love i know youll be happy to see him again although we shall miss him sorely hes always such a joy to have around isnt he the dear neighbor was of course simon whose cottage was just across the back garden and down the lane from us i wasnt surprised to hear hed had a small relapse for the journey had been hazardous from the start my latest news meant that simon had managed to remember what i had told him about colonel prescott and sister burrows but who was our cousin i had no cousins not now one had died in india many years ago of cholera and the other had been killed at mons early in clearly whoever he was he was coming back to france in spite of still recovering from a broken leg i was confused by the reference to light duties there were no light duties in the trenches i ran through our acquaintance came up emptyhanded and read the last paragraph again and then i realized that my father was alerting me to the fact that my news was worrying enough that he was sending someone to keep an eye on me and make communication easier until simon was well again not a real cousin then but someone i knew and whats more knew that i could trust someone who wouldnt stand out or draw attention to himself or more important draw attention to the fact that he was guarding me in spite of simons warning i was aghast this had all begun as an attempt to find out who had murdered major carson and perhaps even private wilson but now it was possible that i was in danger not only because id seen the majors body but also because i could have seen the man who killed him whether i actually could identify him or not all that mattered was that the killer believed i could he had come in search of sister burrows if the man who presented himself to matron was one and the same colonel prescott who had written that spurious letter of sympathy to julia carson i couldnt imagine what major carsons death was all about which made it easier for me to make a mistake or put my trust in the wrong person whats more when i looked over my shoulder in the dark i had no way of knowing if the person i saw in the shadows of a tent or lurking behind an ambulance was friend or foe and that was truly disturbing to me while i was looking for colonel prescott whoever he was the man in the stained bandage might be standing just behind me or the orderly carrying the mop and pail might be the man handing me fresh bandages because i couldnt be sure id know either of them as i drank the last of my tea and finished the thin sandwich that was my dinner i asked myself what in the name of god major carson had done that had set all this in motion vincent carson was one of ours my father would move heaven and earth if he had to to find the captains murderer it would become a personal obligation a matter of honor but where to begin how were we ever going to know what it was that had put the major in danger in the first place and what about the rumor that hed deserted was it true what simon had said that this meant whoever was behind the majors death was indeed tidying up i watched the shell flashes as the ambulance crawled over the rutted road toward the forward aid station listening to the bombardment that presaged an attack what partif anyhad sabrinas husband william morton played in any of this where was he if he and his brotherinlaw had never seen eye to eye had this escalated to the point that it had led to murder the staff was waiting for our supplies and i was busy for hours working with the latest influx of wounded it was shortly before moonrise when the last of the men had been examined and a decision had been made about their treatment dr hicks straightening his back then arching it as if it ached said go on to bed sister weve done all we can ill rouse dr timmons and sister clery they can take over he was right we had done what we could do and that was saying a good bit i said good night and trudged out into the darkness wondering if the time would ever come when i could say with any confidence that i had had enough sleep while i was in france certainly since eastbourne and even longleigh house i had not i made a detour to wash up before going to bed entering the empty line of latrines and basins listening to the sound of my footsteps echoing on the thin boards that kept our feet out of the foul mud below a single candle in a dish gave me enough light to see the bucket standing under the water lorry and i filled it just enough to take out my handkerchief and wash my face and hands water was precious but so was cleanliness when dealing with patients i had closed my eyes to splash water over my face it smelled strongly of brine and faintly of petrol but it was cool enough to feel the fresh morning air on my wet skin i leaned my head back to bathe my throat just as i did an arm came round my neck from behind hard enough to choke off my breath and i had a flash of thoughtthat this was how private wilson had been found hangingbefore i reacted i wasnt about to be choked into unconsciousness and then a rope pulled around my neck private wilson had been taken unawares i was as well but i had a little history to guide me i hadnt grown up in an army post without learning something about selfdefense subalterns had vied to show offand show me tricks sure to protect me as the candle sputtered my booted foot kicked out at the water bucket connecting with such force that it went bouncing and clanging down the boards my hands went not to claw uselessly at the arm of my attacker and the heavy fabric of his uniform sleeve but at his vulnerable sides digging in my nails and raking upward finding the soft skin beneath his tunic and shirt it caught him by surprise as he twisted to protect himself i tramped down on his instep with my other boot and these werent the pretty shoes of a london season they were designed to survive the front he relaxed his arm briefly swearing and jerking back in pain i spun out of his grip and as soon as i could fill my lungs with air again i screamed furious he shoved me toward the lorry and i stumbled as i tried to keep my balance hurting my wrist as i went down he reached for me again pulling me up trying to get a hand over my mouth no longer hoping to make my death look like suicide now he was intent on simple murder i cried out again before he succeeded in cutting it short there are only a handful of women this close to the front lines and my first scream brought men racing from every direction by my second they were converging on us my assailant flung me against the offside wheel of the water lorry with some force i threw up my hands just in time to protect my head and face he ducked beneath the lorry and disappeared into the shadows on the far side by the time the first orderly reached me id scrambled to my feet alone and furiously angry in my turn i could have tried to pass off the attack as female fears and an overwrought imagination in the shadowy poorly lit latrines perhaps it would have been better that way but my hair was tumbling down my back the side of my face where id scraped it on something was already an angry red in the light of the torches blinding me and the strap of my apron had been torn off the bib there was no disguising the fact that id been in trouble their first thought was an attempt at rape and why should they even consider murder dr hicks was pushing the other men aside leaning forward to get a better look at me he swore as he took in the damage are you hurt anywhere else he demanded his face like a thundercloud my wristi think it banged into the pump as i broke away nothing a cold compress wont help in spite of the effort id made to get myself under control even i could hear the shock in my voice nor could i do much about the fact that i must have looked like a thundercloud myself everyone seemed to be there in the darkness behind the ring of torchlight sisters orderlies ambulatory patients ambulance drivers i quickly scanned their faces searching forwhat a stranger amongst them anyone who could fit matrons description of the man whod come looking for sister burrows but of course there was no one who by any stretch of my imagination could have attacked me there was only genuine concern for me and by coming so quickly to my aid they had unwittingly allowed my assailant to escape dr hicks seemed to realize that in the same moment he half turned to the orderlies and ambulance drivers saying grimly dont stand therestart searching the aid station top to bottom find out who did this that done dr hicks marched me off to the surgery tent to bathe and dress my face then find a compress for my wrist where a bruise was fast turning to an ugly red did you see who it was sister crawford can you give us any description i tried but he came from behind out of the shadows and i think the candle went over as he reached for me i didnt even know he was there until he put his arm around my throat i didnt add that his other hand had been locked in the palm of the hand suffocating me bringing all his strength to bear on cutting off my air he had known what he was doing there was no doubt in my mind about that did you mark him in any way not where it could be seen there was no chance i said as he tilted my head to look at my throat i couldnt have reached his face i was nearly sure of that but where i dug my nails into his sides there must be marks you kept your head he said nodding in approval but sooner or later the shock will catch up with you he must have lined up with the walking wounded then slipped away when no one was looking yes that chest woundwe were so busy it must have been then the soldier had been dying from blood loss when he was brought in and somehow miraculously dr hicks had found the source of the bleeding and stopped it the boyhe seemed no older than that on the stretcherwas sent straight back to the base hospital with a fiftyfifty chance of surviving wed all applauded when dr hicks had stepped back and nodded his hands and arms covered in blood i wouldnt have believed it possible if i hadnt watched it for myself in that moment of success someone could have stepped out of line walked to the latrines and waited for me he must have seen me clearly as i sorted the cases but id been too busy to see him ill strip every man in here if i have to you were damnvery fortunate the doctor was saying to me as he considered the marks on my neck i wont have this sort of thing on my watch and he stormed out to do just exactly that but of course he didnt find my attacker or anyone with a mark on him that would correspond to my struggle soon after that he came back to escort me to my quarters saying only hes not here mind you that doesnt mean he wasnt or that he wont come back if not for you then for one of the other sisters and ill see that word is passed this wont be tolerated he stood outside my tent until i was inside and i found it comforting despite my certainty that there wouldnt be a repeat attack at least not while the guard of the entire station was up i didnt fall sleep for a long while my body was still tense the feel of that arm choking me still too fresh every little sound in the darkness seemed overly loud and menacing even though i told myself to ignore it where i thought lying there was the cousin who had been sent to keep me safe wherever he was hed nearly been too late another search was made at first light but there was no sign of my attacker dr hicks excused me from my morning shift but i went to him and asked him to let me work as frightening as the experience had been i knew that i was safer and less likely to dwell on what had happened if i kept busy everyone was sympathetic and i noticed that someone was always within call wherever i went but what to tell my father and if simon got any inkling of what had occurred hed be in france before the day was out still bleeding or not in the end i decided to say nothing to them for all i knew it had indeed been an attempt at rape not murder i was walking across to my quarters that night when i heard dr hicks just behind me say sharply who the devil are you i turned to see him challenging someone who was only a black silhouette against the faint light of the distant shelling the new orderly the voice said i walked up there wasnt any transportation then youll damned well stay there until i can take a good look at your orders i knew that voice didnt i but i couldnt quite place it for coming out of the darkness half muffled by the big guns i couldnt quite make the connection i needed more to jog my memory ill wait until you have sorted him out i told dr hicks hoping to catch a glimpse of the mans face as they repaired to the small tent where the doctors kept their paperwork and whatever medicines we had under lock and key but he said no wiser to go inside and leave me to deal with this nodding i did as i was told and as soon as i was safely in my quarters he was gone the next morning sister clery said have you met the new orderly a glimpse nothing more well i can tell you he isnt like the rest wait until you see for yourself more to the point is he good at his work wasted she said firmly remember that hand that we thought might be turning septic we had to take it off this morning and corporal dugan was fighting us for all he was worth barclay held him for us until we could get the ether mask over his face i didnt hear the rest i had placed the voice now as well as the way the man had been standing as he spoke to dr hicks what was captain barclay doing in france at a british aid station masquerading as an orderly chapter eight i saw him coming out of the canteen a cup of tea in his hand grimacing as he drank it without sugar or milk i called youre the new man are you barclay im never going to learn to like tea he said plaintively approaching me sorry its all we have theres a shortage so ive heard he glanced around then said swiftly bess you dont know me with that he walked off but wherever i was it seemed that captain barclaybarclay the orderlywas somewhere close by he seemed oddly out of place to me in his khaki orderlys tunic with the red cross on his sleeve id seen him in his own uniform and he wore it with an air that suited his rank still everyone else took him in stride and his attempts at rankandfile humility were successful although sometimes i caught a gleam in his eyes that belied them working with the wounded to his credit he did the most menial task from emptying bloody basins to carrying away an amputated limb with the grim stoicism of a seasoned orderly hed been in the trenches of course hed seen and dealt with worse but it was not something anyone grew accustomed to however hard the shell put up to keep ones sanity in the face of such horrors i couldnt help but think in the dark hours of the night that hed appeared right on the heels of the attack on me and then id remind myself that the colonel sahib had sent him and the colonel sahib was seldom wrong in his judgment of a mans character i could also see dr gainess fine hand in all this captain barclay had been pressing to return to his men ready or not this would be a lesson in a different kind of humilityforcing him to listen to his doctors in a way his presence was comforting in the first place it freed me to work without looking over my shoulder in the second id been concerned about someone hovering in my way at every turn but apparently hed been ordered to keep his distance close enough to protect me but without being underfoot id have given much to discover why my parents had turned to captain barclay as the safest choice to watch over me he was as i knew only too well a very persuasive man still his wound helped him carry off his charade that must have carried some weight what little i learned about his story came in bits and pieces from others he was canadian had joined the british army because he had been living in britain when war was declared but he was rejected because of a leg injury that refused to heal properlyhence his limpand so hed become an orderly instead his time in the clinic had given him a good background to make that believable he talked about his duties there with the ease of experience he wasnt married this from sister clery and his father was in the merchant marinewhich was close enough to the truth i asked where he lived and i was told hed been an orderly at longleigh house in somerset had served in dover on several patient transport ships which had aggravated his bad leg and was now with us dr gaines again i thought and hed also been responsible for my own return to france several evenings later dr hicks sent me to the base hospital for supplieswed been running short for three days but he hadnt been able to spare anyone with a brief respite in the fightingthe guns were silent and lines of fresh troops were making their way to the front to relieve those whod endured a week of heavy shellingwe had only a trickle of new patients we took with us three badly wounded men who were due to be sent back for more treatment and barclay was assigned to drive it was a more or less uneventful journey although once a nervous company of raw troops fired on us from a distance before their sergeant got them under control again shouting at them in a glaswegian accent that made half of what he was saying unintelligible we delivered our patients and saw to it the instructions accompanying them were duly signed for then collected the list of desperately needed medicines bandages needles sutures and so on that dr hicks had requested an hour later the ambulance carefully stocked i got into the seat beside captain barclay after hed turned the crank wait until were out of sight he said in a low voice turning out of the racetrack and picking up the road to the front and so i waited last night the sun had set in a blaze of gold and red sliding behind a bank of deep purple clouds now it was pitchdark without the flickering light of the shelling and the only way we could be certain we were on what passed as a road were the wide swaths of deep ruts left behind by the lorries our blackedout headlamps were woefully inadequate casting shadows that only made it harder to judge anything in time to avoid another bonewrenching jolt about two miles out we spotted the single chimney and broken wall of a farmhouse it had become a marker of sorts and we all knew to watch for it the rest of the village was little more than rubble with no way of judging where the streets had been much less the houses or shops that once had lined them how this single chimney and wall had survived god alone knew the ambulance rocked and swayed over the debris and i feared we would never extract it again just as barclay turned off the motor and silence fell i could have sworn i heard a cricket somewhere it was so quiet all right he said turning to me his face a pale mask in the darkness and oddly sinister im sorry there was no chance to explain before this i was told i didnt know you i suspected the sergeantmajors touch there necessity or precaution or jealousy the mask split into a white grin in the shadows how is simon i asked anxiously i didnt see him to tell the truth and that worried me surely if he were well enough simon would have been consulted then how did you become involved in this what did they tell you dr gaines and my father dr gaines had been sent for he must have told your father that id accompanied you to nether thornton and then to the gorge but youd spoken to my father once when i was sailing to france you told him where to meet me that was sheer luck bess i called the war office they found him wherever he was and passed on my message apparently they thought i was the sergeantmajor the colonel had a few words to say about that when we spoke again i could just imagine how annoyed my father was the relationship with simon was sacrosanct he wouldnt have appreciated captain barclays efforts however well intentioned at any rate your father asked if i was fit enough for duty and if id take on a hazardous assignment i was to report directly to him or if i couldnt reach him then to your mother id told simon about my companion on those journeys was it he whod remembered what did they tell you how did they explain that i might be in danger i still wasnt prepared to trust this man the colonel told me the truth at least i had the feeling he did what did they tell you i asked again trying not to sound impatient that someone had been murdered and you were the only witness who could testify to that the trouble was the killer knew you but you couldnt identify him as easily that you were in danger well by god they were right i heard about what happened just before i got there and if i get my hands on thaton whoever it is ill kill him myself the grin had disappeared like the smile of the cheshire cat and i could feel the tension in the man across from me a deepseated anger that was like a flare of warmth in the ambulance at any rate he went on after collecting himself when they spoke to me i jumped at the chance id rather be back with my men but if thats out of the question ill use this assignment to prove that im ready to fight again going over the top is not easy with a bad leg i said you know that as well as i do yes i can get others killed if im a burden he said impatiently thats been brought home to me but your father saw to it that i was given a background that wouldnt make anyone suspicious and your father asked me to give you this he moved in the darkness and his hand stretched out toward me in the palm lay the little pistol that simon had given me once before i recognized it immediately my father not simon himself i never saw the sergeantmajor bess i bit my lip once before id been afraid that bad news was being kept from me i had that feeling again had simon not lived to reach england had he lost that arm i looked down at the little pistol nurses were not permitted to carry weapons but this time remembering my feeling of helplessness when that arm had come around my throat and how lucky i was that id been able to kick the water pail then scream i touched it with my fingertips and then settled it carefully in the pocket of my uniform captain barclay was saying better to wing him bess your father wants him alive but who is he i asked why did hewhat reason could he have for attacking me ive never made an official report of any kind i wanted to know precisely how much my father had told the captain it appears he killed one major carson who was in your fathers old regiment and that hes willing to kill again to protect himself that woman the one who lived near the gorge apparently hed killed her husband as well the orderly who had discovered the majors body finally satisfied i nodded he must be in the army he would have to be to reach the major and then to attack me one cant simply take the next ferry across the channel yes that was your fathers theory they dont know what rank he actually holds but its easy enough out here to kill someone and steal a uniform one unmarked grave more or less wouldnt be noticed but one couldnt murder a major without a flag going up hed be missed a private soldier wouldnt whats more whoever this was had been able to carry off the masquerade as colonel prescott both in person and in the contents of the letter hed written julia carson i wondered how many roles as a military officer william morton had played on the stage shakespeare was filled with them seventeenth and eighteenthcentury plays as well gilbert and sullivan had created lively military characters productions had come out to india and were amazingly popular but then matron had questioned colonel prescotts mannersomething had made her uneasy of course until i asked questions matron had kept her doubts to herself had i allayed her suspicionsor would she at some point bring them up with someone else matron i felt a chill shed seen his face but hed made no effort to harm her why had there been no opportunity or did he think she could wait captain barclay was adding grimly something could have happened in the trenches between this man and carson not everyone out here is a gallant soldier serving king and country id heard stories of shooting unpopular officers in the back when the opportunity presented itself charging across no mans land is a chancy business at best and it would be easy firing at the enemy to find ones nemesis in the crosshairs if sabrina had been cut off without a farthing when she married her actor there could very well be hard feelings against vincent for not doing more for her when the elder carson died but vincent hadnt been shot in the back his neck had been broken captain barclay gingerly climbed out and restarted the ambulance weve delayed long enough theyll begin to wonder up ahead the overworked motor coughed and struggled for several seconds before finally turning over properly captain barclay reversed gingerly the wheel jerking in his hands and then we were safely back on what passed for a road i stopped a sigh of relief but i had a feeling he felt the same way we traveled in silence for a time i said someone knew i was at the aid station i dont see how he could it shouldnt be that difficult he turned to me in the darkness my sisters at a forward aid station or i served under colonel crawford before he retired is it true his daughters a nurse out here word gets around and so it had last winter when id asked for information about convents that took in french orphans the answer had come back to me in the most unexpected way then im still at risk but he wont try to kill me at the aid station here not again for one thing im carefully watched all the sisters are but my next postingor on the way to itill be vulnerable quite but i wouldnt write off someone stopping this ambulance and killing both of us he said tightly i shivered at the thought and touched the weight of the little pistol in my pocket simon had reminded me that it wasnt of a caliber to kill or maim but it was better than no protection and it could make enough noise and cause enough pain to stop my assailant until someone came to my rescue with that thought in mind when we had reached the station i slept more soundly in what was left of that night barclay was always in sight wherever i was and i wondered when or if he slept at all he looked tired and some of that i put down to his leg still being weak his limp seemed to be worse but he never complained sister clery sitting down beside me as i ate a hasty dinner before returning to my duties eyed me with interest i think she said after a moment that you have a beau and he really is handsome even though hes not an officer he ought to be perhaps theres something mysterious in his past that prevented him from joining the army under his own name realizing she was speaking of barclay i laughed hes actually a rich american in disguise and he followed me to france because ive refused his proposals of marriage nine times she laughed with me i tell you bess if that were true id volunteer to mend his sad and broken heart myself alas i fear its beyond mending ah well but ive noticed that everyone has been keeping an eye out for us i dont mind telling you i was badly frightened when you were attacked whoever he is hes well away from here now i assured her and hoped that it was true new orders came for me before the week was out dr hicks informed me of them when he and i had finished working to stabilize an abdomen torn by shrapnel before taking the risk of sending the patient on to rouen i shall miss your steady hand and good eye he said but my loss is another stations gain thank you sir and then with a sense of foreboding i asked could you tell me who ordered my transfer i spoke to him by field telephone this morning a dr percy had requested you id never worked with a dr percy was it dr percy on the telephone no no i could hardly hear the major there was so much interference but he confirmed you are to leave at once and the paperwork is to follow by the end of the week but thats unusual isnt it true but apparently theyre shorthanded outside of ypres and they cant wait for the orders to come he studied my face are you worried about this transfer sister crawford iyes i must admit that i am i said speaking frankly i can assure you it was all straightforward i made sure of that could you try to reach ypres and make certain that this was not a mistake is it the attack on you that has made you so wary my dear you will probably be safer in your new posting than you are here so close to the lines i shouldnt worry if i were you thank you sir i couldnt protest any more than i had yet this was what i had dreadeda new posting i knew very little about id been sure dr hicks would keep me but someone had been insistent and convincing i had no choice in the matter i went back to my tent trying to think of a way to send word to my father id seen captain barclay no more than an hour ago but now he was nowhere to be found troubled by his continued absence on my first break i finished packing my possessions as ordered if i could reach rouen surely i could find a way to contact the colonel sahib but when i changed my apron i made certain that the little pistol was in my pocket outside i could hear the grumble of ambulance motors as they prepared to leave for the base hospital just then dr hicks came to say goodbye be safe sister crawford did i tell you that there will be accommodations for you tonight at the american base hospital your transport to ypres as i understand it will leave tomorrow morning from there thank you sir sister clery also came to say goodbye and several of the others who werent busy with the wounded but still there was no sign of captain barclay sister clery seeing me look around a last time before taking my seat smiled and said ill tell him youll miss him shall i dont bother i said trying to convince myself that he had gone ahead to look into the transfer the ambulances followed the usual track stopping at one other aid station to take on three more patients and then finally when my spine felt like a washboard i could see the lights of rouen ahead we discharged our patients handed in the lists of names and the drivers went away to hose down the ambulances i said to the sister in charge ive received a new posting but the paperwork hasnt come through oral orders for ypres im told you have a bed for me tonight she glanced at my valise then raised her eyes to my face sister crawford i dont thinklet me look at the roster my heart sank but i smiled and waited patiently after a moment she shook her head no sorry theres nothing here i knew then that this was not an official transfer do you have a bed i dont believe my transport leaves until tomorrow morning again she shook her head weve got no space sister we had beds for eight hundred and weve got nearly sixteen hundred patients ive moved in with another nurse myself were that cramped im so sorry i put the best face on it i could my transport expects to find me here tomorrow before dawn could you leave a message that i am in rouen and will meet it on time she wrote a message and clipped it on a board by her desk where there were some twenty or thirty others i wont be on duty tomorrow but the nurse who is will see the message will that do i could tell she had more on her mind than dealing with my problems but there was one more question i wanted to put to her theres one more thing i said with a smile im being sent to work with a dr percy near ypres i hear hes something of a tartar have you had any dealings with him or his patients near ypres most of those cases go directly to dover i could only push the matter so far i thanked her and walked out of base hospitals reception so much for my attempts to find out anything useful communications were sketchy at best here in france the military used runners and motorcycles when contact was imperative radio telephones were not always dependable and so it wasnt too surprising that someone here in rouen wouldnt know a doctor on the coastal sector of the front unless of course he had a reputation that fed the rumor mill id have to wait until morning and see what sort of transportation showed up ordinarily id have sorted out the problem of where to spend the night without a second thought rouen was not a small town it was a sizable city and wandering about in it alonesomething id done a dozen times before thiswas no longer something i cared to do under the circumstances and what had happened to captain barclay id convinced myself that hed come ahead to prepare the way after all he could hardly openly desert his duties by leaving the aid station when i did but there was no indication that hed even reached the base hospital otherwise hed have left a message for me was he even in rouen now i wondered if he was alive because he took his duty to me seriously and yet he had vanished without a word whats more the ambulances that had brought me here had already pulled out for the front and there wasnt even a possibility of sending word back to dr hicks much less getting his answer before i myself left the city i stood there on the street thinking fast hotels were not the best choice for a woman alone but there was one place i was assured of a bed the convent id visited last winter and several times in the early spring before the influenza epidemic took hold id always brought something with memoney medicines soap foodto help with the care of any ill or wounded children this time i had only myself and so i found myself on the doorstep waiting for the porteress to answer the ring of the bell the convent had little comfort to offer a stranger at their door but they greeted me warmly and shared what they could the youngest nun came in quietly to wake me at three oclock and i dressed by candlelight in a room that held the nights chill from the river then i slipped out into the predawn darkness to make my way back to where my transport should be waiting i wasnt particularly frightened in the dark narrow streets where the sounds from the docks echoed and the sporadic shelling at the front was a counterpoint in the background no one knew where to find me and there was no one else about it was too early for the milk wagon or the lorries bringing in foodstuffs from the outlying villages too early for the ships to arrive from england with new recruits i knew the city and could find my way without difficulty only my own footsteps echoing i was within sight of the racetrack and the american base hospital when i glimpsed the outline of a motorcar some thirty yards on the far side of the hospital entrance where summer bushes were thick and dark my driver why hadnt he halted under the lamps where i could see him better but of course i was a little early he was probably sleeping at the wheel after his long drive still i was uneasy after all i had no idea who he was and id already decided to ask for some form of identification if i wasnt satisfied i would have the base hospital verify that hed come from dr percy should i wait where i was i was vulnerable here if the wrong person knew i was expecting to meet transport this morningand even if the transfer was legitimate in spite of the fact that no accommodations were waiting at the hospital it would be the perfect opportunity to find me alone and unprotected or approach what if the driver was already dead behind the wheel so that he couldnt raise the alarm if i didnt die quietly for that matter what if that motorcar wasnt for me after all standing there in the shadows of a building i debated what to do at this hour of the morning it was easy to believe in danger of any kind with my own breathing the only sound i could hear and not even a bat swooping through the darkness to distract me from my thoughts i decided not to wait where i was but to move closer to the base hospital where i could be heard if i had to scream if all went well there would be nothing to worry about if it didnt i hoped i could count on help sooner id taken only one step in that direction when there was a sharp movement just behind me my valise was in my right hand but before i could swing it at my assailant it was snatched out of my grip i was spun into the deeper shadow of a doorway a rough hand over my mouth i realized in that instant that i had stepping unwittingly into a trap that the motorcar had held my attention while the driver had come up behind me biting down on the hand over my mouth i began to fight id just managed to force my hand down toward the pistol in my pocket when a voice whispered savagely damn it bess if you kick me or shoot me ill never take you to the grand hotel captain barclay i stopped struggling he held me close for a moment until he was sure it wasnt a trick as he let me go i demanded angrily in a whisper of my own did you have to frighten me like that why couldnt you simply tell me who you were because he said shortly you must not get into that motorcar or let the driver see you he still had one arm around me holding me in the shadows of the doorway i didnt know if the driver of the motorcar had seen me or not or if he was even there it was too hard to tell it was still a quarter of an hour before i was to meet him and it was possible that he had gone into a café for coffee to keep himself awake who is he i asked keeping my voice low did you see him for that matter where have you been it was more important to watch for you and stop youlook hes just coming out of that alley across the way pay attention to his manner of walking do you recognize him but the man who had just appeared was hurrying away coughing once or twice as if he had been ill he disappeared into the darkness beyond with only a last cough to tell us where he had gone i dont thinkthat cant be him how long have you been here do you know if hes inside the motorcar it was there when i got here ive been watching it nothing then let me go i wont get in i promise you but its important to get a good look at him we may not have another chance no thats not safe bess im no match for him right now i have the pistol no i tell you it isnt worth the risk wait see if he shows himself hell grow impatient he might even walk as far as those lamps by the base hospital but he didnt where was he as i heard the clock in a nearby church tower strike four i broke away from captain barclays clutches and stepped out into the street walking sedately toward the motorcar i took my time i could now see that one wing was dented but that not surprising most of the motorcars anywhere near the front were dented and rusty when i was some ten or fifteen feet away i stopped looking around as if expecting to find my driver hallo i called after a moment anyone there i took a step or two nearer the bonnet and thenapparently uncertaini turned and took four back the way id come this gave me a chance to look around me scanning doorways and the windows of a café just down the street without appearing to be suspicious i was almost facing the motorcar again when without any warning at all out of the corner of my eye i saw movement behind the windscreen as if someone had been lying out of sight across the seats in the same instant the great bright headlamps came on their black paint gone and i was pinned in their glare startled and unable to see or move but i could hear the motor as it was gunned and the headlamps were speeding toward me behind me i heard captain barclay shout but i knew that if i moved too soon the driver behind the glare of the lights could see where i was leaping and compensate i almost left it too late prepared to spring to the left where i had the whole street in which to maneuver i realized that he too could use that space to swerve toward me and so without hesitating i flung myself right into the ragged line of unkempt shrubbery that marked that side of the road he swerved too just as i had feared but in this direction he had no roomhe dared not come too close to the shrubbery or at that speed hed lose control and crash into it still he cut it close i felt the force of his passage the leading edge of the rusted wing brushing my hip catching my apron and nearly dragging me under the rear wheels before the cloth ripped and freed me i cried out catching at the prickly scrubby branches of the shrubs to keep my balance the pistol was in my pocket and i scrabbled for it trying to reach it in the folds of my uniform but i already knew it would be impossible to bring it out in time to fire at my tormentor all the same i was frightened and angry enough to do just that i twisted to take a hard look at him but his face was half covered by a muffler a dark striped length of woolen cloth that must have been hot this time of year all i could see were his eyes matron had said they were gray but in the reflected light of the lamps i couldnt be sure for they gleamed so palely it was almost as if there were no eyes at all under dark heavy brows a very pale blue a clear gray like lake water in moonlight and then he was gone roaring off down the street narrowly missing captain barclay who was already rushing toward me as fast as he could it was in the light of the headlamps that i saw captain barclay clearly for the first time he was disheveled his uniform torn and bloody i hadnt asked him why he had disappeared but now i had a feeling that i knew captain barclay reached me pulling me out of the shrubbery brushing at my coat where leaves and twigs had caught all the while cursing me in words as vivid as any i had ever heard in the army what the hell were you thinking he demanded in the next breath were you trying to get yourself killed damn it bess crawford that was the most brazenly foolish thing ive ever seen anyone do but i had to see his face i had to be sure and he has gray eyes captain just as matron had said he did or very pale blue i could see them above the muffler you can change a good many things but not the color of your eyes whats more i wasnt entirely convinced he was inside the motorcar he could have killed my driver and waited for me somewhere nearby just as we were concealed in the shadows when he came out hed have to face me and id have had a clearer view of him even a clear shot if need be he shook me his hands gripping my shoulders and he nearly killed you a few inches closer and he could have hurt you badly if youd slipped youd have been under his wheels i couldnt believe you would do anything so rash your father warned me you were headstrong but i never dreamed he released me suddenly and i nearly stumbled into him before i got my balance again come on he said and taking my arm firmly enough to keep me by his side he started walking it isnt a good idea to stay here he could decide to swing back this way and ive told you im in no shape to do battle we walked as quickly as we could down the street then at the first corner took the next street and then the next we finally came to a small church in a culdesac and he strode toward the door finding it open we went inside greeted by the smell of musty walls incense and stone cold and dark as it was i felt vulnerable even though i knew logically that there was no possible way we could have been followed here as my eyes grew accustomed to the gloom i could make out the baptismal font a line of pillars leading down to the altar and the faint glow of the altar lamp all of them familiar things that pushed away my initial anxiety captain barclay found a row of chairs and we sat down wincing he thrust one leg out in front of him as if it ached unbearably are you badly hurt i asked after a moment and saw him shake his head what happened where were you i looked for you before i left the aid station he was clever i never saw the blow coming the next thing i knew i was out in the middle of nowhere near one of the relief trenches i fell into one of them while i was still dazed then had to make my way back you had already gone and i set out on foot for rouen i got a lift from a lorry coming back from the front carrying the dead ive been waiting there for you in the shadows of that doorway for hours i saw the motorcar arrive and i went on waiting knowing you had to come where were you they told me at the base hospital that you werent given a room there id been told they were expecting me but they werent i stayed in a convent i know of well at least you were safe for all i knew he shook his head helplessly what are we to do now im supposed to report to an aid station south of ypres but if whats happened here in rouen is any indication they have no reason to expect me there and i dont have the proper authorization to return to dr hicks or to leave france he was still nursing his grievance i couldnt believe youd gone away without waiting for me it could have been a hoax in fact it was a trick to lure you away from the protective dr hicks to rouen for instance where if anything happened to you you wouldnt be missed straightaway yes but there was the message anyone who knew how to use a field telephone could have sent that he scoffed dr hicks assured me the request was genuine i asked him hed spoken to an officer he said and so i didnt have much choice except to leave with the convoy when there was no room waiting at the base hospital i couldnt turn back it was too late i shook my head and felt my hair tumbling down quickly putting it up again i said i shall have to get word to my father its more urgent to get you back to england bess you cant stay in france dont you see one attack can be put down to luck on his part two a damned close call lets not wait for three i was reminded of simon telling me that he was superstitious enough not to want to see me come close to dying a third time captain barclay was saying i thought i could protect you i even told your father that i could but i was wrong falling into that trench was the last straw i dont want to go home to england if i do whoever this is will slip away and well never find out why he killed major carson i dont know that its important to find out captain barclay said wearily not if it puts you in danger like this if i could find a way to return to dr hicks and tell him that the message he received was only a ruse hed be happy to keep me there and id be safer there than anywhere else the only alternative is to go on to ypres and let them decide what should be done about me england bess for your own sake or if not for your sake then for your fathers i sat there trying to think if i went to ypres whoever was out there would know where to look for me if i returned to the forward aid station that id just left hed still know perhaps it would be wiser to go to england after all out of reach but it went against the grain to see a murderer go free to leave the patients i believed i could help i had the sinking feeling that id be letting down not only major carson but private wilson and his wife as well what was that old saying he who turns and runs away lives to fight another day all very well and good but if i ran away who would i find to fight on that other day if the man with those pale eyes couldnt find me then i couldnt find him could i chapter nine once again the decision was taken out of my hands in a very unexpected way we left the church finally for there was no place here to rest i couldnt take the american to the convent to stay for what was left of the night it would have required too many explanations as to why i was bringing him with me and the elderly nuns there would have felt uncomfortable if i simply told them that he too needed somewhere to stay a british nurse didnt arrive with an attractive young man in tow orderly or officer we found a small hotel on one of the streets not far from the cathedral and captain barclay went in to bespeak a room when i was certain he was being given one i removed my telltale cap and apron then hurried through the dark empty streets alone back to the convent i reached for the knocker to summon someone inside it was several minutes before anyone appeared surely even at this hour someone was awake acting as porteress i knocked again glancing anxiously over my shoulder and i was just in time to see a figure sliding quickly into the deeper shadows of another doorway some four houses away more frightened than i cared to admitfor myself and for the nuns insidei tried to think what to do screaming wouldnt help and if i left the convent i would be vulnerable with nowhere to turn i was on the point of leaving when the convent door opened at last and the elderly nun standing there said my dear in french we were at our devotions is anything wrong i glanced again at the spot where id seen the figure disappear and at that same instant he stepped out of the shadows and lifted a hand in salute before turning back the way i had come captain barclay had followed meand while i was in a way glad of his protection i was also angry with him for not staying safely in the hotel where id thought id left him who is that man the nun asked peering after him hes an orderly he wished to be sure i was safe late as it is as it turned out my transport was delayed how very kind of him she said nodding but do come in my dear out of the damp air it will do you no good i smiled and thanked her and followed her into the kitchen where a light still burned there she saw me clearly for the first time and said shocked but what has happened to you i had forgot how disheveled i must appear a motorcar came along i answered trying to stay as close to the truth as i could and in my effort to avoid him in the narrow street i slipped and fell into a shrubbery you must wash your face and hands and brush your hair i will see to your garments you cant leave us in the morning looking like this it would not be proper i thanked her again and very shortly afterward she saw me to the room id used earlier offered me a warmed nightdress again and gently closed the door feeling a little better i thought i might sleep instead i tossed and turned my mind unsettled over what to do i refused to eat breakfast in the morning knowing how little the nuns had to spare and hurried back to the hotel where i had left captain barclay in the early light i could read the signlhotel de lilleand i stepped inside to find the clerk a heavy man in his late fifties just coming back on duty i said briskly would you please tell my orderly private barclay that sister crawford is waiting for him in reception the clerk smiled offered me a chair and went up the stairs after a few minutes he came down again the private is not in his room nothas he come down for breakfast already i regret to say it appears he has not slept in his room i opened the door when there was no response he shrugged he was not dressed properly i thought perhaps he was not what he appeared to be taking that in i said may i see for myself but of course mademoiselle he escorted me up the stairs to the second floor and a room that overlooked the street it was simplea bed an elderly wardrobe a chair and a table that could be used for meals or as a desk the bed hadnt been turned down and even the counterpane was smooth no one had even sat down upon it i could see that for myself when did you last see my orderly i asked he took a room went up the stairs and in a moment had come back down again going out at once to follow me through the streets and then i went to bed mademoiselle yes of course i thanked the clerk and went down the stairs again thinking furiously what had become of captain barclay surely he hadnt been set upon in the streets after leaving me safely at the convent door was he lying hurt somewhere but id taken the same route from the hotel and back to it this morning i hadnt seen anything to arouse my suspicions outside once more i debated and then finally went to the nearest police station to ask if there had been any trouble in the area during the previous night my orderly was to meet me this morning hes missing i explained but there had been no trouble no arrests no calls for assistance the gendarme in charge assured me that it had been a quiet night they often are mademoiselle there is little money for drunkenness and even less to steal i nodded then asked where someone would be taken if he had been found injured on the street if he was english mademoiselle he would most likely be carried to the american base hospital yes of course once more i was back in the street this time on my way to the american base hospital in what used to be rouens handsome racetrack the orderly minding the gates was yawning prodigiously as he stretched as if it were past time for him to be relieved i asked him if an american or british or canadian soldier had been brought in during the night someone found injured on the street perhaps theres been a convoy of wounded sister but only nine men this journey all from sector aid stations no one else has been brought in since well before midnight then where had captain barclay got to i thanked him and went to find the officer in charge of the port he couldnt help me at first and then he spoke to his sergeant on the off chance there was any information that hadnt yet been officially reported the sergeant eyeing me with interest said there was an orderly who couldnt account for himself wandering the streets last night hes been taken up for desertion ive sent to the base hospital to ask if hes one of theirs and what we should do with him so far theres been no answer and thats been several hours taken up for i exclaimed it was the last thing that had crossed my mind could i see this man please its a military matter sister the officer told me politely he isnt the person youre looking for yes i understand about the military matter i said but i must also locate my missing orderly before i report to my own sector if you have him then i can explain why he isnt with me what was he doing in the streets of rouen then if hed come in with the wounded why didnt he say as much the officer was losing patience with me i dont know hed been hurt himself in a fight most likely the sergeant muttered we had athere was a spot of trouble bringing him in i stood there waiting finally the officer said all right sergeant brent take her to him if she does know him well have a name and then we can find out what hes running from i wanted to tell the major that this particular man was resisting arrest because he was to meet me in the morning at the hotel de lille but that would never do the sergeant led me through the maze of the port to the small square building where miscreants and deserters were held until their situation could be determined as i neared it the odor of urine stale spirits cigarette smoke and unwashed bodies struck me three of the men incarcerated here were the sergeant told me drunk and disorderly he asked me to wait outside and after a moment he brought out a reluctant captain barclay who blinked in the watery morning light and then recognized me there were new bruises and scrapes on his face but i read the message in his eyes quite clearly watch yourself i took a deep breath before i spoke whats to become of him sergeant his gaze never leaving the captains face he said with some satisfaction he doesnt have the proper papers to be in rouen desertion is a capital offense and so is spying and if you ask me he looks more like a blooda german officer than an orderly he doesnt even sound like an englishman yes well i expect thats because hes canadian hes an orderly one private barclay and dr hicks can vouch for him and who is dr hicks when hes at home the sergeant demanded turning to look at me i was suddenly grateful for the nuns care in cleaning my coat and cap the sergeant was prepared to think the worst i told him but it made no difference dr hicks wasnt here and he wasnt likely to leave his post to come here and identify this man much less explain why he had no pass we were getting nowhere i said very well take me back to the major hell have to deal with this matter turning on my heel i started back the way id come and the sergeant was hardpressed to usher captain barclay into his cell and still catch me up before i reached the major i said as i was summoned to his presence the man you have in custody is one private barclay a canadian if you will contact colonel crawford through the war office you will be told why private barclay is in rouen sister crawford any relation to this colonel he asked dubious thats not the issue here please contact the colonel immediately its urgent business and he will not care to have this man in your custody any longer than absolutely necessary how is it that you know so much about this matter i said showing my exasperation i was asked to provide a reason for private barclay to pay a brief visit to rouen he was the driver who accompanied me when i was transferring patients from the forward aid station to the base hospital here he didnt believe me but i thought perhaps he was just curious enough about what was going on to contact london the major said his voice sour and if thats the case why wasnt a pass provided you must ask colonel crawford the answer to that i expect there was no time to see to it why rouen and why werent we told im not colonel crawford major you must ask him im overdue at my own post and must make arrangements to return i wish you a good morning before the major could think of a reason to detain me as well i left his untidy office and walked away from the port with some misgivings and what was i to do now i was hungry and it was starting to rain i had no papers assigning me to transport to england and i wasnt likely to be given them by this officer i still had no way to reach my father my best hope was that the major would indeed contact him and once the colonel sahib heard that captain barclay was in difficulty he would assume that i needed help as well the only thing left to me then was to go to the base hospital beg paper and pen and then haunt the port until i found a naval officer i knew by sight with a smile and some excuse such as not having had time to write before this it might be possible to persuade him to carry my letter to portsmouth and post it there the american nurse in charge this morning looked askance at me when i was ushered into her tidy office the small board on her desk identified her as nurse bailey sister crawford what can i do for you my transport back to the aid station hasnt come i said pleasantly is there somewhere i could sit and write letters they will reach england sooner if i can hand them to someone at the port i could see that she was of two minds about offering me space she was new to me a small woman with light brown hair and a thin scar on her cheek pursing her lips she considered me the convoy back to your sector has already left she told me primly you came in with wounded i think i was just going off duty i held on to my patience ive been posted to passchendaele ypres i was to meet someone here to transfer me to that sector but he hasnt come on the contrary he was here looking for you at six oclock this morning she lifted a sheet of paper from a basket to one side of her desk and read what someone had written there driver arrived for one sister crawford he was informed that she was not staying with us and he left no message indeed i said repressing the urge to look over my shoulder who took that down may i ask nurse saunders i believe she would have been on duty would it be possible to speak to her its rather important it is not possible what are we to do with you sister crawford it would seemand i must say your appearance rather bears it outthat you have mislaid your driver rather than the other way around i lost my temper it had been a long night id had a fright dealt with the recalcitrant port authorities trying to release captain barclay and now this woman was treating me as if i had spent the night carousing and found myself too late for my transport id only come here for pen paper and an opportunity to write to my father i said coldly if you care to look into my movements i suggest you send someone to the convent where i spent the night the nuns there will be happy to confirm that i chose to stay with them rather than go to an hotel as a woman alone now will you allow me to write my letters or not i think not sister she reached for paper and took up her pen after a moment she considered what she had written and then said your nursing service has very high standards sister crawford i am sending you to england for proper disciplining one of our orderlies will escort you to the port see you aboard the first available ship bound for portsmouth and hand this letter to the first officer to be delivered to the proper authority as soon as you land at your destination do i make myself clear she was reaching for an envelope as she spoke inserting the letter into it and sealing it i had to bite my tongue at the reprimand i was getting what i wanted actually an opportunity to sail to england straightaway once there i could deal with these charges easily enough and i could reach my father by telephone when i had landed and set captain barclay free even sooner than id expected and then i had a brilliant notion i said in as petulant a tone as i could muster its not fair that i have to be sent home what about the orderly who got me into this trouble the port authority is holding him but is he being sent home in disgrace i think not you are a woman nurse bailey do you think it right that he escapes scotfree hes in the army medical services just as i am because hes a man should his dereliction of duty be seen in a lesser light than mine i watched her eyes they narrowed as i was finishing i have no authority over the port officials the major there would most likely honor any request coming from the american base hospital she was tempted at the very least you could try i pleaded hes quite handsome barclay is i tried to withstand his advances thats why i went to the convent but he followed me from the hotel de lille thank god he was stopped and asked for his papers i dont know what he would have done she considered me for a moment eyes narrowing again finally she rose from behind the desk asked the direction of the convent ordered me not to leave the room and for good measure locked the door behind her as she went out i sat there fuming for over an hour had she believed any part of my story or had i only succeeded in ruining my own reputation for no purpose time was passing and i was locked in here halfway through the long wait i felt a spurt of horror what if shed gone in search of my driver instead if he came here promised to deliver me to ypres as ordered would she feel that i had learned my lesson and remand me into his care surely not he had gone long before this when i finally heard the key turn in the lock i tried to make myself look frightened and contrite nurse bailey came in accompanied by a man dressed in the uniform of an orderly but he was older and i guessedcorrectly as it turned outthat he was in charge i was told that he would escort me to the ship waiting on the river even now and that he would deliver the letter nurse bailey had written to the first officer as she had intended from the start i didnt protest when he took my arm and led me out of the small room through the passages and out the gate of the hospital we walked together to the port i was escorted up the gangway and handed over to a young officer who looked at me as if i were carrying the plague disgust was writ large in his face and whatever hed been told hed believed every word of it i was conducted to the quarters of one of the officers and once more locked inside after a while i heard the sounds of the ship weighing anchor then moving with the tide as it prepared to follow the river to the sea id failed to get captain barclay freed but id be in portsmouth in a matter of hours my worry now was could i reach my father once i got there or was he off on one of his mysterious forays and out of touch for days on end what could mother do in his stead was simon even well enough to attend to this chapter ten it seemed to take longer than usual to reach the mouth of the river more often than not unless i was assigned to duty with the wounded belowdecks i stood at the rail watching our passage downstream instead here in this stuffy little cabin i tried to picture it in my mind as a distraction finally i could feel the swells as we left the river behind and met the channel that much closer to england somewhere in the narrow ships passage outside my door i heard someone begin to retch and then the sound of feet rushing toward the companionway i was a good sailor and i stood at the porthole the lamp behind me turned off and looked out at gray water meeting a gray sky there was always a chance that we would encounter a german sub and if the weather was good the chances were doubled but from my vantage point there could have been half a hundred out there and id have no way of guessing with a sigh i closed the black curtains and sat down not in the mood to relight the lamp i was tired enough to sleep but tempting as the bunk was i wanted to stay alert if i could id just stifled a yawn when i heard the click of the key in the lock and my door opened a very little i reached for the lamp lit it and stood there waiting in its pool of light a familiar face peered around the edge i recognized an officer i had sailed with before on a number of occasions you arent about to throw the inkwell at me are you captain garrison asked with a grin i promise i said and he stepped into the tiny cabin i was just informed you were on board locked away like a common miscreant what happened sister crawford its a long story i told him wryly but ive transgressed im told and im being shipped home in disgrace to face my hour of judgment he laughed outright good god bess did you take a shot at the first lord of the admiralty nothing so grand i was accused of fraternizing with an orderly and in consequence missing my transport to ypres my hand went of its own accord to my pocket what if id been searched and simons little handgun had been discovered i dont believe it hang onis that the other felon we have in irons belowdecks unless hes an american i wouldnt know yes he must be he told one of my men that his ancestors had shown us a thing or two at yorktown and he was ready to have another go at it himself it was my turn to laugh but what was i to tell captain garrison i decided on the truth well part of it we were both assigned to ypres but something went wrong with our transport and i spent the night in a convent i knew of in rouen on his way back to the hotel where he was staying barclay was picked up for not having the proper papers i tried to explain the situation to the harbor police with no luck and when i went to the base hospital in the hope of finding pen and paper to write to my father a nurse there decided i looked disreputable enough to have been up to something nefarious and she sent me back to england i begged her to let my betrayer be punished as well and i expect thats why hes in irons below you were deucedly lucky this was my ship there are letters in my safe that must be meant for the inquisition i was told under pain of death not to open them but to hand them over along with you when i reached portsmouth yes well i do understand in part theres always the fear of spies in a place like rouen youve got people coming and going in every direction speaking i dont know how many languages and there are warnings everywhere to report any suspicious activity i doubt nurse bailey has been in france very long she put the worst possible interpretation on the situation id have done the same in her shoes no you wouldnt have he said youd have got to the bottom of it wait here i ought to let your american out of the brig before he thinks of a way to scuttle the ship ive enough on my hands with the germans with that he was gone and it was some time before he reappeared ive offered barclay my cabin to clean himself up a bit he was all right once he knew you were safe i need to go to the bridge and keep an eye on things he reached into his pocket and took out two letters ill leave these with you he hesitated barclay strikes me more as an officer than an orderly he is he was so eager to get back to france he was willing to take any position available i think his doctor back in somerset was trying to teach him a lesson that his wounds havent healed sufficiently to return to his regiment a little humble pie as it were nodding he went on his way i folded my arms on the makeshift desk put my head down on my arms and went to sleep id consider what to do once we approached portsmouth roads i must have slept soundly it was the rumble of the anchor cable feeding out that brought me awake startled and confused i tried to make myself presentable and settled my cap on my hair my valise was by the cabin door but i stayed where i was it was one thing to be treated as a guest by captain garrison and quite another to appear on deck prematurely and place him in an awkward situation i could hear the wounded being carried off the ship and then the tramp of many feet as the next contingent of troops came aboard finally there was a tap at my door and captain garrison was there all clear he told me i think its safe enough to go ashore there was no welcoming committee out there and my officers wont talk ive procured passes out of the port for you as well im afraid after that my authority stops youve been more than kind i told him warmly i dont know how to thank you for all youve done he brushed that aside ill look forward to seeing you on another voyage this time not under duress we walked together to the deck where i saw barclay looking far more himself now waiting for me without a word we disembarked and made our way along the docks to the gates the captain was several steps behind me as was proper but once we were in the town itself he caught me up do you know everyone in christendom bess crawford he asked a repressed note of disapproval in his voice you forget i said since britannic i must have made the journey to france and back half a hundred times it would be strange if i didnt know most of the ships officers which makes it all the worse when they go missing the first officer is new replacing a man who lost his leg during the winter and the third officer is new as well his ship was sunk on convoy duty and hes learning the run to france i broke off watching a motorcar coming toward us i stopped stockstill as i recognized it what is it captain barclay asked tensing but by that time it was near enough for him to recognize the driver my father as he greeted us i asked how did you know i was coming in i was having dinner with the port captain when you arrived captain garrison sent a signal he didnt specify my daughter was on board but he did say wounded and nurses not sisters and a signal never includes hospital staffits assumed theyre aboard with the wounded i thought i ought to have a look but we hadnt finished our port and mackenzie insisted that i stay until it had been round once then he turned to greet captain barclay making no remark about the torn uniform or the scrapes and cuts on his face not to mention his knuckles thank you for bringing her home safely he said captain barclay grimaced not without difficulty the colonel sahib ushered us into the motorcar and we said very little as we drove through the narrow twisting streets toward the main road north through hampshire clear of the city we picked up the first showers of rain my father settled to a steady speed and then nodded to me to begin my account of events interrupted from time to time by the captain as i spoke he listened with a grim expression clearly visible even in the cloudy darkness good god he said when i had given him all the details ill see what i can do to set this business to rights i think it might be best if barclay the orderly simply disappeared and captain barclay returned to the clinic for further treatment of his troublesome wound after his brief furlough to london captain barclay opened his mouth to argue thought better of it and said only thank you sir im afraid my reputation cant be repaired quite so easily i said ruefully perhaps nurse bailey can be thanked for helping you smuggle one of our spies safely out of france and back into england i think i said considering the suggestion she might be happier if i had helped capture a notorious german spy god help us if that got back to the wrong ears no well offer our sincerest gratitude to both of you for unspecified services to the crown i wanted to ask the colonel sahib if he thought i was safe now but i was reluctant to broach the subject so soon and how was i to get back to france until this whole business was settled it was a dilemma as the rain turned into a downpour shortly after wed crossed into somerset we stopped briefly for a late supper until it blew over my father had said nothing about simon and i had been afraid to ask for fear he was not healing as he should it was one of the drawbacks to being a nurse i knew too much about wounds and a mans chances of survival finally i took my courage in my hands and said is simon all right a deucedly poor patient your mother has had her hands full and that was all he would say the conversation turned to major carson and i asked my father if hed ever met william morton actually i havent he and sabrina eloped and after that her father never spoke to her again i thought that rather harsh it left her with nowhere to turn in the event she was ever unhappy and so as far as i know she has stayed with her actor a pity i took a deep breath julia told me that in one of his last letters her husband was angry with someone in his company but didnt mention a name because of the censors but soon afterward the offending soldier was sent to another sector do you think that soldier could have been william morton its a pity we dont have the journal the major kept it might give us some answers captain barclay interrupted who is william morton my father said he married the majors younger sister the family didnt approve of him it would be interesting to see what sort of war hes had he could have lured the major to that false rendezvous but why wait all these years i asked a good point still theres no accounting for a longharbored anger it can spill over unexpectedly my father said which reminds me julia told me when i visited her that sabrina didnt come to the memorial service that she was poor again her words she cant live as shes used to on a private soldiers pay my father agreed there could have been an argument over settling an allowance on her but how would the major have felt about that i know he was closer to his other sister but surely he didnt carry on his fathers feeling that she made her choice and must live with it he never discussed it with me my father said as the chargers of food were set before us shortages or not it smelled heavenly and we set to with an appetite and of course by rights he shouldnt have it was a family matter julia might know i said doubtfully finishing the ham and turning to the last of the roasted potatoes on my plate but the same difficulty applies could you speak to the majors solicitors id rather not make it quite so official theres the other sister valerie you could call on her she might be able to shed some light on sabrinas situation and her brothers handling of it she lives in gloucestershire not all that far away i dont know her as well as i do julia i reminded him i shall need a better reason than to offer my condolences at this late date your mother will think of something captain barclay said casually i shall be glad to accompany sister crawford sir if you like i can drive myself if you remember i told him we finished our tea and then set out once more the rain had stopped and after a while the moon followed us up the drive to the house two mornings laterstill encumbered with captain barclay but armed with an excuse provided by my motherwe set out for gloucestershire valerie and her husband lived on the outskirts of gloucester within sight of the castle she had married a man in banking who now served with the navy she received me cordially and i gave her a set of embroidered baby clothes with a cap and a matching pram coverlet done up in lilac and palest green for she was expecting a child in three months time julia hadnt mentioned it and when i said as much valerie said i expect she was wishing she also had a child on the way but how kind of your mother to remember i shall write to her at once but you must tell her i shall treasure this gift i shall does sabrina have any children i dont remember a little boy the most adorable child i went to see her in oxfordshire this winter as soon as i heard the news our old nanny wrote to me did you tell julia or the major i wrote to vincent i dont know if he ever received the letter he didnt answer but they do get lost dont they letters to the front yes sadly i answered i cant believe hes dead its just not possible and it makes me anxious for george now hes at sea you know we dont hear his mother and i for weeks on end when theyre at sea theres nowhere to post a letter i said and she smiled i never thought of it that way sabrina eloped didnt she yes our father had forbade her to see william again i wished at the time that id had the courage to attend the ceremony but i was rather afraid of what my father might do or say did she ever send you any photographs of the happy couple she frowned i never liked to display them i didnt want to annoy my father id like to see them i dont believe ive seen sabrina since vincent left sandhurst im really not up to searching for them another time perhaps is he dark or fair william my mother thought shed seen him in a play once molière or sheridan perhaps it was so hard to tell they werent very good photographs im afraid and she pointedly changed the subject clearly not interested in her sisters husband we talked about her pregnancy and her garden and then it was time to take my leave when i met captain barclay in the pub where id left him his first question was did you learn anything only that she doesnt wish to talk about her sisters husband i said when wed reached the motorcar not surprising but her sister has a child a little boy born sometime in the winter captain barclay whistled softly this man morton might not have fought for his wife but he would for his child wouldnt he and hed have been furious with his brotherinlaw for snubbing him it must have seemed rather callous i should think to be met with a refusal to do anything for his family defending major carson i said we dont know that he did do we its possible that william morton wasnt satisfied with his offer thats true captain barclay replied thoughtfully and theres only one way to settle thatif your father is successful in discovering any provisions in the majors will if hes taken care of the wife or the childor boththen morton is out of the running i did ask valerie if she had a photograph of her brotherinlaw but shes feeling her pregnancy and wasnt particularly interested in making the effort to find one she didnt seem to think any of them were very good anyway what about the mans old theatrical company did they have posters and the like as you said in rouen eyes never change i dont know if they still exist or how to contact them sabrina might have something of that sort or a photograph of her husband in uniform every wife wants one in case in case he agreed a silence fell and i found myself thinking about simon again all the way home when i told my parents about sabrinas child they were surprised no one had mentioned the boy to them they were of the same mind that if major carson had been murdered his brotherinlaw could have the best possible motive my father said its not like vincent to be as vindictive as his father was i dont understand it ill look into the will i can be quite frank i think and ask the solicitors if the boy was provided for if not i can suggest that julia might care to make amends im not sure she will i said considering my conversation with julia she doesnt seem to be as fond of sabrina as valerie is i wish id thought to ask valerie about the will she must have been there for the reading hardly something you could bring up without a very sound reason my mother said but getting back to what happened to vincent its possible that william morton chose to badger him after the baby was born and he wouldnt have cared for that even if hed already included his sister in his own will he would have resented being pressed that way and so the two of them quarreled and morton went away with the worst possible view of vincents intentions morton was worried about his family and vincent had more than enough on his mind keeping his men alive they didnt like each other to begin with this could only have made matters between them even more tense she has a point captain barclay put in with a big push coming morton would have been anxious to know the matter was settled either oneor bothcould have died one of my men asked for leave to see his widowed mother he wanted me to sign the request before we fought i did but he was killed in the second wave i must go up to london tomorrow my father said ill see what i can discover simon hadnt been in the house much to my surprise whats more my mother had put me off when i had asked to go and visit him in his cottage she was also rather vague about his condition and so when my father took the captain off to the clinic the next morning and my mother went to see a woman who had lost her husband at passchendaele i slipped out of the house and walked through the back garden and the wood to simons cottage it was small but comfortable and it had suited him well filled with wellread books and memorabilia from his years in the army it had a masculine air that id always found pleasant coming up the walk i kept an eye to the windows expecting him to see me approaching and pretend not to be at home my mother was right men were often not very good at waiting to heal impatient and eager to be about their business again and i suspected that he probably wouldnt be pleased to have me know he had not taken as good care of himself as he should i tapped at the door waiting to be admitted but he didnt answer the summons or come to the door i tapped again in case he was sleeping and when he still didnt open the door to me i was angry enough to open it myself and standing on the threshold i called his name theres no use in hiding i added i know youre here but my voice echoed in the cottage and i knew it must be empty simon wasnt there disbelieving i walked in and searched the bed was made up there were no newspapers neatly stacked by the table where he ate his meals and when i looked in the wardrobe i saw that his valise was gone frightened i went out of the cottage and shut the door behind me before almost running back to the house when my mother came in an hour later i was waiting for her where is simon i asked hes not here and hes not in the cottage what is it youre keeping from me she set down her basket her expression suddenly kind and i had the most dreadful premonition i wanted to cover my ears or tell her not to answer my question but she was already saying the words and there was no way to stop them now chapter eleven my dear hes been very ill i was there when he was brought in i know how serious his wound was i thoughti was told you were nursing him i took that to mean that he was here or at the cottage he did come here when he was well enough he signed himself out of hospital and a driver brought him to somerset but there was infection you see and his armwe thought for a time he would lose it dr gaines cleaned it as best he could but simon is still running a fever he doesnt always remember where he is dr gaines then simon is at the clinic yes but he specifically askedi wasnt to tell you why did he sign himself out of hospital he knew the risk hed be taking there was some pressing matter he had to deal with he came here to use your fathers telephone he didnt have access to one in portsmouth too many ears he said i remembered his urgent need to reach england and how i had given him morphine to keep him quiet biting my lip i considered all the possible outcomes of gangrene im going to longleigh house bess is that such a good idea simon im a nurse mother i am very good at what i do as dr gaines himself told me i could be able to help can father pull a few strings i need an interim posting there while my situation is being considered i cant walk in and ask to be allowed to help with a single surgical case yes im sure he can see to that if not then im sure dr gaines will be able to arrange it she started toward the telephone closet then stopped if its any consolation i think youre doing the right thing simon made me promise you see and i dont break promises to simon brandon lightly she turned on her heel and left me standing there several hours and countless telephone conversations later i was told to report to the clinic on wednesday morning at nine that was two days away i didnt know how i was to keep myself from pacing the floor into the night i found my mother in the kitchen scrubbing the tabletop while our cook stood there frowning at her tightlipped and clearly troubled i said were going to find sabrina morton i dont know how well manage it but we will her face brightened i believe your father left her direction on his desk he hadnt decided to give it to you why not i think he was worried about this business with major carson that you might discover something speaking to her that would take you back to france darling simon is fighting for his life and that nice captain barclay has reinjured his leg your father is looking for some way to keep you safe until then he wants you to stay in england i remembered that arm around my neck in the darkness as i was about to wash my face and the way the wing of that motorcar brushed against me in rouen but i said resolutely i dont need protection dr hicks and his people were keeping an eye on me they would again you might not be posted there next time and your father has learned that you werent expected in ypres at all once you left the security of dr hickss aid station you were vulnerable and you said yourself that he believed the message was completely genuine he could be wrong another time as well dr hicks had done his best for me but he was overworked and exhausted like the rest of us he couldnt be expected to ward off every danger then lets go speak to sabrina she cant do me any harm and we just might learn something that would put an end to this frightful business and so it was that we found ourselves on the road to cornwall id thought that sabrina lived in oxfordshire but my father didnt often make mistakes and if he said cornwall then cornwall it was because of the distance we had planned to stay the night we drove through devon crossed the tamar and set out across cornwall to the seaside village of fowey which actually sat above the river for which it was named taking a room at the fowey hotel we had dinner there on the charming terrace overlooking the estuary where the river met the sea afterward as the evening was fine we walked down toward the harbor unlike other harbor towns fowey had very little flat land along the riverbank for a settlement to grow and so it was built upward a maze of gardens and paths and houses and cottages cheek by jowl and leading ever downward until we reached st fimbarrus church and from there it was only a few steps to the water the clerk at the hotel had told us that the mermaid inn was along the water and more accessible by boat than by foot but we strolled along the river for a bit and watched the ferry plow toward polruan across the way and then saw the sign for the mermaid a narrow walkway bridged the gap from the small restaurant where we stood to the entrance to the inn and led up steep stairs to the doorway from there i could see just below where boats could tie up the inn had seen better days thanks to the war and the fact that many of the men who brought their own boats or yachts to this place were now fighting in france there was a woman behind the desk who watched our approach without enthusiasm as if she knew we werent looking for lodgings i moved slightly ahead of my mother and said pleasantly i believe mrs william morton lives here and who would be wanting her the woman asked her voice neither friendly nor unwelcoming my mother just behind me answered the query mrs crawford and her daughter sister crawford we knew her brother and her parents since we were in cornwall while my daughter is on leave from her duties in france we felt we ought to pay our respects the woman regarded us for a moment then said ill see if she wishes to receive you i thought at first the woman was being rude but she walked into the dimly lit interior of the inn where i could just see a staircase leading upward and to one side a tiny dining room down two steps a potted palm stood next to the entrance to the dining room and a table with fresh flowers in a green vase added a spot of color by the side of the stairs nice touches but even these couldnt eliminate the depressing air of the inn the woman returned shortly shes in room seven just knock at the door we thanked her and walked farther into reception before taking ourselves up the stairs to the first floor number seven was at the end of the passage and we knocked lightly as wed been told my mother gave me a conspiratorial look then faced the door as it opened sabrina morton had always been the prettier of the two carson sisters but in the late evening light she appeared to be the elder of the two rather than the younger come in she said inviting us into a room looking upriver and set out as a sitting room a door into a second room was open just a little and inside we could see a bed and a crib i cant think why you should wish to call on me did valerie send you or was it julia having a sudden change of heart neither as it happens my mother said you werent at the memorial service for your brother and we were sorry to have missed that opportunity to offer our condolences you were fond of vincent as i remember once upon a time she said yes my mother replied as if sabrina had agreed with her then turned to me i think you remember elizabeth shes a nursing sister vincent may have mentioned it shes currently on leave from france and as we had a few days before she goes back we decided to visit cornwall again i remember coming to fowey as a small child its hardly changed at all has it sabrina greeted me coolly then offered us chairs i cant offer you tea as well im afraid the restaurant has closed thank you but we dined at our hotel i answered resigning myself to a difficult conversation its good to see you again sabrina is it i dont recall a visit from you after my marriage you hadnt invited us to the wedding my mother reminded her with a smile we thought perhaps youd excluded us when you excluded your brother he was a hypocrite vincent brother or not he could have made our lives a little easier after our father died by offering me my inheritance he kept it instead you know my sister was given our mothers inheritance as wellas the elder daughter that was fair enough i didnt quarrel with it but it was cruel to deny me anything i cant forgive him for that and i couldnt in good conscience go to his service when i felt as i do he knew what his father thought about your marriage perhaps he found it difficult to go against his express wishes he chose to do that he didnt like will any better than our father did and what had will ever done to my brother or even my father for that matter he married me because he loved me and i loved him my father married for love vincent as well wheres the difference the bitterness in her voice touched me there was no polite way to point out that her choice of husband however much she loved him had not been quite the same as vincents marriage to julia or valeries to her banker they had come from the same circle while william morton had definitely not i never met will i said do you have a photograph of him i should like to see it we could never afford to have a family likeness taken she told me bluntly even when he was leaving for france a pity for your sake and your sons my mother said gently we came sabrina because we remembered you as a child what your father and your brother decided to do is not our fault i thought then that sabrina was going to cry but she lifted her head and said youll go home and tell valerie what ive come down to living with wills cousin in this inn that struggles to keep itself afloat financially on a private soldiers pay i couldnt contribute much to my keep but i do what i can to help constance she put out her hands red and rough from a servants work tell them about these too i have no intention of telling julia or valerie anything my mother retorted if they wish to know where or how you live then let them come and see for themselves there was a whimper from the bedroom sabrina said my son ive just put him to bed hes begun to crawl and i live in dread that hell fall into the river when im not looking but i have nowhere else to go it was selfpity but as the lower doors to the inn must lead directly to that tiny docking area where the usual house would have a porch such a tragedy could happen nowhere else but what of wills family my mother asked wills father and brothers live in the welsh marches near hayonwye they offered me a home but i couldnt accept they were no happier than my own family when i married will if i must live on charity i prefer to be here the whimper settled into a sleepy grumble and then there was silence thinking to change the subject i said how long have you lived here in fowey since just after boxing day where we lived in woodstock the owner of the cottage refused to give us any more credit she kept most of our belongings as well except for the cradle i wouldnt let her take that it was wills when he was a baby im sorry i said i didnt mean to bring up a painful subject you couldnt have known she took a deep breath my father would tell you that i have made my bed and should lie on it without complaint it would be easier if i didnt have a child i could find work with so many men gone to fight the kaiser i could support myself but i dont want to leave him hes all i have now and i would rather accept charity than put him in the care of strangers or leave him with constance because shes too busy keeping the inn from going under to watch him i repeated unwilling to believe my ears all you have an actor is paid to act not to fight the germans she turned to look out the window the port wasnt visible from here it was upriver where the ships that once carried clay and other goods docked do you know id been so afraid will might contract influenza i wasnt prepared after all this time for the telegram reporting hed been killed it seemed so terribly unfair somehow as if god had spared him the sickness because he was destined to die in battle the unshed tears fell now and she let them fall my mother took out a handkerchief and handed it to sabrina she murmured her gratitude as she took it youre a widow i asked but he died two weeks before vincent did ill always wonder if my brother killed my husband they say this sometimes happens that scores are settled on the battlefield if this is true then god avenged will and someone shot vincent she broke down then and there was no comfort we could offer i was still shocked by what shed told us after a moment she said please go please we took our leave and my mother embraced sabrina she resisted at first and then flung her arms around her we were back in the passage when i thought of something it didnt really matter now but still i felt i should ask if only to settle a point i stepped back into the room sabrina id like to know what color were your husbands eyes her voice was almost inaudible blue palest blue like ice except when he smiled for me why what does it matter i was hoping perhaps your son had inherited them to keep wills memory alive she smiled through her tears he has i thanked her and rejoined my mother we reached the stairs and went down them constance was no longer there in reception my mother said see if you can find an envelope or something in the desk over there bess dear id like to leave a little gift for the child i did searching through the stationery before finding a fresh one but as i handed it to my mother something fell on the floor and i retrieved it to replace it amongst the other papers in an untidy stack and then i realized that the envelope on top was postmarked from france and i opened it telling myself that it was not snooping but it was it was the letter from william mortons commanding officer telling mortons widow how her husband had diedgallantly and without pain at the end his mind on his wife and child not his fate that he had fought well for king and country and inspired his fellow soldiers with his courage a standard letter meant to make the grieving family feel that their sacrifice was not in vain that their son or husband or brother had died as a man should with courage and dignity no mention of the reality of dying in a filthy trench or alone somewhere in no mans land the rotting corpse brought in during the next collection of the dead and wounded no mention of his fellow soldiers stoically watching as he took his last breaths or the orderlies racing to find and stanch the bleeding the nursing sister shaking her head accepting that he had died on the way to the aid station none of the panic the screams the blood the despair only comfort i looked at the signature expecting to see colonel prescotts name there but a colonel wouldnt write a letter for a dying soldier his captain would and this was duly signed by a captain forester who may have been kinder because he knew morton by sight and could even speak with some familiarity about how he had served i set the letter back in its envelope and put it in among the papers then realized that the other sheets i held in my hands were copies of correspondence to a dozen or more charitable organizations for widows and orphans begging for assistance sitting here at reception sabrina had filled the empty hours writing these swallowing her pride for her sons sake i could understand now how deep her feelings went against her brother for denying her what she felt was hers by right her family had failed her and it appeared that these organizations overwhelmed by similar requests were finding it hard to spread their funds thin enough to help everyone sabrina had come a long way from the happy child racing through the orchard with her sister at her heels the first week after wed come home from india long curls flying out of their ribbons no inkling of the future in store i put the papers back together as carefully as i could so that sabrina wouldnt have the added shame of realizing that we had seen them better by far to accept my mothers gift for the child as it was meant rather than wonder if it had been given out of pity rather than love the light still danced in the current as the river made its way to the sea but the color had changed to gold as the sun cast long rays across the estuary upriver the shadows were already deep where the trees crowded down to the banks and shut off our view of the port we stood there for a moment looking down at the fortifications at the rivers mouth they too were gold flecked and i thought how lovely this setting was and how much sorrow it encompassed my mother said as we started back the way wed come well i sighed it wasnt will morton was it that letter from captain forester looked all too official and there was the telegram as well no it couldnt have been she agreed how awfully sad julia never mentioned that sabrinas husband had been killed nor did valerie i expect she hasnt told them we shouldnt have come weve only upset her my mother said yes but were talking about murder arent we better us than the police or the army they wouldnt have been as kind and that was cold comfort as we walked back to the gray stone church and then found our way in the gathering dusk up the twisting path back to the hotel a small dog came out to a garden gate barking ferociously then jumping up to be greeted his tail wagging madly as i petted the furry head scratching behind his ears i thought about the child growing up on the river would he ever have a dog i couldnt understand how the young officer id known in india could have denied his widowed sister some financial help but then he himself had died only a short time after his brotherinlaw there had been no chance to do anything still he must surely have known about the child and guessed what sabrinas circumstances must be he could have written to julia to make his wishes known she would have carried them out if he had she would have done anything hed asked even a small allowance would have made a huge difference in oxfordshire and she could have kept the cottage for that matter valeriewith her inheritance from her mother as well as her fatherwho had visited sabrina and must have seen the straits she was in with a new baby could have done something to help i commented on this to my mother as we walked on i expect everyone felt it was the morton family who ought to step in since sabrinas family had cut her off and they did offer sabrina a home didnt they perhaps julia will have a change of heart once the solicitors have finished and vincents estate is settled ill drop a word in her ear without mentioning cornwall she has no child of her own and she may be willing to consider the boys needs but the boy was a morton not a carson would that make any difference as we reached the last few steps of the path up to our hotel my mother took a deep breath and said who killed vincent id have answered someone in his company who knew morton and thought he and his family had been badly treatedif it werent for the fact that vincent wasnt shot and that his body was discovered some distance from the front simple revenge isnt that personal or clever i had no answer for her im very glad youre home and safe she went on putting an arm around my shoulders and drawing me to her in a brief embrace as we reached the tall white doors of the hotel later i stood by the window of my room watching the lights of boats plying the river they couldnt go beyond the fortifications for the sea was probably mined or a submarine might be lurking in the black depths farther out as they bobbed about far below on their mysterious errands fishing or simply longing for another time i asked myself the questions id put off until id said good night to my mother if it hadnt been will morton who killed vincent carson and private wilson or had twice tried to kill me then who was it if it wasnt revenge for his treatment of his sister that had brought about major carsons murder and all that had followed what was driving this man there had to be a reason but would any of us be able to find it chapter twelve when i arrived at the clinic there were courtesies to observe before i could go and look for simon brandon first the official visit with matron to present my orders she remembered me and we talked about france for a few minutes and then she passed me to dr gaines he welcomed me just as warmly and sent for tea ive just made rounds i could use a cup he said offering me the only other chair in his narrow office tell me about france i tried to remember interesting surgeries or treatments id observed because i knew that was what he wanted to hear not how the war was progressing the wounded in his care told their own tale of what was happening in the trenches and then sister masters was there to show me to my quarters and outline my duties once more with my experience id be serving in the surgical theater when needed it was after eleven oclock by that time and she suggested that i meet the rest of the staff at lunch some of them had been here when i first came to the clinic and others were new as before the staff was handpicked by dr gaines and we enjoyed a lively discussion about the patients and what id been doing in france half my mind was elsewhere but i managed to hold my own from long practice we were just finishing our meal when mercifully sister masters suggested that i take the next half hour to settle in i rose from the table took my leave of the others as i thanked her and went up the main stairs id done this so often that it took no more than five minutes to unpack and stow my belongings where i could reach them quickly when needed my mother had seen to it that my uniforms were starched and ready to wear and i was grateful and then i sat on the bed and stared at nothing for another several minutes finally i got to my feet and walked out of my room now that the time had come i was almost afraid of what i was going to find when i left this sanctuary and walked down to the wards but it had to be done i went down the steps counting them as id done so many times during my routine duties the count always helping me put one patient out of my mind and prepare me to address the next as i passed the doorway to the room where convalescents sat to read play cards or talk i glimpsed captain barclay at a table writing what appeared to be a letter fortunately he didnt look up i had only a very little time in which to find simon and i didnt want to call attention to what i was about to do simon id been told was in the surgical ward in the back of the house where the library used to be most of the books had been removed for safekeeping although a few volumes were left amidst the medical kit filling the shelves now as i entered i could feel the warmth of the sun on my face from the long windows that overlooked one of the gardens a slight breeze lifted the thin curtains and blew lightly against my cap the sister on duty smiled and nodded to me she believed i was there to familiarize myself with all the patients and i let her take a moment to describe the conditions of her charges but at this present moment i was concerned most about just one i tried to quell my impatience as we began to pace slowly down the row of cots stopping to look at both sides there were men in various stages of recovery some of them asleep others moaning in a druginduced unconsciousness one or two were barely awake watching us as we stopped their faces pain ridden and thin i was two beds from the end of the room when i heard a rapidfire outburst of familiar words sister randolph was in the middle of a description about the man in front of us and i lost track for a moment she had to repeat her comment and i nodded finally we had come to simons cot he was still speaking rapidly urgently as if something mattered intensely in his drugclouded mind we cant understand him half the time sister randolph was saying its some foreign tongue im told one of our convalescents was in india for a number of years with his regiment he didnt know enough of the language to translate but he said he thought it was hindu hindi i said automatically hindi is the language hinduism the religion a hindu is the man or the woman but it wasnt hindi that simon was speaking just now it was urdu the muslim equivalent i went to his bedside someone had shaved him this morning but his face was flushed with fever his hair long and soaked with perspiration but mercifully i could see both arms under the bedclothes there had been no amputation i was in india i said let me sit with him a bit and see if i can decipher what hes saying please do sister randolph said gratefully its very worrying not to know whats on his mind i can tell that something is and it may be hindering his recovery she referred to her chart his name is brandon we dont know much else about him regiment that sort of thing dr gaines admitted him as an emergency patient whats his status if the fever breaks dr gaines expects hell keep his arm if it doesnt well there will have to be steps taken she lifted the sheet and i could see how swollen and inflamed simons shoulder and arm were weve kept the wound clean weve fed him to keep up his strength but its a matter of time ive grown rather fond of him and i would hate to see him back in surgery but im afraid she let her voice dwindle as if not wishing to speak the words such a strong handsome man a pity isnt it war and all this pain and suffering yes i brought a chair over and sat down simon was restless and he still spoke in staccato sentences i listened for a while accustoming my ears to the sound of his voice and words i hadnt spoken except to my family for some years but it came back to me surprisingly quickly simon was on patrol that much i gathered from the names he mentioned they had been ambushed in the hills above the khyber pass and he was trying to keep his men alive until a rescue column arrived hed sent a heliograph message to a watcher some distance away on the indian side of the border and it was a matter of time before help got to them i heard simon say keep your head down man and then he swore theyve got a sniper up there somewhere i saw the muzzle flash hes damned good with that rifle it must be british not native to be that accurate and then someone must have said something to him for he replied i told the colonel sahib that i suspected one of those damned traveling musicians might be a spy but we couldnt prove it the switch to english was so unexpected that at first i couldnt follow it and then he was incoherent once more encouraging his men keeping them alive and finally going out himself to hunt down the unknown rifleman i remembered that engagement long past but when my father and a detachment of lancers went in search of the men who were pinned down my mother had sat on the veranda all evening waiting for news she had said nothing when the bloody remnants of the column came back but i heard my father issue the order for the man who played the tambourine to be found and brought to him i was never told what had happened to the spy it had been regimental business only and not for my ears or even my mothers glancing at my watch after sitting beside simon for several minutes i saw that i had to report for duty and i slipped away brushing his face with my fingertips as i did feeling the dry heat of high fever on his skin i told sister randolph as i left that the patient was reliving old engagements a result of his fever i thought and nothing that would hamper his recovery she smiled and thanked me again its such a relief to hear that perhaps since you understand what hes saying you could visit him from time to time in case anything changes i promised i would grateful to her for giving me a reason to sit with him for the next two days i spent as much time with simon as i could but there seemed to be no change in his condition and i found myself waking up in the night with a start thinking that he had died but he hadnt he held on as he so often did against impossible odds and on the third morning when i hurriedly downed my breakfast and ran up the back steps to spend a moment with him i found him awake dark eyes under dark brows stared back at me but i didnt think he knew me because he hadnt fully returned to awareness i reached down and touch his face again this time the skin was oily with the sweat of breaking fever but cool blessedly cool i was on the point of going to find sister randolph and asking her to bathe himin fact i had turned away to do just thatwhen his hand locked on my wrist and spun me around bess his voice was hoarse from fever and the constant barrage of words that had come bubbling up from the depths of illness is that you bess i looked down he was staring at me frowning as if he couldnt quite believe the evidence of his eyes then he blinked and said am i still in france noi mean its been a while youve been very ill your shoulderyou nearly lost your arm frowning he said did i telldid anyone tell the colonel what happened there in france that you were wounded i sat on the edge of his cot yes of course you even left the hospital but then the fever overtook you and the colonel sahib brought you here dear god he released my wrist and wiped a hand across his eyes bess get word to your father ive got to see him simon it can wait his mouth was tight as he said dont argue his eyes closed and he grimaced do it id been trained all my life to respond to that tone of voice one obeyed instantly doing as one was told without question in india safe as wed believed we were danger was everywhere and the memory of the bloody mutiny when the indian army turned on its english officers and their families and massacred all they could lay hands onsoldiers women childrenwas always present hesitation or delay could mean the difference between living and dying only this time i was ordered to reach my father at onceand only then could i see to it that dr gaines was alerted about the change in his patients condition i did as i was told urgently begging use of the clinics telephone putting through a call to my mother and seeing to it that word was passed to my father then i went in search of the doctor i found him watching captain barclay walk up and down the passage captain barclay smiled as he made his turn at the end of the passage and started back toward us look for yourselves that knee is as good as ever it was he saw me and his smile broadened sister crawford what do you think but dr gaines was still watching the way he moved youve most certainly improved he began then send me back to france for gods sake im needed there it was a familiar cry but dr gaines paid no heed he was still staring at the knee aware of my presence he said sister the patient in the surgical ward is awake sir brandon ah yes tell sister randolph ill be right there all right captain id like you to take the butchers paper out from around that limb and then walk up and down again i turned away but out of the corner of my eye i saw captain barclays fair skin flame with embarrassment it was an old trick the butchers stiff paper giving a little stability to a weak knee for a short distance only if you listened closely you could hear the layers rustle i went back to the library where sister randolph was bathing simons face and making him more comfortable before an orderly arrived to shave him again ive spoken to my mother i said quickly in hindi and he nodded i hurried back to my own duties i didnt know where my father was or how soon he could be reached i had done as i was asked and a little later i saw dr gaines coming from the library ward his face thoughtful as it happened my father arrived much sooner than he could possibly have in answer to my summons i thought perhaps dr gaines had sent for him as well there were no doubt standing orders in regard to the patient brandon that i knew nothing about it was not an hour before the evening meal when the colonel sahib came striding into the clinic tall handsome that air of command swirling in his wake i saw orderlies salute him and nurses smile at him i was at the top of the stairs and heard him ask for matron five minutes later i was summoned to her office to my surprise she wasnt there but i thought perhaps my father was trying to downplay any military reason for his presence in a clinic i said youve come to see simon ill take you to him hes been impossible to deal with waiting for you to come his eyebrows rose simon ive been very worried about him the reports from dr gaines have not been good is he awake ill speak to him shortly the fact is ive come to see you that surprised me even more indeed that nurse at the base hospital in rouen the one we were to distract with words of praise for doing her duty after shed given you so much trouble nurse bailey was she difficult to appease my heart sank as i had visions of having to explain france to my superiors in the nursing service i sent one of my men there to speak to her and he reported that she had left the hospital to attend a funeral that of nurse saunders didnt you tell me shed seen and spoken to your erstwhile driver she was found dead the morning after your departure chapter thirteen i stood there with my mouth open so completely taken aback that i couldnt think what to say the fact was id nearly forgot about the nurse who had tried to stop me from leaving france my father had told me he would deal with the matter and in our household that was that i could put it out of my mind i most certainly hadnt given a thought to nurse saunders whom i hadnt met but who had seen a killer facetoface and never realized she was in any danger it hadnt even occurred to me to warn her the note she had left for nurse baileyand of course for mehad simply stated that my driver had come but if questioned she would have known what sort of uniform he was wearing what rank he held what he looked like more to the point she could corroborate any description that matronor icould give shes dead i repeated slowly what happened she was lying at the side of the street after a convoy of lorries had passed on their way to the front it was just after dusk a horse had been startled broke away from its owner and charged madly down the hill toward the port as they were driving through when she was found it appeared that the horse had knocked her down shed left the base hospital and walked to a nearby shop where they sold small gifts for newborns apparently her sister had just given birth to her first child at any rate her skull had the clear imprint of a horses hoof around the ear her clothing was stained as if shed rolled after being struck no one saw the accident it was too dark dear god i said blankly my father had had time to absorb the news i could only think about that poor unsuspecting woman walking out of the base hospital on such a happy errand and instead walking straight into a vicious killer in the darkness with the horse running amok he could have struck her down with impunity and who would see it happen every eye would have been on that horse im sorry my friend looked into the matter bess my father said interrupting me i dont think it was the accident it appeared to be of course there was the wound on her face the imprint of a horses shoe and a horse had in fact run loose but my friend was told by one of the orderlies at the base hospital that the surgeon who examined the body was surprised that the blow hadnt gone deeper deep enough to kill yes but there was also the weight of the animal behind it you see and her skull wasnt crushed they decided it was a glancing blow but the surgeonfrom somewhere in minnesota i believewasnt buying it then a cast shoe was found just beyond where the body lay and our friend from minnesota was finally satisfied i thought about that there are hundreds of horses coming through rouen and dozens of horsedrawn carts a shoe could easily have been come by in the town quite however the french police ruled the death an accident and the base hospital didnt dispute it they could think of no possible reason why nurse saunders should be murdered very likely she was i agreed shed seen his face clearly whoever it was pretending to be my driver she could have helped us show that my driver was the same man as the colonel prescott who spoke to matron about sister burrows i thought that once i was out of france it would be over that there was no need to kill anyone else should someone speak to the french police and what about matron is she in any danger is there any way we can warn her no one in rouen has connected nurse saunders to you in any way and its best for now to leave it like that as for matron i think shes safe enough for one thing shes always surrounded by staff and patients for another you told me that she herself was rather suspicious of this colonel and if he sensed that at all hell stay clear of her for fear of making matters worse besides its entirely possible that he doesnt know youve spoken to her on the other hand if he saw nurse saunders on the street and discovered that youd been sent home in disgrace he could very well have considered that any investigation into your behavior in rouen would lead to a counterfeit driver with counterfeit orders and only nurse saunders had seen this man i hadnt thought of it from that direction i took a deep breath we only learned of nurse saunderss death because you took the trouble to allay any suspicions nurse bailey might have harbored we wouldnt have known otherwise its rather frightening to think that a woman ive never met was killed because of me i shivered at the thought but who is this man i asked he couldnt be william morton william morton died two weeks before captain carson didnt he yes ive looked into that theres no doubt of it but he had brothers and one could have taken it into his head to exact a little revenge i dont want you to return to france for the time being not until weve located all six of them revenge is one thing indiscriminate killing is another vincent carson is dead why isnt it finished thats why ive been as careful as may be about any inquiries i dont want to start a witch hunt until we have a better idea of whats going on the army is like scotland yard in one senseany investigation is by its very nature official and weve too little information much less proof to take that step i understand i said reluctantly still the sooner we could get to the bottom of this affair the sooner i could return to france one more thing ive spoke to the carsons solicitors there were no provisions in vincents will for his sister or her offspring but then the will was drawn up just before he left for france in the autumn of hed have had no reason to add such a bequest at that stage morton hadnt enlisted the war was expected to end by christmas sabrina was still in disgrace there was a letter from vincent to the solicitors after her child was born indicating an intention on his part to provide for her straightaway his solicitors drew up a proposal and sent it to france for his approval but he never returned it no one seems to know if the proposal was found with his personal effects according to the solicitors julia was unaware of it and so it was assumed that he must have changed his mind how sad i couldnt help but wish that julia had been sent her husbands journal there could be an entry in it that would make all the difference ive approved the proposal regarding sabrina but i havent sent it to london i want to tell julia and valerie first but theres been no time to write but the entry could also have read i had every intention of helping sabrina but morton was at me again yesterday wanting a sizable settlement instead it has shown me how right my father was to have nothing to do with that match yes very sad all right take me to simon if you will he put a comforting hand on my shoulder it will be over shortly my dear meanwhile best to keep you safe i led him from matrons office to the surgical ward and presented sister randolph who was on duty he asked about her patients and she gave him a brief report on their conditions he thanked her walked slowly down the row of cots nodding to the men who were awake and pausing finally where simon lay waiting i heard the colonel sahib clear his throat then say well brandon youve decided to live have you the officer lying next to simon was awake as well and he shifted his head toward the two men curious and unabashedly listening men of my fathers rank were not often visitors here nor did they know many of the patients by name i turned away as simon lifted his left hand to take my fathers and then behind me i heard simons voice begin speaking in hindi clearly concisely a soldier reporting to an officer i couldnt help but overhear some of it but sister randolph was saying at my side oh how nice hes found someone who understands the same language yes isnt it i replied my ears pricked what were they saying for my father was answering and then simons voice responded with additional intelligence but even as i was listening with only half my attention on sister randolphs chatter while trying to hear information i was not supposed to have i felt guilty behind me my father swore feelingly in urdu do you realize what youre saying and damn the war office for keeping it from my people it would have made a difference if id known he turned and glanced my way i was already leading sister randolph away the conversation went on for another several minutes then my father said heal we need you he was striding up the room toward sister randolph and me and as he thanked her he reached for my arm and guided me toward the door come with me lets hope we dont encounter matron along the way we didnt the staff was busy handing out medications and dr gaines was closeted with one of his patients we walked calmly toward the door and out into the evening sunlight i blinked the colonel sahib led me down the short shallow steps and across the lawns to a bench set under a stand of trees how much do you know about why brandon was in france id learned long since to tell my father the truth when it came to regimental business only a little i told him adding it was the gurkhas who brought him in after he was wounded i never saw them but suddenly he was there i could guess that hed been behind the german lines i remembered too that id drugged him to keep him quiet when hed asked specifically to get word to my father a wash of guilt swept over me what else my father turned his back on the clinic his eyes on my face theres a german spy behind our lines or so simon believed go on and he was trying to find him thats why it was necessary to capture a german officer to question yes all right you shouldnt have overheard any of that but no harm done the question is now who are we looking for who killed carson and your private wilson and nurse saunders william morton or one of his brothers or a german behind british lines looking for an identity there had been talk of spies from the start even before the war began german waiters in popular restaurants or staff in hotels were accused of spying professors and clerics and students from germany were suspected even men from the north of england whose accents were unfamiliar found themselves stopped and questioned by overzealous citizens and policemen the english coastline broken by a thousand river mouths and inlets and hidden beaches was always rife with speculation about spies being landed from submarines or small boats that had escaped the notice of the royal navy there were even tales of spies being lowered from zeppelins on misty nights and disappearing into the countryside but was any of it true seeing monsters under the bed was one thing real spies quite another i dont quite see what a spy has to gain i answered but if he exists he must have spent some time in england no one who spoke to this man were concerned with mentioned anything about him that would indicate that he was german but there are his eyes a very pale color youd think berlin could find someone without any characteristic that would stand out yes well this spy hunt is of course a secret i havent been told anything about it officially and apparently simon was only given enough information to carry out his foray in fact he was ordered not to question his prisoner but between us i think weve begun to piece together enough to worry both of us did he bring someone in i asked curious he says he did and that when he was wounded in a rearguard action the gurkhas split up half the company getting simon to an aid station against all orders and the rest taking the prisoner in they were to leave simon i asked shocked they were to see that there were no wounded left behind who could be questioned by the germans my fathers voice was grim which meant that they were to kill any wounded who were in the way it was a measure of their respect for the sergeantmajor that they had disobeyed that order it explained too why the gurkhas left him at the nearest aid station and then vanished i bit my lip trying to see where my father was going with this what are we to do my father was studying the sky watching a few scudding clouds that had appeared on the horizon just visible now from under the leafy shelter of the trees the colonel sahib turned to me a single man this spy a single target if he didnt come for informationtroop movements and the like where the next attack might comethen he came for someone who i asked who in france is irreplaceable if he were in the american lines id say one of their commanders surely theyre the biggest threat to the germans just now but he isnt behind the american lines and he passes himself off as a colonel hmm my father said and then i knew or thought i did just as my father said under his breath the prince of wales he wasnt allowed to fight but he visited the front often enough and he was very popular with the men what good would that do how would it affect the war i went on and not to be unfeeling about it the prince does have other brothers it would shock the country hurt morale it was hard to believe all the same and yet i couldnt think of anyone else who was as popular as the prince i cant believehe and the kaiser are cousins i said still arguing with myself what the army does and the kaiser knows might not be the same of course its possible that our problem and simons arent connectedthey seem to be because we know only a part of the story are you willing to beard a lion in its den a lion i asked warily there are seven sons in the morton family will was the actor the others were miners and farmers respectable enough men five of them i shouldnt think theyre a problem to themselves or others and then theres hugh he was closest to will or so my sources tell me and he was a union leader before the war best known for hiring several rather disreputable men to enforce his will at the moment hes missing from his unit in france he has been since his brother was reported dead he could have killed carson he could be dead himself but we need to know and as quickly as may be could hugh morton impersonate an officer i asked doubtfully if he had been a union leader he knew something about charming and haranguing his followers but those were not the skills that would help him carry off such a charade if theres one actor in the family i dont see why another brother couldnt have a talent in that direction for all we know he might be even more talented and simply chose not to use it take young barclay with you the best approach is that you are concerned for young sabrina find out if you can which sons can be accounted for i dont think were going to find that hugh is our man hes dead very likely just as william is still if hes our killer then we have nothing to do with this spy business and can safely leave it to those who are involved what if hugh is there in wales i asked he isnt i can almost guarantee that how is he going to get out of france what i want to know is if the family mourns him or if they consider him still alive and simon hes best where he is i dont think dr gaines will let him slip through his fingers he looked toward the clinic again and i read the emotions flitting across his face worry doubt and a stronger feeling anger he had never left one of his men behind of course simon had known the risk to my father it made no difference he left soon after that and later in the evening i asked dr gaines if i could borrow his motorcar and of course captain barclay on my next free afternoon i was given permission and went to ask captain barclay if he would accompany me hed been avoiding me not quite making it obvious but he hadnt been seeking out my company the way he had before hed become barclay the orderly one of the sisters had commented that id lost my beau to someone else he said shaking his head as i told him i needed an escort i let you down in france my father asked if id take you to wales with me he must not agree hardly the most dangerous place in the kingdom it could well be all right ill go alone if i must id been a witness to his attempt to trick dr gaines with the butchers paper and it must have stung i realized that this was not the best time to ask a favor almost as if in response to what id just been thinking he turned his head away and stared out the open door im useless to the army to you to myself its appalling to think of my men dying in france while im forced to pace the floor here in an effort to strengthen a leg that might as well have been amputated for all the good it is to me i read something in his face that i hadnt seen before despair and that worried me useless i said sternly in my best imitation of matrons brisk tone thats selfpity captain and ill not have it buck up young man and fight for what you want if its so important to you in spite of his depressed spirits he couldnt help but smile i smiled in return and added in my own voice i expect i simply wanted your company again after a moment he shook his head not in refusal this time but in surrender yes of course ill go with you do you have another wonder to show me with that he walked away limping more lightly on his cane than he himself could see with a pang i recognized that he would have his wish and return to france in a matter of weeks if he didnt give in to his despair before then and do something rash i waited until late in the evening when id finished my duties and then went to sit with simon for a little he was sleeping his breathing quiet his skin cool without fever it was impossible to think of simon brandon being sent behind enemy lines knowing that if he were severely wounded he would be killed by his own men it took incredible courage still he had a strong sense of duty as did my father but even my father had been angry at the waste his death would have been i just didnt know whether the spy behind the lines or one of the morton family was the person behind my own brushes with death but if it was the spy then his thoroughness in eliminating anyone who could identify him was his very survival and what would simon brandon say if he learned that id already encountered the very spy he himself had been sent behind the german lines to uncover i said nothing to simon about the death of nurse saunders i just watched his slow improvement and encouraged him to rest as much as he could and since hed spoken to my father his mind seemed to be at peace as if duty done he could now think about his need to recover when thursday arrived dr gaines remembered that hed agreed to let me take his motorcar for the day i hadnt said anything more to captain barclay but after breakfast he reported to the doctor and was sent to join me as i came down the stairs to the foyer of the house it was a fine day and we drove through the countryside of somerset and into the marches of wales the border country that had known its own struggles in the past but today was peaceful rolling hills and pastures villages tucked in their lees narrow streams and the occasional stand of trees marked the landscape we stopped briefly to eat the picnic that the kitchen had provided and i was reminded painfully of the picnic simon had arranged as a backdrop for his encouraging me to stay in britain and not return to france i couldnt help but wonder what would have changed if id taken his advice and never gone back to the battlefields i must have sighed for captain barclay finishing his sandwich looked across at me and asked theres more on your mind than a simple outing in pretty countryside and so i told him about the morton family hed known some of the story but not about hugh or about the other brothers who had fought for king and country you feel the father will tell you where his son is i dont know whether he will or not but you can judge cant you how people mourn perhaps the way he says the name or the way he looks when he speaks of will and his relationship with hugh whatever that was good or not what possible excuse can you find for prying into a familys losses actually theres a little more to it than that and so i told him also about sabrina and the life she was living now in fowey she told me will mortons family had asked her to come to them perhaps she should but theres no way of knowing is there until ive seen them for myself you cant make other peoples decisions for them of course i cant i wont still if the family really cares about wills son perhaps they should go to fowey themselves rather than simply write a letter i shook my head look if hugh isnt a murderer all well and good if he is im certainly not going to ask a young widow to go and stay with his family the captain smiled grimly all right god knows if its hugh morton weve been dodging all along id just as soon know of it i owe him for what he did to you and to me we repacked the remnants of the picnic and drove on to the small village of helwynn where id been told the mortons lived it was picturesque in its own way running up from a small stream to the crest of a hill a smattering of houses and shops a stone chapel with a short steeple and several outlying farms that lay like patchwork across the stream we stopped the motorcar in front of a small bakers shop and i went inside to begin my inquiries the woman behind the counter stared at me in my uniform and then her face seemed to freeze can i help you then sister she asked her voice that of wales as well as her dark hair and eyes her fine skin and her straight back hello i said with a warm smile i was traveling through and i remembered a family that id known who lived here the mortons are they still here those thatre left she said seven sons ross sent to war it hasnt been easy for him no i expect not its will i knew well his wife he was the actor wasnt he he was could you tell me how to find his father ross morton he lives on the farm you can see across the little stone bridge nobody to work it for him now most of the fields fallow or given to cattle theres still money in milk and butter from the look of her wares i found it easy to believe that we were all obligated to give to the war effort in some fashion but sometimes in the smallest villages the food they could produce barely sufficed to feed the people living there although it was sometimes hard to convince the men who procured hides for shoes and meat for rations and other goods for the army they had quotas and the needs of people compared to the needs of the army were often unimportant i thanked her bought two small buns for our tea the captains and mine and left the shop several small boys had clustered around the motorcar leaning in to look at it asking questions about how it ran and where it had come from the captain with that easy american way of his was letting them persuade him to lift the bonnet and show them the motor when i came out the shop door the boys stood back to stare at me and i said go on open the bonnet captain barclay got out to do just that but when they saw his limp their questions were about the war and his wound the motorcar forgotten my da had his head blown off one told the captain ghoulishly they couldnt find it however hard they searched so hes buried without it a pity the captain answered all right off with you see you mind your mothers they have enough to worry about without your adding to it they nodded but i doubted theyd remember the lesson half an hour on i saw the small school as we went back down the hill to search for the stone bridge it was scarcely wide enough to pass over but we managed and the captain whistled oh well done he said turning to me after making certain the wings were still part of the motorcar a sign on the far side of the bridge read in faded green letters peace and plenty farm we came shortly into the muddy farmyard where half a dozen blackandwhite milk cows with bursting udders had come in on their own ready for the afternoon milking they turned to stare at us with their large brown eyes and then their attention was caught by the man who had just stepped out of the barn lost are you he asked wiping his hands on a bunch of straw i gave our names then said i was hoping to find ross morton is this his farm he was still like the woman in the shop wondering if i brought bad news with me i said quickly im a friend of sabrina mortons your daughterinlaw i thought perhaps i should stop for her sake sabrina is it he asked moving away from the barn a big man taller even than captain barclay broad of chest and shoulders he added have you seen the boy he was asleep i said but i was told he had his fathers eyes the elder morton digested that that would be my wifes he said after a moment pale as winter ice his own were hazel his hair still fair but thickly interlaced with gray there must have been some english blood in the morton family because the welsh were as a rule dark i never met your son i said but ive known sabrina since she was a child he ignored me wills son ought to be brought up here where he belongs not in england i told his mother that i offered her a home as well my wife died in the spanish flu theres no one to do for us it would be a kindness to come and take her place i could see what he meant that there was no one to feed the chickens or cook the meals or do the familys washing mending or marketing i couldnt imagine sabrina fitting into this world i could understand why she had chosen fowey instead but i could also understand this mans needs he had a farm to keep going without his sons and the house needed a woman in it i said are your other sons married my namesake ross had a wife she died of childbed fever and the babe with her a pretty little thing but with no strength to live where is ross now drowned off the coast of ireland when his ship went down the huns never tried to save the men the surprise was they didnt machinegun them in the water its done im told wills dead but you know that if you saw sabrina davids lost a leg and sits in his room staring at nothing the girl he was to marry didnt want a cripple the twins are in france somewhere and they write when they can but i never know from day to day if theyre alive or dead llewellyns in hospital in suffolk and not right in his head nor ever will be theyre saying shell shock only will has a son and this farm once had seven id been counting with my fingers behind my back ross the elder the namesake will david who lost his leg the twins llewellyn in suffolk that made six you had seven sons i asked gently is the last also among the dead ross morton shifted thats hugh he said nine months younger than will and a hothead into the bargain the image of his mothers own da the one who went down the mines and lived to tell about it a fighter he was marys father i never quite got my mind around that boy i couldnt see how he could be so much like his grandda and so unlike me you could almost imagine him questioning the boys paternity something he must have done a thousand times over the years and yet somehow i had a feeling hed never doubted his wife a changeling he said finally as if in echo of my own thoughts they used to talk about that the old ones i never put much stock in it until hugh and then i knew it could be true enough i just dont know how he got to be in the morton cradle but you saidhughs alive still along with david and the twins and llewellyn morton took a deep breath they tell me hes missing there was the telegram saying at first that he was dead and then a letter from his commanding officer to say he was among the missing after a push that was repelled i dont understand why they couldnt find him do you he swung around to stare at captain barclay as if he were to blame for the confusion hugh wouldnt be easy to kill and he wouldnt care to be penned up behind a fence in a prison camp it would drive him mad he was always a roamer hugh was and i cant see the army changing that why havent they found my son i could hear again the little boy telling us that his father had lost his head and had been buried without it the captain was saying its not so easy theres shelling before an assault and then theres the attack across no mans land men die theyre shot theyre blown apart theyre wounded and fall into a shell hole where the body may not be found for days no certainty you see the sergeant calls the roll and no one answers and no one saw him fall if he hasnt already been taken behind the lines to be treated for wounds they can only wait and see if he turns up he could even be a prisoner if he is word comes back after a time and his status is changed im sorry but thats how it is a damned poor way to run a war if you dont know where your own men are morton said contemptuously while families sit and wait for news and none comes at least not any good news he turned back to me do you think sabrina might want to come and bring up the boy here for wills sake i dont know i said wishing fervently that i hadnt raised false hopes with my invented reason for coming here perhaps if you write to her again i wrote once im not likely to write again i could hear the stiffnecked pride in his voice hed offered his home and all he had to wills widow there was nothing more to say he couldnt understand as i could that sabrina had been brought up in a very different world she would break here on this farm cooking and cleaning and washing for the men of the house with no hope of escape no chance for a life of her own and yet i could see that a boy could run wild here when not at his lessons or doing the everyday tasks assigned to him and grow up as his uncles did compared to that narrow little hotel in fowey where no one came on holiday now because of the war with the danger of drowning not far from the door it offered much i said i think perhaps your sons death is still a shock to her to sabrina she has a son to care for he said stubbornly my grandson he may be too young to know or care now but one day hell want to see where his father came from and its likely therell be none of us left to tell him if this war goes on for much longer and theyre all dead i wont see any reason to stay he nodded toward his cows i have them to milk and feed i dont have time to give over to wishful thinking ill bid you good day sister captain and he walked past us calling to his cows they formed a line as tidy as any drawn with a rule and followed him into the barn captain barclay nodded to me and i turned the motorcar to drive away as i did so i happened to see in an upper window of the farmhouse the thin drawn face of the son whod lost his leg id seen too many like him to have high hopes for his survival if there was no gun in the house there was always the shallow stream or any of a number of ways to end the pain i was torn between wishing hugh morton was not a murderer and would come home to his father and thinking that if hugh took after his mother as will did then he too had those pale pale eyes captain barclay said as we once more drove over the narrow little bridge hughs alive his father doesnt want to hope and thereve been no letters but he believes hugh is too much like his grandfather to have been killed so easily by the germans and i had reluctantly to agree with him chapter fourteen that evening after the motorcar had been returned to its proper place and id thanked dr gaines for the use of it i went up to my room and began a letter home to my mother it was very simple my letter i told her that simon was steadily improving and that meanwhile id enjoyed a picnic with captain barclay i never mentioned going to wales i wrote that it was sad to hear that wills brother was missing and that there was still no news of him all these weeks since it was reported it would suffice to inform my father of what i had discovered after id set my letter in the basket for the morning post i went back to my room and sat by the window looking out into the night there were three people dead all i could be certain of was that the same man had killed all three hed nearly succeeded in killing me as well whats more id rashly promised mrs wilson that id try to take away the stigma of her husbands suicide i still felt strongly about that it was cruel that a woman and her daughter had to live with a lie but id made little enough progress still id learned how major carson must have been surprised and killed and private wilson as well when id felt that arm around my throat it was frightening and id fought desperately to live i expect that even caught by surprise major carson and private wilson must have fought too both were tall men but slender in build and their attacker remembering the size of the elder ross morton the width of his shoulders and the power in his body even in middle age i realized that if hugh was anything like his father id been unbelievably lucky to have survived but then whoever it was had needed to kill me as silently as possible and that bucket rolling and clanging across the muddy ground had put paid to that i shivered if my booted foot hadnt found it and given it a hard kick i could very well be dead now not sitting in somerset watching the moon rise would hugh come to england looking to finish what hed begun i couldnt really answer that but i realized with a sudden sinking feeling in my stomach that my arrival at the morton farm might have changed the future assuming that hugh was still alive and learned that id been there asking questions was sabrina safe id used her name on the whole i thought she would be but he might well be goaded into searching for me because he suspected why i had been there if of course the killer was german what happened in wales would have no bearing on my life or anyone elses id have to go back to france simon couldnt accompany me and captain barclay wasnt fit to be released for duty either then id have to go alone there must be some way to do it safely id need a reason to travel i couldnt hope to search properly if i was sent to one station and one station only whats more i could be found all too easily with a sigh i came to a conclusion and went quietly down the stairs to retrieve my letter upstairs again i opened it and added a second sheet outlining the conclusions id drawn while sitting at my window i didnt think the colonel sahib would be happy with this addendum but i had a feeling hed see the reasoning behind it and agree however reluctantly i tiptoed down to the foyer again to leave the resealed envelope in the basket and i was just on the point of going back up the stairs when a movement in the dimly lit passage to my left caught my eye for the past half hour id been dealing with murder and murderers i froze waiting to see who was there but no one came forward not matron not the night duty orderly not one of the sisters on evening watch as my eyes adjusted to the dimness i could see a shadow at the end of the passage where someone had halted and was waiting for me to go on about my own business i debated shouting for help but id feel silly if it was only one of the officers who found it hard to sleep and who sometimes walked off whatever nightmares kept him awake but that was generally in the small hours two or three in the morning i moved forward as silently as i could keeping to the wall as much as possible id exchanged my boots for slippers as i often did off duty embroidered silk ones from benares in india halfway to the arch where id seen the shadow i listened and could actually hear someone breathing flattening myself closer to the wall i went on cutting the distance in half again and finally holding my own breath i was there movement again on the far side of the arch someone turning and softly heading back the way hed come even listening as hard as i was i almost didnt catch it softlysomeone in bare feet i was sure of it i was through the arch in a burst of speed and just in time i saw whoever it was disappearing through a door into the room where ambulatory officers gathered to play cards or chess or read i was fast on his heels opening the door hed left ajar so as not to make a sound closing it the room was dark but because the night was warm the windows at the far end stood open giving onto one of the gardens i saw the silhouette just ahead of me spin to face me as i said whos there at the same time i drew matches out of my pocket and struck one it flared and i found myself staring at simon brandons painlined face what in heavens name are you doing i demanded anger replacing the fear that had driven me to follow the shadow this far bess he said in some relief i thought it might be matron at the stairs and so it should have been i said you should be in your bed recovering i cant he said if i lie on that cot for another day i shant be able to walk at all and whose fault is that i demanded yes i know duty and all that the last two nights id slip out and walk for a while they wont allow me to try during the day but it doesnt damage my shoulder after all it just brings back the strength in my limbs i knew he was right but yet i couldnt get over my anger it was a measure of my earlier fright he smiled dodging you used up more energy than i realized will you give me a shoulder back to the ward i took a deep breath sit down simon please well walk back in a few minutes rest he sank down in one of the chairs and although he tried not to let me see what a relief it was i could read him as well as he could read me after a while he said why were you following me i thoughti dont know what i thought that someone was sleepwalking or had come in through the windows i stopped not wanting to go down that road does france still worry you a little i admitted but it will pass true enough he leaned his head back against the chair then said did i babble when i was unconscious did anyone comment on anything you were in the northwest frontier not in france and so you were speaking urdu most of the time i dont think anyone else here understands one word in ten of the language thank you i knew something i shouldnt like to have gossiped about here or anywhere else the staff doesnt know how you came to be in this clinic they dont even know your rank its just assumed that youre an officer like the rest of the patients dr gaines has listed you as a special case because of your shoulder he sometimes takes on very difficult cases that isnt a matter for comment and he needed to keep you under his eye is barclay here has he said anything to anyone you can trust him to be discreet i expect one of the reasons youre kept isolated at the far end of the surgical ward is to prevent other patients from talking to you and asking more questions than youd care to answer im grateful he said these were questions he would never have asked my father but he felt he could ask me and i was glad i could put his mind at ease you frightened us sergeantmajor i said lightly he understood im sorry it wasnt my intention there are some matters more important than ones life i wanted to tell him that there was nothing i could think of more important than his and i was still refusing to accept that he had been given orders that could well have meant his death i had been born and brought up in an army household i understood duty and sacrifice as well as any man in the army or any woman married to a soldier waste i could not endure this wasnt something i could talk about even with my mother melinda crawford a distant cousin would understand she had seen a very different war in the great indian mutiny she had lost a beloved husband to war i felt like putting through a telephone call to her and telling her the whole story but i couldnt the telephones were not safe for confessions of that sort i said are you ready to return to your cot yes i think i am he got unsteadily to his feet and i gave him my arm after the first several steps hed regained his strength and it was an uneventful return to the ward to our relief the sister on night duty was about to collect the medicine tray and we waited in a doorway until she had gone simon walked the last distance to his cot himself without my assistance and id just seen him safely under the sheet when sister roberts returned to the ward peering down the length of it she said sister crawford i replied indeed i was passing on my way to my quarters and i thought i heard someone ask for water who was it i was already halfway up the ward i expect he was calling out in his sleep oh yes of course that must be the surgical case from this afternoon she answered coming to look down on the sleeping man hes not allowed anything to drink yet ill just find a cloth and dip it in cool water that should help i knew better than to offer to do it for her i wished her good night and went on to my room it had been a long day and to my surprise i slept well it would be at least two days possibly three before i had an answer to my letter my father was difficult to convince he said as we walked under the trees have you mentioned this to brandon i thought it best not to yes quite right your mother is against it of course but she left the matter to my own good judgment im not sure that i dont agree with her well never know will we if we dont go looking for this man and there are several points in favor of returning this way id given the matter a good deal of thought while waiting for my fathers opinion ill be far less vulnerable than i was before ill be under orders that cant be meddled with my schedule will be random not rigid or predictable and ill be on special assignment where any attack on me would draw instant attention hed be foolish even to trywhatever hes up to hes not likely to risk everything on one attempt to silence me on the other hand there are only so many places a deserteror a spycan hide there are patrols in towns like calais or rouen captain barclay ran into one the main supply routes and roads for columns moving up are too busy he must stay on the fringes of military movement true enough but there will be other ways of hunting him down are there you can initiate a hunt by the army but im the only one who can identify the man you saw him in the motorcar was he of a size to be this hugh morton he was hunched over the wheel all i could see was the muffler around the lower part of his face i was concentrating on trying to identify him and then i remembered the drivers heavy dark brows hugh mortons father had been fair and so had david in the upper window what little i could see of his face and head in that one brief glance i hadnt thought then to ask hughs coloring even if i had how would i have put such a question yes of course he walked away from me then paced back again its a terrible risk bess if we dont find him then major carson private wilson and even nurse saunders will have died for nothing i understand but what you proposein light of what happened to edith cavellmay not sit well with your superiors i shant be looking for spies or dealing with the german army or watching for an english deserter i shall simply be visiting aid stations with a view to improving care its done isnt it the queen alexandras imperial military nursing service maintains high standards with an eye to its reputation and that of its staff im young to be filling such a role but ive had many hours of battlefield nursing dr gaines can vouch for that and dr hicks as well and if my information is correct the prince will be returning to the front shortly a single man in sarajevo began this war i pointed out a single sniper would be difficult to stop i shall have to find someone in my wide circle of friends who knows someone with high enough rank in the service to make the suggestion he pointed out it should not come from me melinda crawford perhaps he smiled the lines of worry smoothing out on his face a brilliant stroke even if you are my daughter for melinda while not on the services staff had advised them in the initial stages of their development and organization of training not only did she know most of the important women in the services governing body but her own experiences in india had made her an ideal resource in studying the conditions that the services nursing sisters would be called upon to face she had had much to do as well in choosing the sort of young women who would bring honor rather than disrepute to the service my parents hadnt consulted her when i chose nursing because they hadnt wished to involve her in a family decision they had firmly believed that i should survive or fail on my own merits rather than melinda crawfords influence and i had always been grateful for that my father had already spent some ten minutes with simon on matters not for my ears and as he prepared to take his leave now he asked how i thought the sergeantmajor was progressing as well as can be expected i answered trying for middle ground and not betraying simon to my father the colonel sahib nodded leaned forward to kiss my cheek and then was gone as i crossed to the house i listened to the sound of his motorcar disappearing in the distance i had got my way not completely but far enough to feel a sense of satisfaction that my father had listened to me but in spite of everything id told himand i believed all that id said that this was the safest way to proceedi would have to be very careful indeed or i could still fall victim to this killer chapter fifteen from the moment my father had turned the bonnet of his motorcar toward kent things moved very rapidly whatever qualms she might have had for my sake melinda crawford was quick to see the advantage of what my father proposed whats more he would have given her a full account of all that had happened she had known vincent carson she too would wish to see his killer brought to book three days later i was summoned to london to discuss reassignment to france i stayed that night in london with mrs hennessey at the flat she was overjoyed to see me and spent half an hour telling me all the news about my flatmates and about her own cronies she insisted that i have dinner with her in her small dining room asking after my parents and simon she had once been involved in an attempt by a murderer to reach my rooms and afterward she had sung the praises of the sergeantmajor for saving both our lives since that time he had ranked with my father in her opinion and she admitted to being quite fond of him i didnt tell her about his woundsthere was no need to worry herand i enjoyed my dinner immensely for she had told her friend the butcher that she expected him to do her proud with a bit of beef that he held back sometimes for his special customers it was not legal but even butchers had to stay in business for the duration and the small roast we ate wouldnt have made the tiniest dent in the needs of the nation the next morning i took the early train to portsmouth with my father to see me off and slept a little while i could in my pocket were the credentials i would need over the next few weeks or for as long as it took to find a murderer the ship made good time against heavy seas for the weather broke with a vengeance as an early summer storm moved in off the atlantic the skies turned gray the rain pelted down and the warmth id enjoyed at my bedroom window vanished in cold air that made standing on deck unpleasant in the extreme it was still raining when we reached rouen but the worst had passed a driver was waiting for me and i was glad to see as he came forward to take my valise that his eyes were a very cornish brown his name trelawney he was also a member of my fathers old regiment and he said as he escorted me to the motorcar your fathers daughter is safe with me sister i thanked him and we slipped and slid out of rouen on the mudslick roads and headed west it took a day and a half to reach the forward lines approaching ypres and i slept that night in a nearly roofless shed that smelled of horses trelawney brought me tea at first light and then we were on our way once more the first aid station on the top of my list was small hastily set up and overrun with wounded from a breach in the line that had mercifully held i dropped all pretense of being there to observe and was busy sorting the cases as they came in and then doing duty in the operating theater there had been a gas attack as well and the scent of newmown hay lingered on the air as men gasped for breath and we did our best to lavage the burned areas of skin and mouths we all carried gas masks with us every hour of the day and night but there had been no time for some men to react to the first conspicuous low cloud coming toward them we loaded the ambulances lined up behind the station and sent stretcher cases back for more extensive care then turned our attention to the walking wounded it was late in the evening before we could draw a breath and the nursing sister in charge thanked me for my help i stayed for the rest of the night and spent most of the morning there as well until the wounded were no more than a trickle the guns were silent and it seemed that both sides were trying to recoup their losses a few more cases were brought in from a flagoftruce collection from no mans land and then those who were not on duty went to their cots and slept deeply i sat drinking tea with sister mason who ran this station with such courage theres not much choice she said grimly dr beddoes was taken back a week ago with a burst appendix he never mentioned feeling ill or told us what he suspected ive had to carry on and i dont know when or if well have another doctor sent to us somewhere nearby a soldier was playing a mouth organ a haunting version of roses of picardy i thought how homesick he must be letting the instrument put into words what he couldnt that the war had lasted far too long and there was still no end in sight he had lost heart and i couldnt fault him for that i made a note of sister masons concerns and as she watched me she said i thought when i first saw you that you were here to make trouble but you worked as hard as any of us it isnt trouble im after i replied ill report your need of a doctor and its the best i can do at the moment but you can be assured i wont forget she shrugged they say the war may end soon another year at most i dont know well all be dead by then there will be no one left to fight i asked if she had sufficient supplies we never have enough but we manage every ambulance that goes back is under orders to bring forward what they can such conditions were common but that didnt make it any easier for those who had to work with first cases out of the trenches and knew supplies were running short i had done it too often the french hospitals are worse they say she added ive heard tales how true i dont know but if i were dying id rather come here and stand a chance than go to one of theirs i smiled id heard the same tales of men crying for water and one overworked sister trying to save the worst of the wounded while the rest hung on grimly in the hope their turn would come setting down my cup i said as casually as i could one of my flatmates worked with a dr percy in a station near ypres she asked me to say hello if i saw him percy i dont think ive met him interesting i said perhaps hes been reassigned and i left it at that an hour later i set out for my next stop trelawneyhed never told me his rankwas always there ready to drive me when i turned toward the motorcar i dont know where hed found this vehicle held together by the rust that was trying to destroy it but the motor was sound and the tires were reliable the two most important factors in transport out here while i was working with the wounded the resourceful trelawney had done a little scouting in the area the germans had reached this far south at the start of the warthere had been bloody fighting in this sector at one timeand he had told everyone he was hunting for souvenirs theyd laughed at him but left him to it any luck i asked when we were out of earshot of the aid station trelawney shook his head you couldnt hide a wee mouse out there he didnt need to say anything more on our way to the next station we quartered another area and were almost strafed by a german craft which veered away at the last minute having spotted something of greater interest down the line i could hear trelawney swearing under his breath as he zigged and zagged across the ruts and dips fearing for his tires and his suspension we were conspicuous just here where there were no convoys of ammunitions and supplies at the moment no troops moving forward or ambulances rumbling back whats more motorcars were usually driven by officers always a tempting target but it was necessary to be thorough and we nearly paid dearly for it the only structure was so pitifully small in this blasted landscape that it couldnt even provide shelter from a good rain but we did discover two cellars once part of a tiny village their entrances partly blocked by rubble ratinfestedaccording to trelawney i didnt go down to seeand filled with more rubble and water they were unfit for human habitation putting away his torch and his revolver he said with disgust i daresay there are bones down there as well i didnt care to have a look it was dawn when we reached the next station on my list and i worked until dusk with the sisters there doing what i could wondering who would step in to help when i had to leave and then it was quiet the last of the wounded dealt with including a head injury and they found a cot for me i fell asleep almost at once glad for a place to rest we continued to move slowly east along the western front and so far no one had tried to attack me nor had we learned anything that was useful except that there was no dr percy in this sector in another cellar we had found two german dead wounded men who must have crawled in there long ago their uniforms barely recognizable their bones already disturbed by the everpresent rats trelawney searched for identification all the same saying theyll have families and someone will want to know what happened to them afterward he marked the location for a burial detail another dawn and we were nearly caught by surprise when a gas attack came the mist moving silently across the ground almost invisible in a light ground fog i caught the faintest whiff of newmown hay and fumbled for my everpresent gas mask got it on quickly tucked my limbs under my skirts and my arms under my cape leaving no skin exposed it passed over us dissipating as quietly as it had appeared we waited until we could hear a distant all clear and then moved on but ahead of us in the next station were men caught unprepared asleep or nodding at their posts i had heard tales of how the gas could creep across the ground and sink into the trenches a killer that seemed to care nothing for either side for if the wind shifted it blew back to the german lines we used gas as well the cough of burned lungs was unmistakable to the trained ear when we arrived at the next station i found lines of gassed men waiting for their turn to be seen bandages across their eyes helped some of the pain and was a distinctive marker they had a hand on the shoulder of the man in front of them stumbling along tripping if no one warned them of uneven ground at the mercy of orderlies and sisters who guided them we bathed their skin and did what we could for their lungs the worst cases would die painfully the less damaged would linger in a misery that was frightful one night when the shelling was renewed some of the shells falling well behind the lines the two of us took refuge in one of those blighted edifices that stood like sentinels as the front moved forward or fell back our own guns opened up in reply and the din was horrific this close it felt as if my brain rattled in my skull and i had to clap my hands over my ears to ease the pain we soon retreated to one of those distinctive french farmhouses built on a square with the house the outbuildings and the barns a part of the encompassing wall usually there were two entrances a wider one in the rear for drays and carts a narrower one nearer the house where riders and carriages came and went part of the wall had been reduced to rubble the roof of the barn had collapsed and the house was no more than a cellar and a single wall we pulled into the lee of the outside of the wall while trelawney did a brief reconnoiter he came back got into the motorcar once more and drove into the sheltering arms of the section of wall still standing trelawney turned to me and said sister were out of range here its best if we wait until the worst is over he pulled out the oiled map wed been using scanned it in the shielded light of his torch and grunted just here i think we are he pointed to a dot on the map that represented this farmhouse it seems there was an aid station here earlier in the war i found a twisted cot or two left behind and then it was a command post before the lines changed again nobody but us now i was careful he always was there ought to be a dry patch in a cellar or under the roof thats fallen in there was a ring around the moon last night well have rain by midmorning id seen the ring too and i didnt relish being wet to the skin which should we try first he waited i think the barn i dont particularly like the idea of being trapped in a cellar the barn it is ill have another look then he disappeared a second time and i heard chickens squawking as he walked in among the fallen timbers they had taken refuge here too i thought their lives changed just as much as that of their owners after fifteen minutes trelawney returned and we moved the motorcar a second time to where it was least likely to be seen from the air or by any parties passing through in one section the straw was clean enough and we spread the rug from the motorcar over it the chickens were roosting in the timbers above the cowshed out of sight trelawney nervous about leaving it unattended told me he would stay with the motorcar i fell asleep in spite of the guns it was well before dawn the sky no longer lit by the shelling but by a tank burning somewhere the smell of metal and petrol and oil barely masking the odor of burning flesh when something brought me awake with a start i couldnt have said what it wassome change in the silence sometimes we noticed the guns more when they fell silent than when they were firing i could hear my own breathing more to the point i could hear the breathing of someone else inside the barn with me it wasnt trelawney hed have spoken to me or in some way let me know that he had come into where i was sleeping nor was it the chickens for even the rooster if there was one hadnt begun to crow i lay there with my eyes closed listening the breathing got louder as someone approached even closer where was trelawney the fingers of my right hand moved among the folds of my skirt then closed over the small pistol that simon had given me i waited it was possible that trelawney had heard something too and had come to warn me i had to be absolutely certain someone else was there before i dared to fire and if there waswhat had he done with my driver several thoughts ran through my mind a handful of the chinese laborers who worked for the british army looking for the eggs the chickens laid or for that matter one of the chickens theyd be wary of trelawney and a company of british soldiers would have asked him his business long before they came here to approach me a deserter it was entirely possible but how had he avoided being seen by the evervigilant trelawney or a murderer who had already dispensed with my driver and was intent on dealing next with me wed been so very careful perhaps too careful lulling ourselves with our own certainty that we could protect ourselves if trelawney was dead or badly injured id have to make my shot count but i dared not open my eyes yet i could tell by the sound of breathing that he wasnt near enough i couldnt be sure which direction to fire there were stalls on either side of where i had slept and tracking sound was nearly impossible i lay there keeping my own rate of breathing as close to steady as possible another sound a timber creaking under an unwary foot my throat was dry i was still reluctant to risk a look and i could feel my heart rate quickening as the moment of decision came hed stopped waiting making certain i was asleep i remembered my valise tucked into the straw close to my right foot was that what he was after whoever was here in the barn with me and just as i remembered it i felt the straw stir as if someone had reached for my case i said opening my eyes im armed and i wont hesitate to shoot stay where you are i broke off in the distant glare of the burning tank a monstrous figure loomed before me one side of his face lit by the flames the other sinister and dark the one eye i could see appeared to be so pale that it seemed not to exist in reality only in my racing imagination i froze and i lay there accepting the fact that the smallcaliber pistol in my pocket could never stop my murderer he could kill me as he must have already killed trelawney and there was absolutely nothing i could do about it chapter sixteen we stared at each other neither moving for an instant i thought i must shoot him anyway while i can it wont stop him but it will mark him it might even do enough damage that hell eventually die of the wound my finger tightened on the trigger slowly as simon had always taught me a steady pressure that wouldnt spoil my aim and then the man in front of me spoke there was the rich welsh lilt to his voice as he said im bad wounded do you have anything in that valise will help i thought at first it was a trick but when my eyes swept down his frame i saw the darkish patch at his hip blood and not fresh it dawned on me that i might have shot this man out of fear and i felt cold with the realization that id have had his death on my hands whats your name rank and regiment i demanded no i wont tell you that im not going back into the line ive got this far and with any luck at all ill make it back to england before i die he wouldnt budge from that i thought if he sees the pistol hell know what it can do and if hes a deserter he could still be a danger to me and so i kept my hand in my pocket what have you done with my driver the cornishman with a tongue on him like a hair shirt hes bound and sitting by the motorcar thats my ticket home that motorcar i wont be stopped not now i wont do you a harm sister but ive rope enough for you as well they wont let you aboard any ship in a torn filthy uniform and without proper papers theyll take you up and sort you out later ill find another uniform the dead wont care he said an edge of desperation in his voice and i understood then why major carson had had to die his officers uniform was someones ticket home but for what reason simple desertion or something far worse he started for me i ordered him to stop then waited until he was near enough before i fired my aim was excellent despite the awkwardness of firing through my apron pocket with only the flickering light of the flames now dying down to help me he threw himself to one side as the shot went whizzing past his ear and the face he showed me when hed raised his head up out of the hay would have made me laugh it was so ludicrous he smothered an oath sisters dont go armed he said in an aggrieved tone of voice i did warn you i told him sharply you damnyou nearly took my ear off the next shot will be between your eyes i was taught by an expert marksman and i wont miss i let that sink in then i added in the nononsense voice of matron now sit down over there no too close on that bucket over there if you please he turned over the bucket and winced in pain as he lowered himself onto it not for long please sister i cant handle it he pleaded then speak up name rank regiment and dont lie to me i will know it believe me he gave his name as jones private welsh sappers youre too large to dig tunnels under the german lines i retorted try again he grimaced youll only send me back to be shot id rather you do it now and be done with it tell me why you deserted theres no one to do the farming if im gone i had been watching him throughout and i was nearly certain he wasnt the man who had tried to run me down in the motorcar his eyebrows were dark yes but although he was indeed a big man he wasnt large enough to be ross mortons son still he was tall enough and strong enough to have throttled me with one arm around my throat but so were dozens of soldiers in the british army i rose from the hay rather awkwardly my hand still in my pocket well find my driver now if youve harmed him youre a dead man yourself if hes all right ill dress that wound he got up nearly as awkwardly as i had his face twisted in pain until he was on his feet i marched him before me out to where the motorcar had been left and there by the wing sat trelawney bound his head on his chest i thought for an awful moment that he was dead his face was so battered hed put up a fierce battle in my defense i turned on the welshman his own face showed the marks trelawney had left there untie him i ordered and my prisoner had to kneel to accomplish that his face was white as he rose and for a moment i thought hed faint i felt no sympathy i was beginning to wonder if id found hugh morton after all or someone very like him a deserter too hurt to fend for himself and too inexperienced to find a way back to england it was naïve to think a dead officers uniform and a motorcar would see him safe and a killer would have taken his chances charged me in the expectation of throwing off my aim and been done with it certainly if this man had had six brothers like hugh morton even the former champion pugilist of the british army would be no match for such roughandtumble training what interested me was why trelawney hadnt shot him outright if hed had the opportunity no longer held erect by the rope my driver slid down to lie on the ground and i felt for his pulse it was regular but it was impossible to tell whether he was pale or his color was normal i looked in the motorcar found his revolver and turned it on my captive in place of my own little weapon back into the barn i ordered the welshman find a clean patch of hay and lie down that wound needs attention and while you dont deserve it ill see to it he argued with me until i had to threaten once more to shoot him it was not a pretty sight that wound he had been shot in the hip creasing the bone tearing up the flesh around it and possibly doing internal damage the one encouraging fact was that the bullet had passed through although it must have left god alone knew how many fragments of cloth and bone and skin behind he must have the constitution of an ox to have survived this long much less battled trelawney but he had seen salvation in that motorcar and it had given him the strength he needed i got what i required from the boot where id kept a scant supply and proceeded to clean the wound sprinkle it with disinfectant powder and then bind it up halfway through i saw that my prisoner had fainted kneeling there beside him i could only think hed been sent back for urgent care and had slipped away in the dark before reaching the aid station while he was unconscious i had no compunction about going through his pockets but i found nothing of importancea few cigarettes a lighter a crumpled photograph of a girl a packet of sweets and oddly enough a st christopher medal i wondered if she had given that to him next i looked at the inside of his tunic and saw what i was after someone had sewn his name behind his breast pocket the same girl his mother at that moment i heard trelawney bellowing my name im all right i answered in here he came charging through the barn door stopping short at the sight of his attacker lying at my feet good god sister have you killed him he exclaimed his gaze rising to my face i just cleaned that wound the question is what ought we to do with him tie him to something and leave him for the patrols to find he put his hand to his head gingerly touching what must have been a painful lump id searched the premises sister there was no one here id have sworn to that the motorcar was secured as well and im a light sleeper mind you i heard him creeping up and went after him im ashamed to say he got the better of me and that would rankle with trelawney for the rest of his life i expect he saw us coming and went away it was the motorcar he wanted i dont believe he intended to kill either of us i didnt add that trelawney would have been dead if he had thats not what my head is telling me trelawney said tersely my patient groaned coughed a little and opened his eyes rearing up as he saw trelawneys enraged face it cost him dearly and while he was sitting there with a cold sweat breaking out from the effort i said thats enough hugh morton or ill have your father take you out behind the woodshed he wiped his face with one hand and said plaintively you looked inside my tunic yes of course i did youre a large man but no match for your father wounded or well you never met my da he said angry now besides i take after my mothers side of the family oh havent i ive been to peace and plenty and ive spoken to your father whats more i saw your brother davids face in an upstairs window you have never but i thought he believed me did you kill major carson i want a straight answer his surprise was genuine ive been hunting him are you telling me the hun killed him i dont know hes a cold basman is carson he could have helped will hed promised he would but will died in my arms and when i spoke to the major afterward he said it would have to wait there was something he had to attend to first i ask you whats more urgent than looking after a widowed sister and her boy he was properly incensed something what something did he have to attend to first a letter home to his solicitor or his wife he didnt say but he wasnt there next morning and the lieutenant told us hed been sent for at hq the summons that had taken carson to his death what did you intend to do if you caught up with him knock some sense into him officer or not will deserved better theres no shame in being an actor he was good to sabrina what to do with you hugh morton i said with a sigh if i leave you here youll be shot for desertion i can take you to the nearest aid station and tell them id found you wounded and out of your mind with fever the wonder is that you arent i want to go home he said weariness and despair in his eyes the first light of dawn was touching the horizon and i could see how very pale his eyes were but they were blue not gray very definitely blue ive no will to fight anyone now william and ross are dead theres david with only one leg and llewellyn not right in his head theres only me and the twins left and ive had no news of them for weeks now weve done our bit this family has and my da needs help on the farm i remembered the fallow fields untended because there was only one man to work them and he could only do so much how many times had this same predicament happened across the length and breadth of england women had been sent out to help till fallow land to turn commons and greens and even estate parks into cropland but no one had come to peace and plenty to remedy the lack of labor i was my fathers daughter and this was a deserter in wartime i looked at trelawney for support his face was hard a soldier all his life he had no sympathy for a farmer in wales or anywhere else take the oath to serve the king and you were his as long as you were required nothing else mattered in the distance the shelling had recommenced this time the german guns range finding they were laying down a blanket of fire in the hope of taking out ours trelawney casting a worried glance over his shoulder said we ought to be going this farm has been hit before he was right i said to hugh morton youll come with us for now into the front of the motorcar ill be just behind you and i dont need to remind you that im armed ill stay here take my chances youre lucky a patrol hasnt found you before this and if that hip isnt seen to by a doctor david wont be the only morton son with only one leg he refused and as i listened to the shells dropping closer and closer i said ill shoot you myself you wont be going home either way hugh morton studied my face what he read there must have been determination although he couldnt know i was bluffing i wont give my parole he said you cant force me to do that and i wont promise not to shoot to kill when you run quickly now but it was too late a shell threw up black earth not fifty feet from the side wall of the farm between us trelawney and i dragged morton to the motorcar his wound after my probing and cleaning had left his leg too weak to hold him up and it must have hurt ferociously he kept swearing under his breath in welsh for i didnt understand a word but i heard sister once as he blamed me for crippling him however temporarily even if hed tried to run he wouldnt have got twenty paces just then the next shell splintered the barn sending shards of wood and debris all over us chickens flew out of the milking shed squawking in terror and even an owl blind in the morning light went swooping up from somewhere trying to escape wed just shoved hugh morton into the motorcar trelawney shielded me as best he could then all but lifted me into the rear seat before dashing around to get behind the wheel thank god hed already turned the crank and he spun the wheel racing for a break in the farm wall but it was already in flames the shed next to it burning like a torch he began to turn away looking for another exit but there was no place left fire spreading so rapidly we were all but encircled by smoke it seared the lungs and made all of us choke and cough hang on trelawney shouted and pointed the bonnet directly toward the shed so engulfed that the opening in the wall was invisible he had searched the farmyard carefully and even without being able to see the break he would know how to judge it but i felt myself tense and hugh morton yelled at trelawney telling him he was going to miss the opening for he too would know this farmyard well braced for hitting the wall at speed i kept my eyes on trelawney he would be the first to know if he was wrong behind us another shell burst showering earth and wall and fragments of farm equipment over us rattling against the motorcar i could only think what a target we would have been in the night trelawney and i if the shelling had begun while we were asleep metal shrieked like banshees as the near wing brushed stone wall and then we were through still blind when suddenly dawn broke ahead of us and the sun breached the horizon in a bloodred ball i lifted a hand to shield my eyes trelawney swore and morton was clutching the dash with whiteknuckled hands angling away from the line of shells we saw what they were searching for massed troops making their way forward into the line i shuddered thinking of the wounded who would be streaming back to the nearest aid station i reached out and touched trelawneys shoulder were needed there i shouted over the din but morton caught his sleeve for the love of god no he pleaded your father believes youre missing thats cruel he was digging deep into his trouser pocket and pulled out a set of identity disks dangling them where i could see them heres proof im tommy morris and im not right in my head he fell into a posture of vapid uncertainty his mouth down at one corner his eyes squinting and sometimes rolling as if he couldnt control them i saw a man once who looked like this they took him away bad influence on the rest of us he said as he relaxed his face muscles and his brother was an actor hugh had enough of that talent to master his condition id have believed it myself then why are you hiding in the ruins why havent you tried your trick on someone in an aid station the truth sister is that ive lived in the cellar of that farmhouse for weeks now someone caught me foraging and took a shot at me i didnt know the password see thats the wound you dressed i wasnt wounded in the line i simply disappeared in the dark taking another man back to the aid station he died before i could get him there his blood all over my hands and i thought heres providence providing so i took my chance i couldnt outrun another patrol not with this hip but the motorcar was providence all over again i blessed my luck and id have had it too hed come into the barn for my kit to find something to help his wound and give him a chance he couldnt have held out much longer in the ruined farmhouse but there were chickens and surely eggs and he must have found something to keep body and soul together before he was shot it was an interesting dilemma i found it increasingly difficult to believe he had killed the major or private wilson he wasnt cunning enough to waylay me or set up an accidental death for nurse saunders but what to do with him and what if i was wrong chapter seventeen we hadnt gone two miles when a shout went up followed by the appearance seemingly out of nowhere of a patrol i heard hugh morton groan and trelawney spoke swiftly hardly moving his lips what do we do sister stop the motorcar have your papers ready private morris i hope your disks save you now theres nothing more i can do we waited listening to the shelling to the sound of a motorcycle runner heading forward to the front to barked commands by officers steadying their men in the line the company quick marched toward us and by the time they reached the motorcar i had taken out my papers from the queen alexandras imperial military nursing service and had them ready trelawney had produced his own and hugh morton his face pale but set held his false identity disks in one hand the sergeant in charge of the patrol went over our papers carefully then looked at the disks that hugh morton presented turning to me he asked hes wounded yes as you can see i was taking him back to be looked at an ambulance couldnt be spared for one patient he insisted on seeing the bandaged wound then frowned as if something about hugh morton registered in his memory i prayed his hadnt been the patrol that had fired on the welshman when he was foraging deserters and looters got short shrift from the army after what seemed like an interminable wait the sergeant nodded and told us where to find our next destination trelawney thanked him and moved off under the sergeants eye and he continued to watch us out of sight as if worried about our presence here in the midst of troop movements our own guns were replying to the german artillery the noise deafening we reached the aid station and i presented my credentials to the young harassed sister in charge supplies were being stowed and the few patients with trench foot gassed lungs and minor wounds were being sent back by ambulance to clear the station for the major wounds to come i could see hugh mortonprivate morrisbeing sent to join the queue and i asked trelawney to keep an eye on him until id thought of a way to prevent it but i neednt have worried sister wharton was anxious about the pending attack and how prepared she was to deal with it in the end i decided to leave her to handle the influx of wounded on her own with her staff to help her rather than become the senior nursing sister in her place id learned my own strengths in her shoes and i knew from the brief conversation i had with her that she would cope very well and be the stronger for it knowing she had we were all so young i thought as we drove away the men who came to us and the sisters who treated them i had seen and done things that my grandmother would have wondered at but i had also discovered that courage was the ability to face what had to be faced when it was impossible to run away at a rear hospital i asked one of the doctors to have a look at private morriss wound he examined it nodded and said well done sister ive given him something for the pain let him rest for an hour or two and well send him on to rouen i thanked him dealt with my patient asked trelawney to sit with himreceiving a thunderous frown for my troublethen started toward the wards at that moment a courier came through on his way to hq stopping by the sister in charge of sorting patients he showed her his wrist she examined it briefly and pointed to a bench where others were waiting for attention he argued with her but she shook her head and moved on to the next man in her line the courier looked around spotted me and walked toward me where his goggles had been were two pale circles around hazel eyes the rest of his face appeared to have black measles it was so splotched from hunching over his machine as he sped crosscountry sister i spun out in the mud and i think ive sprained my wrist will you have a look at it im overdue as it isi cant wait with that lot i glanced across at sister henry she was busy with the line come this way i said and took him a little apart where i examined his wristit was painful but not brokenand taped it so that he could be gone but you must promise to see to it as soon as you can i admonished him i promise sister thank you he was about to turn away when i seized the opportunity could i add a message to your pouch hurry i cant wait there was paper and pen in my valise i wrote my fathers name and rank on the outside of the envelope and inside simply scribbled a single word nothing it would reassure and disappoint him at the same time the messenger gingerly drew his gauntlets on over the tape adjusted his goggles and walked away to where hed left his machine on the spur of the moment i went after him calling you said hq have you encountered a colonel prescott there no should i have i shook my head i was just curious i appear to have missed him at every turn he nodded started his machine with a roar then cut back on the throttle prescott you say yes thats right a big man with startlingly pale eyes that sounds more like major carson i tried to keep the excitement out of my voice then perhaps my information was wrong where did you see him he resettled his goggles rouen hes returning to england he stopped me to ask if id been given his orders there was no time to rewrite the message for my father do you usually carry such orders these were especially cut from colonel crawford he said i felt cold did youwere you asked if there were orders in your satchel for other officers yes as a matter of fact he did ask if there were any others he was worried that his had been mislaid but there werent not that time he gunned the motor eager to be off now i cant explain i began but dont look for major carson the next time youre in rouen hes i couldnt think of a good reason to disparage the major except of course for the fact that he was dead and someone had assumed his identity hes not in good odor at hq that could be the reason why his orders are not yet cut colonel crawford could well wish him to cool his heels for a time how do you know this he asked suddenly suspicious im colonel crawfords daughter if you look in your pouch youll see his direction on the letter i gave you i offered him my best smile justbe careful will you he regarded me for a long moment nodded and then was gone in a roar i went to find trelawney as quickly as i could the man im looking for hes in rouen we must leave as soon as we can but there were already wounded coming in strafing injuries from a lowflying aircraft as well as shrapnel from exploding shells the guns were busy and it was baptism by fire for the raw recruits facing death for the first time i held one boy of seventeen while the doctor dug shrapnel out of his legs and i pretended not to see when he wept with the pain i worked late into the night and i rose early in the morning before sunrise as the long lines of ambulances and an overburdened lorry brought us more and more wounded a hardened veteran watching the long lines being sorted by one of the sisters said therell be no one left in england over the age of sixteen i worked long into the night again and when i came off duty trelawney said morton is gone he slipped into one of the ambulances heading for rouen hardly unexpected i sighed remembering my own predicament over proper passes if they dont pick him up at the port hell be very lucky aye thats so on the third day as the flood of wounded slowed to a trickle i found time to tell the sister in charge that i would be leaving for rouen to complete my report she thanked me for my assistance and then said ive met one of your flatmates mary she was with us for a few weeks earlier on then was sent home after falling ill with the influenza they tell me it will return with a vengeance in the autumn i pray every night that it cant be true id heard the same but i said bracingly weve seen the worst of it im sure i cant think of anyone who hasnt had it but even as i said the words i remembered mrs hennessey simon and my parents we set out for rouen an hour after lunch working our way back through the quagmires that were roads and then encountering a rainstorm that turned the mud into a morass we took shelter for a time beneath a lone chimney standing by the road at least breaking a little of the wind if not the rain rouen was busy as we drove in late that night and i had the credentials now to ask for a bed at the base hospital one for me and one for my driver i sent trelawney to search the port for the man calling himself major carson and he was away for three hours before returning to report if hes here i cant find him but that messenger the one who told you about himhe was killed and his motorcycle taken just last night the french police are conducting a housebyhouse search for it but ill lay you odds its already in paris or points south i didnt think so the killers destination wasnt paris it was london the motorcycle was most likely in the river where it wouldnt be found straightaway allowing the hunt to go on i felt a surge of anger mixed with sadness id warned the courier either he hadnt taken it seriously or hed come upon this man sooner than hed expected someones orders had been in his pouch i could guess at that orders worth killing for but in whose name it wasnt until much later that i realized that my letter might still be in the couriers pouch depending on his route with my fathers direction scrawled hastily across the envelope if nothing else it would surely tell the killer that i was once more in france i went down to the port looking for any ship whose officers i recognized there was no way of knowing if major carson or whoever he claimed to be now had already left for england sometime last night or if he had had to wait as i did for the next available transport finally in late afternoon i spotted captain grayson he saw me as well throwing up a hand in silent greeting as he finished his business with the port master and then coming forward to meet me hallo sister crawford i didnt know you were back in france on leave are you yes i am i replied smiling any chance of space aboard the merlin i should think thats possible i have my driver with me and a motorcar do you think there could be room for that as well ill tow it behind us if i must do you have time for a cup of tea im dry as the desert it was a stormy crossing couldnt search properly for periscopes or torpedo tracks because of the high seas i never left the bridge i went with him to a small café near the cathedral and he drank his tea with gusto we talked about france and the war and then he told me that his brother had been killed in the north atlantic i remembered joseph grayson as a man with a kind smile and a quick wit and said as much thank you the captain replied his voice husky im not accustomed to the fact that hes gone we were close to change the subject i asked if there were other passengers on board this crossing he shrugged god knows they give me the count after weve been searched there are quite a few wounded coming back with us at least thats the rumor not surprising i could hear the guns as we came upriver he paid for our tea and escorted me back to the base hospital before rejoining his ship it would sail just after dark and i promised to be on board before that time i had just walked through the gates of the hospital when someone called my name and i turned quickly unable to identify the voice it was hugh morton drenched by the earlier rain despair in his eyes i dont have the proper papers he told me beside which theyre determined to keep me here as well not send me home wounds not serious enough they claim i dont know what to do rouen is bigger than i knew id come over through calais not here and i cant speak the language what about your head injury performance he smiled wryly i tried they couldnt find any wound on my head thats when they concluded i was feverish and would be admitted here i said im leaving rouen tonight theres nothing i can do you got me this far he reminded me no you left with the ambulances as a hip wound i thought it best how was i to know i looked him over when did you eat last two days ago come along then i walked back out the gates and took him to a restaurant where the food was not the best but was of enough provenance to trust it he ate cabbages and potatoes and what appeared to be minced chicken cooked in a sauce there was a pudding and he ate that as well i refused to let him have wine and he drank tea almost as thirstily as the captain had done when he was finished i took pity on him he was a man who only wanted to go back to his fathers farm i said look even if i could get you to england what then as soon as you reach walesthats to say if you manage it without getting caughtthe entire village will see that youve returned home the next thing you know the army will be there to take you up they dont turn the other way hugh morton theyll search for you and in the end come for you i dont think youve considered that i have thought about it i look enough like llewellyn to pass as him i could pretend to be one of the others but will and llewellyn and i were alike as peas in a pod someone was always blaming the wrong one of us and if anyone comes ill just do my little mad bit and theyll turn away they always do but hes in hospital and it isnt much of a life for you who has traveled across england to see him nobody which of my fathers neighbors will call me a liar it was madness the madness of desperation go back to your company private morton ill tell the base hospital how i found you wandering and confused there wont be charges to face sister i left my company to avenge my brother its all i wantedrevenge for how will was treated but wills dead the major is dead ive no more stomach for fighting and i can do more good at home helping my da in the fields than i ever could here i wont be responsible if youre caught do you understand that i do sister i wont even tell my father how i got home whats more he wont ask he may think you a coward for leaving france none of your other brothers ran i doubt they would have stayed given the choice i doubt will preferred to die in france never seeing his son or ross drowning in the cold sea or david when he looked down to find his leg gone all right go sit in the cathedral until dark meet me at the port gates theyre taking wounded on board and whatever i say to you at that time youll do your part on my honor sister but did a deserter have any honor to swear on i took him as far as the church saw him safely ensconced by the organ loft stairs and then walked away i wondered what my ancestress whose husband fought at waterloo would have to say about what i was going to do i turned around and went back to the cathedral and found hugh morton where id left him you will make me a promise i said anything sister if you survive this war you will go to cornwall and speak to your brothers wife and see his son do you swear on my honor he said again and this time i nodded i had left the cathedral and was making my way back to the base hospital when i happened to glance in a café window music was spilling out of the doorway someone playing a plaintive tune on the piano something about lost love and heartbreak and my own heart seemed to leap into my throat as the man sitting at a small table in the shadows of the doorway looked up at the very same moment he was wearing a british officers uniform wearing it as if it were his although it was a little tight across the shoulders but his eyes were as cold as the winter sea by comparison hugh mortons were as blue as a spring sky and id last seen them shadowed by a muffler in the drivers seat of a motorcar trying to kill me i couldnt help my own response this encounter had been too sudden too unexpected and we both knew he and i that id recognized him in the same instant hed recognized me he had killed four people that i knew of how many more i couldnt say but those four were enough i walked on half expecting him to stand up walk out of the café and follow me but at the corner of the next street when i looked back there was no one behind me except for two elderly women in black struggling to carry a tub of washed clothes between them either i was no longer a danger to him or he was too close to whatever objective drove him to take the risk of killing me now but why sail for england if the prince of wales was scheduled to come to france at the base hospital i looked for trelawney but i was told hed taken the motorcar down to the quay the chief engineering officer had sent word that it could be stowed aboard now i hurried after him but he was nowhere to be seen one of merlins officers was coming through the gate and i went to speak to him asking if hed seen my driver and my motorcar the chief is haggling with him now he told me grinning he wants the tires for his own motor at home in chichester i had to laugh good luck to him getting the best of a cornishman thanking the officer i moved off a little to wait for trelawney to disembark but he and the chief engineer must have moved past haggling and were swapping stories now looking at the collection of people hanging about the port i saw no sign of the major from the café it was possible he wasnt on merlin but if he was here in rouen he would have to land in portsmouth sometime i had only to get there first and wait i was tired of standing waiting but i dared not leave until id found trelawney finally after id nearly given up twice he came off the ship and saw me as he passed through the gates shes as snug as can be he told me pleased with himself i saw her tied down myself there was just room for her aft im glad trelawney i found the man weve been looking for he was in a café halfway between the cathedral and the base hospital i doubt hes there now he saw me as clearly as i saw him but he didnt follow me and that reminds me hugh morton is in the cathedral im going to try to get him aboard a deserter he demanded aghast sisteryou cant mean it i said i wont be the one to hand him over to be shot i have no such qualms he told me but you will do as i tell you its more important to find this major than it is to see morton in irons bloody coward he muttered then realizing that id heard he begged pardon nevertheless i said this you will do for me my reasons are sound he said nothing for a moment then changed the subject what do we do if hes on this ship this man youre after the captain is a friend ill ask that he be held until my father can come to meet the ship hell do that yes i said with far more assurance than i felt trelawney nodded and if hes not on board i think hell come to portsmouth within a day or two he has the orders he needed its only a matter of time whats more well have a chance to prepare he wont get away in england he mustnt i was told he might be looking to kill the prince of wales i dont know i said uncertainty loud in my voice theres something he intends to do or else he would stay in france makes sense doesnt it trelawney agreed he doesnt know me why dont you go aboard alone and ill watch until the last minute yes all right but be very careful hes killed four people that i know of he wont be taken by surprise if he even suspects youve recognized him he has a choice kill again or wait for another ship and waiting would be far more dangerous he said ill leave you then what about morton if he reaches the ship ill put him with the wounded on board ahhere comes the first of the ambulances and indeed it was making its slow approach to the port trelawney disappeared there one minute and invisible the next i scanned the dozen or so onlookers and i saw no one i recognized i had to collect my valise and i hurried back to the base hospital for it i was just leaving with it thanking the duty nurse for the hospitality shown me when i saw ahead of me a man in the uniform of a british officer his back to me but there was something familiar about his shoulders and the way he walked and then i realized where id seen him before he wasnt the man with the bandaged shoulder whod gone into the makeshift canteen just a few yards from the shed where the dead were taken he had been the orderly carrying a mop and pail the orderly sister burrows must have stopped and asked to bring fresh sheets to the ward id been trained to observeand so had she i didnt think i was mistaken i followed at a distance making certain that i wasnt where he might glimpse me in a shop window soldiers saluted him as they passed and i tried to judge whether he was actually an officeror a private soldier masquerading as one i came to the conclusion he was a sergeant for his back was ramrod straight and his officers cap didnt have that jaunty angle i saw so often rather it sat squarely as if he felt my scrutiny he turned and looked back the way hed come but a party of sappers had just cut across my path and i was shielded by them when they had passed he was walking on again i tried to judge if he was british or german but it was impossible to be sure and someone sent to spy or act as an assassin would have been carefully chosen for his ability to fit in even his voice would be suitable his english more than acceptable hed reached the ship i stopped to gaze at a window of cheeses my back to him and let him board apparently his papers passed inspection and when i looked again he was nowhere in sight someone took my arm and i nearly leapt out of my skin i turned quickly prepared to scream if need be it was hugh morton would you have waited for me he asked or left me in the organ loft i had other worries but yes i would have come trelawney is aboard with the motorcar and theres someone i didnt want to encounter just ahead of me hell be on the same vessel the officer you were following yes ill keep an eye out for him he wont know me that would be helpful i said but hes not a fool you must be very careful he gave me that onesided grin his eyes all but crossed his mouth drooping i told you people dont see the afflicted he said theyre too uncomfortable to look at it was a perceptive remark just then more ambulances turned in toward the port and i took hugh morton with me to add to the queue explaining to the sister in charge god forgive me that he had been left off the list he was ordered on board with the others and at the end of the long line i myself handed over my own papers i didnt see the man id been following but i thought perhaps he was taking care not to be in plain sight just in case someone could identify himor inform the port authorities that he wasnt who he claimed to be the only other possibility was that he wasnt on merlin at all that he was scheduled to depart on the ship just tying up behind her and hed come early to keep out of sight in due course merlin was given leave to sail the lines were hauled in dripping wet and coiled neatly on the fore and aft decks i stayed by the rail looking out over the city watching the flashes of the guns in the distance my father remembered france from well before the war and i wondered if it would ever look again as it had then the ship eased into the current then turned to steam slowly down toward the sea the night was dark the running lights masked and as i looked up to the bridge i could see captain graysons profile tense and focused on what lay ahead he had given me his cabin for the voyage as he wouldnt be using it as long as merlin went in harms way indeed as soon as we reached the sea word was passed that we were being shadowed by a submarine and the watch was doubled the rating who came to my door was young but steady assuring me that we were safe but of course i knew otherwise having sailed on britannic it was a long journey seemingly longer than the usual nerves stretched almost to the breaking point as we waited for the shout of torpedo my life vest was too warm but i kept it on in case we reached the shelter of the isle of wight without being attacked and portsmouth harbor lay ahead i slipped out on deck to watch us come in standing in the shadows where i wouldnt be in the way or noticed but someone had seen me out of nowhere someone put hands on me thrust a canvas bag over my head before i could scream or struggle and then i was being dragged toward the railing it had happened so fasta matter of secondsand then i was being lifted over the railing my muffled cries covered by the racket of the heavy anchor cable paying out as we came into the roads to await a berth i could feel myself dangling now no foothold or handhold and unable to see i couldnt tell where to reach out and save myself and just as suddenly i was being pulled up so roughly that i struck my head on the teak railing seeing stars in the blackness of the bag i landed on deck with such force i was winded and then as i reached shakily for the bag someone stepped on my skirts i realized that just above me two men were locked in a fierce struggle only their feet were visible and i quickly rolled out of the way as the heavy bag fell away i could see their shapes one in an officers uniform the other in the distinctive blue worn by base hospital patients they were surprisingly well matched in size and reach but mortons hip wound put him at a disadvantage unable to keep his balance on the moving deck he was quickly losing the battle pushed until his own back was hard against the rail and as i watched the other man rammed his knee into mortons groin and hip the crew busy with docking had no time for us but two orderlies had just come on deck from below if they saw him fighting with an officer he would be taken up for the offense i could do nothing then he had saved me i still had my little pistol in my pocket scrambling to my feet dizzy at first and then quite determined i brought it out aimed and fired the shot seemed so loud in our ears that we froze where we were morton turned his head to look at me stunned and in his grip i could see his attackers eyes incandescent i wondered how anyone could have described them as cold a trickle of blood began to run down the side of the mans face where my bullet had grazed his skull with an oath he let go of morton turned and stumbled away disappearing down the nearest companionway as three ratings converged on morton and me alerted by the shot they caught his arms pinning him and i realized that they thought hed been attacking me i shoved the pistol into my pocket and pointed over the railing there i shouted someone just tried to climb aboard look they held on to morton but ran for the railing staring down into the dark swirling waters i joined them pointing down the side of the ship now over there stop him leaving morton where he was they raced along the railing still searching for the intruder shouting to the watch to ask if anyone could be seen i took mortons arm quickly get back to the wards what were you thinking coming on deck like this trelawney had warned me morton might try to escape i told you id keep an eye out for him he was searching the ship and i watched him i didnt see you there in the shadows and then he had you pinned and was tossing you over the side he leaned against the companion doorway wearily hurting i dont want to be sent to hospital i want to go home it was blackmail hugh morton had saved my life ill see to it go find trelawney and tell him what happened hell be readying the motorcar dont leave him but the majors somewhere still hell find you again and i wont be there not now there are too many men on deck go before they come back to question you reluctantly he did as he was told i went back to captain graysons cabin and a moment later the second officer knocked asking around the door you saw someone trying to come aboard is it true he was wearing an officers uniform he fired at me gentle god he said and disappeared again a false rumor but there was nothing else to be done otherwise id have had to explain why id shot a british major with a pistol i was not supposed to possess id be detained while the major disappeared i poured water from the captains carafe onto my handkerchief and held it to my aching head where it had come in contact with the railing i didnt think i was concussed but it had been a hard blow all the same and i could feel the swelling under my hair i could hear racing feet and shouting for a while longer and then the same officer returned to tell me that theyd found no one and whoever it was had presumably either drowned or swum back to the port the authorities there had been alerted to watch for him i was asked if i could identify the intruder but i shook my head it all happened so quicklyby the time id realized what he was doing hed disappeared over the side again it was tempting to catch the major in this net of lies but his uniform was dry they would never believe hed come out from shore youre a brave woman sister crawford who was the patient who came to your aid i didnt stay to ask i came directly back to my cabin he nodded very wise as the door shut behind him i found myself wondering what on earth my father would say when he learned id thwarted a wouldbe boarder who didnt exist rescued an unreported deserter who did and shot a purported british officer in the head soon afterward the anchor came up again we tied up to the dock and trelawney was at my door reporting that the motorcar had been offloaded what have you done with private morton hes in the motorcar the sister in charge was glad to be rid of him it seems hed wandered the ship all night alarming the other patients and mumbling unintelligible drivel after id thanked captain grayson and accepted his apology for the fright id had i prepared to leave merlin id asked earlier if he would signal portsmouth as soon as possible to ask if my father could be summoned he told me now that my father was in london and couldnt be reached i was on my own then trelawney escorted me off the ship and to the waiting motorcar and with my papers in hand we left the harbor behind just outside gates in the street where once my father and i had considered what to do about the charges against me trelawney and i conferred i saw him leave merlin just ahead of us trelawney told me i marked where he was heading did you give him that bloody crease every time he wears his cap thats going to hurt there was no pity in his tone weve got to find him i said knowing how impossible that would be we cant let him disappear into the countryside theres the train trelawney said doubtfully crowded and slow in his shoes id look for a motorcar and where better to find one unattended than the ship officers billet leaves were short and a motorcar could make the difference between reaching london or ones family in time to spend a few hours with them or wasting it in portsmouth trelawney at my direction quickly found the nearest billets as we got there several motorcars were heading out of the nearby mews and trelawney counted rapidly naval uniform naval uniform naval again army that one and i saw his bloody eyes there was no way to conceal hugh mortons bulk but i had made myself as small as i could taking off my cap so that i couldnt be seen as easily and so i trusted trelawneys assessment and as our motorcar turned at the end of the mews to follow i said i wish id had the chance to telephone someone too late now sister trelawney answered all right you can sit up again he cant see you hes too far ahead we kept a discreet distance which was fairly easy as the sun rose and we wove in and out of convoys heading down to the port the green hilly landscape of hampshire rose beyond the town and the road to london was just ahead but our quarry didnt take it instead he turned west toward dorset here it was more difficult to stay within sight of the other vehicle the roads now followed the curve of the land rather than a roman rule and there were villages stretched out along it like tiny jewels on a necklace the problem was we couldnt always be sure our quarry hadnt stopped at one of them or turned off it wasnt until we were on the far side of each that we could pick out the glint of the sun on his boot in the distance or actually glimpse his motorcar rounding a bend far ahead my head was thundering and we were all three tired and thirsty and on edge for fear of losing the major and then as we were coming down a long sloping hill we saw in the distance that hed turned into a lane lined with hawthorn trees leafy now their white blooms long since faded at the far end of the lane we could just pick out the chimneys of a house it made no sense was this where the major was intending to go or had he spotted us and tried to throw us off chapter eighteen trelawney pulled to the side of the road the motor idling i could use a company of sepoys he murmured under his breath then aloud to me what now sister i must find a telephone i said my father needs to know where we are there isnt much he can do if hes in london but someone must be told that man is in england now i cant leave you here but you can i said quickly taking the decision out of his hands go to the next villageask for a telephone ill tell you how to reach three people leave a message with anyone who answers describe how to find us i began to dig in my valise for pen and paper fumbling in my haste i dont like leaving you miss he said his failure to use sister a measure of his anxiety he almost got to you on merlin what was i to tell the colonel then i asked you to guard the motorcar it wouldnt suffice sister if you were at the bottom of portsmouth harbor and the motorcar safe as houses the colonelnever mind what hed want to do but you know him as well as i do and how hed take such news i said as i wrote down three names and three telephone numbers ive reloaded my pistol it wouldnt stop a fly miss begging your pardon nor someone as determined to see you dead as this bastas this one is ill be all right ill take private morton with me if he can manage to walk that far he swore he could and while i didnt believe him his was a comforting bulk to have beside me i handed over the sheet of paper we got out hugh morton and i while trelawney with a last reluctant glance over his shoulder drove away leaving us by the side of the road private morton foraged for a moment in the hedgerow to the far side and came away with a stick he could use the two of us started toward the distant farmhouse in a roundabout way trying to keep out of sight the hawthorns and the lay of the land contrived to help us i didnt think that even from the upper floor of the farmhouse we could be seen unless someone was looking for us what if its a trick and he leaves before the sergeant comes back i shook my head it was a risk we had to take i wanted to find out who lived in the farmhouse gripping the stick with a tight fist private morton managed to keep up across the pasture but began to fall behind as the ground beyond the stile changed to a field with humped rows of marrows he called to me keeping his voice low ill wait for you i said closer by the house on the far side of the field i came to small yard and a derelict shed one that had been used for shearing sheep from the smell of it i stepped into its shadow just as the sun went behind a cloud and looked back for hugh morton but he had turned toward the trees along the drive where it was easier to walk i watched him fearful that he would be in trouble if the man suddenly reappeared just then from the direction of the farmhouse across the back garden from where i was standing i heard two distinct shots i started to run private morton forgotten it was faster to go around the house than try to find my way through it i had barely reached the first of the trees that lined the drive when i heard a door slam and then the motorcar was racing toward me at reckless speed the drivers face bent forward over the wheel was a twisted mask of hatred i didnt hesitate i spun around so that i was half protected by the nearest tree letting him pass but i dont think hed have noticed a line of cavalry if it had stood in his way i didnt look to see where he was heading i went straight toward the farmhouse door it was a lovely old house three stories and built of local stone there was a bow window to one side of the door which stood ajar and somewhere through the open panes i could hear a woman crying i stopped on the threshold and called out ive come to help i said please dont be frightened there was no answer i went inside the wide hall was empty there were stairs just to my right and beyond the newel post was an open door to my left i moved to it and stepped into the room stopping almost at once as i tried to take in the scene before me an older woman a maid judging by the way she was dressed her arm bleeding badly dripping down her hand to the floor was struggling to help the young woman who lay in the middle of the floor on a patterned carpet there seemed to be a great deal of blood more than could be explained by the arm wound i said bending over the younger woman let me see but i had to push the maid to one side even to tell if the other victim was still alive for a wonder she was breathing although it was labored and the cloth that the maid had pressed against her side was already making its own pool across the carpet my kit was in the motorcar with trelawney but i said scissors quickly and more clean cloths the maid still quite dazed scrambled to her feet with an effort and disappeared meanwhile i was trying to find where the shot had actually gone inand if it had come out the woman moaned as i moved her and i said gently youre with friends im going to stop the bleeding and make you more comfortable i wasnt certain she could hear me but i kept making soothing noises as i worked and finally determined that she had been shot in the side it appeared to me that the bullet had dug furrow along the ribs i didnt think it had reached the lungthere was no froth of blood on her lips the scissors came and i cut away the oncepretty white and green fabric of her summer gown for a better look the problem was i couldnt find where the bullet had stopped although it was very possibly lodged in her shoulder somewhere without instruments i couldnt be sure and internal bleeding was still a danger if it had penetrated the rib cage under her arm she was so much slimmer than the wounded soldiers id dealt with not much muscle or flesh there to shield the ribs and as i tried gently to probe the site then stanch the bleeding she cried out i had nothing to give her it took time more time than i cared to think about to stop the bleeding and bind up the wound as best i could with the simple bandages the maid brought me and as i worked i spoke to the maid hovering over my shoulder what is your name maggie she said her voice shaking from shock compounded by her own pain will she live yes i think she has a good chance what happened here why were the two of you shot did you know the man who did this he came through the door shouting her name over and over in such a voice that i ran out from the kitchen and came to see what was happening and then she came down the stairs staring as if shed seen a ghost and it was dear god it was her husband i asked ripping lengths of cloth to bind the womans arm to her side no oh no hes in france this was the man she was once engaged to and then broke it off and hed come for revenge her name julia palmer his do you know his name ralph mitchell go on i sat back on my heels looking down at my handiwork satisfied that for the moment julia palmer was out of danger she was on the stairs you said getting to my feet i took the scissors to maggies bloody sleeve and i began to clean and bind up her wound as well it went deep and it must have been painful for her to endure my touch but she went stoically on he told her hed come to ask her again to marry him then she said cool as you please come into the parlor ralph well talk about it shall we and she walked ahead of him into this room and turned to face him id come with her not knowing what to expect before she could say anything more he told her that he was a major now and as she was a widow he had come to ask a last time if shed marry him she told him he was mistaken she was still a wife and he said im an officer now i outrank palmer whats more hes dead you should have heard by this time there was a letter from colonel prescott i saw it myself was colonel prescott his commanding officer miss i dont have any idea go on fighting back tears she said miss julia told him but i havent he was very angry he told her she was lying on purpose to put him off thenthen miss he told her hed killed the lieutenant himself miss julia cried out at that and he went on shouting do you love me tell me you still love me but she couldnt could she i led maggie to a chair and she sat down suddenly her face very pale he just stood there waiting for an answer i didnt know where to look it was as if i could hear the ticking of the clock on the table behind me but maybe it wasnt that only my heart in my throat how did mrs palmer answer she told him then that she had never loved anyone but her husband i could imagine what must have followed but as it happened i was wrong and then he said he couldnt live without her and thats when he took out his revolver and i thought he was about to kill himself right in front of us but it wasnt that was it he pointed that revolver straight at her and he told her that if he couldnt have her no one else would she answered that if he truly loved her he would want her happiness above his own maggie broke down as she relived the shooting in her mind i knelt beside her trying to comfort her i dont know what possessed me when he fired i pushed her to one side and the bullet struck my arm instead he stepped forward shoved me away so hard i fell against the wall and then he shot her standing over her he cried out damn you crawford as if someone else had pulled the trigger then without even waiting to see if i was alive or not to tell the tale he was gone out the door driving away like a whirlwind id finished binding up maggies arm suddenly aware that hugh morton had been on my heels but had never appeared i hurried to the door to look for him he was nowhere to be seen i called his name and there was no answer there wasnt time to worry i came back to the parlor and asked is there a doctor close by do you have a motorcarsome way we can get mrs palmer to him she needs more care than i can give her whats more so do you theres the dogcart maggie said standing up out back and the old horse is in the pasture i dont know if i can find the strength to harness him up theres no one else here today the cooks daughter got word her husband had been killed and so the cook and the boy who does the handiwork went over to sit with her it was up to me then stay here with your mistress i said ill fetch the cart i found my way through to the kitchen and then out into the yard the small dogcart was in a good state of repair and the horse in the field came at once to my call it took no more than ten minutes to hitch him to the cart and then drive round to the house door it took much longer to bring mrs palmer as far as the cart slender as she was she had fainted again and couldnt help us i sent maggie to bring as many pillows and blankets as she could find piled them into the cart and then began the arduous task of settling my patient among them it was impossible to bring mrs palmer around sufficiently to help us help her and all the while i thought about hugh morton who would have been such a support through all this finally her face nearly as pale as the linens she lay on mrs palmer was ensconced among the pillows and i had shut the house door behind us before taking up the reins to drive to the nearest village trelawney hadnt returned either but it could well have taken much longer to find a telephone than id hoped if that was the case then i would surely meet him somewhere between here and the doctors surgery i drove as carefully as i could along the drive and out into the dusty road beyond trying not to jostle mrs palmer and start the wound to bleeding again the sky was threatening and although the distance to the nearest village was only three miles it seemed much farther all that mattered was whether or not it had a doctor shelpot maggie said and pointed the village the surgerys down there just past the church dr glover it was a long rambling house with a thatched roof and a pretty garden his nurse answered my knock saw the cart with two bloodstained women in it and with a shocked oh my dear lord she went to fetch the doctor he was a man of perhaps sixty years of age straight as an arrow and strong enough to lift mrs palmer himself and carry her into his surgery i ushered maggie in after him the nurse was sent for tea while the doctor examined my two patients looking at my uniform at one point he asked on leave are you well its a good thing you were or mrs palmer might not have made it shes lost a good deal of blood and her breathing is not as comfortable as id like to see it theres the bullet of course but at the moment the bleeding worries me most ill have to keep her here maggie as well i should think im not happy with either of these women returning to the house he finished rebinding maggies wound with proper bandaging and reached for the teacup his nurse had set on his desk gunshot wounds are rare hereabouts who did this any idea ralph mitchell so i was told good god i thought he was in france so apparently did mrs palmer his father owned a farm some miles from here young mitchell took it into his head that he was going to marry julia baldwin made a right nuisance of himself instead and then when he failed to qualify as an officer he blamed everyone but himself and swore hed win the vc before the war ended baldwin i repeated what was her fathers name tobias an army man himself although hed been invalided out recalled to do something or other in london died there in a zeppelin raid i knew who tobias baldwin was and he hadnt died in a zeppelin raid that was the official reason but hed been killed during one and his murderer had never been caught hed worked for my father and the fear early on was that his death had to do with his work as time went by that seemed more and more unlikely was ralph mitchell in london when captain baldwin died my father would have to look into that i remembered what maggie had told me that mitchell had stood over julia and cried damn you crawford and he had had more than an hours head start i must find a telephone i said quickly actually theres one at the house baldwin had it put in when he began reporting to london and mrs palmer chose to live here after her father died in the bombing rather than stay in her husbands london house she believed it was safer poor woman if that was the case where were trelawney and private morton there was no time to consider that i had only a dogcart at my disposal and that wouldnt carry me any great distance in pursuit of a motorcar i needed to make the calls that trelawney hadnt and as far as that went where on earth was he what had become of private morton i was beginning to worry that they had run afoul of mitchell somehow after asking dr glover to send someone to the house of the palmers cooks daughter to let her know what had become of her mistress i set out alone in the dogcart against all advice if mrs palmer is in danger you will be as well sister dr glover warned me he could come back the mans not stable if hed do something like this to julia palmer if he cant find her hell turn on you let me summon the constable hell need your statement anyway there isnt time ill be all right i must get to that telephone i promise ill speak to the constable as soon as possible then promise me as well that once your telephone calls are made youll return to the surgery dr glover followed me to the door quietly asking out of earshot of the others what was so urgent but i wasnt prepared to tell him that i thought mitchells next victim was very likely going to be my father there was still no sign of trelawney or of private morton on my return to the house the door was shut as id left it but i took the horse around to the back where he couldnt be seen by anyone approaching down the drive and with the little pistol in my hand i went from the kitchen through to the wide hall searching for a telephone i found it in the room that captain baldwin must have used for his study i locked myself inside and sat down at the burled desk i called london first but i was told by a voice i didnt recognize that colonel crawford was not available the next call i put in went to somerset and my mother iris pleased to hear from me was full of questions and finally told me that my mother was not to home where is she i asked praying that shed gone to market or was calling on friends she went to the clinic miss elizabeth the one where you were she should be coming home before very long debating what to say i settled on tell my mother and sergeantmajor brandon if hes with her to close the house at once and go back to the clinic they must wait there until i come and you must go with them taking cook as well do you hear yes miss but cook is in the midst of preparing dinner im sure she must be but you must convince her to go with you as quickly as you can you must leave the house theres something wrong iris and i dont know whats about to happen its best if there isnt anyone in the house at all it took all of my persuasive powers to convince her to heed my warning iris accustomed to the safety of the crawford household found it hard to believe that any threat could touch her there and my final call was put through to longleigh house matron answered the telephone and i asked if my mother was there or failing her simon brandon she hesitated for a moment sister i shall be happy to take a message for them i sighed had simon gone missing again was that why my mother had been summoned to the clinic in lieu of my father i said if i could speak to captain barclay she was happy to tell me that he was available if i could wait in short order i heard his familiar voice on the line i havent much time i began and so you must listen closely and not ask questions im in dorset im calling from the home of the late captain baldwin my parents or simon will know the name theres been trouble here and its my old adversary from france hes in england and bent on revenge i dont quite understandbut hes shot the woman he wanted to marry hes posing as a major and it may be that hes coming after my father theres quite a bit more but it isnt important right now my father is in danger and everyone else in the household could be as well where is simon brandon do you know there was a telephone message from london a captain grayson in portsmouth was trying to reach the colonel your mother called here and is on her way to pick up brandon theyre going on to portsmouth captain grayson had probably told someone that i was attacked on board merlin and that someone had either tried to come aboard the ship or had gone ashore from it without proper authorization all of it true but it would sound to simon as if the german spy hed been hunting was in portsmouth and hed be leaving the clinic to deal with it with my mother to drive tell them to stay at the clinic until i come there portsmouth can wait its mostly a distraction and theres nothing for simon there i dont have a motorcar captain but as soon as i can manage to find transportation im going to look for my father he could be in grave danger i said again please you must tell simon that and to wait for me i think the man were after is on his way to somerset there was a pounding at the main door of the house and i ignored it if it was mitchell returning so much the better i could deal with him or at least try i began opening drawers of the desk looking for a revolver or had captain baldwin taken it to london with him surely hed have other weapons souvenirs captain barclay was saying ill take the doctors motorcar and come for you stay there and tell me how to find you there isnt time i must go theres someone at the door bess but i was already putting up the receiver trying to think what best to do i hadnt really expected mitchell to come back again or to have second thoughts about witnesses when he had other quarry in mind but he had been very thorough covering his tracks in france the main door crashed open i could hear someone shouting from the passage and i turned opened one of the windows in the study and went over the sill into the lilacs just beyond the locked study door would keep him occupied while i went round to the front of the farmhouse and stole his motorcar i slipped toward the back of the house where i couldnt be seen through the windows and then went the other direction toward the front peering around the corner of the house i stopped stockstill and stared the motorcar was trelawneys just then through the open parlor window i heard private morton call out theres blood all over the floor in here trelawney shouted something and i strode toward the voice where in heavens name have you been i demanded walking into the house through the broken front door it was trelawneys turn to stare and hugh morton limping out of the parlor said his eyes on my uniform is any of that blood yours theres a horse harnessed to a dogcart around back i said quickly put him out to pasture if you please trelawney and private morton theres a window open in the study close it ill be waiting in the motorcar i handed him the key and walked out before they could waste time asking questions all i could think of was my father and the man who was going to hunt him down in five minutes hugh morton was back minutes later trelawney returned got behind the wheel and looked over his shoulder to me to say i discovered the telephone was here and turned around when i got back that other motorcar was coming up the drive like a bat from hades nearly ran down morton i stopped long enough to take him up and we went after it miss hes headed for somerset we followed him far enough to find out if he was returning to portsmouth but hes not somerset it was all i needed to hear hes going to kill my father i answered and told them what id found in the baldwin house i knew i should have turned back and called captain barclay once more but if my mother was on her way to longleigh house then iris and our cook were at home alone and god knew where my father was time was not on my side i could only hope that everyone had taken my warning seriously that captain barclay had given my message to my mother and simon it was more important to reach my home as quickly as i could and trust to captain barclays powers of persuasion at longleigh unless he had rashly set out to find me the cloud that had moved over the sun was thicker now joined by blacker ones moving onto the coast when i looked back there was a long stretch of intense gray and i thought i saw a flash of lightning the journey ahead was a long one and trelawney had lost time coming back for me but i was glad he had every mile seemed to drag on forever leaving me in an agony of impatience except for the cup of tea at dr glovers surgery i had had nothing to eat all day and neither had my companions we were well into somerset before we had to stop for petrol i dashed into the nearest shop for sandwiches and a thermos of tea while trelawney was seeing to the motorcar surely at some point ralph mitchell would be doing the same delaying him as we were delayed the storm was still behind us skirting the coast ahead was bright sunshine turning the somerset hills to a rich green as the road looped and ran straight then looped again following the contours of the land we were silent for the most part uneasy wondering if somewhere ahead of us ralph mitchell had found his target or had turned toward london when he had failed at a crossroads i saw captain barclay barreling down on us in dr gainess motorcar trelawney blew the horn and both vehicles drew up by the verge the captain got out and came limping toward us a frown on his face i thought you had no means of transport he said at once who the devil are these men and are you all right i was fortunate i said not taking the time to present my companions where is simon is he with my mother the sergeantmajor is on his way to london in search of your father i passed on your message but he has been ordered to follow up on what captain grayson reported alone he shouldnt be driving he persuaded your mother to drive him at least that meant she was out of harms way as well i could still see mrs palmer lying in the middle of her carpet bleeding heavily i shivered where are you going ill follow you no one has heard from my father no one had by the time i left he said he could be in london dover portsmouthscotland for that matter then we should go directly to my parents house sergeant mitchell will be there ahead of us but with luck hell wait for my father just as we will and we can stop him from walking into a trap bess are you sure about this im sure i dont know why he hates my father but if he shot julia palmer then hell certainly kill the colonel sahib if he can captain barclay cast an eye over private morton who stared back without a word the captain finally said i know you from somewhere i doubt it i intervened quickly but i could see that he was skeptical as he turned back toward his motorcar the sun was casting long shadows summer shadows across the landscape when i finally saw the chimneys of my home just ahead i asked trelawney to stop and shortly afterward captain barclay came up to the motorcar to ask how to proceed im not quite sure i said if you will lend me dr gainess motorcar ill drive up to the house meanwhile trelawney should stay here in the event weve got ahead of sergeant mitchell trelawney balked at that but i shook my head youre armed you can stop him meanwhile i went on captain if you and private morris will please go around to the rear of the house following that lane just there by the signpost it will take you only a few minutes of walking but if you come in that way he wont expect it it was reluctantly agreed upon and i got behind the wheel of the doctors motorcar and began to drive openly up to the house i found i was holding my breath as i rounded the last bend in the drive and could see the door directly ahead in the straightaway it stood open and two motorcars sat there before it both of them empty one was the vehicle that id last seen hurtling down the long line of hawthorn trees from the baldwin house and the other was the familiar motorcar my father drove my heart sank i was too late to prevent the encounter that id dreaded for the past seven hours chapter nineteen i braked then pulled dr gainess motorcar into the shelter of a stand of rhododendron which more or less hid it from view if anyone was watching for it id already been seen but i didnt care all i could think of was my father i reached the door without being challenged and i stood there listening for voices something to guide me to him there was only silence inside id already stepped into the hall when i heard my fathers voice from somewhere inside he was alive the relief was overwhelming i assure you i have no influence over sandhurst if you failed to pass the standards set by the staff i can neither change nor appeal their ruling in any way you were there another voice replied on the day i washed out i saw you captain baldwin didnt want me to marry his daughter and the best way to go about that was to see that i was not allowed to finish the course you give me far too much credit my father said drily but thats neither here nor there why did you try to kill my daughter because she discovered the body of major carson did she by god was the answer no i saw to it that the man who did was removed i wanted her for the same reason i killed carson to diminish you as youd diminished me besides hed married a woman named julia and every time i looked at him promising officer darling of the regiment i hated him indeed my father said in a tone of voice i knew all too well he was deeply furiously angry carson private wilson nurse saunders thats quite a list youve forgot palmer i killed him as well did you odd that ive never been told he was dead my fathers voice had come from his study if i called to him would mitchell shoot or wait for me to walk into the room i could feel the weight of the little pistol in my pocket if i used it i would very likely not kill mitchell but if i fired first i could very likely incapacitate him where was captain barclay was he inside the house yet or still trying to find his way up from the kitchen i began to walk as silently as i could down toward the study door i knew the spots where the floors creaked and my father was speaking covering any slight sound i might make and then i was by the door it was open i wished i knew where sergeant mitchell was standing he spoke and his voice was loud now i realized he must be very close if you have any prayers to say now is the time you might wish to pray for your wife and daughter i will find them you know i looked around the edge of the door my father was seated at his desk the sergeants back was to me but i could tell he held a revolver in his right hand the barrel just visible from where i stood my father long used to danger never registered my presence i brought out the small pistol lifted it and took aim i was almost too late my shot was fired a matter of seconds before the sergeants and it went into the shoulder of the arm holding the revolver he jerked but pulled the trigger anyway and i heard my father bite off a cry as the heavier bullet struck home i was already taking aim again this time with every intention of killing the man before me but before the sergeant could turn to face me there was another shot from behind me this time the report of a service revolver it spun sergeant mitchell around and the expression on his face was anger mixed with surprise and then he dropped like a stone i was already crossing the room to reach the colonel sahib i couldnt see where hed been shot there was no blood yet but he was looking down at his chest i thought he must be dying i wouldnt allow it i refused to accept it behind me captain barclay said hes all right bess in the same instant my father looked up he smiled at me and said that was too damned close for comfort i stared as he put a finger into a tidy little hole in his uniform just to the side of his chest sergeant mitchells shot had gone wide and to the left and then he was getting to his feet holding out his arms to me and without a word i went to him im all right my love truly i am he said holding me close but sergeant mitchell was not captain barclay was already bending over him and i left my father to kneel beside the wounded man morton came in just then hobbling toward the desk and trelawney was on his heels without looking up my hands busy with the sergeants tunic i said theres a doctor in the village near the inn called the four doves quickly trelawney said tersely ill go it was my duty to do for this man whatever i could to save his life if it was within my power id worked over german prisoners and felt no rancor but as i touched his flesh i had to shut my mind to what he had done to me and to my father to a kindly man like private wilson and even nurse saunders who had tried to be helpful and leave a message for his passenger or that tired courier who carried orders and dispatches behind the lines if he wanted the world to believe that his love for julia baldwin had driven him to murder then he was a liar mrs campbell who had committed adultery and been divorced by her husband knew more about love than ralph mitchell but i very badly wanted him to survive and be tried for what he had done nothing less would take away the stigma of suicide from private wilsons death or the charge of desertion from major carsons good name and so my mind and not my heart guided my hands the wound i had inflictedin the shoulderwas bleeding but not serious the chest woundcaptain barclays shotwas far more dangerous and i was hardpressed to stop the hemorrhaging by the time i had succeeded trelawney had brought dr everett from the village and we worked side by side for nearly half an hour and still the sergeant wasnt stable i was aware once of my father leaning over my shoulder to see what was being done i heard a quiet hmmpf which gave no indication of what he was thinking after a moment he touched my arm gently and then ushered everyone out of the study but the doctor and me i spared an anxious thought for hugh morton it was very likely that my father was now hearing an account from trelawney of that long journey from dorset and even if he suspected who private morton was he would say nothing in front of the others but trelawney knew and i was afraid that captain barclay might see some resemblance to ross morton in the sons face and jump to the right conclusion he was already suspicious but there was nothing i could do i worked in concert with dr everett following his lead it was touchandgo i thought twice that wed lost the sergeant but then he struggled to breathe again and his pulse steadied it wasnt until the doctor got to his feet and said i expect that will have to do that i was even certain the patient was going to live dr everett looked around as if suddenly aware that we were in the colonel sahibs study and he added let him rest for a little while and then well shift him to my surgery until its safe to take him farther afield your father seems to prefer dr gainess clinic at longleigh for difficult cases i cant say that i blame him perhaps london would be best when hes ready to be moved i said diplomatically my father will have sent for constable medford but i believe he considers this an army matter indeed that explains why your man trelawney was asking for medford all right london it is he looked down at my uniform go and change my dear ill stay with him medford can spell me grateful to escape from the study i thanked him in the passage outside i listened for the sound of voices and heard them coming from my mothers sitting room i tapped at the door then opened it as i stepped in four pairs of eyescaptain barclays my fathers trelawneys and constable medfordsturned my way my father rose and brought forward a chair for me there you are my dear come in will he live we believe he will good captain barclay said grimly trelawney said if youll excuse me sir id just as soon not let the sergeant out of my sight until hes in custody wounded or no constable medford said ill go with you he thanked my father nodded to me and accompanied trelawney into the passage i shut the door behind them and smiled at the colonel sahib he looked tired for that matter it had been a long and trying day for all of us but he was safe and that made up for everything else hed been studying my face as well he said now i believe the sergeantmajor will be very pleased to learn that you are as fine a shot as even he could have hoped captain barclay frowned uncertain how to take the remark but i understood it high praise from the colonel to his daughter i couldnt ask for better i was about to say something on the order of it appears that weve been very fortunate when i remembered that in all the excitement neither iris nor our cook had appeared julia palmers maid had been shot had sergeant mitchell got to them before he found my father dear god i ran out of the room and began to call but there was no answer i hurried down the back stairs to the kitchen my anxiety mounting and in nearly the last place i looked i found them they had locked themselves into the butlers pantry where my mother kept her tea service and table silver and other valuables i had called through the door heard nothing and was about to head for the attics when the heavy key turned and they came out faces pale and eyes wide whats happened miss did we hear gunshots is everyone all right how did you know to lock yourselves in i asked did my father warn you oh no miss we talked about your telephone call then your mother telephoned from the clinic and told us not to go to the door if anyone came when i heard a motorcar coming up the drive we decided to come down here and stay until help arrived from the way the two motorcars had been left in the drive my father had arrived first and he must have gone into the study without any warning that sergeant mitchell was on his way i felt ill thinking about it surely hed seen the color of the mans eyes when he came through the study door surely that had alerted him to his danger private morton was waiting when i came back up the stairs i thought after so much exertion he must be in great pain and i said its best if you stay out of sight let the doctor look at your wound and then ill find a way to get you to wales as soon as its safe no one will think to look for you in the footmans old rooms theyve been empty since the war began i want to go back to france he said i dont know why i thought my father would want a coward creeping home even to work the farm can you find a way to get me there and a satisfactory explanation for my disappearance i dont want to be shot for deserting much as i deserve it id be grateful ive let everyone down i cant live with that i wondered what had made him change his mind and he answered that without my asking i must have run mad but i thought he had felt like so many men had that the only end to their suffering would be death and home seemed so very far away and unreachable chapter twenty it wasnt until much later that my father and i could talk quietly sergeant mitchell had been removed from this house and iris was already on her hands and knees scrubbing his blood out of the carpet shed taken an instant dislike to him as he was being carried out the door on a makeshift stretcher with trelawney constable medford and dr everett hovering in the background vicious thats what he is i could see it in his face i wasnt certain that she could for his eyes were for a mercy closed again id seen the look of absolute hatred in them when i had stepped into the study to tell dr everett that the ambulance had arrived he hadnt got what he wanted after all sergeant mitchell and i was quite happy to be the person who had thwarted him we were sitting together in my mothers morning room the colonel had personally searched the motorcar the sergeant had been driving and he had found the name of the true owner as well as an officers kit that sergeant mitchell had brought to england with him as part of his disguise he opened it now and i saw that beneath the extra clothing it contained personal itemstoothbrush and powder shaving brush and straight razor a cake of soap the small box of thread and needles that most soldiers carried with them several boiled sweets and a silver frame with a photograph of the girl left behind in england a very young julia baldwin digging deeper my father found an oiled packet he pulled it out and opened it there was a worn testament on top and under it a book bound in moroccan leather even that wasnt unusual for many soldiers as well as officers carried a favorite volume with them shakespeare a treasury of english verse the works of a favorite poetit varied with each mans taste something to read during the crushing boredom waiting for the next attack or to steady the nerves in the long hours before an assault the colonel sahib took out the volume opened it at random and then seemed to be riveted by what he could see written on the page opposite him i sat and waited its a journal he said slowly and if im right about the handwriting it belonged to vincent he leafed through a few more pages and then passed it to me i also chose a page at random and read next to the date attack came just before dawn there followed every scrap of information he could remember the length of the attack the number of germans in each wave ground won or lost which german regiment had been involved number of casualties on both sides weather conditions whether or not gas was used how many men were sent to the aid station whether there had been air or artillery support and finally strength in numbers remaining after the attack it was an impressive accounting and i could see why my father had believed that vincent carson would one day be the colonel turning a few more pages i discovered a copy of a letter written to julia i didnt read it instead i went to the beginning of the journal to see what name was inscribed on the board but there was none only a scribble that seemed to make no senseunless one had been in india and recognized it it was the date when vincent carson received his commission written in hindi and below that a copy of the inscription on a sword that hung in the officers mess wherever the regiment was stationed no evening ended without a toast repeating it i die at the pleasure of my god i serve at the pleasure of my king it was as personal as a signature sergeant mitchell a farmers son from dorset had never served in india but vincent carson had with this journal in the sergeants possession we could show positively that he had killed the major after a moment i said julia will be pleased to have it but what of the other juliajulia palmer did her father know she was being courted by sergeant mitchell before she met lieutenant palmer i doubt it it was my doing that young palmer went to dorset in the first place and he was most persuasive captain baldwin agreed to come out of retirement sadly it cost him his life we were fairly certain captain baldwin was murdered in but we could never discover who his killer was until now thats why the cause of death was listed as a zeppelin raid yes we didnt want it to be generally known and simons spy whats become of him im afraid youll have to ask mi about that which if you did would see you shot at dawn in the tower theyve been damned quiet on the subject i expect nothing came of it well at least the prince of wales is safe hes on his way to the front now as a matter of fact you can see why it was worrying and mother how do we explain the damp spot on the study carpet where iris has been scrubbing away at a bloodstain wed better tell her the truth shell find it out anyway i smiled now about portsmouth and the man i reportedly saw trying to climb aboard merlin presumably from a small boat in the harbor it was some weeks later when i drove back to cheddar gorge during a few brief days of leave mrs wilson was busy in her garden and i saw her tense as she looked around to see who it was in the motorcar stopping before her gates she recognized me at once and made me welcome but i could see new lines in her face and i thought she had lost weight it gave me great pleasure to tell her that the man who had killed her husband was almost well enough to stand trial for his murder it wouldnt bring private wilson home again but i had kept my promise to her and her daughter would no longer have to grow up as the child of a suicide there would also be a pension to help with the farming she made tea for me while i petted toby the cat cried into the handkerchief i handed her and as i left gave me a round of aged cheddar to take home to my mother i thought about captain barclay as i drove back to somerset he was in france finally i didnt think his leg would ever heal fully but it had mended well enough to return to duty he wrote often and in his latest letter told me a little of what he felt about rejoining his men there are so many new faces bess replacements for the dead and the wounded but my old sergeant is still here and lieutenant britton theyve survived against all odds and im very happy to be back where i belong god bless dr gaines he worked something of a miracle but i thought perhaps it was not trying quite so hard that had helped his leg heal id also had a message from private morton he was alive and well back with his regiment and had not forgot his promise to visit sabrina one day i hoped he survived the war i found simon waiting for me in somerset he was still in london when i returned to france shortly after id given my statements to the dorset police and to scotland yard and finally to the army according to my mothers letters he was nearly recovered back in his cottage and impatient to return to duty greeting me on his doorstep he said its been some time he looked well and id seen no twinge of pain as hed opened the door to me the shoulder must have healed completely it has indeed i said lightly i put the kettle on when i saw you walking down the lane tea please i came in and sat down by the window overlooking the back garden it was a pretty place to sit the sunlight coming through the panes and spilling across my lap we were silent for a time waiting for the kettle to boil and then the teapot to brew simon handed me my cup i havent thanked you properly for saving my life it was dr hicks and dr gaines who did that their skill nevertheless he brought his cup and leaned his shoulder against the mantelpiece as he drank you were right about not going back to france i said finally but for the wrong reasons i know mother has told me that it was arranged for lieutenant palmer to have compassionate leave my father saw to that im sure trelawney wrote to say that mrs palmer is much better yes thats good news we thought at first that mitchell had killed the lieutenant as well and julia has agreed to settle a sum on sabrina she and her son will be able to live comfortably wherever they choose thats to say if sabrina will accept the gift but i think she will my mothers hand there he nodded i set my cup aside wed come to the real reason id wanted to speak to simon today he already knew what i was about to say but i needed to talk about it sergeant mitchell will certainly be found guilty on all charges still im told he claims that julia palmer had so turned his mind with her promises that he went mad and didnt know what he had done it had nothing whatsoever to do with madness bess hes the sort of man who wanted his own way and when he didnt get it he blamed everyone around him your father had nothing to do with the decision to ask mitchell to leave sandhurst but he looked up mitchells record and it was dismal the man had trouble following orders and taking responsibility for what he didor failed to do he killed so many people they got in his way it was a rather sobering evaluation but simon was right no one set sergeant mitchell on the road to murder cold comfort all the same to his victims and id nearly been one of them simon collected the cups and took them through to the kitchen setting them in the sink when he came back he said with a grimness unusual to him if you want my view he will pay too easily for all he has done hed known captain baldwin and major carson hed seen how close id come to dying and my father as well this man had not only struck at the regiment but he had struck at the crawfords personally and simon hadnt been there there would be no forgiveness on offer that could ever change his feelings about that he held out his hand changing the subject its too fair a day to sit here lets walk for a while shall we about the author charles todd is the author of the inspector ian rutledge
