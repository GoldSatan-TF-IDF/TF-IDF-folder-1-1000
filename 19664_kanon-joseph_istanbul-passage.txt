joseph kanon istanbul passage for david kanon my istanbul companion michael kanon my music maker bebek the first attempt had to be called off it had taken days to arrange the boat and the safe house and then just a few hours before the pickup the wind started a poyraz howling down from the northeast scooping up water as it swept across the black sea the bosphorus waves usually no higher than boat wakes by the time they reached the shuttered yalis along the shore now churned and smashed against the landing docks from the quay leon could barely make out the asian side strings of faint lights hidden behind a scrim of driving rain who would risk it even the workhorse ferries would be thrown off schedule never mind a bribed fishing boat he imagined the fisherman calculating his chances a violent sea sightless hoping the sudden shape forty meters away wasnt a lumbering freighter impossible to dodge or another day safe in port securing ropes and drinking plum brandy by the castiron stove who could blame him only a fool went to sea in a storm the passenger could wait days of planning called by the weather how much longer mihai said pulling his coat tighter they were parked just below rumeli hisari watching the moored boats tossing pulling against their ties give it another half hour if hes late and im not here hes not late mihai said dismissive he glanced over hes that important i dont know im just the delivery boy its freezing mihai said turning on the motor this time of year leon smiled in istanbuls dream of itself it was always summer ladies eating sherbets in garden pavilions caïques floating by the city shivered through winters with braziers and sweaters somehow surprised that it had turned cold at all mihai ran the heater for a few minutes then switched it off burrowing turtlelike into his coat so come with me but no questions leon rubbed his hand across the window condensation clearing it theres no risk to you wonderful something new you couldnt do this yourself hes coming out of constancia for all i know he only speaks romanian then what sign language but you mihai waved this off hell be german one of your new friends you dont have to do this its a small favor ill get it back he lit a cigarette so that for a second leon could see his grizzled face and the wiry saltandpepper hair on his head now more salt than pepper when they had met it had been dark and wavy styled like the bucharest dandy hed once been known in all the cafés on the calea victoriei besides to see the rats leaving he said brooding they wouldnt let us out now look at them you did what you could a palestinian passport free to come and go in bucharest to beg for funds leasing creaky boats a last lifeline until that was taken away too mihai drew on the cigarette staring at the water running down the windshield so how is it with you he said finally you look tired leon shrugged not answering why are you doing this mihai turned to face him the wars over yes nobody told me no they want to start another one nobody i know be careful you dont get to like it you start enjoying it his voice trailed off rough with smoke the accent still balkan even now then its not about anything anymore a habit like these he said holding out his cigarette you get a taste for it leon looked at him and you nothing changes for us were still saving jews he made a wry face now from our friends no visas for palestine where should they go poland and im helping you talk to a nazi a wonderful world why a nazi why all this some poor refugee no someone who knows the russians i think and who knows better youre guessing it doesnt matter to you what you deliver leon looked away then down at his watch well hes not coming tonight whoever he is id better call make sure theres a café mihai leaned forward to start the car again ill pull around no stay here i dont want the car i see you run across the road in the rain get wet then you run back again wet to a waiting car that will be less suspicious if anyone is watching he put the car in gear its your car leon said thats all you think they havent seen it by now have they youd know he said a question always assume yes he made a turn across the road pulling up in front of the café so do the expected thing stay dry tell me something if he had come your package was i going to drive him towherever hes staying no mihai nodded better he motioned his head to the side window make the call before they wonder there were four men playing dominoes and sipping tea from tulip glasses when they looked up leon became what he wanted them to seea ferengi caught in the rain shaking water from his hat needing a phoneand he flushed a little pulse of excitement a taste for it had mihai seen it somehow the way it felt getting away with something the planning the slipping away tonight hed taken the tram to the last stop in bebek and walked up to the clinic a trip hed made over and over if hed been followed theyd stay parked a block away from the clinic gates and wait relieved to be snug out of the rain knowing where he was but just past the big oleander bushes hed headed for the garden side gate doubling back to the bosphorus road where mihai was waiting feeling suddenly free almost exhilarated no one would have seen him in the dark if they were there theyd be smoking bored thinking he was inside this other life just walking to the car was all his own the phone was on the wall near the wc no sounds in the room but the click of tiles and the hiss of boiling water so the token seemed to clang going in a ferengi speaking english the men would say if anyone asked tommy at home luckily not out to dinner ah i was hoping youd call he said a genial club voice with the clink of ice at the back of it youre after that reporti know i knowand my steno never showed trouble with the boats typical isnt it first hint of weather and the ferries leon imagined his round face at the other end the jawline filling in fleshy i can have it for you tomorrow all right i mean the contracts all right were just waiting for the quotas ive had american tobacco on the phone half the day so youre all in the same boat on this one all we need now are the signatures at commercial corp the wartime agency that was tommys cover at the consulate thats all right im stuck here at the clinic anyway just wanted to check if it was on its way no tomorrow now sorry about this let me make it up to you buy you a drink at the park an off note this late im in bebek ill get a head start an order then dont worry ill roll you home their standard joke leons apartment building just down the hill from the park hotel before aya paşa made its wide curve give me an hour from bebek surprised an edge now take a look outside itll be a crawl in this just save me a stool the domino players were looking down pretending not to listen but what would they have made of it anyway leon ordered a tea a way of thanking the barman for the phone the glass was warm in his hand and he realized he was cold everywhere else the wet beginning to seep through his shoes and now the park everyone looking and not looking tommys oldboy voice getting louder with each drink rain check he said to mihai getting into the car you free tomorrow mihai nodded somethings up were having a drink at the park very exciting the tobacco business leon smiled it used to be in fact it had been sleepy as routine and predictable as a book of hours agents bought the cured latakia leaf and he arranged the shipments then took the train to ankara to get the export permits leave haydarpaşa at six arrive the next morning at ten thats how it had started carrying things on the train for tommy papers they couldnt put in the diplomatic pouch something for the war effort no money involved then an american helping out not just standing around at the club getting drunk with socony and liggett myers and western electric the men interchangeable lucky businessmen sitting out the war tommy asked him to help commercial corp buy up chromium so the germans wouldnt get it and suddenly he was in the war after all the peculiar one that played out over dinner at abdullahs or those consulate receptions where the sides lined up on either end of the room cocktail wars what surprised him later when he knew more was how many others were in it too tracking shipping through the straits collecting gossip turning a commercial attaché who needed the money everyone spinning webs watching one another the turkish emniyet watching them nothing sleepy anymore ill drop you home youll want to change no just back to the village i want to go to the clinic look in mihai waited until they were almost there how is she the same leon said his voice neutral and then there was nothing to say still hed asked anna was still alive to him a presence not just someone in obstbaums clinic who had retreated into herself gone somewhere behind her own eyes people used to ask all the timepainful questions at the club an awkward concern at the officebut gradually they began to forget she was still there out of sight out of mind except leons a wound that wouldnt close any day she might come back just as quickly as she had gone away someone had to be there waiting you know what i think mihai said what sometimes i think you do this for her to prove something i dont know what leon was quiet not answering do you still talk to her mihai said finally yes tell her we got a boat out shell like that past the british patrols so far otherwise wed be in cyprus tell her three hundred we saved three hundred he took the same side street back the same garden entrance hed expected to have to ring but the door was unlocked and he frowned annoyed the staff had been so careless but no one was trying to get out and who would want to get in the clinic was really a kind of nursing home a place to be out of the way dr obstbaum had been one of the german refugees welcomed by atatürk in the thirties to help the new republic get up on its feet the ones who could afford it had moved to bebek or closer in ortaköy where hillsides covered in fir trees and lindens may have reminded them of home or maybe lemminglike they had simply followed the first settler most of the clinics medical staff was still german which leon had thought might help her own language something she would understand if she was still listening but of course the nurses the people who bathed her and fed her and chattered around her were turkish so in the end he realized it didnt matter and now he worried that she was more isolated than ever dr obstbaum himself encouraged leon to talk we have no idea what she hears this form of melancholiait may be a matter of responding not awareness her brain hasnt shut down otherwise she wouldnt be breathing or have any motor functions the idea is to keep up the level of activity over time maybe it grows so music does she hear it i dont know but the brain does somewhere something functions not disturbing music but things she knew had played at home lovely notes to fill the silence in her if she heard them most of the time i think im talking to myself leon had said everyone here talks to himself obstbaum had said a puckish joke one of lifes great pleasures evidently you at least are being asked its late the nurse said in turkish a hushed whisper her eyes glancing down to the water dripping from his coat is she asleep ill just say goodnight im sorry about but the nurse was already opening the door brusque the clients whims no business of hers hed sit and talk the way he always did and shed have to check back again another round but it was a private clinic and he was paying anna was lying in bed the room shadowy only a dim nightlight on when he touched her hand she opened her eyes but looked at him without recognition it was the disconcerting thing the way she took in what was happening around her without responding having her hair brushed people moving across the roomthings happened far away just little blurs of movement how are you feeling he said warm enough theres a terrible storm he nodded toward the french windows the sound of rain on the glass she didnt say anything but he no longer expected her to even her hand didnt touch back when he talked he answered for her silent responses to keep things going sometimes sitting next to her hed actually hear her voice in his head a ghost conversation even worse than talking to himself but this is nice isnt it he said indicating the room cozy gemütlich as if a change of language would matter he let her hand go and sat down in the chair when they first met shed never seemed to stop talking bubbling over switching from german to english as if one language couldnt contain it everything she had to say and her eyes had been everywhere ahead of the words sometimes waiting for them to catch up lighting her face the odd thing was that the face was still her own stopped in time the wonderful skin the soft line of her cheek everything just the way it always had been aging itself put off while she was away only the eyes were different vacant i saw mihai tonight he sends his love he said they got a boat through people are getting out again something that might register what she cared about dont try to startle her obstbaum had said just ordinary things domestic matters but how did obstbaum know had he been to where she lived now did it matter to her that fatma had been ill sent her sister to do the cleaning three hundred he said so they must be operating again mossad who else could it be a boat that big he stopped the last thing he should have said a reminder obstbaum thought it had happened then when the bratianu sank corpses bobbing in the water children her brain turning away from it drawing a curtain obstbaum had even suggested she be put in a garden room not a front one facing the bosphorus where ships passed all day each one a possible reminder leon had gone along with him everyone in istanbul wanted to see the waterin ottoman times there had been laws about builders blocking the viewso a garden room was cheaper and it was pleasant looking toward the hillside cypresses and umbrella pines and a judas tree that dropped pink blossoms in the spring a fortune back home but something he could manage here and not a boat in sight i thought i might need romanian they bring someone out but they dont tell you who they want me to babysit i got georgs old landlord to find me a room out near aksaray theyll never think to look in a muslim neighborhood and then the weather started up he caught himself hearing the sound of his voice saying names out loud telling her what he didnt want anyone to know all the slipping away and doublebacking for nothing it occurred to him one more irony that since she had gone away they could finally talk to each other all the things they couldnt say before other peoples secrets now safe to talk about some things anyway now there were other drawers you didnt open things you didnt say your parents are dead we havent heard but they must be theyre not on any lists you cant imagine what it was like how many the pictures i see a woman just for the sex it used to feelwrongand now i wait for it not like us something different i dont think youre ever coming back i cant say itcant say it to youbut i think its true i dont know why this happened to us what i did what you did better to keep those drawers closed i ran into gus hoover soconys sending him home you still cant get a boat though so what do you think theyre putting him on the clipper hell of a lot of money but i guess theyve got it to spend can you see reynolds doing it for me not that i want to go but you always wanted to didnt you see new york he paused leaving time for an answer maybe when youre better we cant really move you now like this and i can take care of you here he motioned his hand to the room you could get better here he paused again maybe if youd try obstbaum says it isnt a question of that but what if it is you could try everything could be the way it was better the wars over all the terrible things knowing as he said it that they werent overpeople still in camps boats still being turned around everything she had gone away to escape still happening what was there to come back for him the drawer he shouldnt open was it my fault another casualty of the war obstbaum had said but what if she had left the world to leave him something only she knew and wasnt coming back to answer not ever gus would fly home all the others and he would still be here talking to himself while she stared at the garden you have to be patient obstbaum had said the mind is like an eggshell it can withstand tremendous pressure but if it cracks its not so easy to put it back together a humpty dumpty explanation as good as any other but it was leon who was sitting here his world that had been cracked open i have to go soon tommy wants to have a drink at the park on a night like this not that rain ever kept tommy from a drink still you know what occurred to me he wants to bring me inside run my own operation i mean a job like this tonight its not messenger work anymore thered be money in it its about time he babbling filling time do you have everything you need he got up and went over to the bed putting his hand on the dark hair fanning out beneath her lightly just grazing it because there was something unreal about physical contact now touching someone who wasnt there and there was always a moment when he flinched apprehensive expecting her to reach up and snatch at his hand finally mad he passed the back of his hand over her forehead a soothing motion and she closed her eyes to it looking for a second the way she used to after they made love drifting get some sleep he said quietly ill be back but not tomorrow in the beginning hed come every night a kind of vigil but then days slid by filled with other things because the worst part was that without even wanting to hed begun to leave her too outside he walked through the village to the shore road glancing at parked cars but he wouldnt see them would he not if they were any good after a while you developed an instinct the turkish police had been clumsy when anna worked with mihai theyd park someone in the lobby of the continental where mossad had its office a bored policeman in a business suit who must have thought himself invisible behind the cigarette smoke the work had been openarranging visas for the weekly train to baghdad the overland route to palestine just a trickle of refugees but legal the police watched anna go to the red crescent offices watched her check the manifest lists at sirkeci watched the transfer to haydarpaşa a pattern so familiar they never thought to look anywhere else when the illegal work began mihais boats they were still following anna to sirkeci still smoking in the lobby later her work became a cover for leon too it was the jewish wife working for mossad who needed watching not her american husband once hed been playing tennis at the sümer palas in tarabya when a man he assumed to be police wanted a quiet word his wife no doubt well meaning but her activities were attracting attention turkey was a neutral country they were its guests it was a husbands duty to watch over his household nobody wanted to be embarrassed not the rj reynolds company not the turkish government leon remembered standing speechless in front of the old hotel staring at the famous hydrangea bushes trying not to smile to savor the unexpected gift anna suspect not him but that had been the locals the emniyet the security police were something else never obvious part of the air everyone breathed playing the home advantage when macfarland had been station head he was convinced theyd planted somebody inside which would mean they might know about leon too even unofficial off the books tommy didnt just pull the money out of his pocket where would they find him miscellaneous expenses jobs tommy wanted to freelance out like tonight the square was empty no tram in sight just two women huddled under umbrellas waiting for a dolmus and then improbably there was a single taxi maybe out here on a run from taksim leon stopped it glancing over his shoulder as he got in half expecting to see headlights turning on a car starting up but no one followed he looked out back only a thin line of traffic everyone chased inside by the rain in arnavutköy a car pulled in behind then went off again leaving them alone no one unless the taxi was emniyet but then the driver started to complain about something the details lost in the swoosh of the windshield wipers and leon gave that up too so much for instinct maybe he hadnt had to do any of itsneak out of the clinic meet mihai in the road maybe no one watched anymore maybe mihai was right it had become a habit tommy had already had a few by the time leon got to the park his face red cheeks shining with it his broad shoulders still had the strong lines of someone whod once played for penn but the rest of him had gone slack pudgy from years of sitting and extra helpings christ youre soaking whatd you do walk here take the chill off mehmet how about two more of the same well have them over there he said lifting himself off the stool with a little grunt and heading for a small table against the woodpaneled wall there were more people than leon had expected probably hotel guests who didnt want to go out but still plenty of empty tables the long outside terrace with its view of the stamboul headland had been closed for weeks leon remembered it full waiters with trays darting in and out like birds people talking over each other looking around to see who was there what the stork must be like sorry about tonight tommy said didnt know myself till i got the message there wont be any problem about the place will there no ive got it for the month i didnt know how long hed the month how much is that going to run us its in laleli cheap you can afford it laleli where the fucks that on the asian side leon smiled how long have you been here tommy shrugged this off and what do we do with it after we move him you could take your women there nice and private yeah just us and the fleas ah here we are he said as the drinks arrived thank you mehmet he raised his glass blue skies and clear sailing leon raised his glass and took a sip cold and crisp a whiff of juniper mehmet put down a silver bowl of pistachios and backed away christ imagine what hes heard tommy said watching him go all these years maybe he doesnt listen they all listen the question is who for besides us tommy ignored this they used to say every waiter in this room got paid twice and sometimes more at the same time remember the one used to send little love notes to von papen then turn around and feed the same thing to the brits he shook his head amused six months he pulls this off you have to hand it to him what good did it do anybody ever say anything at the park that you wanted to know tommy smiled you live in hope you live in hope anyway that wasnt the point was it point was to know what they were saying what they werent saying might be useful to somebody who could put the pieces together you think there was somebody like that christ i hope so otherwise he let it go ill tell you something though it was fun too this place goddam threering circus everybody same room packy macfarland over there and that kraut who kept pretending he was in the navy right next to him navy and the jap tashima remember him with the glasses a spit of fucking tojo at first i thought it was him and mehmets listening to all of them the good old days tommy looked up caught by his tone come on tommy its a little early for last rites at the park mehmets still listening god knows who else for what its worth tommy shook his head its finished this place leon looked around feeling the drink a little well the germans are gone and tojo thats what we wanted to happen right i mean the whole place neutral city in a wareverybodys got an interest turks coming in staying out whats everybody up to now what now its just going to be turks youve still got me meeting boats leon said finishing his glass were still here not for long what do you mean tommy looked away then raised his hand to signal for another round youre going home leon guessed we need to talk thats why were having the drink not a new job tommy nodded theyre rolling up the operation dont react which operation here all of us well most you washington you know september they handed us over to the war department couldnt get rid of bill fast enough i guess what g wanted all along r a went to state whole unit now theyre research intelligence office of but the field whats the war department going to do with field officers wars over tell that to the russians leon said thats europe not here christ leon you didnt think wed just keep going here forever did you after the war he said his tone slightly defensive ah mehmet making room for the new drinks some banter leon didnt hear as he watched tommys face the red cheeks moving as he talked knowing it was coming arranging his own transfer taking care of business a desk at the war department or something closer to the mayflower bar he looked down at the fresh drink his stomach queasy now what back to the desk at reynolds days without edge when does this happen end of the month just like that what about me you i thought youd be glad its over you never wanted i had to talk you into it remember though i have to say you took right to it best i had you know that dont you that i always thought that he moved his hand as if he were about to put it on leons but stopped i could put in a word for youi mean knowing turkish thats something but theyre closing the shop here everything back to g and you dont want to join the army do you he looked over the brim of his glass its time to go home leon owis already packed up everybodys going home i havent been back to the states inwhat ten years now you dont want to stay here whats here my life get reynolds to transfer you back be a big shot in the tobacco business would they an office in a long corridor of offices sharing a secretary not his own corner overlooking taksim a house in raleigh with a small yard not the flat on aya paşa looking all the way to the sea of marmara anna where he shook his head i dont want to move anna shes doing so well now real progress a move now the lie effortless one of the reasons hed been the best shed do even better in the states if you ask me they could do something for her there hospitals here he stopped you look all funny what is it the money the money leon snorted what you pay thats not enough to notice just enough to make a difference its the drink i guess he said pushing it away im beat all the waiting around he looked up feeling tommy staring at him alert behind the glassy eyes i never did it for money you know i know i appreciate that im surprised were pulling out thats all be a little dull pushing paper at the office want to push some more theyre going to need somebody at western electric middle east accountthe whole territory guy in charge now is leaving for washington so i hear you had someone at western too now now like to keep your bets all over the table dont you separate drawers separate secrets safer that way youll be running out of covers soon no more lendlease no more owi western electric even the guy in the tobacco business what guy leon smiled im going to miss you i guess when do you go as soon as we can arrange air transport for our friend the one who got seasick tonight youre going with him we dont want him to travel alone he might get lost we just need to park him here for a day or so then all your troubles are over but while youve got himwell i dont have to tell you its not as if youve never done this before just be careful always with this one i mean lots of people want to talk to him so all the old rules he doesnt go out he doesnt i know the rules tommy if youre that nervous why dont you pick him up yourself spread the bets leon this time im not even at the table nothing to see nothing to connect me i just pack up my bags and leave you run into people on the plane thats all but i cant put him there the board would light up im not invisible here and i am youre freelance they wont be expecting that not for him whats he got that you have to take him to washington yourself leon you owe me that much tommy looked at him for a minute then downed the rest of his drink lots he said finally nodding up here he touched his temple also a very nice photo album of mother russia aerial recon the germans photographed everything when they still could valuable snaps now and he got these how that i couldnt say fell off a truck maybe things do want another leon shook his head id better go start being invisible here finish this well since im paying leon stood up some evening tomorrow then one more and youre a free man leon looked at him disconcerted by the phrase who is he tommy hell answer to john as in johann german as in john doe he glanced up no funny business okay let washington ask the questions just do your piece therell be a bonus in it if i can talk them into it i dont care about that thats right good of the country still think of it asi dont know for old times sake he turned his head to the room you coming ill just finish this give the place one last look goddam threering circus wasnt it he said his voice drooping like his eyes maudlin leon picked up his damp coat by the way tommy said sharp again separate pieces but where the hells laleli past the university before you get to aksaray christ who goes out there thats the idea it was still raining hard enough to get wet again and he was shivering when he got home the cihangir apartments just down aya paşa from the park had been put up in the twenties and still had a few moderne touches in the lobby but the plaster had begun to chip a sign of larger decay to come reynolds had bought a company flat here because it had central heating a luxury but fuel shortages had kept the radiators tepid all during the war and now leon relied on space heaters a few rows of toaster coils barely strong enough to warm your hands the elevator was sporadic hot water came through the geyser in a trickle so that it was cool by the time the tub had filled none of it mattered the first time he and anna had come to the flat a ritual handing over of keys all they saw was the window with its view across the rooftops of cihangir past the mosques at kabataş and findikli to the open mouth of the bosphorus alive with boats on a clear day you could see leanders tower the green park at topkapi that first year theyd sit with a drink after work and watch the ferries crossing to asia the freighters passing up the strait there was no balcony just the window a private movie screen youll like it here perkins had said a little wistful of course it helps if youre handy yourself mr cicek thats the buildingwell manager i suppose not much with a wrench with anything really so if you need something oh its wonderful just the way it is anna had said eyes fixed on the view how can you bear to leave it but that was when everything was new istanbul something almost magical after germany somewhere you could breathe leon remembered the very first day stepping out of sirkeci station into a swarm of motorbikes the smell of frying fish trays piled with simits balanced on vendors heads boats crowding the eminönü piers everything noisy and sunlit in the taxi crossing galata bridge he had turned back to look at sinans graceful minarets pricking the sky and at that moment a flock of birds rose up swooping around the dome of the yeni mosque then diving back to the water rippling with light and leon thought it was the most wonderful place he had ever seen during those first weeks they didnt see the old wooden houses listing and creaking from neglect the backstreets with clumps of garbage and mud cracked fountains seeping moss they saw color heaps of spices everything that wasnt germany and water everywhere a city where you took ferries just to be out on it looking at domes and spires not the crooked dirty streets anna wanted to see everything the famous sights then things she found in books the camondo stairs twisting down galata hill the castiron bulgarian church the byzantine mosaics out near the old city walls where they could eat picnics on the yellow grass looking up at giant stork nests in the ruins their building had been fronted with sunny lemon plaster then a confection the plane trees in the median shading aya paşa that was before the grime had settled in the edges the white trim faded before anything had happened to them there was a small pile of mail on the floor just inside the door pushed through the slot by cicek did he glance at them first report anything interesting but these days not much came no air letters from home no thick envelopes with consular seals when he and anna had been a new couple in town invitations fell in clumps through the doortennis parties drinks parties receptions the endless social life of the european community then after she got sick he noticed the thinning out events one could attend alone sometimes just bills or nothing at all he picked up the mailat least one invitation a thick envelopethen shivered again a chill that didnt stop at the door he went over and switched on the space heater stood next to it and opened the envelope a party at lilys something to look forward to piles of food and the yali warm even this time of year fuel never a problem for the rich a woman who had actually been in the sultans harem something out of the last century now serving cocktails to modern turks who still left their wives home one more istanbul paradox he looked down as usual the coils were glowing without producing any heat at least get out of the wet clothes he went to the bathroom stripping on the way the clothes sticking to him when he reached for his bathrobe he shuddered with cold almost a spasm chilled to the bone not just an expression he threw the clothes over the shower rod to dry then wrapped the robe tighter and went back out to the drinks table to pour a brandy you dont want to get sick not before a job which tommy could easily have done himself putting john doe up at the consulate safe out of sight until the plane was ready why involve leon at all a bonus in it for you if you do your piece the brandy burned as it went down the only heat in the room but why do it in pieces anyway unless he didnt want anybody at the consulate to know didnt even want his own office to know im not invisible no connection until they were on the plane together a german with photographs important enough maybe to get tommy a bigger desk in washington planning it you were the best i had a cheap compliment while he looked out for himself and leon went back to buying tobacco he went through the rest of the mail a utility bill a circular for madetoorder suits and a card from georg ritter a namesake knight on the front on the back a pen drawing of a chessboard a game this week thursday tomorrow well not thursday hed have to call which georg could have done why send a card when you could just pick up the phone but a call was an intrusion you could ignore a card just not respond if youd rather not the formal manners part of georgs way of dealing with the world as if the past fifty years had never happened calling cards notes a pneumatique if they still existed even his flat with its heavy furniture and meissen figurines a relic of old europe hed been fond of anna a kind of substitute father and now like an aging parent was becoming easy to neglect he shouldnt have to be sending cards gentle reminders a game once a week some gossip just being companyit wasnt a lot to ask call tomorrow and set a date he put the invitation on the piano the upright georg had found for them keys dusted in tune ready for her to play again during the war it had been mendelssohn because you couldnt play him in germany jüdische musik anna thumbing her nose at the nazis with lieder along the piano top was the row of framed photographs leon had come to think of as his war memorial annas parents dressed for a walk in the tiergarten the last picture theyd sent before they were taken away anna herself mouth open in laughter when she still had words phil kneeling with the ground crew on an airstrip somewhere in the pacific the propellers just behind their heads his unexpected baby brother so many years between them that they had never been friends and then suddenly were the only family each of them had the telegram had come to him the only one left missing in action over new guinea then months later a letter from an officer whod survived the japanese camp who wanted leon to know that phil had been brave to the end whatever that meant maybe a samurai sword to the back of the neck maybe dysentery anyway gone leons last tie to america and yet oddly losing phil had pulled him closer to it wanting to be part of it even carrying papers for tommy as if that would help somehow like a ground mechanic who checked the oil and waited for the others to come back he draped an afghan over his shoulders and sat next to the electric fire one of your new friends mihai had guessed now on a vip ticket to washington what would anna have said who else would have reconnaissance pictures a nazi or a thief your new friends not what he imagined doing when it had started an innocent train to ankara then dinner at karpićs to leave the papers no need to go to the embassy just in town on business and then tommy had other things for him you have a gift for languages hed said who picks up turkish and kraut leons grandfathers legacyenglish at school german at home you should be proudthe language of schiller but of course he wasnt hiding it from his friends an embarrassment until one day it got him a job not paris where he wanted to go but still overseas and paid in dollars one job to another hamburg then berlin where he met anna after that the trips home became less frequent and then when his mother died there was no reason to go they stayed in berlin until kristallnacht when annas parents in a panic pleaded with him to take her to new york they would follow as soon as things could be arranged but when would that be an ocean between them something final and then almost a fluke the reynolds job came up somewhere safe but still close enough to help get them out you could take a train there viennasofiaistanbul twice a week but they never did delaying until no one got out unless they were rescued unless anna and mihai somehow got them on one of their boats anna never stopped trying even after they couldnt be found two more who had disappeared and leon had started working for tommy his own way of helping fighting nazis and now he was hiding them he looked at the window still blurry with water what if it hadnt rained tonight what if john doe had made it through would tommy have told him about the pictures any of it just do your piece while i make plans it wasnt the money there were always ways to get more money but the end of things just like that he shivered again now a chill that wouldnt go away but something else too an uneasiness about what maybe just the quiet with the windows closed there were no soundsno foghorns on the water or even cars grinding up the steep streets below when he struck a match he could hear it a loud rasp he pulled the afghan tighter an old man huddling in front of the fire but not exactly a fire and not really old yet either too old to be asked back to washington tommy was going nagging at him take a pill and get into bed under annas old duvet always warm he went into the bathroom about to open the medicine chest and stopped the same mirror he used every morning but someone else in it when had that happened it wasnt the gray hair or the tired eyes he looked the same more or less something worse a sense of time running out why hadnt tommy ordered a backup that was one of the rules not even ask for the safe house address careless his mind already on the plane leaving leon behind to mop up im not invisible here then why have a drink in the most visible place in istanbul to tell leon he was leaving but he could have done that after why even make contact before the job was finished to be in mehmets report somebodys tommy king spent the evening getting soused with a business colleague at the park not waiting for a boat in the rain covering himself the way he did one step ahead he was restless all morning moving papers and fidgeting with pens sending osman out twice for coffee he glanced at the telephone tommy wouldnt call today hed keep his distance until after the pickup outside taksim square scrubbed almost clean by the storm was sunny perfect sailing weather there was nothing to do now but wait out the day but the clock barely moved he was always anxious before a job simple but you never knew and today was thursday his afternoon with marina and that anticipation had already begun a prickling all over his skin his mind filled with how it would bethe afternoon sun through the curtains catching the dust the thin silk wrapper she called a kimono loosely belted so that it came apart at a touch his breath getting shorter on the stairs almost there not wanting her to see how eager he was but already hard when she opened the door the way it always was and then afterward the sudden deflation embarrassed at wanting it so much something he shouldnt be doing only once a week so that it wouldnt feel like cheating more like a medical appointment just a time you set aside an affair would have meant one of the european wives unpredictable emotions a betrayal this was a simpler transactionif you paid it didnt mean anything he had never bought sex before but what other choices were there in istanbul the houses in the alleys on the water side of galata hill waiting downstairs with sailors and stevedores for ten minutes upstairs and months of disease the apartments over the clubs near taksim fading red wallpaper and businessmen the risk of meeting someone you knew then he had overheard a man talking about her in the bar at the pera palas a girl with her own place and he had gone once nervous almost drugged with the thought his first woman in a year and then it was every week what he hadnt expected was that sex itself would be different not what he had known with anna but something furtive and heady the way it had been in adolescence he knew that if he saw her more often everything would change that strings would begin to attach themselves guilt the afternoons no longer just physical just pleasure he thought she felt it too a kind of relief that he only wanted her body leaving the rest of her to herself they had sex that was all they didnt want to touch anything else once he offered to keep her pay for the room no i dont want that just pay me like always why not it would make things easier for you oh for me and why would you do that so i wouldnt see anybody else thats what it means just you but i would and then id lie to you lets just stay as we are how many do you see youre jealous if you want a virgin go somewhere else i dont want to go anywhere else you know when i was a virgin when i was twelve so its too late to be jealous you like them the others everyone wants to know that now you some yes some no i like it with youthats what you want to know yes nobody really cares about the others just how is it with me but they ask anyway what are they like the men who see you they want to hear stories do you tell them stories about me she shook her head what could i tell them thursday afternoonthats all i know about you somebody who doesnt ask me questions until today and now what pay for the room i pay for it i told myself if you ever get out of that place youll have your own room just yours not in some house with people walking around its mine she said looking at the room i pay for it but this is how you pay for it he said nodding at the bed the tangled sheets yes then im paying anyway not for the room which is when he realized someone else was keeping her their thursday afternoons just extra cash something to tuck away under the mattress all the others just pin money too did the man know about him the afternoons the most private thing he had seemed suddenly invaded no longer safe it became important to know he even watched the building for a while curious to see the others europeans always in the afternoon like him only one at night a turk who showed up at odd times as if he never knew when he could manage to get away someone she kept her evenings free for just in case why do you want to know she said when he pressed her does he know about me no i told you that or the others you think there are so many he waited does he know she belted her robe tightly reaching for a cigarette no why do you want to tell him you said you didnt want to lie to me but you lie to him maybe i have feelings for you now you are lying to me she glanced over at him then smiled wryly and drew on the cigarette im a whore thats what we do youre surprised tell me oh tell what leave me alone hes rescuing me thats how he sees things a fairy story he gives me this room so im like a princess somebody in a window in a drawing and hes the prince she smiled again the pasha he stole the building an armenian owned it remember the varlik vergisi how they taxed the jews and the armenians and when they couldnt pay they sent them to camps and took what was left he got the building so he gives me this room no rent but i pay for it with him is that what you want to know and he thinks youve given it up the others he thinks im grateful i am grateful but i have to think of the future too he gets tired of me anything can happen hes a simple man a business in şişhane he never thought he could have anything like this a girl in a room waiting for him but now hes a big landlord rents so it was the tax maybe that got me out of that place strange how things work why strange im armenian he steals from an armenian and he gives the room to another i dont think he knows a womanits all the same to him so i lie to him i dont lie to you why not i know who he is a man who steals youim not so sure you never tell me anything he touched her wrist i dont come here to talk everyone elsei think thats why they come to tell me their troubles maybe i dont have any troubles she raised her eyes meeting his and held them for a second a sudden connection not saying anything not having to he met ed burke for lunch in one of the restaurants in the flower passage a table out in the arcade under the belle époque globes ed had ordered wine and drank most of it himself leon sipping a little for show barely touching the stuffed mussels his mind somewhere else so when are you going home ed said whats the hurry you dont want to wait too long the import business is finished where are they going to get the hard currency another year itll be strictly domestic here you should get out now im buying not selling theyre still open for business until the fucking russians get their hands on the place what they always wanted he looked down the arcade to the istiklal caddesi busy with trams and old cars be a hell of a thing wont it to see all this go he looked again to the street you know when i first got here they still had the women in veils had marina worn one as a girl but she was armenian so a christian something he hadnt known before another piece like filling in an outline what did she look like when she went out he had never seen her in anything but her silk kimono a swishing sound as she moved smooth to the touch like the soft flesh of her inner thigh he looked up aware again that ed was talking you hear about tommy its all over the consulate back to washington really leon said noncommittal i thought you two were thick as thieves leon shook his head i helped him out with a deal once thats all what kind of deal ed said suddenly curious chromium i knew some people in ankara well that always helps doesnt it always leon said looking more closely for something behind the words but eds face was the same long and droopy like fred allens pouches now under the eyes board of economic warfare thats where hes going except theres no more warfare ed said so they change the name its the government youre in the government not where hes going what do you mean come on you never thought tommy might be doing something extra on the qt like what hushhush stuff you never suspected tommy whod trust him with a secret just hand him a drink you worked with him who knows maybe you worked i put him in touch with some people in ankara thats it whats this all about wars over what does it matter now id just like to know was i right ask him how the hell would i know of course thats what youd have to say isnt it leon looked at him then forced a laugh i guess it is if i didnt have a foreign wife german for christs sake im the last person theyd ask the anna cover still useful and ill bet they didnt ask tommy either with his big mouth what youre talking abouti thought all that was over at owi and i hear they packed up so maybe well never know owi ed said nodding not letting it go and the college remember early fortytwo all of a sudden robert college gets a whole new group of teachers youd meet them at parties theyd never talk about their classes leon smiled maybe they came for the view a hilltop looking down at bebek and the bosphorus cocktail parties on the terrace in the evening light not what the founding missionaries had had in mind come on ed you see those guys doing parachute drops foureyes with tommy i never saw him open a book ill bet he doesnt even know where the college is ed smiled a cat licking cream hes giving a party there a party he didnt ask you leon shrugged i told you were not that close what kind of party just some drinks say goodbye to his friends there he looked over those guys he doesnt know well tommy any excuse whens this tonight why dont you come the more the merrier thats what he said to me wants to fill the place with witnesses distancing himself i cant tonight hot date im going to see my wife sorry ed said genuinely embarrassed well try to drop in late youre right there shes in bebek right leon nodded near the college but not as far up the coast road as the boat landing tommy making a diversion if anyone followed him theyd never go farther than bebek waiting for him to come down the hill hosting a party not meeting boats ill see what i can do he said signaling for the bill you find out whos who first so i dont say anything i shouldnt you think im kidding i think the place is getting to you here let me get that tell me one thing then whats that leon said dropping some lira notes on the bill remember that secretary of von papens switched sides the one asked for asylum sure i was at the consulate that day and where do they send him to tommy now why would they do that a flustered attaché an instinctive reaction forgetting the rules i dont know ed think about it ed said taking another sip of the wine and leaning back settling in leon imagined another hour of this ed probing a meaningless catandmouse game to learn what exactly i have to run leon said glancing at his watch endofthemonth figures he got up watch yourself tonight with the professors loose lips very funny but ill bet you im right ill try to make it later leon said a lie they both accepted he left by the side exit to the fish market the narrow street slippery with melted ice and old frying grease then turned through the covered vegetable stalls and out to mesrutiyet a long street of apartment buildings looking west to the golden horn what did ed want anyway imagining tommy lurking in alleys missing the real sleight of hand follow me to a party while my freelancer does the work up the road the street curved hugging the steep hill opening up to the water view below once there would have been hundreds of sails a dip in the road past the pera palas and then up threading through the narrow streets to the tünel station marinas building was just behind a gray apartment block grimy with neglect some of the windows looked toward the square where commuters poured off the funicular but marinas faced down to the şişhane shipyards the flat waters of the horn beyond i can see my whole life from here she said once smoking by the window her body wrapped again in her kimono thats my childhood she nodded toward the streets squeezed behind the docks then if you lean out this waywell maybe its better you cant see that house but the same hill a few streets what a difference another life and now what leon said idly now here i like it here i like looking down on it he checked his watch a little early driven away by eds prying but marina wouldnt mind thursdays were his you couldnt wait shed say teasing opening the robe to her breasts waiting for him to take them in his hands lean down he had just left the square when he saw the man coming out of the building stopping for a minute to adjust to the sunlight then straightening his hat a western suit not the workers overalls or jellabas you usually saw in the building leon turned almost a pivot and stepped toward the station newsstand looking at a newspaper waiting for a presence behind him then turning again the man was heading to the istiklal tram high cheekbones thin nose dark but not necessarily a turk anybody who went to her building in the middle of the afternoon now walking past the tram into the crowd he felt suddenly warm of course she saw others hed always known that but not on his day that was the point not to be somebody waiting in line like a sailor in a galata house the illusion of something more the whole day paid for unless the man had been somewhere else visiting one of the other flats except he hadnt sometimes you knew just by instinct youre early she said opening the door the air golden blinds half shut against the light i know i just missed your friend she hesitated for a second what friend she said not sure trying to find a tone i saw him coming out oh and im the only one who lives here she said quickly who was he no one what a little boy you are pretending to be jealous she tugged a little at his belt close the door did you see the pail on the landing another leak you should complain oh to the kapici in a building like this to the owner was that him she moved closer to him look at me my eyes so you know its true i havent been with anyone today you know you can smell that when theres somebody on the skin do you smell anyone just perfume thats right the one you like she stared at him again i havent been with anyone today all right she put her hand on his crotch rubbing him i always save today for you you know that stroking him the lie like another hand on him so that he was hard instantly excited by both unable to separate them he took a dolmus taxi to bebek this time making conversation with the other passengers so that hed be remembered a foreigner who spoke some turkish anna had already been fed and changed for bed a soft nightgown she seemed not to notice ill just sit with her until she falls asleep he told the nurse holding up the magazine hed brought to read an openended visit no need to check back fifteen minutes later he was through the garden entrance back on the road where mihai was waiting anybody around busy night egyptians are giving a party mihai said looking out the windshield toward the old khedives summer palace anybody else hard to see no moon outside the village the night was black only a few yellow windows visible through the cypresses and umbrella pines on the bosphorus a passing freighters lights reflected on the water then were swallowed up again by the dark lets see if we have company leon said turning to look out back as mihai started the car but no one else pulled into the line of cars moving quickly tonight winter traffic not the usual jam well be early leon said its not exact the time like a train no rain tonight anyway i checked the reports its clear all up along the coast he looked again at the black water where jason had once sailed the argo did you see anna tell her about the boat leon nodded if she heard they say hearing is the last sense to go when you have a stroke she didnt have a stroke mihai said nothing it had been his boat the one he and anna had organized also out of constancia as it happened overcrowded and listing stuck in istanbul for repairs then waiting for sailing permits two hundred people taking turns on deck theyd run tenders out with food and water medicine that anna had somehow rounded up out of nonexistent supplies black market drugs and still no permits then panic everyone seeing a repeat of the struma the ship sent back then torpedoed in the black sea everyone down with it one survivor theyd heard so the decision was made a desperate run through the marmara a moonless night like this one that made them hope they could slip through mihais decision no both annas too worth the risk what could the turks do tow them back to istanbul where they were anyway rotting better to make a run for it later it was said the engines would never have made it not at that speed that weight they were bound to overheat but no one really knew how the fire had started some sort of explosion probably flames suddenly leaping up into the night the ship had been just off yedikule close enough for the fire to be seen but even so the rescue boats were late the bratianu had begun to break up by then people screaming in the water going under later washing up the shore littered with them like driftwood anna had managed to save a few swimmers strong enough to stay afloat grab onto paddles but the children were gone it must have been then watching the debris and corpses float toward her in the ships lights that something had broken in her too another overheated engine theres the chance of another one mihai said a boat the british are watching brindisi now so were trying to get one here should i know this why not we have no secrets from each other except the ones you dont tell me leon looked over at him i dont know who he is so you said well a surprise for both of us eine kleine überraschung youre so sure hes german who else comes out this way the americans first they put them on trial now they take them home a change of heart very useful you cant put everyone on trial why not they wanted all of us dead no exceptions annas german a jew its different thats what they wanted everyone to think in that they succeeded now we know who we are where are you getting the ship leon said changing the subject trabzon of course a wreck but if it can make it this far why not palestine a freighter maybe for your tobacco from trabzon tobacco and hazelnuts leon pointed out the windshield pull up here i dont see anyone theyll see us they parked in the dropoff area by the quay a few boats bobbed against their mooring posts launches you could hire their owners probably keeping warm in the café on the other side of the road no one else around mihai put on a knitted sailors hat pulling it over his ears lets hope theyre not late its freezing they walked over to the edge of the pavement looking out at the black water any minute now unless the boat had had to dodge a patrol around garipçe the moneys already arranged mihai said you dont want to hang around bargaining leon tapped his breast pocket on delivery he looked over at mihai clamping his ears for warmth two men standing in the cold outlined by the café lights behind them up to what theyd have to move soon hear that a boat being put in gear the noise moving toward them their shadowy figures spotted from the water right mihai said one two three lets go you pay ill get johnny in the car the fishing boat still without lights now swung toward the quay throwing out a rope john leon said feeling foolish as if it were a password the passenger nodded thin smaller than leon had expected about mihais height a heavy woolen jacket he shoved a step box against the gunwale mihai pulled him up out of the boat gripping his hand come on cars over there get in the back mihai said in a rush then stopped his eyes on the passengers face reading it below them the fisherman started talking in turkish leon answering before he got louder my bag john said nodding to a duffel bag in the boat i have a bag for a second mihai didnt move still staring until john looked back at him a question mark ill get it mihai said finally breaking his own trance the car over there hurry its all right john said to leon suddenly anxious a whatswrong expression leon made a shooing motion fine get in the car and my money what about my money leon took an envelope out of his pocket and handed it down the fisherman started to count the bills its all there throw us the bag and get out of here behind him he heard the car door slam before anyone sees ha before anyone sees you just throw up the goddam bag mihai said edgy putting one foot on the boat reaching out first i count the fisherman said who are you anyway nobody said two one man count it then leon said impatient now watching him thumb through the notes unshaven face surly nothing extra for the extra day leon could feel mihai tense up next to him coiled not here he said quickly improvising after youre back and we know no ones seen you something tommy could easily arrange pocket change the bag mihai said his voice low almost threatening so that the fisherman picked it up without question heaving it across the gap mihai swung it onto his shoulder no lights till youre past the landing leon said reminded by a sweep of headlights from the road mihai tossed back the rope did he say anything you had two days the fisherman shook his head no turkish we play dominoes the money will be there when you get back leon said the extra the fisherman smiled an uneven row of teeth with gaps inshallah he said a hand on his chest he went over to the controls pushing the handle forward the boat choked then started moving the engine grinding swinging out again toward the dark the sputtering still audible even after it was out of sight theyre lucky they made it in that mihai said come on lets get out of here mihai turned to him you know what youre doing what do you mean a crunch of tires a car door slamming mihai turned to it then suddenly swiveled the air near him exploding his body jerking back as if hed been punched he let out a sharp cry hit somewhere leon saw the duffel bag falling then mihai pitching forward rocking get down a hoarse grunt as he dropped onto the duffel scraping the pavement to get behind it another shot hitting the concrete near the edge of the bag mihai rolling away from it leon ducked then threw himself down flattening his body on the concrete out of the light but still exposed his mind a minute behind what was happening trying to catch up what soldiers must feel everything around them moving too fast getting killed afraid theyd pee he lifted his head a little looking across the quay the shots had been so loud that everyone must have heard he expected people rushing out of the café but nobody appeared even the café lights now hidden behind the dark bulk of the car where the shots had come from mihai he said a hiss keep down he was reaching into his pocket pulling out a gun crouching farther behind the duffel for cover roll away mihai said still hoarse keep moving but the next bullet went to the duffel again a locator shot for mihai who now aimed at the point in the dark where it had been fired leon watched him steady the gun nothing but dim reflected light on the road but he found the spot another explosion louder than the others almost in his ear and then a grunt from the other car a surprised scream a shadow forming trying to stand then falling down again for a second silence so quiet he could hear the boats creak against their ropes mihai he whispered crawling over on his belly still trying to keep his head down i hit him now close enough to see mihais hand covered in blood jesus we have to get to the car we dont know how many mihai pushed himself up knees then a low crouch moving his eyes fixed on the other car leon scrambled up following then saw the shadow take shape on its knees hand extended watch out he shouted flattening himself again my hand its stiff mihai said sliding the gun to leon get him for a second less leon stared at the gun reaching for it as if it might snap at him a gray lizard flecked with blood alive quick then a pure reflex he was aiming the gun firing hearing another grunt this time the crack of bone as a head hit the pavement mihai was up and running bent over dragging the duffel get in the car leon said taking the bag from him risking a halfstanding sprint an easy target now but moving racing he slammed back against the car when he reached it hearing his own breath then yanked the door handle to get in he reached across the seat to open the other door for mihai who slid in a writhing movement still low here he said handing over the keys leon jammed them into the ignition turning them at the same time keep down leon put the car in gear and felt it jump beneath him wheels squealing as he pressed the accelerator shooting out of the parking area and left onto the road past the café no one outside hadnt anybody heard gunshots were startling always recognizable not cars backfiring or maybe they were huddled inside cowering behind windows or maybe it had all never happened a fever dream but there was mihais hand bleeding and his own shaking his whole body trembling adrenaline still surging shocked someone shooting at him they said there wouldnt be any trouble john said from the backseat his voice apprehensive leon looked in the rearview mirror somehow surprised that he was there an afterthought youre safe mihai said did you see them leon said over his shoulder how many john shook his head they thought you were me he said to mihai you had the bag leon looked in the mirror again taking him in for the first time short gray hair receding at the temples so that he seemed almost bald a thin face pulled tight over high cheekbones sharp eyes peering back at him in the mirror hows your hand he said to mihai i can move it theres a shirt in the bag john said you can wrap it in that stop the bleeding i dont need your shirt mihai said to the mirror pulling a handkerchief out of his back pocket anyone behind leon said there will be would they send just one they whoever they are whod want to put a bullet in your head mihai said to the mirror who is that do you think john looked back saying nothing you brought a gun leon said glancing down at the seat in case in case there was no reason to think leon said his voice still ragged back at the quay theres always a reason mihai said evenly he looked up at the mirror dont you think so where are we going john said not answering him a safe place leon said dont worry not the consulate how mihai said in a diplomatic pouch so the turks dont see leon glanced over at him surprised at his tone still shooting back dont worry he said again to the mirror he made a sharp right turn into the village what are you doing mihai said you cant lose anyone on the coast road well take the back way leon said what back way just watch behind leon said gesturing to the rear window they shot up the steep grade toward nispetiye leon leaning forward to concentrate on the twisting road dark with pines anyone no its hard to follow here suburbs with shady local roads circling the hills easy to get lost in even during the day so youre called john mihai said making conversation holding the bloody hand so many johns ivan johann ion in romania john looked into the mirror alexei he said john was for the fisherman mihai continued to look back for a second then turned to leon who knew about the pickup here nobody thats why they used me someone outside so then your end mihai said to alexei turning in his seat to face him someone at your end alexei just stared back at him any ideas no of course theres always the fisherman if someone pays more but who who wants to kill you alexei looked at him deliberate moving a chess piece into place everybody he said why do you think im coming to you do you have a cigarette leon reached into his pocket and handed back a pack so thank you for that alexei said lighting one saving my life mihai nodded thats right isnt it i did and the bag saved mine how things work what if he isnt dead leon said taking a left at the intersection down toward yildiz who our friend then hes as good as dead he cant go to a hospital what would he say leon looked over his stomach suddenly light someone was dead had to be and he hadnt felt anything just the blind panic of firing back saving himself it must be different for snipers taking aim knowing youre about to kill detached not shaking later gripping the wheel tighter head filled with it it was supposed to be a simple pickup he said they drove for a while in silence then skirted the dark border of yildiz park where sultan abdul hamid had walled himself away frightened of shadows leon glanced at the rearview mirror nobody behind you know the pharmacy in taksim the latenight one i should get some iodine for this leon spotted the green pharmacy sign and doubleparked in front of a borek stall looking both ways as he stepped into the street maybe he would always do this now listening for bullets inside he got the iodine and bandages and then an afterthought some aspirin so it would look like a general supplies run when he got back to the car he had a sense that something had happened a change in the air but neither mihai nor alexei said anything maybe the change was in him a new churning uneasiness as suspicious now as abdul hamid shit mihai gasped as he applied the iodine leon was heading downhill again toward galata bridge can you drive home with that he said indicating the bandage ill be all right just worry about him a hard look mihai somehow blaming leon they crossed the horn and went up into the old city past the tourist monuments then beyazit laleli caddesi turned downhill toward yenikapi station in a stretch of small hotels and cheap textile dealers well get out here leon said stopping so they dont see the car who leon pointed to a light three doors down hotel its safe alexei said looking out suddenly vulnerable lets hope so leon turned to mihai you sure youll be all right another look his eyes meeting leons then letting it go pushing the bag back to alexei here keep it close it might come in handy again he slid over to the drivers seat waiting for them to leave then handed leon the gun better have this watch your back leon touched it feeling it alive again then nodded keep the car off the street in case anybody spotted it he hesitated im sorry mihai shrugged dont be sorry just get him out of istanbul you were never there you can trust me on that and him they moved to the curb watching the car pull away down the hill three men appeared out of the shadows probably on their way to a mihanye the night belonged to men here roaming the streets in bored groups the women safely shuttered away except for the ones loitering near the station hoping for a few hours in one of the hotels salesmen from izmir with suitcases of samples workers up from the country to see about a job a neighborhood used to new faces passing through leon took out a folded paper and handed it to alexei in case they ask they might not what your tezkere internal passport foreigners have to carry them foreigners what am i bulgar i didnt know what you could pass for if you knew turkish no he glanced at the passport its real leon nodded a refugee i knew he moved on your friend alexei said motioning to where the car had been hes romanian was why he spoke to me in the car to see if i knew romanian why romanian its like that with us romanians recognize each other something in the voice maybe he looked in the passport now bulgar jakab a bulgar jew thats why you left a jew he said to himself trying it on like a hat but the night clerk didnt ask for a tezkere a pale man with a beak nose and small eyes who might have been bulgar himself he took the money and handed leon a key attached to a weight with a tassel when leon asked for glasses he scowled but got up and went to the room behind and brought out two raki glasses muttering in turkish a weary putupon monotone what did he say alexei asked on the stairs not to make too much noise leon said holding up the glasses the hall light was on a timed switch just long enough to get the key in the door before it snapped off again the room was small stained liberty wallpaper and a curtain on a rod for a closet not intended for long stays a turkish toilet and a shower no tub alexei looked around how long do i stay here about half an hour leon said going over to the window parting the curtain to take in the street dont unpack ah then where somewhere nicer he looked at the lumpy bed a chenille spread pink something a young girl would have private and the man downstairs theres a back way he put the glasses on the table so you brought some raki no then why anybody checks with him he says were up here having a party tomorrow were sleeping it off buys us time to move a game alexei said hideandseek leon didnt answer lighting a cigarette and leaning back against the wall giving alexei the bed the only seat two places you expected trouble alexei said leon shook his head just wanted to keep ahead of the emniyet if theyre watching youre not in the states yet and illegal here if they pick you up theres nothing we could do it was them at the boat no the emniyet dont like people coming in but they can send them back they dont have to shoot them alexei leaned back against the rickety headboard who then the russians old friends maybe not turks not my new friends either he said looking at leon not before we have our talks the photographs are in the bag leon said what photographs german aerials i thought you were bringing out do you think im a messenger i brought myself out the photographsthat was arranged in bucharest your embassy has them maybe already in the pouch in washington who knows how efficient are you youre here arent you alexei smiled a lucky man nice hotel rooms a trip to america everybody wants to go to america he looked down before the russians get them and now they know im here in istanbul but not where alexei looked at him thats right not where leon turned glancing down at the street anything alexei said no its quiet well give it a few more minutes when he turned back to face the bed he saw that alexei had closed his eyes dont get too comfortable only resting i get tired all the time now before i could go for daysnow always tired he smiled to himself age maybe leon looked at his face softer with his eyes closed but drained and spent like someone winded after a race he went to the window again touching the gun in his coat pocket still not real the seedy hotel room the empty raki glasses the man lying dead on the quayall part of someone elses life he just took the ankara train and passed along papers and now there was a gun in his pocket okay he said eager to move better leave the light too early for bed but no ones watching you said i didnt think there was anyone at the quay either alexei nodded you know its interesting what saved me we were early a little later and i wouldnt have been in the car id have been where they thought you were getting off the boat with your bag who shot him you or your friend we both did he held the door open a sliver of light until alexei reached the back stairs then followed feeling his way back against the wall the stairs themselves were easier shadowy but catching light from the ground floor he could hear a radio in the desk clerks office loud enough to muffle any creaking steps alexei barely touched the banister the duffel on his shoulder not making a sound someone used to going out the back no one at the desk when they reached the ground floor audience laughter on the radio just the hallway now past a utility room then the back door not even locked in the street behind no wider than an alley alexei stumbled into a trash bin but caught the lid before it could fall off holding his breath for a second leon nodded toward the streetlight at the end no one was out all the mihanye customers farther down the hill which way alexei said when they reached ordu caddesi turning away as a halfempty tram passed just across a few blocks small quiet streets then a larger one looking down toward the şehzade mosque a modern building with a buzzer entry system not a courtyard with a nosy kapici leon opened the front door with a key more timer switches on the stairs but at least everything working the lobby clean smelling faintly of disinfectant one more floor leon said when they reached the landing who lives here university people its nearby students no they couldnt afford it so im a professor youre not anything you dont go out youre not here the flat was no more than functional but a pleasant step up from the hotel i stocked the fridge leon said you should have everything you need at least for the next few days few days or sooner depending on the plane alexei threw the duffel on the bed then walked over to the bottle on a side chest so now the raki not for me i have to go we dont talk tonight alexei said surprised thinking leon was tommy not just the babysitter no questions later well join me anyway a welcome toast alexei poured the drinks then raised his to safe journeys safe journeys leon said feeling the heat as it slipped down finally something real you dont stay here alexei said the watchdog its safe safe alexei said his voice neutral no one followed us here i know i worked in the field too so now the only risk is you me when you come back or is someone else coming tomorrow either way a visitor leaves a trail like hansel and the pebbles so perhaps its better to stay again trying to be light he poured more raki in his glass i havent talked to anybody in two days dominoes its not the same thing a game for simpletons you see them in the mountains every village sitting in the cafés click clack two days of that leon smiled a little youll be all right now just stay put where would i go he walked over to the window where are we what part the old city constantinople alexei said playing with it for effect a student reciting homework and that he pointed to a hulking shadow beyond the mosque valens aqueduct aqueduct from romans byzantine fourth century a fact hed picked up from anna on one of their walks fourth alexei said genuinely impressed a tourist they still use it not anymore not for fifty years or so so nothing is forever he turned to leon a half smile but of course thats why were here the new order another one yours this time leon drained his glass i have to go lets hope this one lasts for a while alexei said turning to glance again at the aqueduct i cant change sides again youre the last leon looked at him for a moment not what he expected not a rescue one of ours someone buying his life with betrayal ill be back tomorrow do you need anything something to read maybe alexei said nodding to the empty shelf not even dominoes now what should i do think about my sins thats what the priests used to recommend when was this when i was young he smiled before i had any lock up behind me leon said turning one more thing the gun he held out his hand youre safe here then ill be safer a precaution alexei said staring him down until leon reached into his pocket and handed it over thank you he looked at the gun then around the room very trusting americans no guard youre not a prisoner you came to us remember leon said improvising a guess what if i changed my mind changed it to what alexei made a wry smile not so many choices left you mean no he said to himself then shrugged ill see you tomorrow then alexei raised his head ill look forward to that outside leon crossed the street heading toward süleymans mosque then ducked suddenly into a doorway cattycorner from the building a few minutes just to be sure no one in the streets he felt the same tingling the caffeine alertness hed felt on the quay he should have arranged for someone to watch the building but there hadnt been any reason for that not a few hours ago a simple pickup just slipping someone in and out of the country a kind of card trick not shootouts someone lying in a pool of blood or carried away by now tossed into the bosphorus another secret in the water leon looked up at the lighted window remembering alexeis face wary and then tired gone to ground but there must have been other times eyes confident standing tall in his uniform romanian it turned out not wehrmacht whatever that looked like probably the same peaked hat padded shoulders fighting alongside the germans all the way to stalingrad and now in the russians crosshairs mihai taking the bullet instead luck just a matter of turning a few inches a hand on the duffel where his head should have been he thought of himself flat on the damp concrete of the quay waiting afraid to breathe he moved away from the doorway through the dark streets around the mosque then the even darker ones below the grand bazaar just an occasional light through shutters or a radio playing streets as dark as they must have been when valens was building his aqueduct the timeless city houses with bay overhangs cobbles slick with peels and rinds leon had never been afraid on the streets in istanbul not even in the back alleys of neighborhoods like fatih full of headscarves and long stares but tonight every movement every faint rustling put him on edge in one street two dogs raised their heads to watch him pass some of istanbuls roaming wild dogs fed on scraps he kept going east through cağaloğlu where all the newspaper offices were had they heard about the shooting yet pages being made up lines of type murder in bebek mysterious shooting on the bosphorus no witnesses never suspecting the witness was outside their windows right now not just a witness the killer and looking at the swirl of lights down at sirkeci he knew the sudden shortness of breath doubling over was about this not about alexei or mihai how the job had gone wrong but about this killing a man a line hed never expected to cross the sound of the shot was still in his head an echo life gone in a minute that easy he caught a taxi at the station and took it to the park a few minutes just to establish his presence pretending to look for someone in the big art deco dining room waving at mehmet in the bar then using the mens room off the lobby spotted by regulars who would say vaguely that theyd seen him there that evening a few minutes later he was back out on aya paşa past the now dark german consulate down to his building sliding the key in the door then freezing the door already unlocked he pushed at it gently listening for sounds no light but the smell of tobacco a cigarette burning still here he felt for the gun in his pocket then remembered it wasnt there he took another step a faint creaking not a burglar something he knew without knowing why someone waiting for him turn on the light for gods sake mihais voice in the living room its only me leon flicked on the hallway switch then walked into the room mihai was sitting by the window smoking the only light the glow of his cigarette tip how did you get in leon said a child could get in what are you doing here thinking about what leon said turning on a table lamp mihai winced at the sudden light what you know what you dont know whether youre a fool or something else leon nodded to his bandaged hand you think i knew i wouldnt have asked you not that mihai said waving his hand toward the drinks tray make yourself a drink i just had one oh yes with alexei he said his voice curling around the name a celebration not exactly and how did you find him good company worried ah pour me one will you leon poured two handing one over a natural reaction mihai said to being shot at i dont feel so wonderful either not just that worn out a sympathetic figure and now such a helpful friend he took a drink who sent you tonight you know i cant tell you that scruples at such a moment if the bullet had got me would you have told me then does it make any difference who whats this all about trading with the enemy a drink with the devil he said holding up his glass hes not the enemy anymore mihai looked at him then down at his glass so i wondered is he a fool now i know sit down youve got something on your mind leon said taking a chair my mind yes not on my conscience yet i thought he doesnt know he should know know what who he is your alexei shall i guess what you think the romanians well they sided with the germans how could they not the expedient thing our friend too what choice then stalingrad the russians push back and push into romania now germanys losing and whos coming so why not make a deal with them throw out the fascists fight with the russians instead the new expedient thing but meanwhile some people get caught in between our friend for example the russians dont forgive him theyre going to put him on trial like antonescu so he runs and he has something to sell things he knows im right so far yes leon nodded only one bidder in this deal and better not to ask too many questions the whole romanian army was fascist so yes he was a fascist but now the communists are after him a recommendation in itself in such a situation you take what you can all right an opportunist but our opportunist thats what you think isnt it i havent thought i dont know but i do i recognized him before i took a bullet for him you think hes someonenot so good maybe but romanian politics were like that who can blame him for wanting to save himself you it seems yes me i know what he is jianu thats his name a butcher but you dont know i think so what do i do keep my mouth shut somebody this close to me anna i used to trust with my life we killed a man tonightyou me and you dont even know tell me then leon said quietly mihai nodded to his hand get me another it hurts its not infected is it such concern so where to start king carol with his hand in everybodys pockets the wolf at the door but still thank god the jews to hate so the legion of archangel michael you know it the iron guard yes a wonderful group pouches with romanian earth around their necks little ceremonies where they drink each others blood like savages my countrymen well not by then im in palestine my family said how can you be a zionist jassy is a jewish city well it was so im in palestine and things get worse for the jews mossad sends me to bucharest to get them out the athénée palace everyone in the same place you go to dinner at capşa and bribe someone then back to the palace and bribe someone else you could still do that then but how many jews listen then carol runs away with lupescu the mistressand the treasury for them at least the happy ending no one else now michael is king but really general antonescu the army and meanwhile the iron guard are running wild killing people government people even pogroms naturally what else terrible excesses finally its too much even for antonescu he sends the tanks outthe army fighting the iron guard fascist against fascist but hitler prefers antonescu not so crazy he sides with him and so does our friend jianu your alexei he was in the iron guard but now he helps antonescu break them so antonescu joins the axis and the army goes off to invade russia a reign of terror in odessathat you know from the trials this summer deportations from bessarabia all the jews the romanians set up extermination campsthe only ones the germans didnt run themselves they killed almost two hundred thousand we think quite a record my countrymen and alexei now a right hand to antonescu antonescu liked him someone who would betray the guard who better for intelligence work he knew how to get russians to come over the romanians had good intelligence right up to stalingrad but he had to know about the jews too the army carried out the deportations it was the guard all over again jassy they emptied out in fortyone your family everyone then bigger things until they started to lose after stalingrad they knew antonescu was so desperate he put out feelersthis time to save the jews help them get to palestine sell them i was here then we bought some out the americans more they had the money already antonescu must have been thinking about the end making some friends for after he should have looked closer to home when he was deposed fortyfour where was loyal alexei nowhere to be found he paused until you found him so he knew thats not the same as who pulls the trigger is that what you mean leon looked away flustered maybe ive been going too fast for you i get the picture hed sell his mother what am i supposed to do not let him sell her again antonescu goes on trial soon but not alexei why not because he made a deal leon looked up he didnt make it with me so its not your responsibility nobodys he took a drink letting the air settle a little let the communists have him put him on trial with antonescu a show trial they dont try people they shoot them in this case well deserved maybe hes more valuable this way i dont know i dont know what he knows i know what he is i said before a butcher i didnt tell you why leon held up his hand it doesnt matter its not up to me one more thing then you decide the guard you remember i said there were excesses but whats in a word excesses you know bucharest no dudeşti was the main jewish district three days they went crazy there first strada lipscani a killing spree looting then out in the băneasa forest making them dig pits before they shot them the reason for this by the way no one said enough they were jews but the second day before antonescu decided to send the tanks the guard went even crazier maybe they drank each others blood again who knows for courage what courage who was fighting them terrified jews begging for their lives that was the day they got two hundred of themmen womenand took them to străuleşti he stopped then tossed back the rest of the drink the slaughterhouse south of town an abattoir leon waited not moving they put the jews on the conveyor belts stripped on all fours they made them bleat like the animals crying i suppose maybe screaming but also bleating like they were ordered then through the assembly line the same treatment the animals got heads sliced off then limbs then hung up on hooks carcasses and then they stamped them the carcasses he said something in romanian then translated fit for human consumption the inspectors stamp he paused you decide leon said nothing staring as if the belt were moving through the room before them blood spurting running into gutters and alexei was there leon said marking time his stomach queasy there were no witnesses among the jews just the guard but hes still with the guard then he was seen ask him he sold the guard out you said when it was convenient a fine point he paused again you decide leon was quiet i cant he said finally its not my decision its somebodys not yours either no i just speak romanian and drive the car and keep my mouth shut that was before help a man like this escape i wont be part of that whoever sent youmaybe he doesnt know either he needs to know so somebody can decide youre not part of it they dont even know you were there thats not so easy now maybe you didnt think about this either what it means for me what this is now leon looked at him waiting so more thinking i had this time he said waving to the room while you were having your drink who were they tonight russians all right who else would have such an interest stop him before so they send a unit three four men in which case theyve already cleaned up the mess got rid of the body but no one followed us its more important to get jianu than worry about the fallen comrade but no one follows so he must have been alone think what that means i know what it means yes you have thought about this too no one moves the body it lies there to be found and it will be found now something for the police even emniyet and what are they looking for my gun my car who protects me now the boss you cant tell me about who wants me to help the butcher im working for him now too i have a right to know i never meant its too late for that do we want to tell the police it was selfdefense then we have to tell them what we were doing there leon stared at his drink for a minute can they trace the car to you this is your response they cant can they where is it the garage where its been all night as far as anyone knows theres nothing special about the car if they saw it from the café unless they got the plate number it could be anybodys so i have nothing to worry about theres nothing to connect you to this mihai looked over except you if it comes to that well protect you i promise you that ill talk to protect me a palestinian helping the americans killing russians id be out of the country in a day at least you wouldnt be in jail those are my choices and my work here who does that you were never there leon said his voice level nobody knows except alexei and hell be gone the butcher goes free and we protect ourselves so we protect him thats what im doing now protecting someone like that a knot he said twisting his fingers not so easy to pull apart i didnt know thats what the germans say mihai said wryly every one he put down the glass ready to go so a good nights work hes safe and so are we only the turks have this problem this body one thing though still to think about how did they know the russians the arrangements where hed be just you no guns so easy they could send one man if they knew all that what else do they know so maybe were not so safe and neither is he he said getting up the phone rang twice as loud this late startling them like an unexpected hand on the shoulder leon glanced at his watch then looked at mihai who shook his head a tic response another clang filling the room waves of sound he picked up the receiver snatching it leon ive been trying to reach you ed burke at this hour i was at the park accounting for himself to ed burke already making alibis do you know what time its about tommy ed said quickly i thought maybe youd know something know something since you were in bebek with your wife we couldnt get past the police police just an echo you havent heard hes dead killed what a first wave of heat rushing through him tommy hit too the one who was supposed to meet the boat not a freelance theyd known where he was he looked over at mihai who was watching him leon you there say something killed in a crash he said trying to keep his voice steady no thats the thing shot in bebek thats why i called i thought you might have heard something before they blocked the whole place off by the water just down from that fort rumeli hisari leon said an automatic response not hearing himself shot his mind racing now his blood seeming to travel in two directions by the water the boat landing thats what i wondered too hell of a place to be that hour tommy leaves his own party i figure he must have something going on but christ you never know do you maybe somebody saw the car and said theres money there so if he hadnt left then but maybe something else god leon said blankly shot you dont expect that here no leon said you dont fire into the dark and wait for a thud the crack of a head on the pavement well i didnt mean to bother you no no im glad you called thanks police cars and lights questioning people in the café his head filling with blood face hot ill let you know if i hear anything about the arrangements arrangements well barbara will want to bury him here dont you think i mean shipping a body home barbara leon said vaguely the widow a bottle blonde who flirted after the second drink she had to identify the body ed said in the know who else had he called its a hell of a thing one minute youre at a party the next youre i cant believe it leon said what you were supposed to say you never saw anything they must have had half the force out not while i was there he waited a second when did it happen right after he left the party i guess i must have already gone jesus shot well ill let you go ed said slightly disappointed hoping for details i still say its a funny place to be that hour fishing thanks again ed leon said not responding he put down the receiver moving slowly and turned to mihai what mihai said looking at his face you have to think some more it wasnt a russian laleli he spent all morning waiting for a callsomebody from tommys office at the consulate maybe even the consul himself the account in hürriyet had been skimpy a businessman shot but the details were already racing through the foreign community why hadnt barbara been invited to the party at the college why had tommy left early heading away from town suspicions percolated up and down the phone lines but no one believed tommy was seeing another woman certainly not one who would shoot him which left robbery except according to barbara his wallet had been in his pocket when the police found him his gun had been fired so he must have scared them off but why was he carrying a gun a full morning of it pacing then staring at the phone expectant turhan leons secretary one of the atatürk new women who didnt cover her head but still went home to her family at night gave up any pretense of working answering calls in a breathless voice eyes wide with interest during a normal day not much happened at rj reynolds today the phone kept ringing but not with the call he wanted by noon standing at the window overlooking taksim he realized that no one was going to contact him that he was alone nobody knew did his name even appear on any record some payment voucher tommy spreading his bets over the table the way he liked it using someone outside so he could distance himself someone to blame if anything went wrong but why should it a job so routine it hadnt required the usual precautions tommy hadnt even asked where the safe house was just the neighborhood why not but the answer was the same one hed been getting all night sitting up with it the address didnt matter alexei was never supposed to get there he was supposed to die on the quay and leon would he have been left there tommy squealing away in his car not sure if hed been recognized impossible to risk that of course hed have to be killed too an easy target not expecting it just picking up a package two people left dead whod killed each other how would tommy have arranged it dressed the scene he thought of his face at the park bar pink reminiscing already planning it and that always led back to why and the other answer he circled around the one he wasnt ready to accept he gripped the windowsill as if his body had caught the swirling in his head meanwhile he had to hand alexei on to someone who tommys people at owi were already gone the plants at robert college whoever they were but tommy hadnt used any of them they didnt know nobody had called his operation now he had to find the next link in the chain there must be a name maybe in ankara maybe lying around tommys desk but when he got to the consulate he found it surrounded small clusters of people drawn by the police cars in the street patrolmen at the gate cadging cigarettes from the guards the carved american eagle over the door staring down at them all not just a consulate matter anymore a courier assignment a crime police wanting answers tommy setting up his own man why would they believe it why would the consul the only story theyd hear was that he had killed tommy his word against a dead mans what proof did he have besides alexei himself who wasnt here not to the police he looked up some movement at the door the consul shaking hands with a turk in a bulky suit cigarettes doused orders being given a few policemen staying behind everyone else moving toward the gate they passed around leon as if he were a stick in a stream nobody knew getting into cars writing up reports not one of them looking at him he stood there for a minute feeling them all around him unable to move invisible nobody knew they had arranged to meet in the secondhand booksellers market a narrow passage shaded by plane trees near the beyazit mosque mihai was waiting at an englishlanguage stall near the end flipping through a book youre late anything on the car leon shook his head nothing if anybody saw it theyre not saying no calls from the consulate either nobody you said there was a plane arranged that was tommys job then now its yours you have to get him out he starts to panic whered you park him leon said nothing theyll be checking the hotels first thing they do hes not there he picked up a book the cover a blur as long as hes in istanbul were a man whod sell out anybody cheap he says whats good for him not us but we didnt i mean which explanation do you think theyll believe lets say the real one what we were doing there just for the sake of argument your new friend can vouch for it he said his voice suddenly hard a wonderful history of telling the truth and then what your ambassador intervenes an embarrassment for him but lets say he does a deal no prison they deport us instead resident permit revoked if they believe us he looked away we dont want to explain anything we wont have to im telling you nobody knows if i can get him to the consulate the consulate its police now with a body murder the emniyet have to have at least one pair of ears over there at least take him in and the police he let the thought finish itself and the russians if theyre watching you wouldnt even get him to the gate maybe what he deserves but not the best thing now an incident more police he has to talk to somebody eventually tell them mihai made a wry face his american confessor discretion guaranteed he lifted a finger from his book but not here if hes gone the turks have nothing to use against us he placed the book on the barrow except each other he looked at leon quiet for a second what are you going to do if theres no plane tommy said there was he said a lot of things i know someone at the airport i can have him check the manifests not a scheduled plane i suppose not for this passenger military leon shrugged his shoulders wonderful all right ill check all of them look you dont have to get involved in this you werent there remember if everyone says so but will they he looked over ill let you know about the airport you think there is a plane then probably your tommy was passing him along hed want his end covered its just that jianu wasnt going to be on it thanks to you given that any thought leon met his glance all night its something to think about mihai said turning to go then put his hand on leons upper arm a goodbye gesture how long have you known me he said quietly theres blood here like blood we have to look out for each other he squeezed the hand tighter keep your head everything normal or theyll smell it its not just for us you know what im doing here what anna did these people its the last hope for them id even help a pig like jianu he dropped his hand still looking at him since you want him alive your new american friend he got on the tram at beyazit preoccupied its something to think about shooting at jianu shooting at him how long had tommy been someone else but how do you prove it make one thing lead to another like the stations on the map over the door next to him two women in robes and headscarves were talking to each other as cut off from the rest of the car as if they were still in the harem the men barely noticing staring out the windows stubble and bushy moustaches not europe outside the old city jerked past the blue mosque the hippodrome chariot races a thousand years ago old enough to have seen everything alexeis iron guard a modern version of an old story infants impaled blood smeared over doorways bodies flung into the golden horn staining the water everything not what anna had seen clutching her guidebook the iznik tiles the delicate carvings on the minbar a city of wonders to her not the other one no longer surprised by anything at topkapi a group of sailors fresh off the seraglio tour crowded into the car and leon had to turn facing the back at first there were just the same anonymous faces then he felt a prickling on his skin someone he knew head down reading a turkish newspaper the same man whod come out of marinas building a coincidence when had he got onbefore leon with leon so good leon hadnt noticed still not looking up from his paper leon turned back or was it just his imagination jumpy about everything now a public tram a man marina said she didnt know dont turn to look again the car was heading down the hill into the swirl of sirkeci he had begun to sweat when the doors opened the crowd pushed in for a second he felt out of breath as if they had taken all the air out of the car the buzzer rang he held back waiting then plunged through the door just as it was closing dont look back a face at the window or maybe not something hed never know keep moving he took a gulp of air heavy with diesel fumes and charcoal smoke and headed over to the eminönü piers out on the water you could think follow the logic one thing leading to another tommy had used someone outside he took the ferry to üsküdar sitting in the open back of the boat with a glass of tea something warm his coat pulled tight he went over it all again each move like a step into open space with nothing to break the fall he glanced over at the birds circling and tried to fix on landmarks galata tower the shipping offices in karaköy but they seemed insubstantial too just something to graze with your fingers as you fell past in over your head a phrase he could actually picture now where tommy had wanted him to be grab onto that follow it someone must still be expecting alexei there had been people in bucharest the fishing boat only tommys link had broken and now theyd come looking but not for leon not yet it was the trap that folded in on itself the minute he went to someone about alexei he was putting himself on the pier and mihai he watched the boat crunch against the rubber tire buffers on the dock the gangplanks being slid into place everybody in one anothers hands he changed boats for beşiktaş looking at people half expecting to see the man from the train two places a coincidence but there were only clumps of men in woolen peacoats smoking indifferent didnt anything show in his face a man dead when they landed he stood on the pier for a minute at a loss commuters brushed past him as if he werent there like the police at the consulate nobody knew go back to the office everything normal but nothing was normal anna was sitting in a chair and she lifted her head when he came in she was aware of physical activity knew when she was being dressed helped into clothes even though her face showed no expression when he leaned down to kiss her forehead she didnt flinch simply accepted it somethings happened he said then hesitated too abrupt are you warm enough he said fidgeting the nurse had opened the french windows letting in a crack of air he put a shawl around her shoulders i was thinking about you on the ferry how you love the water but he hadnt been her eyes stayed fixed on the garden just say it tommy kings dead shot in a robbery they think he stopped and sank into the other chair falling again am i doing that with you it wasnt a robbery and then he couldnt say anything more not out loud instead he followed her gaze to the garden the patch of sun on the bare judas tree i was there he said softly he tried to kill a man were bringing out he tried to kill me anna stared ahead not moving there wasnt anything i could do i had to still not finishing it it didnt feel like anything not at the time its only later you but i cant explain what happened to anybody until i get him out the man were moving he took a breath looking away from her and i dont know if i can do it tommy was supposed to he stopped and then there he was with a gun he heard her question in his head and nodded ive been going over it all night it has to be why else would tommy have to kill him i keep coming back to that why hed have to but think what it means tommy it turns everything upside down all these years working for christ i worked for him how long was he he stopped talking the two of them sitting in silence nothing was supposed to happen just a babysitting job and now ive got him hell be killed if i he looked down a man who would have killed you not even thinking twice he got up and walked over to the french window careful not to step into her line of sight a bed of late asters near the wall but if i dont help him the turksll get involved then its murder and mihai he let the thought drift his eyes following a bird fluttering between branches you know what i was thinking before if i can do this deliver himits the kind of thing people notice in washington it would be a chance to show them i could he stopped and then i thought maybe it would have been better if tommy had got him theyd both be gone nothing to explain easier if he were dead too and what kind of person thinks that what kind of person a reflection in the glass someone standing in the doorway obstbaum doctor he said turning his voice changing ive just been telling anna how long had he been listening dont let me interrupt obstbaum held out his clipboard a visual excuse no no please leon said then glanced down at his watch anyway look at the time im seeing georg he said to anna i couldnt put him off again do all the normal things an old friend he said to obstbaum she was very fond of him werent you ill give him your love he leaned down and kissed her forehead then looked back up at obstbaum what had he heard i hope its all right talking like that he said at the door its good your coming the activity and two days now last night too i hear from whom why how is she leon said ignoring it no worse he caught leons expression its something you know no worse at least theres no deterioration its good the talking sometimes i think its for me just sitting here it makes me feel calmer obstbaum nodded an oasis it can have that effect you know the shooting last night up the road it was in the papers all the patients so upset you know what its likejust getting them to calm down but for anna it never happened leon looked away but now it had his voice registering somewhere in her brain so thats one good thing obstbaum said georg ritter had come to istanbul the week hitler became chancellor a job at the university barely paid for his room in an old wooden house in fener but he was free and hed brought the lessing manuscript with him his future years later when leon and anna got there he was still working on the book and by then had become an institution in the foreign community the man who knew where to get residence permits secondhand appliances turkish lessons he and anna shared a passion for the city outoftheway fish restaurants the best carpet seller in the bazaar and he became an ersatz father to her as cranky as her own full of convictions that everyone else had abandoned when the house in fener was seized for the wealth taxthe owner a greek sent to a work camphe was rescued by a former student a rich turk who set him up in a building he owned in nişantaşi the only marxist in the neighborhood georg claimed but the move suited him he could now shock the bourgeoisie just by being among them something he couldnt afford before and yildiz park was nearby for his dog you dont mind we take a walk shes been in all day i thought you wanted to play chess georg waved his hand with you no surprises move the knights out first keep the pawns back he was snapping on the leash locking the door are you all right you dont look just tired at your age wait till you see how it feels later he sighed the air seeming to wheeze out of his plump cheeks hows the book mendel wants to use the new chapter on nathan der weise he thinks theyll be interested here the comments on saladin as if the turks will read it a german journal in istanbul well where else germany at least you keep something alive nathan leon said trying to remember the chronology then how much more to go georg shrugged the last years at wolfenbüttel not so happy for him but very productive several chapters at least a paupers grave you know in the end me too by the time im finished what about your friend he said tacking where are they going to bury him who tommy you heard about that everybodys heard about it like a western karl may shootouts in istanbul he said shaking his head i dont know thats up to his wife i knew him i wouldnt say he was a friend no just drinks at the park he caught leons reaction you hear things leon looked at him waiting but georg moved away from it youve seen anna yes the same they were passing through the gates into the park the wooded hills dotted with pavilions the sultans old compound i wonder what she sees georg gestured to the trees a shame to miss these but of course the mindabdul hamid thought people listened in the trees everywhere so it was very quiet here whispers and that made him worse why are they whispering the mind you know he thought every week he would be killed every friday in the great selamlik down to hamidiye mosque hundreds all lined up the only time they could see him so one of them must be an assassin the whole time all during prayers waiting to be shot you know there were five hundred slaves in yildiz then not forty years ago not even history yet slaves here and people listening in trees the kind of detail anna loved how did you hear about the drink at the park someone mentioned it i dont even remember who its a great place for rumors here a farewell drink leon said answering what hadnt been asked he was going back to the states they say it was a robbery and no money taken so now everyone has an idea like what you know maybe a coincidence but theres a man missing so one theory he was meeting your friend tommy but shot him instead and ran away why georg shrugged a hundred reasons who knows an unreliable type apparently unreliable leon said marking time whos missing him russian friends georg said looking at him he took something valuable so they want to find him he paused it would be worth a lot to them money you mean money yes certainly favors whatever is required how much leon said going along that would depend a tip some information they would be grateful but if someone knew where he was could find him that would be worthi dont know a price a good sum and of course it would mean finding the man who shot your friend so its good that way too why are you telling me this so suspicious you are not just you they want people to know how valuable this help would be like a reward more karl may why dont they just put up posters a joke you dont think its serious i dont know is it theyre your friends he paused i didnt know you were still in touch with the comrades anna said youd left the party old ties only its a serious matter they have to use every channel and not the police georg looked away watching the dog what georg leon said then pointed to the trees nobodys listening or is that why we came here so we could talk they asked you to approach me why you were abusiness associate of tommys we werent in business together an acquaintance then maybe you have an idea why he was shot maybe he told you something a man whos drinking with him the night before you understand they have to ask and get you to do it sorry he never said a thing why do the comrades think he was shot thats something theyd like to ask their friend and theyre willing to cough up a reward to do it maybe they should just write him off thats not possible what did he take stalins phone number he moved his head toward the main pavilion another one like old abdul assassins everywhere so get rid of them how many now millions thats who you want to do business with its a world of excesses isnt it just he killed your friend hes of no use to you what do you care what happens to him its an old quarrel between them not with you so why not make a little money while they work it out georg he turned to go what makes them think he shot tommy anyway we know they were meeting ones dead now the other one is gone why would he be unless how do you know they were meeting another rumor hes capable of this georg said not answering a violent man unreliable im surprised they want him back they dont want him for long leon looked at him but georg simply stared back ill keep my ears open leon said about to leave as a favor to you he stopped i didnt realize all these years still with the comrades a messenger only leon nodded delivered he started to go then turned to face georg again do you really think i would do this if i did know shop a man this man it would be the right thing to do leon looked at him then you wouldnt have to pay me he used the agreedupon three knocks i brought you some food he said handing over a bag grease from the kebabs already beginning to stain through everything okay he looked around the flat as neat as the night before no clothes draped over chairs uninhabited alexei was sitting before the miniature board of a travel chess set the only thing that seemed to have been removed from his duffel the plane we have a time not yet were going to need to switch airfields after last night the allpurpose excuse nothing safe now alexei grunted and got up you want some tea its all i do drink tea he coughed and smoke puttering with spoons lighting the kettle i see youre a chess player it passes the time you play against yourself you make a move then you turn the board and you know whats interesting when youre on the other side its completely different you think you anticipate the move but you turn and you see something different ill have to try it sometimes playing both sides alexei looked up at him youd better eat it gets messy did they find the body alexei said taking the food to the table yes so he was alone maybe im not so important and now someones raising hell melnikov whose idea to send one youll pay for this it never changes you knew him political officer he said eating you know what that means at stalingrad the nazis in front of you melnikov behind no cowards there no stalin jokes he shot them on the spot easier than sending them back to the gulags less paperwork he crumpled up the bag but you have all that in bucharest his staff list that was my deposit you want to do that again and then again with the tape recorder over and over until a slip a name you forgot or maybe didnt forget well everyone does it save it then for the tape recorder im not here to interrogate you no what then just get you on a plane ah to be my friend easier to get them to talk a little trust so you have a name you never said familiar somebody at a bar he got up to pour the tea leon looked over trying to imagine it the abattoir putting bodies on hooks an ordinary man making tea leon he said leon asking for the rest bauer alexei handed him a glass smiling a little a german name farmer he said translating also pawn he opened his hand to the little board in the game so thats you the pawn thats everybody alexei looked up at him pleased a philosopher something new its different with the russians no sandwiches either just fists when they interrogated you my friend if they had done that you would see it he said putting a hand to his face the bones you see the prisoners after their faces are different they take pictures for the files if theyre alive so you were lucky he shrugged i ran i knew what they were that was my job to know about them he took a sip of tea but you know that and youre not here to interrogate me leon looked over a conveyor belt people bleating now calmly lighting a cigarette but tommy had talked about old times while he planned to kill him you have a wife alexei said running a hand across the top of his head hair cropped so short it seemed to have stopped growing yes in america no here and you the obligatory response magda like lupescu but not so lucky she was killed in the war alexei nodded partisans in bukovina three years now its a convenience sometimes to have nothing to lose he drew on the cigarette thats what you wanted to know isnt it can they use somebody keep me on a leash he shook his head theres nobody just me you didnt know this before why would i thats right not the interrogator what then a wife here so theres a cover businessman at western electric leon raised his eyes how many of tommys people did they know all even the freelancers no where then dried fruit apricots figs apricots alexei said its a good business now youre interrogating me alexei smiled just talking like you we do it differently maybe better he leaned his head to the side still amused yes i think so thats because you dont know what im after alexei looked straight at him no smile now at all no so its an advantage you have what do you want to know leon hesitated trying to frame it how it was at străuleşti a stillness alexeis eyes locked on leons not blinking after a minute he looked down at his hand the cigarette burning to his finger he rubbed it out still quiet a test of wills his eyes neutral sorting things out we do that too he said finally tell them you know the worst thing so they think you know everything leon waited nobody asked me this before your people so why now you were there another silence calculating your romanian friend he told you now it was leon who was quiet when did a romanian not betray a romanian a national gift he reached for another cigarette well im one to talk he waited another second then shook his head i had no part in that just the rest of the guard he nodded thats when i decided what that they were crazy they werent crazy before blood oaths but this it was bound to call attention make them turn against us so you did thats what you want to know why i turned against the guard thats easy because i could see what was coming the future was antonescu for a while yes and now hes going on trial but not you trial for what you were there that would be enough alexei nodded theyre not so interested now what happened they just want to shoot us then all these things can go away so you made a deal thats right alexei said eyes on leon with you he got up clearing his cup you know what its like a mob like water you cant stop it they were going to ruin everything and who could stop them not you leon paused you knew what they were going to do no alexei said raising his voice shoot them maybe this was already happening dudeşti all over the city but this he stopped his shoulders suddenly slumping of course you know in the end they were dead anyway he shuffled over to the window and stood there for a minute lifting his hand to part the shade then letting it rest there staring when you have blood on your hands does it matter how it got there he said carcasses dripping he turned is that what youre asking whats on my hands he held one out not so clean are yours in this business he lowered his hand do you know how easy it can be something you never thought you could do easy later its harder people forget but you live with it whatever you did he turned we penetrated their military intelligence thats all that should matter to you now you want to put me on trial with antonescu for what the guard the camps all of it my fault maybe even the war my fault too he stopped nobody cares about that anymore not them not you its in the past he looked up except your romanian friend maybe so eager to tell you things maybe hed like to tell someone else a romanian will sell anything maybe me leon looked at him intrigued a life revealed in a phrase he cant he doesnt know where you are only you if you werent followed he said dismissive and what do we talk about all these arrangementsthe truck from bucharest the boat this placeand now its what happened to the jews they died his voice final as a window being slammed shut he went to get more tea refilling leons glass leon watching him not saying anything alexei raised his eyebrows waiting all right leon said the american working for the russians lets talk about him alexei stared at him i need to know alexei held his gaze sipping some tea calculating as if he were running his finger over a chess piece not yet ready to move how long have you been doing this he said finally this work maybe youre new to it maybe thats it so let me explain something to you if i knew such a thing would i tell you we talk in bucharestenough information so you know its real the rest when im out safe if i tell you here you squeeze a lemon whats left so you throw it away we dont do that everybody does that he said flatly everybody so you can wait not anymore i need to know for your sake if he had anyone else here here an american here alexei said a little surprised relieved well you wouldnt have to wait for that its not such a bargaining chip he stopped i mean leon looked at him turning this over not worth a trip to the states but someone in washington would be alexei met his glance yes he would be but were here wasting time these questions i dont know anyone here he sipped more tea youre so sure there is such a person leon nodded how i shot him last night on the pier at first there was only a flicker of movement in alexeis face the composure still fixed then his eyes began darting as if they were involuntarily following his thoughts leaping from point to point they identified the man he said leading not a russian no one of us who knew you were coming out and who tried to kill you why would he do that in the open take that chance unless you were someone he had to stop he couldnt give you back to the russianshed expose himselfso hed have to kill you expose himself he was running this operation getting you out which makes for some complications running this piece of it anyway so the trip had to end here things go wrong but hes safe no one blames him and the russians get their rat but then i shot him and i got you instead so i need you to tell me are there others am i wrong alexei put the tips of his fingers together in a pyramid pressing them against his lips almost prayerlike thinking no he said finally then hesitated as if he were eliminating more possibilities they had a man in ankara why not here ankara leon said dully seeing himself at karpićs leaving an envelope on the banquette during the war now im not sure you understand its only gpu i know not the other agencies but you see what this means the russians know the whole operation we have to leave this place its not safe he never knew about the flat so they dont know either were back where we started no everything is compromised now the planethats still your plan i dont see why notif there is one but alexei was shaking his head they must know if i show myself there theyll kill me we have to start over everything ill help you well work together leon looked up caught off guard his new partner alexei started coughing a smokers hack amateurs its my life and the man in charge is working for them was and now its you alexei said peering at him the new gazi and who else leon shook his head i only knew tommy so alexei said and you had no idea what he was not until he shot you not even me the romanian amateurs he started coughing again his face getting paler istanbul he said choking on the word still trying to stop the cough maybe it ends here i always wondered what would that be like when they finally get you he looked up so we make a new plan we leon said you cant trust anybody now not here not in ankara he put his hand to his mouth thinking but we have one piece of luck whats that nobodys looking for you or theyd already be here theyll think im running not hiding who would be hiding me who would and then theyll think im gone we can do it he paused if no one else knows just you do what get me out istanbulits a trap now we have to leave here leon was quiet for a minute then got up to save your skin my skin i saw your face when i told you about washington a valuable chip no people will want to hear about him he looked up always have something to trade leon stood still for a second as if he were balancing himself testing his footing alexeis eyes gray and clear insistent which hadnt seen anything at the abattoir he said holding up his bargaining chip lets start with the gun then leon said one less complication id better have it back the gun alexei said not expecting this what are you going to do with it get rid of it leon said picking up the empty food bag and how do i protect myself here use the one you brought with you leon said looking at him youd have to have one you just wanted this for a little insurance and maybe to see if i was dumb enough to give it to you he held out his hand its a murder weapon now evidence you might use it to put me there in bebek if things dont go well right alexei looked at the open hand then reached into his pocket and took out the gun smiling a little a quick learner he handed it over youre right about the plane leon said putting the gun in the bag ill arrange something else he started for the door just stay put youre safe here and thats my protection now alexei said nodding to the lock a door he looked at leon and you leon reached for the knob by the way it matters to you what happened at străuleşti i wasnt part of that what they did if your friend says yes hes lying making a case now reassuring i wasnt part of that leon turned that must be a comfort on the ferry back leon stayed out on the lower deck dropping the bag over the side halfway across even the sound of the small splash covered by the grind of the motors ibrahim the sot had drowned his whole harem here sewn into sacks the gun was easier just another secret in the bosphorus nothing to connect him now to the quay nothing to connect mihai not even alexei once he could pass him along the chain tommy had tried to break his new partner he looked down at the dark water uneasy again the gun would be settling on the bottom lodging itself in the silt too heavy for the current except there were two currents in the bosphorus hed read somewhere the surface current flowing south and a deep undercurrent kanal flowing north dense and saline strong enough to drag a fishing boat by its net pull someone off course inside the cabin the tea man was handing a tulip glass to a man in a knit cap the kind mihai had worn a dockworker a thief who was anybody tommy ordering drinks at the park every second a betrayal years of it you cant trust anybody now alexei had said asking leon to trust him pera the funeral was held at christ church near the galata tower with a reception to follow in one of the private rooms at the pera palas it was the same service tommy would have had however he had diedthe same hymns the same homily about a man taken too soon the same teary handkerchiefs but he hadnt just died released from illness hed been killed the violence of it disturbing somehow shaming as if hed been complicit in his own death so people said comforting things to barbara and fidgeted in their seats wondering leon sat to the side watching people take their places ed burke was next to barbara as chief mourner with the staff of commercial corp filling out the pew behind the business community had come out and most of the consulate an almost official gathering except for a sprinkling of unknown faces part of tommys wide social net near the back were a few turks secular enough to risk being in a church and two burly men leon assumed to be police scanning the crowd their faces expressionless frank bishop had come from the embassy in ankara stiff and formal in a black suit and owlish hornrimmed glasses he had brought his wife a woman leon hadnt met his dealings with frank usually a drink at the ankara palas or an early dinner at karpićs just long enough to leave papers she kept her head half bowed so leon had to crane slightly to see her face or the part of it not shadowed by her hat pale skin just a hint of makeup reddish hair younger than frank next to them the liggett myers rep was handing out candy to his restless children a committee from the club had sent a wreath barbara wept during the reading of the twentythird psalm the minister spoke of tommys open heart and concern for others no one in the solemn drafty room leon realized had known him at all afterward they clustered at the door hugging or shaking hands then started the steep climb up a taxi had been ordered for barbara its width almost filling the narrow street but everyone else went on foot wives clinging to their husbands arms careful of their heels on the paving stones christ i dont know how the hamals do it frank said winded when they reached the top hamals his wife said you know stevedores whatever you call them who carry things you see some of the loads you dont know how they can stand up itd be mules this far up leon said i dont think you know my wife katherine frank said kay she said almost fiercely as if she were angry about something she was wearing dark glasses against the winter sun her eyes no more visible that theyd been in church nice of you to come leon said taking out a cigarette its a long trip ankara could i have one of those do you mind or isnt it all right on the street i mean i never know what the right thing to do is in this country not anger more a general impatience waiting for everyone else to catch up youre among friends leon said lighting hers katherine i wish you wouldnt frank said her name some pointless tugofwar between them oh i know set an example just two puffs those hymns barbara carrying on i never thought she cared two cents for him katherine all right not appropriate she dropped the cigarette and ground it out sorry she said to leon i didnt mean to waste it leon smiled ive got plenty im in the business what business i buy tobacco for export i thought you were with the consulate like everyone else she said dipping her head toward the others only when i need a permit theres barbara frank said her taxi had now reached the square and was waiting for the tram to turn at least well get decent grub at the pera and its right by the consulate convenient his wife said mm tommys second office funny to think of having his wake there the tram moved and they started across ted frank said to the man ahead of them katherine do you mind tagging along with the kiernans i need to have a word with leon well catch up she lifted her head about to protest but ted had already taken her elbow so she settled for being annoyed not bothering to say goodbye do you have another frank said nodding to leons pack we need to talk he said while he lit it walk with me a selfsatisfied boarding school voice used to getting his way they started up the istiklal caddesi this is a real mess frank said tommy you mean frank nodded and i dont have a lot of time what did you do for tommy besides the courier job i mean just a few favors leon said hesitant i know a lot of people in istanbul and speak turkish i know he said checking off some invisible list tommy liked to work outside now it looks like he had his reasons but it makes it hell with the books what books petty cash special funds tommy liked special funds so all right informants they dont want their names floating around on check stubs but it makes things hard to trace are you asking if tommy paid me he bought me a meal once in a while leon said ill buy you more than that leon stopped to do what to be tommy what youre a businessman you can read books cant you leon nodded suddenly lightheaded a new mix of absurdity and caution maybe you can read tommys a fucking mares nest maybe you can make some sense of them youve already been through them leon said still stitching things together we need to put somebody on his desk until we can get a new man nobody at the consulate knows you worked for him do they so they wont suspect suspect what that youre working for me frank said a little surprised as if leon hadnt been following i cant use anybody inside its compromised the same word alexei had used the same world you think somebody at the consulate killed him leon said his voice his own but coming from somewhere outside his body or set him up and you want me to find him he said carefully slowing things down not trusting his voice now ill find him but i need someone to help from outside you knew him the way he worked how do you know it wasnt me trying it irresistible because your movements are accounted for sorry about your wife by the way i never knew anyway this operation it had to be someone inside he wouldnt have let you in on this nothing personal just the rules for a second leon felt a rush of air in his throat not a laugh just an odd release of pressure of course they still trusted tommy by dying hed become the only one they could trust what operation leon said testing look you in this i know you guys during the waryou did it for that now you think its over believe me its not over he paused tommy always said you were good leon turned focusing on a tram approaching keeping things straight reynolds doesnt have a problem with this if thats whats bothering you youve already talked to them leon said surprised he let a minute go by what operation frank dipped his head plunging in he was bringing someone out one of ours theirs knows russian military intelligence the cast list lots we were going to have a nice talk and now well if tommys dead id say hes back with the russians wouldnt you or dead lets hope so anyway better for everybody now if hes dead leon said quietly yesterdays friend bishop nodded now he knows us tommy wasnt the only one in this so lets hope hes dead we want to be sure of that he said almost casually without menace only the eyes steely leon looked at him same sandy hair probably the same glasses hed worn at groton but everything hardened now years in the business how can you do that whoever sold out tommys in touch with the russians lets start with him lets find him leon took a breath the air in his head clouding again feeding on itself look i know what youre thinking somebody killed tommy maybe theyll try to take a shot at you no i wasnt thinking that really an irony almost too complicated move away what do you want me to do start with the people he ran who else knew leon nodded buying time think how to do this there were no explanations not plausible ones everyone would rather believe tommy whom theyd believed all along i have to tell you i wouldnt blame you if you were thinking that frank said leading them down to mesrutiyet hell want to protect himself yes nice you dont scare easy frank said as if he were putting a note in the file they were passing the wroughtiron gates of the american consulate tommys office he remembered was in back facing down to the horn now his as surreal as attending the funeral of a man youd killed what was the next link he said thinking how were you getting the guy out of istanbul plane dont worry weve canceled it frank said the sound to leon of a door closing the banquet room at the pera was crowded spilling over with consulate staff and turks who hadnt been to the church and were now lined up at the buffet table plates in hand the food was american chicken and potato salad and cold roast beef not even a stuffed grape leaf to remind them where they were barbara stood near the door receiving still blotchy from crying cheeks puffy oh leon she said embracing him thank you for coming it still doesnt seem real does it one day everythings and shot i keep thinking those last few minutes what was that like dont leon said disconcerted dont think about that i know i know everyone says and just when we were finally getting washington thats all he could talk about getting our things there you know what the boats are like and nowwhat do i do dont do anything leon said take some time you dont want to rush into anything i cant stay here wheres home boston i guess she said vaguely but thats years ago you know what its like overseas you take home with you i dont know anyone in washington that was for tommys work frank she said touching his arm as he joined them all this way ankara how are you holding up everyones been so kind barbara said suddenly genteel something shed heard in the movies kays staying over for a few daysi promised her a breakso if you need anything she nodded i never realized how much paper now they want a form to take him home his ashes i mean who elses would they be ill get ted kiernan to take care of it for you thats what he does gets cargo out cargo barbara began but frank miming apologies was being pulled away to meet someone he certainly got here fast enough didnt he barbara said watching them go taking over the office youd think they could wait two minutes tommys not even cold and heres ankara barbara well he isnt oh what does it matter office politics were not in the government anymore are we now what would you come by help me sort things out i always felt i could talk to you she said looking up oddly coquettish tommy took care of everything and now are you all right for money she nodded yes fine its just all the paper she said leaving it openended and he saw that she was misinterpreting responding with an unexpected intimacy tommys wife you should talk to ed burke he said pulling away hes a lawyer oh ed he never said five words to me and now every time i turn around there he is maybe he thinks im a rich widow ha not that rich but youll need a lawyer did tommy leave a will she shook her head i havent found one anyway you dont expectat his age she trailed off beginning to tear up again here you go ed said coming up from behind with a fresh drink exchanging it for the empty glass in her hand thank you ed she said voice quavering a new mood youve been so wonderful chin up he said raising his glass dont let me get tipsy thats all id need you wont he said a friend of the family even more attentive now wanting a seat at the table a curiosity he couldnt contain excuse me mrs king the hotel manager with a question about the champagne well i thought i said with dessert but if people are asking for it she said following him you meet frank bishop ed said just to shake hands in ankara hes the sheriff dont you think ed said leaning forward confiding how do you mean this must have set off some pretty loud bells the minute they hear hes on a plane im not sure im following ed for a desk holder at commercial corp he raised his eyes a knowing look whos that hes talking to leon said looking across a man he recognized but didnt know one of those people you saw at parties but somehow never met al maynard western electric you dont know al leon shook his head tommys man too late now hes going to washington mm tommy mentioned it he did why i mean if you dont know him well not him the job he thought i might be interested in his job funny how things work al might get tommys now the new one in washington somebody will look at him sucking up to frank what did you mean hes the sheriff they dont trust the police here they sent their own man they know it wasnt a robbery how do they know that ed nodded toward frank then why send him ed im just saying what everybody in this room is thinking everybody in the room were they leon looked around the indistinct hum of social conversation but a tension too people shooting side glances at frank lowering their voices when barbara went by speculating buzzing with it everybody with his own idea but no one knew leon felt the tingling at the back of his neck again no one knew frank had moved on to someone else now another link in tommys network maybe you could follow him like a diagram around the room point to undercover point but what did they all do now it had started with watching boats the traffic in the bosphorus drinking at the park hoping for an indiscretion no one got shot but that war was over in the new one you brought out murderers and kept them safe so they could tell you about other murderers with a job in washington at the end now open again waiting for a new tommy could i cadge one more kay bishop said suddenly next to him or dont they like it inside either he blinked coming back smoking she prompted he took out a pack and turned to introduce ed but ed had gone how long had he been standing here watching the room i think you can risk it he said putting on a party smile this crowd she had taken off her dark glasses and now he saw her eyes for the first time shiny and alert so bright they seemed to have drained the light from her pale skin leaving a sprinkling of tiny freckles they looked directly into his steady without fluttering movements to the side and the effect was an easy familiarity as if they already knew each other and were simply picking up the thread of an ongoing conversation then the eyebrows went up slightly a question and he realized hed been staring theyre green he said your eyes like the song just flecks theyre really brown its a trick of the light some trick is that a pass sorry he said surprised did it sound like one how would i know anymore she said im in ankara they dont make passes in ankara if they do i missed it what do they do the wives play cards the men i dont know try to stay awake mostly anyway no passes government town its always like that saves trouble later and the turks ah no worse they just look like youre something in a candy store its new for them men and women mixing theyre not used to it but theyre married dont they talk to their wives he smiled maybe thats why they dont talk to you she raised her glass in a touché gesture he smiled again feeling suddenly buoyant the first time since bebek that he felt himself his mind clear not twisting around anything then she tilted her head what and he shook his in reply nothing embarrassed now flirting here of all places with franks wife not even especially pretty except for the eyes aware of her perfume theres one for instance hes been staring at me for five minutes leon followed her gaze then froze not staring at her staring at him the man in marinas building on the tram only one coincidence allowed a thin moustache something leon hadnt noticed before how do you know hes a turk he said quickly turning back he could be anybody making conversation the buoyancy gone weighted down again with uneasiness a flicker toward the man still there the way he looks like youre a specimen but hell just look so i guess that leaves you lets see eyes anything else you like everything leon said looking at her for a second but frank probably does too she stopped a ball suspended in midair then looked down dont get the wrong idea i was justpassing the time you get to learn how to do that in ankara he finished for her she took a sip from her glass people dont talk like this there like what back and forth tell frank to take a furlough stay for a while he has to go back but im here for a few days right here in fact she looked up as if they could see through the ceiling into her room your first trip one day when we got here right off the train we saw topkapi the big church haghia sophia then another train then ankara so what should i see süleymans mosque start with that what else not in the guidebooks what do you like me everything the water all the boats the food the food not this stuff their food eggplant she said but look what they do with it the sultans had a chef just for eggplant you like it here she said her eyes appraising him the man was moving away from the wall heading toward the buffet table but still keeping them in sight why not just come over but he wouldnt not while they were talking hed wait for an opening its the layers leon said take here where were standing the orient express built it so their passengers would have somewhere to stay somewhere grand with all the latest here she said taking in the faded room the height of elegance then like the train the dining room at sirkeci has the same look this was pera in those days the european quarter all the embassies until they moved to ankara just across the bridge from the ottoman city except all of it was ottoman really for five hundred years before that the hill was genoese a trading concession from the byzantines they built the tower the byzantines lasted a thousand years you can probably see their shipyards from your room all along the horn istanbul is like that youre always standing on layers what about this layer now she said interested now the war was a hard time for turkey but they were neutral they kept a standing army just in case a lot of money for a poor country now theyre broke the house needs a paint job but they have to put it off to next year so everything looks a little shabby but i guess thats true everywhere since the war except home he stopped then dipped his head ceding the point except there but you want to stay here she said almost to herself trying to read his face you dont give much away do you before when you were standing here just looking i had no idea what you were thinking the others yes but you no idea i didnt know i was so mysterious he said lightly most people dont think so well most people arent are they themselves so they dont see it they dont see the layers either she looked away over his shoulder my god whos that he turned thats lily nadir but who is she her husband took over vassilakos shipping when the greeks were thrown out widow in washington shes what theyd call a hostess she gives parties shes not shabby she was dressed for a funeral a highnecked black silk dress with padded shoulders and only a few jewels day diamonds a thin bracelet and one giant pin that glittered starlike on the dark fabric her hair wheat blond streaked with gray was covered by a black cloth with silver thread something between a snood and a head scarf a soft ottoman wrap that made all the hats in the room look dowdy you dont see jewels like that in ankara you dont see them here much either lilys a special case she had been standing at the doorway scanning the room and now saw barbara and headed toward her people stepping aside as she moved across a kind of social choreography she took barbaras hands in hers a regal moment and said something then as barbara teared up gripped the hands harder for emphasis a gesture more dramatic than hugging everyone in the room had turned to watch another istanbul layer leon said she was in abdul hamids harem his harem how old is she its not that long since they abolished it forty years less she was a child a child they were often sent early for training he said then saw her expression not that kind of training household things manners not everybody got to sleep with the sultan certainly not children it was supposed to be a privilege to be a gözde one of the noticed and was she noticed no she was too young after she was lucky she found a protector ill say kay said still looking at the pin lily was moving away from barbara now respects paid and passing the man with the moustache a glance almost too quick to be noticed not stopping but aware of him would you like to meet her you know her everybody knows lily she has one of the great yalis on the bosphorus you come in on the train and see the houses the ones that look like theyre falling down and you think thats istanbul but you dont see the yalis the old gardens the khedive used to stay in hers when he came to istanbul then her husband bought it so now its hers a great friend of atatürks by the way from the early days so dont say anything antiturk first frank now you i have been let out from time to time i just meant i know what you meant im an embassy wife its funny though she doesnt look turkish the light hair i mean you dont usually see circassian originally she cocked her head and now youre not going to tell me where that is and im not going to ask because i dont want you to know i dont know so ill never know he smiled part of russia now east of the black sea very popular with the sultans for slaves gentlemen prefer blondes she said even then lily was surrounded by people but turned a social instinct as if she had actually felt leon approach leon she said the french pronunciation how nice i was hoping she extended her hand to be kissed playful i didnt know you knew barbara her eyes lit up a naughty child caught out hardly at all but darling i couldnt resist no ones talking about anything else imagine like a roman policier in istanbul i had to come but a robbery ouf with no money a turkish thief would take money no the bosphorus at night an assignation it has to be the fatal meeting but who she looked around the room so maybe the jealous wife she could do it very strong hands that one you should feel them a gun would be nothing for her leon smiled behave yourself meet kay bishop shes here from ankara with the embassy she said warmly taking her hand kay nodded my husband does it show everybody in ankara is with an embassy why else would they go the dust my god such a lot of dust of course kemal wanted a turkish city and thats right but you lose something too i think poor istanbul too decadent for him he said hes just a soldier barracks are fine but you know he meant there were too many foreigners in those days all the shop signsarmenian greek hebrew now just turkish even here a turkish city now its kays first visit yes then you have the perfect guide no one knows the city like leon its always the foreignerswere the true istanbullus you you havent been a foreigner since she raised a finger no ages ça nest pas gentil she turned to kay but then you must come to my party its so difficult to find women its new to them still leaving the house the husbands say theyll bring them and then they dont leon youll bring her she paused and your husband of course he cant stay itd just be me im afraid ah lily said glancing at leon so much the better an extra woman in istanbul more precious than rubies oh dear hysterics on the other side of the room barbara had begun to weep loudly perhaps not enough attention lily no its true its a day for the widow and all these distractions youre the distraction leon said i hope thats not true she said enjoying herself at such a time maybe i should leave that would be a distraction you just got here she arched an eyebrow at him but said to kay and what do you think about the murder you have an idea i didnt know it was they said oh the thief in the night lily said waving this off but so much more interesting dont you think its selfish to say this i know but itll be good for the party a little frisson during the war it was easy invite a german invite a russian and then watch same room will they look at each other and of course serious questionswill turkey stay out but always something and since a little boring i think just what you needed then leon said youre making fun of me but its true so why not say it and of course so implausible a man like that a great love how can you imagine it so maybe a local woman and hes leaving her or an american friend just a cinq à sept but now jealous but someone youre a romantic lily leon said and youre not everyone i think if theyre lucky but this time unlucky i admit to think of tommy king as a lover maybe it wasnt about him maybe he just got in the way kay said leon looked at her surprised his minds eye suddenly back on the landing tracking bullets positions playing it out again if you see a chessboard from the other side alexei said but nothing changed it had only happened one way youre always reading things like that in books kay said people see something they shouldnt or they just happen to be but its terrible no a murder by accident not even interesting enough to be a victim just someonein the way better i think the widow those hands he was shot lily the trigger then no problem je tassure listen again a new arrival barbara in tears only the guilty cry like that dont have too much fun with this leon said lily lowered her head reprimanded its true still a death she looked up at kay but youll come to my party of course thank you maybe hell be there whoever it is what an idea leon said why not maybe here too someone he knew not a stranger it has to be why who goes to a place like that to meet a stranger someone he knew and the shot was close how do you know that leon said alert lily shrugged people talk people in the police people i told you nobody talks of anything else except here maybe where you all want to think its a thief involuntarily leon looked across the room frank had reached the drinks table then made a half turn as the man with the moustache introduced himself polite formal maybe innocuous lily was asking kay about her plans a background noise as leon fixed on the other conversation too far away to hear coming out of marinas building a client why frank then frank looked over a nod in leons direction as if he were pointing him out the hotel can arrange for a guide lily was saying to kay of course if leons freehe knows it so well not the shopping though it was anna who knew the shops anna my wife leon said oh kay said not expecting this but she must have seen the ring shes not here shes been ill im sorry something serious une maladie des nerfs lily said a terrible thing a long time now but perhaps soon thats the hope leon said cutting her off frank has my number if youd like to see anything he said as frank joined them kay raised her head to say more then nodded letting it go im sure youll be busy at the office frank said she can use cooks nice if you could spot her a meal though kay shot him a quick irritated glance leon made a little half bow ill look forward to it he said taking her hand yes she said polite again and to the party she said to lily so frank said impatient now to go but kay waited another second looking at leon thanks for the layers he watched them say goodbye to barbara youre interested in that girl lily said i just met her thats your answer to that question no he said a formal answer dont play cupid im too old oh old shes interested in you im married lily sighed your faithfulness so american a turk would go to a teahouse and play cards lily laughed yes perhaps only up here she touched her head but you watched her i saw and she likes you you could tell all this in five minutes two and that husband ouf well thats her problem he looked at her im married so were you devoted everyone says so of course she said easily he was the love of my life and anna was yours but thats not all there is in life its unnatural your faithfulness not to me she looked up at him then put her hand on his arm smiling a little as you like but shes interested she wants to know you know me women like to know detectives and do you find out eventually she patted his arm thats the disappointing part oh no more waterworks she nodded toward barbara i should go a mercy for both of us i think shes just had too much to drink its a hard day for her you think so she turned to him its an odd thing men we know you and you dont know anything about us shes not upset why would she be oh the inconvenience maybe then so much for your crime passionnel well its amusing to think that a man like that with a woman but of course it was political she said matter of fact you know he was with the americanwhat do they call it secret service like the british i suppose what well everybody was a little werent they during the war she said waiting for leon to respond to this not everybody no all right but tommyhans beckman always said so you remember him in the german consulate he knew because he was in theirs how i dont know the most indiscreet man of course they lost the war so maybe thats why lily he said drawing out the sound well but its interesting no spies spying on what each other but now hans is gone all the germans tommy goes home with the faithful barbara so why now thats the question nestce pas some episode during the war maybe and now it comes back the germans remember things so maybe somebodys still fighting i dont know you sound as if it doesnt matter this business oh during the war yes everything matters then now maybe not so much one death how important really in the scheme of things she paused such a look you think im terrible it matters to you so much this death he turned his head at a loss barbara crying across the room maybe more upset than lily imagined something you didnt replace taken away with the pull of a trigger his i know she said were supposed to feel that but in a month or two already something in the past timeits different here you know i came to istanbul as a slave a slave i had no idea then it was just the way things were they gave us new names all the girls poetical names youthful grace ever young i was dilruba captor of hearts well so they hoped dili my friends called me then after i changed again lily then refiks name and you think well life all these things that happen it feels like yesterday but really a long time ago a slave imagine how long ago that was another time he was quiet for a second then smiled captor of hearts yes but not the one they expected so who knows maybe something unexpected here too a crime passionnel after all she looked toward barbara well ill say goodbye and leave niobe to her grief as she dropped her hand the man against the wall started moving through the crowd what hans told me thats just for you she said not that it matters now everyone will know soon why its bound to come out when they find who did it unless they keep it quiet they always try dont they still therell be something now dont forget bring your friend to the party she said quickly already moving away the man from the wall was making eye contact now as he got closer oddly the moustache disappeared another trick of the light his face was dark with stubble someone who shaved twice a day but no moustache the man on the tram again mr bauer he said there at last may i introduce myself colonel altan leon nodded i thought perhaps we might have a cigarette together would you mind outside you mean altan moved his arm after you expecting leon to move are you with the police no please extending the arm again now more than a suggestion they moved to the door weaving through the crowd a sad occasion altan said a very popular man leon said nothing waiting until they reached the street then offered him a cigarette colonel in what he said lighting it emniyet altan said simply i thought you never announced yourselves a courtesy to foreign guests to put us at ease talking to state security mr bauer we are not gestapo no but not just police either is this an official visit not yet leon looked at him trying to stay calm emniyet could do anything detain you indefinitely revoke a visa not gestapo no knocks on the door in the night but just as privileged how can i help you you had drinks with mr king the night before he died what did you talk about his going home mostly he was looking forward to that he didnt like turkey no not that his job here was over now he had a new one thats all his job here you worked with him no reynolds has had its licenses in place for years commercial corpthat was tommywas part of the war effort buy chromium embargo companies if they were selling to the axis things like that but now the wars over sos the job i meant his other work his other work mr bauer its better to be candid in these matters we know mr kings work we know you were sometimeswhat an irregular its our business to know these things we have to be the ears of turkey listening to tommy king to many and now you want to know who killed him not precisely thats a matter for the police then why are you the police concern themselves with crime witnesses what kind of bullet alibis they do things in their way methodical they will want to know about your talk at the park too your movements the night of the crime bebek so convenient just down the road a coincidence the night before drinks that night close by theyll be suspicious of that theyll think he might have been meeting you theyll ask when you came to the clinic when you left police you think i shot tommy i dont care leon looked up at him im not police im not concerned with justice my job is to protect the republic if you did the police will find out or maybe not they are not always successful our police overwork perhaps i dont care one way or the other no turks have been killed if the ferengi want to kill each other thats their affair until its ours and whens that altan bowed his head a silent now but you dont want to know who killed him for the record of course but what i want mr bauer is the romanian they had been walking back up to tünel and now stopped at the wall near nergis sok looking down toward the horn a haze was forming over the shipyards blocking the pale winter sun what romanian more candor a romanian mr king arranged to meet of great interest to you to the russians too a prize of war so to speak and you think he killed tommy altan shrugged its not important whats important is where he is maybe hes with the russians no how do you know because i do leon looked at him the ears of turkey another tip of his head everywhere a new thought with us too thats how you know tommy was meeting someone altan stared at him not saying anything did tommy ever suspect leon said altan rubbed out his cigarette we cant be everywhere we have to choose carefully where there is likely to be mischief mischief look down there altan said nodding to the horn once the hinge of the world now all we can do is listen to protect ourselves the russian bear would swallow us so we dont offend america is rich he turned to leon they embargo industries their war our industries so we dont offend them either a balancing act do you know what it was like for us this war the first one was a catastrophe the ottomans finished istanbul occupied greece invades only atatürk saved us well and the greek soldiers beinggreek then a new one both sides say come in maybe another catastrophe so we walked a tightrope one step another step always watching to see if someone might push trip us and now were still watching a man is shot in our streets the police have a crime but we may have an incident something that gets worse both of you pulling at us so we want this man before you tear us apart to get him you mean the russians have asked for him theyre accusing altan shook his head they cant do that officially such a man cant exist he looked over for either of you there is no romanian but what will you both do to get him already a man here from ankara the russians offering money battle lines and whos in the middle russians offering ears everywhere but if everybodys still looking then nobody has him that point has not escaped me what would you do if you got him altan smiled to himself a valuable thing to have you mean youd sell him to the highest bidder no we would advance our interests of course its not for me to decide how to do that only to find him he paused it would be a good thing for turkey to stop this move the war somewhere else we would be grateful for that someone who helps leon looked at him im an american with interests here a good life i think your wifeyoure satisfied with her care i cant help you even if i wanted to i never heard of your romanian no im sorry to hear it he reached for cigarettes then stopped as leon offered his again and if you really know as much as you say you do you know that i was nothing to tommy an errand boy when i happened to be going to the right place altan nodded karpićs leon said nothing taking this in how long had they been watching you could have been deported for that you know we were fighting germany not turkey in turkey im just a businessman youve got somebody inside from the sound of it ask him i wasnt part of anything just an irregular but thats what makes you so interesting we dont know you thats what this talk is all about no i would say its to warn you not to get involved he turned unless of course you are this is excellent he said looking at the cigarette its superior american tobacco and yet youre in turkey its the blend virginia bright is cheaper but turkish latakia has a stronger flavor it brings the blend up and theres a certain cachet to turkish people associate it with the rich custom blends then its lucky for us your real competition is kentucky burley leaf you can flue cure and flavor it altan drew on the cigarette so you know tobacco leon looked at him its my business thats what i do here yes you know altan said as if something had just occurred to him you see people and you think youve seen them before but you cant remember where and then it comes to you i think i saw you yesterday on a tram maybe not the hat its hard to tell where was this beyazit was it you not really a question it may have been i went to see a friend at the university yes who georg ritter ah our marxist philosopher there i thought he was in nişantaşi now his office he still keeps one there hes well the rhythm of conversation eyes watching carefully actually he wasnt in stupid i suppose just stopping by like that but it gave me an excuse to go to the book market you know by beyazit camii you pronounce it correctly the c its tricky for foreigners a valuable skill so few americans know the language im surprised they didnt call upon you more on a regular basis not errands i prefer the tobacco business altan raised his eyebrows on that we agree we prefer you in it too he began to walk leon following the book market we had some dealings there once you know the german bookseller the corner with the old tree not just selling books the germans denied it of course but they stopped its always better that way to arrange things quietly quite a coincidence you being on the tram yes oh i see you think on purpose what would be the reason for that none no i was out in laleli a hotel the police you know its routine with them to check hotels after a crime so we wanted to know is the romanian somewhere maybe an assumed name but a ferengi thats usually remembered and was he two men at this one on a drunk the clerk said sailors he thought but he could identify them if he saw them again oh easily i think both he said looking at leon of course the clerk sometimes these types are not reliable an unusual drinking party the room was clean sailors are usually neat mr bauer have you ever been drunk look at your room the next morning the police could show him a picture of the romanian then youd know for sure if they had one dont you mr bauer he said not answering the police have their own methods we dont interfere interfere emniyet you can do i dont think you understand the police must do their work but it would be better if they dont solve this crime leon looked at him waiting the men are gone whoever they were whatever they did if the police find who killed mr king friends are likely to be embarrassed someone will be put on trial the russians are an excitable people quick to take offense we could lose our balance trip much better to deal with this quietly out of the public eye what if the romanian shot him would you want to solve it then even more quietly altan said his own voice lower after we find him he turned making a formal goodbye nod thank you for the cigarettes the turkish tobacco it comes mostly from the north coast i think thats right your business it must take you to the black sea ports then once in a while your wife too i think leon said nothing a woman with jewish interests she is jewish yes i understand terrible things during the war one cant help but be sympathetic to save people its heroic what is illegal when a life is at stake now of course a different time what makes you think their lives arent still at stake every day you hear stories and now another friend to balance the americans want this the russians want that and the britishthe british want us to stop ships you say refugees they say human contraband you were the safety valve all during the war the only people who got out got out through here but now a flood and the british turning them back to where for myself i dont he paused your wife i know is ill you dont share her interests the old work no good its a difficulty for turkey why do you ask no reason just to know your sympathies times change the black seaa very troubled place now we think the romanian came that way now all the jews a place that needs more ears familiar with the ports leon took this in an invitation a warning but altans face remained blank have you seen the human contraband what they look like leon said yes skeletons some of them they had reached the top of the rise the sea of marmara a distant glimpse of blue between rooftops to think when jason sailed through there altan said looking down at the water the black sea was a new place a treasure househides amber maybe gold now it sends corpses europes war and the survivors float to us theyre just passing through to where america no another war the british took palestine from us now they ask us to help them keep peace there and we have to do it keep our balance he stopped you wouldnt want to help anyone pass through make difficulties there seem to be a lot of things you dont want me to do but im not doing any of them i buy tobacco thats all and now the emniyet is accusing me ofi dont know what exactly am i suspected of something altan looked over at him taking a second of not being candid mr bauer thats all he raised two fingers to his forehead in a salute hosça kalin he said and turned away melting into the crowd of people at the funicular station leon stood for a minute watching then went back to the end of the square and lit a cigarette unnerved what everyone dreaded a talk with the emniyet but what had actually been said not said everything elusive like the moustache that came and went with the light but only one coincidence allowed not two and now the tram seemed to be the coincidence he looked left down the hill toward marinas building maybe visiting someone else but that would make two coincidences he imagined them suddenly in her room altan slipping off the kimono running his hands along her shoulders or talking cigarette smoke drifting out the window a notebook of talk maybe weekly his thursdays too he tossed the cigarette and started down the street trying to remember everything he had ever said to her did altan pay her something more valuable than her body a peephole into someones secret life how many or just him everything they said afterward lying on twisted sheets altan listening the vestibule smelled of damp plaster something he hadnt noticed before his senses usually overwhelmed by anticipation and after the smell of sex his fingers heavy with it quiet on the stairs a drip somewhere down the hall gray light through the translucent landing window his breath shorter now anxious would she lie a new lie to keep the other one going the knock sounded loud not the standard gentle tap knowing she was waiting on the other side it took her a few minutes to answer leon straining to hear listening for footsteps shed be surprised clutching the kimono tighter belting it when she opened the door hesitant her face was exactly what he expected puzzled a little put out what are you doing here without her saying it a silk wrapper but not the kimono the bedroom door closed behind her what did you tell altan he said she said nothing looking at him deciding how to react murat she said finally how do you know about him we just had a chat youre in some trouble leon shook his head he just wanted to scare me a little let me know hes there she stared for another second then opened the door wider so come in he told you he comes here no he doesnt know i know how do you she said lighting a cigarette i saw him coming out of your building a client she shook her head just information he doesnt take a little something out in trade she looked up a small flash of anger what do you want hes emniyet what does he want to talk about me about everyone and you tell him hes emniyet she said the anger a little weary now im a whore what choices do you think i have what does he want to know the man who owns the building they want to know about him i dont know why do you think i would ask know what about him what happens in bed another flash of anger you think thats so interesting what happens there she took in some smoke calming herself what he says his business does he talk about inönü things like that and me what do you tell him about me nothing i said when you come here its only for what we do thats all its true enough what do you ever say to me he saw them lying in bed idle talk drifting with the smoke she put out the cigarette who are your friends who in the consulate do you have enough money you know what i tell him you have enough for me thats all i care about she stopped and came over to him you dont have to worry she said touching him i dont say anything to him its bayar he wants to know about you only come here to sleep with me its true isnt it thats why you come stroking his arm you enjoy it why didnt you tell me why because youd tell me to stop and how could i stop so then maybe youd stop coming and who knows i might say something one day you could use in a weak moment you think i would do that she said maybe isnt that why they came to you you make a good recruit people tell you things all the time she turned to him stung thats right all the time wonderful things do you want to hear do this more let me see you like that yes open your legs she said everything in a rush spilling over with it louder oh you dont want to hear why not wonderful things all my life just to have this she said her hand to the room emniyet doesnt want to hear either tell us what he says what do they think men say to a whore the bedroom door opened just a head face unshaven and the top of an undershirt a quick exchange in a language leon didnt understand marina telling him to go back inside glowering at leon unsure then closing the door marina looked over at him saying nothing the mood now slightly deflated interrupted what was that the language armenian she said a specialty he likes it yes she said defiant now it makes it better for him his language would you like to know what he tells me in it leon turned away then caught his reflection someone unfamiliar as tarnished as the mirror itself mottled with age brown spots spreading around the edges wearing out a place hed found erotic dust in the window light a sheen of sweat now just a tired room a surly armenian behind the door a thin girl in a wrapper waiting to please him what her life was really like he stared at himself for another minute unable to move the same hollowing out he sometimes felt after sex the man in the mirror looking straight back undeceived marina came over to him touching his arm tentative sensing his withdrawal when he looked down he saw her differently too more rouge brushed over the cheekbones maybe the way the armenian liked it for a second he had the feeling a strange jarring that he had made her up that all the visits here those afternoons hed waited for had really taken place in his head come thursday altan its nothing i tell him nothing he wants to know about bayar not you she paused and i wouldnt you know i wouldnt tell him its justhe likes to know who comes here come thursday a half smile squeezing his arm we dont have to talk at all if you dont want she moved her hand higher to draw his head down but stopped both of them aware that something had happened had broken whatever spell the room used to cast like a crack in the mirror would you do something for me he said she raised her eyes waiting dont tell him i know he comes here why not maybe someday i will tell you something that hed want to know and hed believe it because i told him youd use me for that it wouldnt be a lie no then tell him yourself youre alike you two you want to do what he does he moved to the door i dont sleep with him she said as if it made a difference yet he said he took the istiklal tram to the office and went through messages with turhan then got a dolmus taxi out to aksaray waiting until the other passengers found their buses then waiting a little while longer to make sure he was alone the emniyet wanted you to think they knew everything watched everywherewasnt that the point of altans meetingbut no one could watch all the time only one man at the station seemed fixed in place a possible plant but then he got on a bus headed to the airport and leon started back toward laleli twisting first down to the aqueduct then up the hill alexei opened the door a halffilled chessboard behind him nothing hot he said looking into the bag leon had brought he was clean shaven his shirt pressed military crisp leon thought of the grizzled armenian heat up a can of soup alexei opened the cigarette carton tearing the cellophane off a pack the food isnt much but your cigarettes are excellent theyre easy to get here american cigarettes in bucharest like gold i have a good source so alexei said taking a puff why the face theres trouble ive just been to a funeral ah your friend how did that feel he said almost amused then i had a visit from the emniyet why you theyre seeing everybody who knew tommy and theyd like to find you so they can play us off against the russians odds on the russians this time youd be a kind of peace offering feeding the beast to keep him quiet and my new friends youre topic a with them too the embassy just sent a man from ankara the name bishop mean anything to you if it does i need to know to protect me alexei said smiling a little then shook his head no he canceled your plane alexei looked up there are a few ways to think about that depends whether you feel like trusting him alexei waved this off not worth answering and your tommy no one suspects they still think he died in the line of duty keeping you from the russians who now have me except theyre offering money for you which franks bound to hear i did so no then its as before not exactly he wants to bring me inside to take over tommys desk find out who shot him alexei raised his eyebrows at this then looked over to the chess game a complicated board now every move he stood up every time you take your fingers off a piece very dangerous for pawns would you like some tea he moved over to the stove so now were careful thats how you survive theres a leak in turkey somebody told the russians i was here well tommy would have but thats the interesting thing alexei said sitting down sipping tea i dont think he did what leon said a delayed reaction there were no russians there that night just him one man not even a good shot the russians dont work that way go on leon said quietly you leave me here alone all day so what is there to do but think turn things over your tommy was the istanbul link think how this works he took another sip he knows the fishing boat is bringing me to istanbul he keeps me here he puts me on a plane nothing before nothing after so the chain is secure everyone works this way but why shoot me in istanbul so public always a risk of being seen why not the coast not one night there two a delay in the weather if they wanted to kill me or take me away why not there he knew where we were he called to see if we were coming how easy to make another call have his russian friends take care of things then when everyone is inside keeping out of the rain but he waits for istanbul an odd decision no but he came with a gun alone you can believe me the russians arent known for restraint so what does it mean leon waited silent they didnt know they never would have handled it that way but you agreed he must yes so i thought about it prisoners have time to think why here the fishing village a perfect moment bebek still possible but not as good and not alone then why pick it because he wasnt alone he had you no suspicions attach to him if they attack at the fishing village the leak might be traced but here hes protected he had you leon said nothing we were there to kill each other thats what would have been found and tommys still safe he wasnt there just us the setup leon had already imagined he nodded you were the only one who knew where the actual landing would be alexei said thats correct thats what he said so think some more he goes to an outsider someone he trusts for such a job maybe he didnt want to lose one of his own men leon said his voice sour no who gets killedyou someone else what does it matter not a time for niceties the trust is the point he didnt trust his own people alexei opened his hand so he doesnt tell them then how do the russians know im here they didnt know bebek or they would have been there but now theyre offering money so how do they know someone else told them alexei nodded but only tommy knew when you were coming and me but the operation itselfothers must have known about that not when but the fact of it that tommy would be alerted that he would pass me on and then when hes killed the obvious conclusioni must be here in istanbul maybe running maybe snatched by someone else but not by them he looked across at leon im safe in the next link the problem is here i knew this from the first even before i thought things through he walked over to the board and put his fingers on one of the pieces so the next move the russians are looking now the turks you say so we have to get out of turkey you have people in greece its not far edirne but well need papers he leaned over to his duffel and pulled out a passport its a risk now using this name he opened it the pictures still good only a little of the seal not hard to remove turkish this time i think anyway not romanian he handed it to leon you can do it leon nodded then a contact name in athens for later after were there not before no one knows not here not there a surprise visit you understand ill need a day or two for the papers no more alexei said the officer in charge you have enough food i dont want to come back here yes alexei said then froze lifting his hand up a traffic cop he crossed to the door in two steps silent leaning back against the wall listening drawing a gun from his pocket in what seemed to be slow motion holding it up leon didnt breathe staring at the gun a sound outside he hadnt heard alexei listened for a few seconds more then lowered the gun moving away from the door the couple at the end he said quietly they stopped in the hall maybe carrying something you heard them you learn to listen living like this i see you found your gun alexei nodded its not much two would be better you never know how many of them would come leon said nothing what it was like day to day waiting and another gun would make a difference he said finally in that kind of shootout no its better to escape but not always possible so you listen no surprises escape how leon said looking around the room the bathroom window drops to the courtyard but theres only one way out to the street and theyd have someone there you have to assume that utility stairs to the roofthey might not expect thatand its easy over to the next how do you know i tried it a test you went out youre supposed to stay here i told you to stay here without a plan playing chess all day he shook his head how do you think im still alive listening to people like you who knows maybe waiting for you to bring them trust nobody leon said still imagining his life then what do you do sit on a roof or walk around istanbul it would be a matter of time a map would help also your phone number he fixed his eyes on leon a kind of challenge if were going to help each other leon hesitated then pulled out his wallet and handed him a business card your home alexei said glancing at the telephone number or the dried fruit office leon said someone would be there if im not alexei held the card for another minute memorizing it then handed it back keep it if they kill me and they find it it leads them to you dont worry its here now he tapped his temple leon started for the door then turned if someone else told them there must have been two inside tommy didnt know alexei smiled faintly the russians did that sometimes put two in more you dont want them to know each otherif one gets caught its only one he cant lead to the others washingtons like that they dont know each other there said casually sure of it sometimes it backfires in bucharest there was a case they were watching each other as the most suspect which was right as it turned out a typical bucharest situation he snorted the corners of his mouth creasing up i didnt make the world someone elses joke but tommy shot you without telling them yes alexei said nodding as if he were appreciating a move leon had made im still thinking about that heroics maybe he liked to act alone of course they would want me dead so he hands them a fait accompli with you to protect his cover or something else i dont knowall we know is that he did maybe you can help when you become him find out why he did it maybe he thought you deserved it maybe alexei said looking at him he also shot you leon left by the back checking the courtyard to see if alexei had been right one exit he imagined him racing up the utility stairs across the roof like a cat burglar on his eighth life near the bottom of the hill he turned into a side street and waited to see if anyone had been behind but no one passed except two turkish women in anklelength coats carrying string bags he stood for a minute making a list new papers at the landing there were boats for hire to cross the horn the handful that hadnt been put out of business by the bridges once the whole shore here had been lined with slips for caïques istanbuls gondolas slim and graceful in the old watercolor prints the boatmen in turbans ladies in veils on mysterious errands layers this caïque was a rowboat with a small outboard motor the turbaned oarsman an overweight old man who smelled of raki and complained all the way across about the price of gas how was an honest man to make a living or a dishonest one for that matter leon thought then raised his head remembering the boatman in bebek whod been promised more money a loose end but that request would end up on tommys desk and now he was tommy he got off near the koç shipyards in hasköy and walked the few blocks to mihais office an old industrial building given to mossad by its jewish owner before it could be seized for the wealth tax during the war mossad had worked out of the hotel continental and some of the staff still preferred it for the convenience but mihai had moved his unit down to the waterfront aliyah bet the illegal immigration was like noahs ark hed said it should have a water view only a few of the top story windows had one though a scummy stretch near the repair docks the rest of the office looked like the sewing factory it had been now divided by plywood partitions mihais desk an old cutting table was covered with what looked like passports stacked in piles and a clipboard of lists sorry im late leon said loud enough to be overheard mihai looked up surprised anna wont mind we can take a taxi you really dont have to do this you know yes i know mihai said his eyes question marks leon cocked his head toward the door give me a second mihai said a normal tone now i have to put these away destination visas gold he started to shelve them in a safe leon picked one up honduras thats new a generous host no quotas leon opened the passport josef zula born lodz going to honduras they buy that the romanians dont care where he ends up as long as he doesnt stay there the visas are official cubas drying up and weve got people ready to sail beggars cant be choosers how many would you like to take the land of the free jews all full leon put the passport down wouldnt they be surprised in honduras if you did come this must have cost you what price would be too much for you he closed the safes door and twirled the dial so lets not keep anna waiting he said raising his voice then told the secretary hed be at the clinic bases covered whats so urgent he said outside now i have to go to bebek and on a day theres so much to do i couldnt think of anything else they know you visit anna why else would i come see you my conversation whats wrong i had a talk with the emniyet welcome to the club whats so remarkable at tommys funeral they want to know what happened they know alexei is here so they talked to you not only me a little warning i think they also warned me not to get involved with you aliyah operations they thought because of anna that you might actually help instead of making difficulties how little they know you you dont seem very concerned the emniyet and i are old friends sometimes they take an interest sometimes not right now theyre taking an interest the english insist so istanbul is becoming difficult we have to send the convoys to italy then all we have to do is get past the mediterranean fleet and the coastal water blockade a piece of cakeraf expression he said wryly during the war it was easier they had other things to do now they can turn all their attention to stopping the jews let the poles finish them off but not these four hundred with honduran visas most some others all good you dont happen to have a spare mihai looked at him theyre already made out i need another a fresh passport for him the butcher youre asking me that he leaned against a chain link fence enclosing the scrap metal yard behind them dull gray and rust a killer of jews its more complicated than that no easy why are you here i thoughtno contact if the police its not just the police now its emniyet mihai stopped quiet i thought youd better knowwhere things are its not easy its complicated so tell me there were no taxis waiting at the koç yards so they walked toward the hasköy ferry stop leon talking trying to put everything in order like tidying a desk mihai said nothing just listened the ferry for karaköy was docking when they got to the pier so they followed the crowd on and went out to the open stern to talk everyone else huddling inside to stay warm mihai scanned the empty pier as the boat pulled away spewing brown lignite smoke no one behind he said youre not being followed theyll come and go now that theyve made contact its a way they have to make you think theyre always there youll get used to it he turned back looking at leon as if he were still sifting through what had been said hes a killer of jews he said finally but thats not all he is i need papers not from me just an address who do you use he waited we have to move him you know that not mossad we cant not this man leon nodded not mossad me you one man mihai thought for a minute get out of this now or youll never get out get out how ive just been telling you a man like this give him back to the russians then no one ever knows any of it just give them the address and its over he disappears he stopped and were safe hed be killed youd do that kill him i wouldnt have to theyll do it he rubbed his palms a washing no leon said quietly mihai looked away not meeting his eye so make another knot tie yourself up a houdini how are you going to do it get him out first i get him papers mihai took another minute you dont need me for that youre tommy now you can make all the arrangements right under the americans noses a half smile while you investigate yourself the taxi to bebek took half an hour leon talked to the nurses so that their arrival would be noted then went to annas room she was dressed sitting in a chair by the garden doors a cardigan draped over her shoulders mihai took her hand and looked into her eyes hello lovely he said then to leon she blinked she knows my voice maybe we found a boat mihai said to her his voice easy making conversation did leon tell you for four hundred from the greek the one who sold us the ida remember ari says in pretty good shape panamanian flag so well see mostly from poland from the camps you know some went back to their homes and the polespogroms after the camps he stopped but thats over in constancia now so we have to hurry when you get better youll see how much work bigger boats in italy they have one for two thousand imagine two thousand at a time the work just to get them on board he trailed off looking at her then got up its always like this no improvement but no regression the doctor says thats the important thing mihai stared at the garden sometimes i think its my fault that work i thought she was like me but really only a young girl its nobodys fault i know if this hadnt happened if that hadnt happened he paused i knew girls like her everything for the family the good dishes for passover my mother had a tableclothfor once a year special she was like that a daughter thats why she did it i think somewhere in her mind she was saving her parents and then the night the children drownedit started then but not all at once remember a little at a time like turning out the lights until the house is dark he shrugged his eyes suddenly moist no regression what does that mean from what this i remember when you came here both of you the way you looked at her he faced the garden again for another minute the room silent and what happens to her if anything happens to you leon said nothing another knot being tied into place mihai turned back for a killer of jews i knew theyd bring someone in ed burke said the pouches under his eyes pulled taut anxious they think one of us did it nobody said that ed they just asked me to go over the books but they think it why not promote phil leon shrugged and why is frank still here hes going back to ankara whats the problem ed they didnt ask me to go over your books leon said slyly almost a tease just tommys all right dont tell me ed how long have you known me its just a funny time for an audit he looked down at the folder in leons hand the embargo list thats during the war how far back are you going just getting to know the files people have different systems i still dont understand the expense claims you dont have just one depends whos authorizing the money the consulate use the white forms if its direct from washington they have to go by pouch the yellow ones but it all gets paid out of the same office here ed nodded welcome to the us government leon got up and went over to the wall of file cabinets pulling out a few more folders you think its one of them somebody he turned down i dont think anything yet leon said looking down at the file then back up a new thought anyway you said it was someone here i said they thought so why else would the police be here still all morning right through the consulate where were you alibis did you have one very funny come on ed its just routine to talk to coworkers it gives you the creeps thinking its someone here walking down the hall or something and you dont have any idea leon looked at him not saying anything an hour later frank called him into his office to meet detective gülün a heavyset man in a gray suit shiny at the cuffs with what seemed to be a permanent five oclock shadow by that time leon had had the filing system explained by tommys secretary and had gone through every drawer looking for anything not officially connected to commercial corp but tommy had evidently taken that part of his cover seriouslyhis other work had never existed at least on paper there were only a few personal items in the desk drawers a datebook check stubs the white expense chits breath mints anybodys desk the bottom drawer was locked but shallow just enough room for a bottle for an afterwork drink would he keep records at home vulnerable to theft there had to be something maybe coded within the other files memos that meant something else trails that would take weeks to unravel money however was always accounted for tommy had paid his outside people it had to come from somewhere i told detective gülün that you were helping us leon nodded anything yet he asked gülün who seemed startled by the question defensive a murder in the european community the last thing any policeman would want angry diplomats demanding answers calls from ankara people you werent supposed to intimidate that was altans world full of resources and foreigners gülün was the kind of policeman more comfortable with car thieves in taksim some witnesses in the café witnesses the car only unfortunately too dark to identify but a car not a taxi leon said that narrows it a little doesnt it someone who can afford to run a car with the gas shortages i havent taken mine out in months a diversion gülün eager to take it as you say someone who can afford maybe black market connections taking it even further away youve talked to people here leon asked gülün nodded of course we have to check their stories hours wasted but nothing suspicious no but you know i didnt expect he said a deference i apologize if its inconvenient no no you have a job to do we want you to do it if you think its someone here as i said i dont expect that a matter of procedure only the likely explanation is a robbery but the difficulty is the money mr king still having it and nobody in the café saw anything how many there were just the car its possible there was only one scared off perhaps before he could take the money already preparing his unsolved folder but if it wasnt then its something more serious more serious gülün said frank looked up slightly alarmed wondering where he was going a thief thats one thing leon stopped hesitating looking down at the folder in his hand what i keep wondering is what if it wasnt accidental what if there was a motive some reason some reason gülün said a monotone its just an idea i had leon said do you know what tommy actually did here frank raised his eyebrows commercial corp was set up by the board of economic warfare he glanced at gülün already lost in the bureaucratic chart his job was to buy up things so the germans couldntchromium mostly a good thing for turkey by the wayhed pay top dollar just to keep it out of german hands and to steer american business to friendly firms he could also embargo unfriendly ones he said dropping his voice embargo them gülün said waiting thats right stop doing business with them if he thought they were too cozy with the germans that could be trickycompanies wanted to sell to both sides sometimes they had to to keep going an allied embargo could put you out of business ruin you gülün said leon nodded what occurred to me was what if its somebody tommy put out of business somebody with a grudge i see said gülün familiar with grudges or somebody he was going to but the war is over bauer bey but not all the embargoes have been lifted yet and now who else is there to sell to somebodys just getting by and tommy wouldnt well its just an idea no its possible involving turks people gülün was more comfortable investigating if you like ill make a list for you he held up the folder any business that was affected might have a grudge or maybe would find it convenient to get tommy out of the way would that be useful very useful gülün said dipping his head a kindness well we want to find out who did this anything to help for an instant he felt ashamed of his own smoothness gülün and his force grilling hapless businessmen piling up reports but not just any businessmen after allgerman sympathizers people who still deserved a little police scrutiny i think were getting someplace here frank said a dismissal how long to put together a list give me a day or two leon said to gülün a preliminary anyway gülün dipped his head again he picked up his hat as frank started for the door his files he said to leon theyre for these businesses only nothing else like what gülün took a second personal business perhaps some other business he said floundering leon shook his head just commercial corp tommy kept a very clean desk gülün turned this over then nodded and followed frank out leon sat back on the edge of the desk leafing through the folder export licenses a political report on the companys owner vague enough to be gossip tommys cover work an idle thought did he favor businesses dealing with the soviets but he would have then that was good frank said coming back the embargoes that should keep him busy not poking around here the emniyet are already doing that they talked to me they know aboutwhats his name jianu yes were cooperating with them he looked up theyre everywhere they might actually get him what makes you think theyd turn him over to us politics frank said sure of it theyre afraid of the russians and they should be find anything besides the embargoes theres nothing to find either tommy played his cards pretty close to the vest or somebodys been cleaning house not even payment records i have those frank said casually you have them leon said im not supposed to see what exactly do you want me to do here be like gülün spin my wheels frank adjusted his owl glasses dont get excited i didnt want things sitting around in tommys office somebody might take a look ive got them all here whats all the other files operations a half smile you come up once in a while youve been through them frank nodded but i dont always know what im looking at who the people are he opened the desk drawer pulling out several folders two sets regular expenses special funds some of those are in code so we may never know why would he do that i mean here at the consulate frank turned well what occurred to me was that he didnt trust people here one of them anyway thats why youre here remember they went through the expense books together leon identifying names when he could mehmet at the bar tommy no doubt one of several paymasters a turk in the customs house a few names from robert college he stopped f gülün whats our detectives first name farid i know i thought hed have a special interest try to get this wrapped up before anyone got too far into the books several payments leon said still looking at the sheet you know what these people are like theyre all on the take over here no more than anywhere else leon said beat cops in chicago aldermen in south boston but only foreigners corrupt no offense i didnt know youd gone native frank said lightly trying to ease out of it just part of the culture isnt it a little baksheesh a groton drawl rubbing his fingers together and what about us were the ones paying frank looked over his glasses point is he took it all right but what did he do for it frank shrugged parking tickets maybe some offduty surveillance who the hell knows ask him leon shook his head hell think hes a suspect hes easier to play this way if he thinks we dont know hes in a spot he knows what tommy was doinghe worked for him so he knows the embargo list is bullshit but hes not going to say anything just keep his head down they dont like crooked cops over here either believe it or not hed be out frank raised his head to say something then let it go and turned back to the expense sheet heres one of the codes twelvetwo a date no the dates in the left column two hundred and fifty liras same cost as the boat hed hired last september another look at the date its me twelvetwo leon looked at it a crossword clue lb he said finally twelve in the alphabet like a kids game christ tommy see if it works for the others and then what frank said the question is who the fucks jm or any of them let me look at it he said tracing his finger down the column looking for whoever had supplied alexeis papers probably no more than a month ago when had the operation started on the romanian side somewhere between a hundred and two hundred dollars would be about right in turkish liras he looked at the coded entry not initials he recognized a delivery hed made how could he do this without the jianu file wheres the operation file on our guy frank looked at him not saying anything there must be one do you want me to do this or not i need to check a date frank waited another minute then got up and went to his desk it stays here you can take the others but this stays here leon opened it all laid out the contact number tommy must have called when the storm hit the army transport landing permit with a routing from istanbul to casablanca so no one in greece had been involved a plus an address in tophane for enver manyas photographer presumably the forger consistent dates are you going to read over my shoulder or let me do this frank moved away who else knew jianu was coming thats what were looking for and anything that might need to be taken out references to twelvetwo but there werent any not here tommy was supposed to be the pickup so why ask leon but then two people wouldnt have been dead leons body what the police would need to close the case and the codes frank said just to keep things neat so we know where were spending our money leon nodded ill need the payout sheets ill bring them back you understand its not that i dont one other thing some of the operations that went wrong what do you mean operations that didnt work out this one didnt i want to see if theres a pattern somebody who crops up frank stared at him somebody here he said a trace of excitement in his voice the hunt that interested him suspecting everyone now except tommy leon kept leafing through the file hoping for a match but most of the initials stayed unclaimed tommys secret manyas had been a lucky exception mentioned because hed already done work for the unit before tommy arrived passports in several names leon memorized the address messages from bucharest sent by diplomatic cable part of the chain that got alexei to the coast for the handover to tommy leon traced the route in his mind just as alexei had said infinitely easier for the russians to snatch him on the coast if they had known which meant they hadnt and impossible once he was on army transport istanbul would be the last chance there was a brief bio in the file alexeis time with antonescu juggling the soviets after he was deposed finally running and hiding the first approaches to the americans the story leon already knew nothing about străuleşti either still not known or scrubbed from the file our butcher now number was the second shop down from the hamam near the kiliç ali pasa mosque in tophane the street was flat behind the shipping terminals and the shop was scarcely wide enough to fit a door and a display window the dusty framed photographs covered the usual rituals of family life soldiers stiff in new uniforms secular weddings solemn young circumcision boys in round hats and white satin cloaks in some of the older pictures the men still wore fezzes steamed and pressed for the camera already artifacts according to a small sign enver manyas offered a choice of backdropsa garden pavilion seraglio point bosphorus viewsbut most of his customers seemed to have opted for less expensive plain canvas a bell tinkled when leon opened the door bringing out a short roundshouldered man with wirerimmed glasses at first a look of surprise then a guarded dip of his head efendi merhaba manyas bey the man nodded still wary i have some work for you for mr king leon said in turkish manyas stared at him keeping his face composed noncommittal were alone leon said another nod waiting leon reached into his pocket pulling out alexeis passport mr king is dead manyas said yes ive taken his place he held out the papers are you interested same price manyas glanced at the passport he didnt use it change of plans romanian traveling through turkey you have a new picture same picture now a turk traveling to greece manyas looked up at him putting this together the man in the picture still here how long will it take you manyas examined the picture fingering the raised seal still a jew if that makes it easier for you its of no consequence to me its a matter of the spacing the length of the name a turkish jew barouh sayah he said offering names barouh leon said ordering up an identity first izidor nesim yusuf nesim i guess so nesim barouh going to greece same everything else he looked up same man same everything else leon said how long the seal has to be matched on the photo tomorrow there is some hurry half now half tomorrow leon said taking out his wallet and the other one manyas said watching him count out the bills leon looked up at him of course i understand now its not but the work was done youll pay me for the work two hundred liras outstanding if i hadnt done the work but as it is leon waited a moment manyas said going to the back room and returning with an envelope i thought you know when i heard theres no money now but its special paper for these an expense and the black marketits not possible for this one not now leon took the passport out of the envelope american you can see the engraving is excellentno difference leon opened it russell brooks born pennsylvania an engraved stamp over the man in the picture tommy leon stared at it trying to keep his face blank something tommy had ordered for himself he could feel the quiet in the shop suspended like dust two hundred he said to say something it was agreed no studio work so a saving duplicate prints if we hadnt been able to use the same picture the same picture as the others the other two the other two leon said slowly feeling his way different names yes of course different tommy had three passports leon said thinking out loud its useful no manyas said simply in his work leon looked back at the passport does he owe for them too no no that was last year just this one now if you wantas a favor no charge since hes deadi can change the picture the passport is good work a shame to waste ill let you know leon said putting it back in the envelope ill bring the two hundred tomorrow i dont have that much on me now that all right of course manyas said bowing his head his voice formally polite like a dealer in the bazaar and whom do i have the pleasure of serving now its still tommy its still his account he stood outside for a few minutes clearing his head why did anyone need another passport to be someone else to cross a border as someone else but tommy was going home as himself unless something went wrong at bebek prepare for the unexpected an ace up your sleeve if you had to get out fast as someone else but he hadnt picked it up yet so hed have had to use one of the old ones which meant they were still around somewhere more tommys not in his office desk at home then with barbara he wondered if she knew but no passports had been made for barbara if tommy had needed to bolt get out of turkey he was planning to do it alone leon took a taxi to his bank in taksim and drew out enough money to cover manyas and the trip to edirne then walked down tarlabaşi caddesi to a garage hed used before his car needed a tuneup if he brought it in did they have another he could use for a day or two who had cars to spare these days but somehow for a fee they could he thought of frank smug the land of baksheesh after all he walked back uphill to the consulate feeling the passport in his breast pocket why an american passport something conspicuous but what else could tommy be a bulgar in a fleece hat jianu could shift nationalities in a minute a chameleon tommy could never be anything else a hopeless defector if it came to that where would he go russell brooks at first a jarring second he thought it was alexei leaning over tommys secretarys deskthe same cropped gray hair and straight military back the jacket in fact a uniform how alexei must have dressed once voices pitched low private it was only when they heard him at the door and turned that leon could see his face fleshy almost without definition not like alexei at all except for the gray mr bauer dorothy said jumping a little flustered a closer look now navy jacket filling out at the waist too old for active duty but evidently not for making a pass dorothy was in her thirties with glasses and hair rolled up on top maybe glad of the attention my husband she said jack wheeler he said offering a hand didnt mean to just got in from ankara so thought id stop by leon nodded jacks naval attaché dorothy said explaining in ankara i know wheeler said a familiar question not too many ships but lots of admirals you have to be where the orders are cut but i get to go back and forth so we pass in the night once in a while he said head toward dorothy who looked away at this flustered again navy wives at least im not at sea and once they wrap things up here at commercial corphow longs your brief what everyone in the consulate wanted to know they didnt say one thing when the wars on you do your part but now theyll be bringing new girls over let the wives go home youll be in ankara before you know it yes dorothy said evenly wheeler smiled she says you might as well be in omaha but at least the streets are safe hell of a thing a man getting shot like that an american jack ill see you later dorothy said picking up a pad isnt she something all business well thats right i guess nice to meet you he said shaking hands again sooner you wrap things up here the better ill like it you take good care of my girl here jack well do our best hell of a thing right in the streets you knew him i guess wheeler said looking at leon just from around leon said everybody knew tommy wheeler waited expecting more then nodded well ill get out of your hair later he said a twofinger salute to dorothy i have the list you wanted she said to leon barely nodding at wheeler shooing him out with her eyes im not sure what you meant though by athens mr king never called athens his embassy contact there there was no embassy greece was occupied she said well not now of course he had no contact there someone for alexei once he was over the border i can get the general number if you need to talk to somebody is that it i thought thered be a liaison to this office using the same cover not that i know of we deal with turkey thats all he went to ankara sometimes izmir once to look at companies but not greece not as long as ive been here she paused her hands fluttering brushing back a stray hair can i ask why youre asking i mean im not sure i understand what youre doing here everyones nervous as a cat since thesince mr king died the police asking questions and mr bishop coming in and now she stopped and now me have a seat im not sure i know what im doing here either snooping i guess thats what frank wants anyway on mr king he was the victim but not of a robbery you know that so i need to know anything that might he looked at her i need your help you knew him better than anybody what makes you think that she said suddenly head flying up so unguarded that for a moment their eyes met and he knew both of them silent with surprise they looked at each other bargaining another piece of tommys secret life weekends somewhere here in the office tommy of all people leon imagined her without her glasses taking the pins out of her hair or did she regret it some moment of weakness that now threatened to blow up in her face shooing wheeler away working with him i mean leon said safe between us she looked away both jobs i dont know what you mean yes you do your husbands on the embassy staff hed have security clearance so youd be vetted too it was a natural fit i was an american wife with time on my hands and i can type eighty words a minute he held up his hand before she could say more dont i worked for him too or did you already know that they exchanged looks again then she crossed her arms over her chest a truce you seem to think heconfided in me it wasnt like that i did the work thats all we didnt talk about it never never she said meeting his glance setting a boundary but you wouldnt have to everything would go through you not everything he kept some things to himself a faint smile he was like that she looked up making a decision a direct stare what do you want to know we were bringing someone out you knew that she hesitated then nodded who else did i dont know no one but someone must have mr bishop took the operation file you could look there i did how about an appointment book a sly smile almost conspiratorial he never asked for that in my office turhans got my whole life there day by day ill get it she said standing up and a key for this by any chance he said pointing down to the locked drawer she nodded then turned to go taking off her glasses at the same time pleasant no more an ordinary woman with enough sense to know better then tommy had made her feel special the mysteries of other people she came back with the calendar and a pink telephone slip mrs king called she said with a straight face wants to set up a time to go over his things okay he never kept anything at home you know she said slightly disapproving said it was safer here leon took the appointment book we locked the files at night so the cleaning staff he was strict about that i know he liked a drink but he didnt talk not even to me not about the work what did he talk about leon said leafing through pages hour after hour all the scheduled appointments but not random meetings in the hall or a late drink at the park what do you mean the war politics he said easily an idle question politics she said tommy i dont even know whether he was democrat or republican it never came up you mean here in turkey well its just one party isnt it so theres not much to say i dont think he cared about any of that this office you couldnt you have to deal with all kinds mm he moved his finger over the page shaking his head look at this he knew everybody in the building well the commercial department you do she said smiling a little but that was him too what he was like the groom at every wedding what an expression she started to turn away suddenly at a loss dont forget to call mrs king she said then handed him a key for the drawer she waited while he opened it as i thought he said bringing up a bottle he must have pouched this one in you cant get it here since the war he brought it with him i never saw him drink it though too expensive he was careful about money his anyway expense accountthat was something else i brought that too by the way she indicated another folder mr bishop didnt ask for that either maybe youll find something there well ill get back to the phone she fingered the expense folder stalling you asked what we used to talk about the house sometimes the one they were going to have when they got home him and mrs king big with a powder room downstairs he said it gave a house class a powder room you didnt have to go upstairs thats what he used to talk about to me leon looked up caught by the break in her voice so i guess he was saving it up for that she said nodding at the bottle anyway what are these leon pulled some folders from the back of the drawer dorothy opened one so thats where he put them i wondered he didnt want them with the rest of the files why leon said rifling through crossrefs to the joint distribution committee war refugee board he said one day theyd be history but right now they werenot illegal exactly just classified he was proud of these you know people thought they knew what he was like she looked over at him but there was more to him than that the side he didnt let people see leon raised his head mr hirschmann from the war refugee board brought a boatload of children out tommy got the transit visas for the train otherwise they wouldnt have been allowed to go strictly speaking the ambassador wasnt supposed to ask for something like that so mr hirschmann got tommy to do it three hundred dollars each i never forgot that imagine selling children he helped them lease some turkish ships too thats how he knew about you your wife was working for one of the groups getting refugees out is she still doing that no but thats how he heard that you went to ankara she nodded again at the expense folder good luck with this she said looking straight at him her voice lower he wasnt always the most sensitive man in the world but he had this side too he didnt deserve to be killed leon waited feeling a burning in the tips of his ears not sure how to answer nobody does he said finally no thats right nobody does he suddenly imagined her entering a jury box next to barbara next to frank all of them looking at him taken in the lies got easier one leading to the next until you believed them yourself the way it must have been for tommy lying to all of them too a few minutes later frank came in looking pleased take a look gülün actually came through with something theyve traced the other gun what other gun tommy had two on him now why the hell he needed two never made any sense no leon said carefully seeing tommy plant them one in alexeis dead hand one in his and look it turns out its romanian the one he fired no that was turkish turkish he didnt have his own frank nodded but a turkish gun couldnt be traced back here no american connection if anything happened where did he get it gülün says its like buying a pack of cigarettes not this baby though frank said poking his finger at the police report not so easy to pick up a romanian gun he looked up unless you happened to be meeting a romanian so you think its jianus dont you maybe tommy frisks himhe should haveand oh look maybe well just hold onto this until too bad in a way meant jianu was unarmed when the russians got there they plug tommy and the guy hasnt got a chance leon listened to him fill in the scenario in his head detail by plausible detail so where does that get us not very far but not wondering about two guns anymore either so one less thing his eye caught the open folder on leons desk oh the kids he said he kept copies he wasnt supposed to you can read upside down quite a talent the letterhead hirschmann had his own he picked up a sheet glancing at it so now you know not that it matters anymore i guess now i know what what you were carrying frank said easily tommy always used you for the hirschmann deals these leon said why why not use the pouch he never explained distance the ambassador you send it by pouch its official logged in distributed this way steinhart could say he never knew what did you think you were carrying the allied invasion plan no leon said looking away oddly embarrassed remembering the train alert in his compartment feeling important he picked up a folder war refugee board he had to be distanced from that you have to remember what it was like last year the bulgarians the romanianshitler doesnt look like a winner anymore everybody wants some way to look good to the allies for after you know even eichmann approached us wanted to trade trucks for the budapest jews that didnt go anywheresending war matériel to the nazis he touched the folder reminiscing but hirschmann got a waiver from morgenthau in treasury otherwise hed be trading with the enemywhich is what it was technically youve got money changing hands so he could make deals he says he got fifteen thousand out maybe less he likes to exaggerate but were not supposed to know nothing in the pouch so tommy sends you no embassy connection and if anybody finds out well youve got a wife in the business itd be natural you being involved in this for her leon said trying to keep his voice neutral tommy using anna too and if the turks we would have protected you frank said what the hell you were doing it for humanitarian reasons whether i knew it or not he stared at the folders so thats all it ever was what i did no frank said looking at him not all but you were perfect for this what with your wife he thought of everything leon said brooding all this just to cover tommys ass well steinharts the embassy couldnt go near this why not the russians as usual the minute steinhart talks to anybody on the axis side the russians think were trying to make a separate peace before they get there which is probably what antonescu did want but all were asking is to let some kids out hirschmann the russians are suspicious because they always are thats what theyre like so the grunt work its better if its somebody they do know who wont make them nervous he opened his hand tommy they know what he does and its not negotiating peace they know him how when we first set up here there was some crazy idea wed exchange information you know ally to ally but that turned out to be a oneway street the way it usually does with them so there wasnt a hell of a lot that got exchanged but everybody kept pretending it did anyway tommy was our side so they knew him leons cheek jumped an involuntary tic he met with the russians on a regular basis at first then off and on just to wave the flag pretend were all working together hed give them stuff german minefield chart once for sulina harbor that was a big deal we got our hands on it and no use to us so lets help the russkies not that we ever got anything out of them tommy talked to the russians leon said flatly letting this sink in authorized no need to meet in secret on a park bench or at a ferry railing one eye looking back well during the war now nobody talks to anybody but it made him a good cover for hirschmann hirschmann knew a lot of people in washington fdr even the kind of guy puts the right word in somebodys ear and all of the sudden you get posted back stateside i suppose i shouldnt say i mean hes dead but you know how tommy always wanted washington so he probably thought hirschmann was his ticket back was too until the russians got in the way the other night theres a rumor around town theyre still looking for jianu leon said floating it something frank was bound to hear anyway theres a rumor about everything frank said dismissive smoke screen theyre good at that they have him i want the one they dont have who ratted tommy out hes here i can feel it frank glanced at his watch im late for the consul walk with me in the hall leon couldnt let it go these meetings he had with the russians they keep minutes what was said some proof minutes frank said smiling this stuff you had lunch maybe a drink at the pera by accident you didnt take minutes but hed tell you later what was said for what it was worth he thought it was mostly a waste of timewell we all did why tommy i mean he volunteer for this when i asked him frank looked at him im point desk for the soviets leon stopped for a second then caught up as they rounded the corner so jianuthis was your operation i was briefed frank said careful another distancing anyone else in ankara sometimes things get overheard there was nothing to hear all the details were up to tommy time dropoff its procedure safer for him the fewer people know no backup that would be for him to arrange but he didnt leon said turning this over so hed be the only one who knew but he wasnt was he frank said and youre not going to find him in there he gestured to the file in leons hand old war stories hes not in ankara either hes here he stopped katherine she was leaning against the desk dressed for going out high heels and a widebrimmed hat expecting sun not istanbul winter there you are she said and i thought i was late frank looked at her blankly for lunch she said prompting the one youre taking me to to tell you the truth you forgot and now youre busy she said sliding down off the desk her skirt hiked up for a second a flash of white slip leon looked at her a gray jacket open to a white silk blouse bright lipstick that made the reddish hair seem darker green eyes not a trick of the light and then youre back in ankara and ill never get out unless barbara takes me she shuddered for effect then looked at leon why dont you join us the two of you can talk and ill just sit there quiet as a mouse and nibble my cheese cant chained to my desk he gave a small tip of his head toward frank now cast as overseer besides theres lilys party i dont want to run out of things to say you wont not with katherine frank said unexpectedly playful these people giving the party theyre friends of yours we have to be lily runs istanbul the parties anyway everybodyll be there and no ambassadors kay said for a change i wont have to be representing my country youre always frank started about to be pompous then caught himself well shes dying to go he looked at her fondly youd think it was your first party all right lunch just let me see the consul first he looked at his watch again why dont we go next door to the pera i can do room service myself she pulled a paper out of her purse ginny gave me a list she turned to leon you must know all these places troika somewhere near frank said leon nodded just a few blocks russian youll enjoy it fine fine give me ten minutes frank said leaving kay leaned back against the desk the room suddenly quiet enough to hear the wall clock an awkward silence leon fingering the folder just standing when he looked back up her presence like a tug on his arm he found her staring at him again the way she had at the pera another moment still not talking and then she looked away breaking it russian she said thats funny here i mean white russian lots of them came in the twenties another thing i didnt know more layers when youre there take a look up at the balcony two ladies knitting another ones behind the cashier they switch around all blondes well used to be they come every day to keep an eye on the place its theirs they were dancers then friends of atatürks friends she said looking back at him mistresses he said bowing at the same time he met her eyes amused that i dont know but when he got tired of them he set them up with the restaurant so theyd have something or so the story goes is that what they do here i wonder if frank would give me a restaurant when he gets tired of me maybe he wont no she said then backed away well thats lucky she picked up her purse how dressy is the party what does lily usually wear something floaty floaty you know long andfloaty like a sari i dont know how else to describe it she always seems to be floating through her parties thats a help so not the jersey maybe ill get some roller skates and we can float around together leon smiled youll be fine in anything he said indicating the clothes she had on whatever you like only a man would say that say what frank said coming back that it doesnt matter what you wear she said suddenly jumpy as if shed been caught at something ready she took his arm it doesnt you always look nice she rolled her eyes thats because you never look she said teasing be careful with the chicken kiev leon said the butter squirts she raised her eyebrows not sure whether he was making a joke holding his glance for a second then led frank away leon watched her go not floating high heels clicking across the parquet floor legs long and sleek pitched forward by the heels dont ever wear skates she must have once a girl with freckles now it was high heels and soft blouses and a walk something in the air marooned in ankara where frank watched the russians leon looked down at the folder in his hand a lot of trouble to go through to distance the ambassador a tommy he hadnt known the best of him how do you weigh all the sides of someone what had the russians offered him money an idea but then there was also this something hed been proud of according to dorothy the same man whod tried to kill him at bebek he took the folder back to his office and started reading through what hed been carrying on the train history now still why keep them locked away the war was over or had tommy simply forgotten about them he read more hoping to find something but it was just what dorothy and frank had described the joint committee backdoor messengers desperate trades he looked at the drawer so why there why the bottle for that matter everyone knew tommy liked a drink hardly a secret he opened the drawer a few more files like the ones hed read he paged through more of the same he stared at the now empty drawer not the bottle not the files neither worth locking up but nothing else there he started closing the drawer maybe just another of tommys hardy boys games a man who used alphabet code he stopped who played at hiding things he pulled the drawer all the way out and tapped a few places on the bottom then stopped feeling silly false bottoms not even tommy he felt along the sides and lifted the drawer off its runners pulling it all the way out feeling behind then tipping it over the envelope was taped near the back away from the runners so that it would clear the bottom frame when the drawer was opened he pried one piece of tape away then yanked at the rest a consulate envelope not even sealed he took out two passports the same picture enver manyas had used in one tommy was donald price rhode island in the other kenneth riordan virginia turkish entry stamps no doubt manyas again but nothing else hed never left the country in the back of each passport was a narrow slip of paper more of tommys code not alphabet this time dz ak leon stared at them trying to work out a key but came up with nothing it seemed absurd all of it he was sitting at a desk with a drawer turned upside down staring at meaningless numbers but they must have meant something to tommy a man with passports who didnt travel kanlica i didnt think anybody was this rich anymore kay said looking past the bow of the boat ahead of them the jetty that fronted lilys yali had been lined with hurricane lamps and the jalousied shutters left open so that the whole house seemed to be shining with light the white neoclassical facade bathed in it throwing its mirror image back to the water lily had been lucky in the weather a mild evening more spring than winter but even so it was cold on the water and kay was hunched into a caracul coat too curious to sit inside the cabin the vassilakos shipyards leon said her husband was greek no no a turk a cypriot the original owner was greek lilys husband bought him out during the population exchange he kept the name but hes the one who really built the company what population exchange after the war with greece in twentythree ethnic greeks were sent home vice versa with turks there whether anybody wanted to go or not people whod been here forever it was a bad time you go to izmir places like that its still an open wound anyway it gave refik a chance to buy kay looked up about to ask more then turned back to the house too excited to be dragged into the past here comes the return trip she said as an empty launch approached and another my god how many boats has she got doing this lilys yali was on the asian side near kanlica where people went for yogurt and she had provided a small fleet of motorboats to ferry guests across this is how they used to do it leon said everybody went by boat see the yali next to hers with the big overhang the boats would just slip in underneath the way they do in venice not anymore i guess she said looking at the dark house half its timber fallen in what happened fire theyre all wood the old yalis heated by braziers one hot coal andwoof its a shame that one its as old as the köprülü a really classic yali theyre all going one by one arson sometimes to collect the insurance people cant afford to keep them up anymore except lily she said looking at the house again houseboys in white jackets were helping people out of boats lanterns flickering the rippling water flashing back she turned to leon her eyes catching the light thank you for bringing me he dipped his head in a mock bow pleasure no dancing you know mostly just gossip i hope you wont be bored ive never been less bored in my life she said almost laughing i keep thinking a pumpkins going to come and take me away he pretended to look at his watch not yet remind me to show you the garden before we leave its famous this time of year well you have to imagine it and suddenly he was seeing it that first bosphorus spring with anna everything in blossom judas trees and lilac and yellow laburnum cherry and softgreen chestnut trees pulling branches down to smell dizzy with it years ago when theyd been other people he glanced over at kay still gawking at the house as eager as anna had been that day bubbling over catching his eye while lily chattered away a joke between them no one else heard we talk about seasons he thought as if they repeated came back but they dont that spring was gone irretrievable a picture in an album faces smiling unaware of what would happen to them what kay said nothing he said shaking the mood off you know the sultans used to light their garden parties with turtles theyd put candles on their backs and let them wander around hundreds of them she looked at him the things you know he helped her out of the boat handing her up to a houseboy hand outstretched the cabin passengers lining up behind them he looked across the strait to rumeli hisari just up the road from where alexei had landed not deserted tonight busy with taxis dropping off people for lilys party while alexei sat smoking in laleli listening for sounds in the hall turning the chessboard aroundunless he was checking exits again how much longer before something happened get the papers from manyas and go youre right kay said looking through the open doors she does float lily was greeting people near the fountain that splashed softly in the center of the reception hall now talking to georg ritter and a burly man leon didnt recognize she was wearing a silk caftan with gold embroidery that billowed as she moved her hair swept up seemingly by the wind in a high bun held in place by two jeweled combs leon she said coming over as a boy took their coats how wonderful you brought her im so glad she said to kay taking her hand how pretty you look such a lovely dress she gave it an appraising look which leon followed the first time hed seen her without her coat a long offwhite dress with a deep vneck cinched at the waist by a silver cord a simple butterfly pin near her shoulder garnet he guessed like a piece of red that had dropped out of her hair thank you for having me your house she broke off suddenly awkward ive never seen a yali its not one of the old ones though you know just nineteenth century when everyone was in love with france she gestured toward the facade now the one next door the one that burned lily nodded poor selim now that was the real thing tulip period and now its gone he says hes going to restore it but they never do do they just build something new do you know dr ritter hes at the university an éminence grise grise blanche georg said pointing to his hair he took kays hand but delighted leon i was hoping youd be here now introductions were made georg bringing over the other man ivan melnikov he said to everybody mrs bishop leon bauer melnikov leon said involuntarily hearing alexeis voice yes you know me he said his voice direct too blunt for the frothy room someone who might bump into the furniture a broad weathered face pitted maybe scarred years ago by acne no the name seems familiar thats all its common the name mrs bishop the bishop at the embassy you see lily said everybody knows everybody in istanbul you know frank leon said curious we have met he turned to kay hes here no ankara im visiting istanbul for a few days a beautiful woman alone in istanbul he said shaking his head a stage gesture trying to be courtly no russian would allow it ive got a chaperone she nodded at leon him a chaperone georg said you dont think im safe with him kay said looser now safe yes in the right hands maybe not so much oo la lily said and who do you nominate you she turned to kay of course he knows everything about istanbul but no reputation is safe with that one a tease and a compliment to georg overweight and aging maybe i should offer myself to the highest bidder like the girl in oklahoma leon could tell from the blank expressions that no one had really caught the reference but lily smiled anyway then you must choose melnikov a true pasha he brought caviar imagine in istanbul where no one can get it for love or money a whole tin a sly glance at leon no one brought gifts to parties like this for a gracious hostess you must have some before they eat it all up lily said to kay and me georg said offering kay his arm lets have caviar always gallant when theres food lily said taking her other arm come ill protect you besides i want to show you off such a prize a new woman leon looked at the room as they left there were in fact only a few women most of them european in the old days they would have been in the other part of the house having sherbet and coffee watching the party through latticed grilles youre working with bishop now melnikov said not bothering with small talk news travels fast leon said off guard maybe thats where you heard my name maybe or from tommy king another friend of yours leon looked at him for a second everybody knows everybody in istanbul he said glancing toward lily an old comrade we met from time to time during the war ah leon said noncommittal those drinks at the pera more information exchanged than frank imagined to survive the war then this he shrugged now of course you want to find the man who did it well thats a police matter naturally we hope i want to find him too he said his voice low almost a growl georg has spoken to you about this leon looked at him carefully that was you offering the reward you worked for tommy a man for hire why not for me avenge your friends death perhaps you could use the money in these difficult times he paused the man belongs to us and why would i turn him over to you assuming we found him selfinterest the americans want him we want him more so were willing to pay are they what makes you think melnikov waved this off you can put your flag away a man like you leon felt a flash of heat on his face i dont know where he is he said keeping his voice even but you will now that youre inside its a bet to make anyway whoevers protecting him its not a stranger someone whos part of this business you dont know yet heres an incentive for you to find out enough money to take your wife back to america its a reasonable offer leon stared at him a hard face livedin knowing eyes buying someone go to hell he said melnikov said nothing for a minute then looked away so then take a message you know how to do that be a messenger what kind of message to whoever has him i dont know its important melnikov interrupted we are going to find our friend and kill him he looked directly at leon and his protector if he would give him to usa different situation but if not both are dead tell him that well kill both leon waited for a second trying not to react the chill of a death sentence like a hand on your shoulder the air still melnikov held his gaze emotionless how many had he already killed is that a paid message melnikov nodded if you like and not as expensive for us he raised his eyebrows at first i thought it might be you one of tommys men the question was why to bargain for jianu get a better price then bishop brings you in to help not a foolish man so not you now we only have to pay you for a message you wont have to pay for anything deliver it anyway melnikov said his voice thick to the one who helps you might save a life from you youd kill him anyway for the sport melnikovs eyes clouded as if hed been offended then darted over leons shoulder heres georg alone he must have lost the bidding georg champagne flute in hand was plodding toward them feet heavy older you enjoyed the caviar melnikov said georg put his fingers to his lips in a kiss then id better hurry before its gone melnikov said the guest eats his own present leon said im not so polite a simple soldier i was never taught these things lilys very grateful georg said evidently the point of the gift an interesting conversation melnikov said nodding to leon a leavetaking yes what about georg said melnikov ignored him beginning to move away then turning mr bauer if it is youtake the money he started to walk again and leon followed his back to georg how about an answer as a kind of down payment melnikov stopped and the question why did your romanian friend shoot tommy if tommy was there to yes melnikov said a movement to his lips almost a smile how the americans must want to know that dont you a speculation tommy found out what that his information is worthless something wasnt right so he became suspicious he had a mind like that tommy melnikov nodded a suspicious man of you maybe me certainly that was his job and now of jianu the minute jianu sees this tommys dead hes a fantasist jianu but good at protecting himself a fantasist of course thats exactly what youd want us to think but you wont youll believe him whatever he says a good thing for us in fact this has been discussed let the americans have himbelieve his lies but you want him back a question of discipline in the end more important a man who betrays he shook his head he dies he said flatly and he will still stalingrad melnikov peered at him not expecting this but decided not to respond so is that an answer he said walking away what was that about georg said apprehensive such talk what stalingrad leon turned to him he shot his own men the ones the nazis didnt get for defeatism disloyalty to the party an automatic response then avoiding leons eyes he was a hero in the war so was hitler to millions it depends where you sit christ georg you brought him to lilys she asked me to bring him someone like that georg shrugged she arranges meetings thats what her parties are so people can meet and who wants to meet him i dont know you give your old friend too much credit would they tell me he looked up a faint smile a peace offering please such things you know where i sit im a marxist he isnt hes a thug or cant you tell the difference anymore georg took a step back youre upset he said something do you know what he is you must running errands for him leon part of the dialectic is that it to accept contradictions yes he threatened to kill me im your friend how do you reconcile that one threatened you he also seems to think ill do anything if he waves a dollar bill in my face whered he get that idea you did you tell him he could buy me buy some information comes to you a piece of luck why shouldnt you profit from that my fucking fourleaf clover he looked over buy georg you made the same offer it must be what you think he asked me to not such a nice character as you say so i did for a second neither said anything a willed slowing down why do you still do it leon said finally people like that hes nothing georg said but the war i wanted to help he looked up didnt you help who that country in your head georgs face went slack its not russia the one up there leon said its not real maybe to me georg said quietly he is though and the people hes killed thats what it is there now georg stared at his drink not here he said a finger to his temple you dont know how it was how much we were going to do you know i knew rosa luxemburg the current of history thats what she said we had we could sweep away he stopped then they came the melnikovs maybe they were always there i knew after trotsky but the idea to keep that alive so was it right i dont know but its too late now to find another one he paused then finished his glass dont be offended its not personal you were the first friend we had in istanbul georg put his hand on leons arm and im the only one whos changed leon said nothing suddenly aware again of the voices around them the turkish musicians playing in one of the alcoves it was different before georg said everything was different now whats the same maybe anna only shes the same leon moved his arm the name like some physical intrusion separating them the noise of the party seemed to get louder you should take her home georg said his voice an echo of melnikovs the same bait what theyd agreed leon stared at him white hair and apple cheeks caught now too everyone different except anna where would i get the money he said still staring until georg looked away embarrassed he walked across the big room to the garden entrance a lowrailed seating area with divans and an arched ceiling glowing with motherofpearl two men smoking a water pipe looked up waiting until he passed before they started talking again the garden was colder than he expected he lit a cigarette looking back at the bright busy house people passing in and out of the dining room standing with meze plates servants with trays of glasses flutes of champagne fruit juices for the observant one of lilys parties where you could arrange an import license or plant a story in hürriyet or hint at an arrangement outside official channels theyd had a special excitement during the war germans across the room drinking the same wine british officers just in from alexandria romanians who seemed to belong nowhere buying and selling he wondered who wanted to meet melnikov say something over a champagne glass that couldnt be said in an office but melnikov had disappeared swallowed up in the crowd the old parties had seemed more frivolous flashbulb occasions for the newspapers but maybe theyd always been the same little marketplaces people bargaining leon too naïve to notice both of them naïve relieved to be out of germany the flowers and soft bosphorus night part of a larger happiness inside a skirt rushed by one of the dining room windows and he saw annas dress the one shed bought for that first party how do i look pleased with herself buoyant thinking the dress was a success when it was really the shiny skin just being young everyone is so nice shed said dont you think they like a new face they were standing by an umbrella pine the air heavy with fresh resin and you not so new to you no he said putting his hand up to her cheek just brushing it she leaned into his hand a cats movement oh its wrong to be so happy no it isnt think of my parents theyll get out buying dresses going to parties champagne who gets to do these things now you do he said stroking her cheek isnt it terrible im so happy she looked up at him i dont want anything to change and it will what things everything changes she looked up a smile maybe not you so stubborn so thats lucky yes she said her voice throaty a german inflection something she would always have like a fingerprint she looked back toward the party how does she know so many people her husbands rich that makes you a lot of friends no they like her you can tell everyone charming then in their new eyes the room dancing with light maybe they simply hadnt been aware of it the quiet introductions the plotting any of it just the sound of dresses swishing voices spilling out lapping at the garden its really true she was in the harem to meet someone like that you could be in a harem he said his face closer already wanting to go home those days when they couldnt get enough of each other oh a dancing girl with those pants you can see through me a hausfrau she looked at him eyes shining frau bauer what if you had never come to germany youd have found someone else no id have waited yes she nodded id have waited for an instant the memory was so real that he felt her breath on his face he dropped the cigarette before all the luck had run out but maybe it hadnt not all of it isnt that what georg called it a piece of luck meaning something else turn the board around tommy was gone and no one knew one word an address to melnikov and alexei would disappear and no one would know that either money in the bank a fresh start for a man not worth saving a fresh start for anna maybe a chance for her to come back and leon still lucky in the clear while frank turned the consulate inside out every trail getting colder none of them leading to leon he moved the men around the board in his head looking for the flaw a straight play no piece lurking on the side except melnikov who would know and use that to put leon in check another georg his man now cheap at the price a penny for your thoughts he turned to the house his vision hazy out of focus all right a turkish lira kay said she was leaning against the doorjamb watching him elbow tucked in holding a cigarette its smoke curling up past her face two liras he smiled back now not worth it how long have you been there where do you go when you go off like that i was just thinking about lilys parties the way they used to be they were different she said walking over to him not really i guess they just seemed different everyone was younger she said a gentle tease he dipped his head that and the way they spent buckets of caviar then you could have fooled me kay said glancing back at the party i had no idea she was down to her last nickel i mean my god a fountain in the middle of the living room sofa he said then seeing her expression the main hall he nodded to a seating area i guess thats where we got the word usually thered be a brazier in the middle for heat fountain out in the garden whoever built this was showing off the layouts traditional though youd be received in the sofa he gestured with his hand a tour guide and mostly you stayed there but if you were a favored guest youd go there into the selamlik the mens quarters and the women the other side he said pointing where the dining room is now see the alcoves around the main room thats where you sat no furniture not like this anyway all the chairs its a hodgepodge now like istanbul it cant decide what it wants to be kay stared at the house i used to feel that sometimes didnt you she looked at him no i guess not not you men i used to hate it when i was little what do you want to be when you grow up what did you say oh nurse mostly you had to say something or they wouldnt leave you alone but what did you want what did i want she said to be married i guess i wanted to be safe so you got what you wanted he said a question yes she looked up at him and what did you want to be i dont know what do kids want something exciting he looked over not safe well and safe at the same time yes she drew on the cigarette her eyes still on him some conversation she was having with herself you enjoying the party dont let lily wear you out she shook her head i feel like its someone else not me everybody making a fuss somebody new meaning it wont last i dont care i have to go back anyway put away my new dress not that you noticed just like frank i wear a dress like this and you dont even notice i noticed he said looking at the open neckline she turned her head away and dropped her cigarette i didnt mean like that she hesitated maybe i did she said looking back at him anyway youre not frank are you no no she repeated still looking i can say things to you i dont know why and then i cant she said her voice running out what before i was standing there and all i could think she stopped then took a breath and put her hand on his sleeve do something for me her eyes green again in the light from the house darting across his face he looked at her waiting aware of her hand the warmth of her then felt her reach up pulling his face down to hers her mouth just brushed his a soft pressing testing then opened to him a sudden urgency as if he were going to be taken away he put his hand behind to draw her closer surprised at his own response alive to her feeling her down the length of his body when he started to move away she held his face to hers again lips still open their mouths wet now excited they pulled away at the same time out of breath staring not just a kiss in the garden neither of them talking leon hard he moved first reaching for his handkerchief and slowly wiping the lipstick from his mouth his eyes still on hers some line crossed no need to do it again neck like kids she reached over taking the handkerchief daubing a spot at the corner of his mouth intimate the way people were with each other after sex the noise of the party inside seemed farther away the air in the garden still broken only by night sounds rustlings he put away his handkerchief glancing through the french windows a few people passing talking to one another dr obstbaum standing looking straight at them leon felt the blood pulse through him a rush of shame then obstbaum turned away even more embarrassed as if he could tell more than a kiss and now none of them safe what is it somebody i know did he see i think so well she said lightly wanting it to pass looking at him again my wifes doctor oh she said physically backing away some spill spreading toward them im sorry leon said i mean in public to embarrass you like that he doesnt know me he knows you she said anyway she came closer it was my idea still still she said looking at him eyes brown now only flecks of green wed better go in he said in a minute just stay for a minute letting the air settle around them holding on look he started ive never been unfaithful to frank she said her voice flat so that he wasnt sure what she meant how to respond there you are lilys voice from the steps dont hide everyone wants to meet you everyone has kay said smiling a quicksilver moment leon a beat behind lily came out toward them a tryst in the garden she said teasing really leon like a play my fault kay said i wanted a cigarette you know how people area woman smoking mm look at them lily said turning her head to the party stealing husbands the silver too yes youd be surprised but smoke and theyre offended she turned back to leon am i interrupting something would that stop you he said smiling but still shaken do something for me of course not if i am then its a reputation at stake she said having fun watching them not yet kay said easily just a cigarette what happened to your russian leon said moving somewhere else bringer of caviar yes i know dreadful but important now not very distingué though are they the new ones remember the germans of course terrible people but the consul was charming four languages not like the japanese you remember leon two of them never a word not one bowing only then like birds picking at the food making little sounds kay laughed and how were the americans oh serious theyre always serious always leon said half listening always they want to save the world you have to be serious for that the russians are serious leon said what do they want to do or didnt melnikov say lily shot him a look everybody knows what they want to do she said then turned to kay light again you see even leon serious i had such hopes kay nodded smiling but not as bad as they are in ankara not yet she said to leon he glanced back something different in her voice private could anyone else hear it no lily was saying so why now at the consulate she poked his shoulder gently what does it mean just filling in yes they say youre a detective now who says on dit lily said brushing this a way and have you found him yet the killer no no suspects your new guest is everybodys favorite he said motioning toward the dining room at the consulate anyway but how could it be he wasnt even in istanbul that night how do you know oh people say things they think i dont hear you know at yildizyou learned to listen every sound a long time ago but its a lesson you dont forget what else are they saying lily waved her hand gossip thats why i ask you but you dont tell me so come before people talk i dont care for myself refik cant hear anymore but mrs bishop refik was your husband kay said yes and jealous too ouf i think it amused him some men are like that they think every man is every man probably was leon said but was i interested in them never of course he knew that maybe he thought it flattered me to be jealous you were in love with him kay said what a question lily said suddenly tentative surprised at this certainly but loveits not always so reliable you know it changes but with us there was also a debt i owed him everything my life how could there be anyone else he rescued me literally oh a long story not for a party leon you must know this how refik found me after the harem only that he did tell me kay said do you mind leon glanced at her eager wanting to know a kiss he hadnt expected he looked over her shoulder unsettled in the same garden but not the same just a few pines the other trees pollarded cut back for the winter the laburnum and chestnuts only in his head in the past mind lily was saying delighted to have an audience well everybody wants to know about the harem what was it like something romantic but it wasnt like that the house in yildiz nothing to do games with the other girls what did we learn how to act how to dress and what good was that when it was over people dont ask that what happened after nobody thought after they sent abdul hamid to salonica there we were and no one knew what to do with us hundreds of girls some children so they took us to topkapi it was the first time id ever been there so damp at least yildiz had been warm and then they sent messengers to all the villages where wed been borncome and get your daughters take them home and some did farmers and their daughters are dressed likewell you can imagine the kind of clothes you wore for the sultan beautiful and now theyre going back to the farm useless for work some didnt want to go what would happen make yogurt be married off to some ox so theyd cry but of course they had to go the fathers would sell their jewelry and thats the last theyd see of istanbul now the fields if they were still virgin maybe a marriage in the town somebody who liked good manners if not not any marriage that could be arranged the jewelry would make a bride price and that was the end of the harem for them she stopped catching herself i dont know maybe some of the girls were happy to see their families again there must have been some yes but i didnt see it just the crying in carts sometimes they drove away in carts in istanbul behind veils of course but you could tell they were crying and these you know were the lucky ones someone came for them the rest of us wed think why doesnt my family come maybe they moved from the village maybe they never heard the messengers maybe this maybe that but what you thought was they dont want me and now what we couldnt stay at topkapi forever the government didnt want to keep us the expense what happens to a girl in istanbul who knowswhat how to make herself attractive galata one of those houses what else if you were a virgin they could sell your first night money to them after that you were just in the house one of thewell you know what that was thats what i thought would happen to me theyd lock me up in one of those houses until they could sell my first night and then the rest who knows what its really like just things you hear maybe its worse and then i was rescued she looked up at kay not refik not yet the first rescue was nevber one of the girls her parents had died but they had friends who came for her to adopt her and she said please would they take me too i dont think they wanted to one daughter was all they could afford but nevber said they should take me as a servant i could do housework whatever they liked a servant but i wouldnt be put out in the streets and you know they were all right a lot of work but a place to live this was in izmir jews so i always felt a debt to that she said to leon thats why i helped anna when she needed money for the boats and when nevber married and left the house they kept me not a daughter not a servant something in between but there wasnt money to arrange a marriage so what future and then refik some business and he comes to the house and he sees me a cypriot what happens between people do we know i dont no kay said it just happens leon looked at her mouth slightly open deep in the story do something for me reaching up to him so it happens for him lily said why i dont know and a few days later hes back and then back again and they tell me he wants to marry me no bride price no family never mind not some arrangement a girl in a roomthey would never have agreed to that marriage so my first night was with my husband not some house in galata she moved her hand toward kay love not then but the debt began and everything that happened after she extended her arm to the yali the life we had you know in the harem you want to be gözde one whos noticed abdul hamid never did i was too young but refik did i was gözde to him i sometimes think what would have happened if theyd kept the harem become a kadive to abdul hamid an old crazy man maybe now id even be valide she shook her head but never have this life never see paris anywhere so it was lucky for me refik better than the sultan gözde kay said trying to pronounce it still in the story yes in the eye and it was true i was so later when there were other women id think well theyrewomen but im the one in his eye you didnt mind if kay began yes at first its terrible you think its the end of the world but you know the world doesnt end it just becomes something else i remember when the ottomans finally leftthe last ones the household children grandchildreni went to sirkeci to see it i knew some of them from the old days so i was curious they put them on the orient expressone wayand this woman at the station maybe a servant tears and wailing its the end of the world and this is twentyfour when kemal pasha is making a new turkey so whose end well listen to me who talks like this old women she put her hand on leons upper arm patting it dont make trouble with my russian you know everyone comes to my house when did he die your husband kay said before the war a few months after kemal people said it broke his heart they were so close kemal atatürk leon said another lion lily said without irony now come have something to eat hacer has been cooking all day ah theres ivan leon followed her glance through the doors to melnikov head bent in conversation with colonel altan hes found a friend leon said maybe hes a better mixer than we think oush lily said a behaveyourself sound and now georg always when hes not wanted she moved toward the doors intercepting him before he could reach melnikov and led him to the dining room gliding a sequence of perfect dance steps why so melnikov and altan could talk the meeting shed arranged melnikov seemed to be doing most of the talking altan simply taking him in barely nodding his eye now over melnikovs shoulder catching leons just a flicker then back everyone noted what a story kay said did you ever meet him the husband yes leon said still trying to watch melnikov and was she his gözde mm what she didnt say is that she was fourteen when she caught his eye so you wonder what he was seeing fourteen leon nodded it takes some of the romance out of it doesnt it but lily made it last and now look the rumor was that she caught atatürks eye too and kay said intrigued i doubt it refik lent the treasury a lot of money in the early days and they really were friends and he had his russian dancers leon smiled and then some of course lily loves to keep the rumor going part of her myth its all made up no no its true refik was crazy about her and a few others no only her the others didnt matter do you think thats possible an affair that doesnt matter i dont know she looked up ready to joke then met his eye i think it would have to somehow she said her voice steady unless both of them agreed that it wouldnt just be something thathappened something you could walk away from after no harm to anybody he waited a minute you dont mean that why not the good wife she said wryly arent you yes she said looking away so what am i doing why you i dont even know that how do people do this give a room number she shook her head i am a good wife so say goodnight kay and thank you for the party she stopped but i thought that what would it be like with me she lowered her head god look at your face i know im embarrassing you bored wife away from home lilys right in the garden like a play no moon though at least give me that i havent gone completely corny he took her elbow leaning closer stop aware of her again even a simple touch just pretend i had too much to drink all right and tomorrow ill be myself again not say things like that she looked up i never did before for what thats worth to anyone a silence both of them just looking night sounds behind glasses tinkling so she said moving her arm wed better go inside before you say anything make it worse theres that man who was talking to frank yesterday she said spotting altan hes always around talking just to fill up space then stopping turning back to leon a small smile it wasnt all me though was it maybe we both wondered a little mrs bishop altan said leaving the terrace step murat altan we met at the funeral again the thin moustache until he stepped into the light yes i remember kay said mr bauer altan said nodding i was just taking mrs bishop in it got chilly all of a sudden the bosphorus is like that altan said which meant what did anything show in his face kay a little breathless but that could be the cold youll excuse me altan was saying to her a quick word with mr bauer i was just getting a wrap she said sounding relieved to get away mr bishop has gone back to ankara altan said to leon watching her go inside a courtesy to escort her frank asked me to ah altan said his eyes moving with some private amusement but his face blank part of your new job no job just helping out until they send a replacement it makes one wonder altan said what assignments they thought had prepared you for this i think the biggest qualification was not having any frank wanted someone new outside the consulate put the cat with the pigeons well an idea assuming he can rely on you he glanced again toward kays back frank tells me were working together emniyet i mean we cooperate with everybody but yes a special case this one the elusive mr jianu so my new colleague what do you think officially or personally theyre not the same personally i think hes dead you do i doubt that that hes dead altan nodded and that you think so why not dead by whose hand his own jianu not i think the suicide type the russians they would be the first to tell the world a great feather in their caps a spit in your eyeis that exact and they are looking for him is that what melnikov said is that why you wanted to talk to him well he talked i listened not a subtle man would he pretend to look if they had him he shook his head he would gloat and the americans making demands in ankara extra men at the ports at the border such expense but of course we have to do it so not dead extra men he said trying to keep his voice steady you insist altan said a waiters nod but you cant cover the whole coast you think he would leave in a rowboat its possible i suppose depending on who is helping him helping he cant speak turkish even jianu would need help here any idea who leon said carefully feeling the familiar twitching at the back of his neck altan gave a listless shrug he came to turkey during the war perhaps someone he met then he came here istanbul not here ankara once edirne twice altan said familiar with the records government business or so his papers said only a day each time a courier perhaps he said glancing up at leon so maybe a friend from the old days we are checking the romanians here a long job more men but he cant go back to romania no so where then if he went east it would have to be by train easy to check the drive is too long to risk he would be seen and baghdad for jianu not so attractive i think i would say greece he made trips to edirne the first stop coming from romania but also from greece so maybe some greek business those trips old colleagues and in greece he might be useful the greeks are fighting their own communists he might have information he could sell to themnow that hes not selling it to you its true as you say we cant control the whole coast so many places but where would the boat be going one of the islands then piraeus most likely then its my old friend spiros problem he shook his head pretending to be amused a man who works for the germans and now for the greekshe must have something on everybody who better to find him works for the greeks how state security i thought it best to alert them if jianu tries to cross the borderby road trainwe have him but if he somehow manages it the little boat then spiro personally i hope he does let the greeks have him as altan spoke leon saw the border guards checking cars at edirne thered be photographs now the emniyet forced to supply them pressured by the embassy conductors ticket offices a net flung over turkey greeks waiting on the other side watching the docks at piraeus passenger lists from rhodes chios even assuming that could be arranged he hadnt imagined anything beyond a few hours drive sleepy edirne guards glancing at enver manyass new papers and waving them through his chest tightened theres something wrong altan was saying peering at him just thinking but the greeks would hand him back altan sighed no doubt the police here want him for murder why would the greeks protect him so back but then neither of you get him we do melnikov wouldnt like that neither would your mr bishop and whos in the middle he looked at leon much better you know if one of you do find him the police theyd put him on trial and that is a trial no one will want to have consider the testimony what it might be but if we found him we couldnt get him out now past your blocks altan nodded you would have to consider an alternative solution he said smoothly polite conversation only his eyes hard making the point leon stared back we dont do things that way altan raised an eyebrow but said nothing melnikov would though leon said if he finds him your problems are over but he wont find him why not he has no idea what to do a simple man it makes no sense to him so he looks to emniyet to do it thats why the chat hes disappointed impossible for a man to disappear we must be working for the americans and so on he said idly waving his hand its always a question of blame with them its the way they think no human factor leon looked at him waiting you dont find its usually the case altan said theres a logic and then someone upsets it why a personal motive why did jianu run why does someone help to sell him old comrades a loyalty something else so you look for that melnikov doesnt things are this way if not a correction is needed someone at fault you talk to him you see his character a great believer in the rational he shrugged but look how they live they kill their own peoplethat makes sense to them better to bend a little his lips turned up the ottoman way so weve promised to do our best this what you wanted to tell me not tell just to talk get to know your character not so easy as melnikov he took a card from his breast pocket and to give you this you can reach me at this number if you need to meet not at the consulate melnikov would hearso quick to take offense somewhere neutral a hotel a social gathering like this why would we need to meet like that mr bauer we are working together if you do find him you will need our help to kill him to get him out i thought that was the alternative you preferred so a cooperation of course if melnikov gets him or spiro then my hands are tied you will keep me informed your progress i thought you already knew everything that happens at the consulate not everything altan smiled you have a suspicious nature maybe mr bishop was right in his choice he nodded use your home telephone please we may not be the only ones with ears at your consulate leon stood for a few minutes looking down at the card the noise of the party rising and falling at his back a direct line to the emniyet something that would have seemed surreal a few days ago he thought of the meeting he and anna had had with the gestapo before she had been allowed to leave the usual summons to prinzalbrechtstrasse just a formality all the exit papers in order but his throat catching the whole time feeling the sweat under his armpits now suddenly on that side of the desk part of atatürks secret army working together you will keep me informed he put the card back in his pocket staring at the night garden the main axis outlined with flickering candle lanterns but the other paths dark you had to squint to see them he replayed the conversation to see how altan had steered it but it began to overlap with melnikovs we will find him but he wont find him frank somewhere in the background too all of them flailing like the people in the water when the bratianu sank all reaching for him he could see the hands outstretched strong enough to pull him under protect yourself listen to what mattered the border was being watched and the greeks were waiting not edirne a new plan leon its too rude hiding out here youre supposed to be meeting people lily standing behind him holding two glasses champagne the color of her hair they seem to be finding me he said seeing altan talking by the fountain yes lily said following his look whats he like halit brought him old friends apparently i dont know how friendly leon said taking the glass she held out to him a big improvement on your russian anyway so everyone says i think one time only for him its enough well have to find another russian some chargé daffaires who doesnt frighten people so my old friend she said shifting her voice lower and taking a sip what are you going to do now a question that seemed part of the conversation in his head i dont know he said to the air you dont know he looked out at the lanterns extra men at the border no he said then turned realizing she meant something else her eye to the dining room shes talking to özmen from hürriyet you know what that means she says one thing and he prints another and your consuls in a rage why did you say that i was misquoted its always the same the society column the consul wont even notice thats where youre wrong lily said holding up a finger the front page maybe not but everyone reads özmen i guess leon said drinking all right no dont go a minute i never see you anyway the damage is done and maybe shes more careful than you think ooh la with özmen so tell me she said lowering her voice again what dont you know i was thinking beforethe first time i came here spring remember a long time ago not so long long enough i dont even look the same well it doesnt matter for a man they lookhow they look for women its something else she reached up grazing her fingers over his temple some gray but the same i remember so curious both of you so many questions with georg he said you had good manners for an american leon smiled a compliment from him lily said only the germans had manners and music kultur i think he still believes that even after everything anyway men dont get old she said moving on so its not that some other trouble i know you a little when you think im not looking i see youre worried this new work maybe what do you mean worried reading his face like a map inquiet the way people look when theyre late running out of time leon said hours to the border now closed he caught himself and made a forced grin there better all the time in the world she smiled indulgent playing along then looked at him and how much is that if we knew the hindus think we come back as something else a bug if youre bad you can also go up the scale well up down what does it matter all nonsense no one comes back she pointed up no garden in the sky either this one thats all there is is that what you learned in the harem he said teasing no from refik she said serious who knows how much time better to use it no he said nothing waiting to see where she was going you know what else they believe the hindus seti the husband dies the wife throws herself on his cremation fire a lot to ask dont you think to follow the other one who would ask such a thing not refik any of us she looked at him so why are you out here are you waiting for her permission to keep living leon stood silent feeling heat rise in his face you know i thought once it could be me were easy together and you look a woman always knows when a man does that but its this one i think theres something there she touched his arm were alike this way when refik was alive there was only him no one else but life goes on leon met her look annas not dead he said she lowered her head a retreat well as you like she patted his arm dont be angry i didnt mean i know come at least get her away from özmen but neither of them moved not quite finished its a kind of seti lily said what youre doing you know that he looked at her a moment then another moment so quiet that the sound of the crash inside seemed like an explosion glass breaking splintering voices stopping then starting again all at once like birds rushing to a tree oh god the new boy i told mustafa he wasnt ready and try to find good crystal now she held up her skirt to walk faster leon following voices louder clustered around one of the serving tables in the dining room servants ran back and forth to the kitchen and leon thought of birds again the whole room fluttering let me through let me through dr obstbaum shouldered his way into the crowd the turkish musicians oddly kept playing an undertone to all the voices until one of the servants rushed over to stop them he was just standing here and all of the sudden he grabbed the table that fast and hes down careful of the glass georg lily cried seeing him now he was on the ground the edge of a tablecloth still clutched in one hand obstbaum leaning over sweeping away shards of glass so he could kneel next to him frantically opening his tie georgs face a bloodless white the forehead shiny with sweat call an ambulance obstbaum said give him some air he swung his arm in an arc as a signal for people to step back leaning closer to check georgs breathing what is it leon said kneeling with him ignoring the glass heart an ambulance obstbaum said again to the crowd two people raced off presumably to phone but now georg was moving shaking his head a little nein nein he said barely audible spittle in the corner of his mouth then a rush of german not here on the asian side a german doctor yes yes a german doctor obstbaum said in german georg had now opened his eyes halfway his face still contorted with pain leon he said grabbing his hand and squeezing a german doctor ssh be quiet everythings going to be all right but how could it be he turned to obstbaum can we get him to the clinic would he survive the boat im not a fortune teller obstbaum said impatient feeling the pulse in georgs neck if he has another attack bebek georg said squeezing again leon turned lily would you get a boat ready she nodded leaving so that kay suddenly came into view her arms folded across her chest as if shed caught cold her eyes fixed on him will he be all right leon said to obstbaum i dont know the breathing is better he should be in the hospital here there what does it matter i can go with him if he needs to hear german foolishness no bebek georg said can i help colonel altan said squatting next to them leon shook his head when the ambulance gets here well use the stretcher to get him in the boat can you make the water calm obstbaum said to altan a boat its a risk he needs to lie quietly its his risk leon said feeling georg squeeze his hand again a thankyou altan took out a handkerchief and handed it to obstbaum for georgs forehead shall i call the clinic for you to have them prepare yes thank you obstbaum said then turned to leon i take no responsibility for this he should go to the hospital here a few minutes can make a difference georg leon said please the boat ill be all right he tried a weak smile sea air leon looked at the face under the chalky skin the one hed always known mischievous hunched over his chess set their first friend in istanbul what would happen to the dog he heard his own voice earlier baiting hectoring he took the handkerchief from obstbaum and wiped georgs forehead drier now and smiled you always get your way he said ha has this happened before obstbaum said georg nodded what medications ask kosterman in şişli do you know him leon said to obstbaum yes ill call keep him quiet yes no dramatics were not out of the woods with this the boats here lily said coming up to them you want to telephone oh your knee she glanced down at a bloodstain from the broken glass obstbaum waved this off when the stretcher comesgently understand he said to leon then glanced over at kay theres nothing to do now he said in general a kind of dismissal two houseboys came over to sweep the glass so the crowd backed away drifting across the room talking again kay stood still fixed on leon whats happened melnikov gruff even the sound of his voice disruptive something with the heart lily said intervening oh the ambulance please we have to move georg had heard the voice and now clutched leons hand tighter drawing him down closer to his face you think im not a friend to you he said almost a whisper ssh never mind about that the ambulance is here no you have to know in case georg pulled him closer i am your friend i know i never told him melnikov told him what sürmeli the landlord in laleli he thanked me for referring you he thought i sent you to him georg later the stretchers here no now in case thats how you knew him remember he owned the office building in beyazit so when you took the flat i never told melnikov but i knew why would you take a flat a woman sürmeli thinks not you a woman in a flat so i knew but i never said your friend you understand he opened his eyes wider i never said leon looked at him then nodded we have to get him on the stretcher one of the attendants said in turkish georg you ready leon said so its safe georg said still somewhere else i never said okay here we go just hold on to me they lifted him one smooth fluid movement and covered him with a blanket placing an oxygen tube in his nose the rest of the guests stood watching as the attendants moved out to the landing georg still grasping leons hand kay following obstbaum was waiting in the boat wheres lily here take his hand leon said to kay slipping gently out of georgs grip ill be right back hold on to her he said to georg and behave yourself georg smiled faintly obstbaum looked up uncomfortable kays presence some awkward test of loyalty leon hurried back into the house the party was now breaking up people milling around the fountain a houseboy pointed him to the telephone room a small study in what had been the selamlik the door was already open and he pushed it wider altan was hanging up the phone turning to lily both voices low leon froze not just talking intimate their faces close a couple whats he like she had said leon remembered her eyes at the pera palas brushing past him now talking just to each other the way people did in bed leon stepped back how long he waited another minute then knocked lily yes yes coming she said at the door in seconds were off oh taking in altan these phones lily said but finally the clinic theyll meet you on the other side her voice easy leading them out of the room as smooth as the attendants lifting georg how is he the same you dont mind i come with you altan said as they walked theres room yes but now ill tell halit lily said so he wont look for you a pleasure madame nadir thank you for the evening he said politely as if his face had never been close to hers im sorry that yes such a terrible thing leon youll call let me know how he is they were at the landing now being helped in the boat rocking in the wake of some larger ship so that everything even her voice seemed to be shifting unsteady he turned to her a woman who arranged things how much did altan tell her faces close whispering his old friend her hair golden in the lamplight before he could answer the boat pulled out onto the dark water keep the tube in obstbaum was saying to georg you need the oxygen on the bosphorus georg said but closed his eyes obeying the air in fact was sharp and fresh the freighters wake had passed and the water was calmer their headlight slicing across the surface the opposite shore twinkling my father had an attack like this kay said her hand still in georgs hes getting his color back see leon georg said motioning him closer again dont talk you have to stay quiet i didnt say he whispered his eyes closed i didnt say anything to melnikov but he would his mind filled with it now brimming maybe not intending to but letting it slip out what does he mean kay said nothing ssh patting georgs hand to quiet him not here not anywhere what if he talked in his sleep unaware sedatives loosening the last restraint you are old friends altan said old like a son georg said his voice faint eyes moist i didnt say ssh leon said brushing the hair off his forehead soothing a child feeling kay watching him kosterman says its the second time obstbaum said taking georgs pulse again so its dangerous my father survived two kay said but not the third obstbaum said blunt dismissing her presence and the landlord didnt talk only to georg a whole neighborhood of friends eager for news the sort of gossip altans men were bound to pick up the ferengi renting a flat for his woman whom nobody had seen imagine the expense a flat not a hotel someone who couldnt be seen he could almost hear the voices a sibilant buzzing sürmeli smoking a water pipe the center of interest if georg had heard it would be just a matter of time before someone else did whether georg talked or not running out of time he looked at kay holding georgs hand wisps of hair blowing across her face in the breeze a nurses calm obstbaum deliberately not looking at either of them how could he bring her to the clinic anna down the hall georg was mumbling something again too indistinct to be heard above the running engine good they sent the ambulance obstbaum said seeing it on the quay ahead move alexei the sooner the better not a hotel somewhere private he thought of the house he and anna had rented one month on büyükada pine forests and empty coves no one else in sight afternoons just walking and looking at the sea of marmara an easy exiletrotsky had stayed therebut also a trap no fast way off the island if someone found out better to hide in plain sight even the cihangir flat the last place theyd expect unless someone was already watching it he glanced over at altan his new colleague expecting a report be careful obstbaum said waiting for the driver to tie up before they lifted the stretcher you think ill break georg said then gave an involuntary moan as the stretcher jerked the last heave up to the quay they loaded him into the back of the ambulance obstbaum opened the black bag an assistant had brought and took out a syringe filling it from an ampoule whats that georg said kosterman prescribed it this will pinch but itll feel better the pain just keep calm well need to monitor you at the clinic your rhythms still irregular but kosterman on his way hell meet us there he looked up at leon standing at the door you coming kay started toward him but leon turned stopping her no dont wait it could be all night ill just make sure his doctor gets here colonel altan will you see that she gets home the pera but kay started to protest really youd just be sitting in the waiting room down the hall theres no point im sorry the evening had to nobodys fault she said vaguely trying not to look wounded ill call tomorrow he said let you know how he is she looked at him eyes still puzzled not the best timing was it things just happen sometimes she nodded and sometimes they dont now please obstbaum said from inside the van leon climbed up closing the door behind him he looked back through the oval window as the ambulance pulled away kay in her party dress with altan boats bobbing behind them and for a second he wanted to open the door and jump out then georg moaned and when he looked again she had got smaller too far away at the clinic georg was put on a gurney and wheeled into one of the medical rooms where nurses attached electrodes to his chest from a bulky machine next to the bed if it gets worse well have to move him to a hospital obstbaum said were not equipped here he looked at his wristwatch so wheres kosterman şişlis fifteen minutes he glanced up maybe youd better wait outside the less talking the better we need to keep him quiet annas room was dark just the dim nightlight near the door and a thin strip of hall light underneath she was asleep when he came in so he tiptoed to the chair eyes still closed usually she was aware of movement and he wondered whether theyd given her a sleeping pill more rest after a day spent not quite awake outside the door the hushed sounds of the clinic at night he sat for a few minutes watching the faint movement of her breathing did she dream melancholia from the greek black bile what they used to think it was a gloom spreading through the body addling the mind something you could drain away georgs here he said the voice in his head imagining her listening a heart attack serious we were at lilys at the yali you know what i thought about the first time we went there her garden party i could hear you worried about your parents you said it was wrong to be so happy those words and i said no and theni couldnt remember any more what we said it just faded your voice it keeps getting harder to remember even your facei see it and then it fades too the way it looked then i mean he touched his hair not just a little gray lilys flattery older someone else no one stayed the same but what happened when everything just stopped the air still memory suspended in it getting fainter in the garden earlier hed felt he could hear his own pulse his senses so alive they seemed to be outside his skin touching listening now he barely heard the voice in his head a steady murmur that seemed as far away as that first party what it must be like to be dead when you couldnt even hear yourself then suddenly a louder voice came in over it not really talking to anna anymore to anyone just pouring out you were the only idea i ever had to be with you the way we were at the yali thats all i wanted to be like that not change but it did i still dont know why the child then the war everything sometimes i blame youand then its worse but lilys right were both dying this way and i dont want to i see a woman near tünel and it doesnt mean anything how can something like that not mean anything like the lab frogs in school you could make their muscles twitch with electricity even after they were dead its like that a jolt but you dont feel anything then tonight i did i think so anyway he shrugged to himself the voice taking a breath so what did i do i sent her away so i could come here sit with you that was right wasnt it the right thing but i cant even remember your voicea few minutes and then it goes im not sure anymore what im holding on to the voice stopped the sudden quiet a vacuum in his head he looked over at the bed anna lay still not moving as if she were holding her breath waiting im sorry listen to me one kiss and now all this like a kid he paused but its true its getting harder to remember outside there were footsteps in the hall a nurse hurrying past kosterman had probably arrived why sit here brooding check on georg and leave move alexei where georg wouldnt be going home to nişantaşi just one night but thered be neighbors taking care of the doggeorg never left her alone mihai had a cousin in kuzguncuk on the asian side a street with old wooden houses and plane trees as quiet as an anatolian village and just as smalleveryone would know in an hour much safer in an impersonal flat a cheap hotel no questions there were more steps outside nurses shoes a hospital sound how many times had he sat with anna listening to rubber soles and swishing skirts the sound echoed back to the other hospital anna lying with her hair spread out on the white pillow not crying her face drained facing it we can have another hed said not knowing what else to say dont give it a name shed said her eyes far away for the first time something he thought now he should have noticed but didnt if you name it we wont be able to forget as if it had existed had personality a place in ones heart all the things that can happen in the first seconds of life the hospital listed it as baby or infant he forgot which the form tucked away in some box of papers where anna wouldnt see it you couldnt lose a child whod never existed but shed known the sex her boy and here he was years later still in the room with them all it took was the sound of nurses shoes youd better come obstbaum said at the door hes had another attack not waiting for leon starting back talking over his shoulder kostermans working on him but hes not responding in the room a grayhaired man was pushing down on georgs chest kneading it nurses around him glancing nervously at a monitor nichts he said but kept pumping somehow angry as if georg were being stubborn another minute then a quick knowing look from the nurse and finally his hands stopped he moved them away slowly and shook his head hes gone obstbaum said needlessly leon looked down at georgs face already different empty for a moment the room seemed motionless stunned by the gravity of death then nurses began to remove the electrodes wheel a cart away cover the body kosterman looked at his watch noting the time already preparing the certificate in his mind leon kept staring something you never got used to no matter how many times youd seen it the stillness of a dead body not georg anymore irretrievable in a second not coming back not in any life whatever the hindus imagined there was nothing you could have done kosterman said to obstbaum in german like a bomb he opened his fingers mimicking an explosion i told him have you finished a nurse said to leon holding the sheet waiting leon nodded theres no family obstbaum said to the doctor he turned to leon did he ever say anything to you what he wanted leon shook his head the dog the neighbors must have her someone should make sure and call lily he said making a list things to do a way of not thinking about it shell want to know she can have someone tell the papers an obituaryhe knew a lot of people ill call vogel at the university he can arrange a memorial service later and then there seemed nothing more to say georg disposed of gone he wondered suddenly how easy his own death would bea notice to the reynolds office an insurance claim for anna mihai settling the apartment maybe a piece in hürriyet american businessman nothing about the trains to ankara or tommy or alexei would anna know he was gone a paragraph would do it two aides came to wheel the gurney away and leon felt people moving around him busy why wasnt everyone standing still letting it sink in but they hadnt known him hadnt just lost something it was georg whod explained about the storks that sunday when they went out to see the byzantine walls a picnic in the shade looking up at them perched on their high rickety nests they migrate south over arabia so the muslims believe they make the pilgrimage to mecca every year was it true did it matter anna delighted smiling sandwiches in waxed paper beer the wheeling stopped the aides looking at him in the way he thanked obstbaum and started back to annas room then stopped his feet suddenly lead not another vigil talking to himself about georg regretting their last conversation sneering at his marxist heaven then on the landing still your friend maybe his own form of warningthe landlord was talking it wasnt safe anymore but where would be hotels with sleepy night clerks checking the tezkere alexei didnt have what would be open the muslim world went home at night whole sections of the city blacked out in a medieval dark streetlights like the old torches only the greeks and armenians and foreigners went out drinking in noisy mihanyes but eventually they closed too even the taksim casino went dark forcing the streetwalkers to lurk by the latenight kebab stalls and the dim lights of the taxi ranks he stopped a simple answer the obvious overlooked it wasnt too much to ask and if it was there was always cihangir but not laleli anymore georgs warning like an omen now what is it alexei said when he opened the door dressed the way he always was maybe the way he slept ready to get out in a hurry im moving you somethings no a precaution its time good alexei said putting out a cigarette and folding up the chess set somewhere better i hope the pera palas leon looked up a joke alexei said one minute my razor thats all he said heading toward the bathroom i met your buddy melnikov tonight leon said alexei stopped be careful with that one a friend of berias meaning he does what he likes kill first he can afford to make mistakes is that why were moving no its time thats all hes still trying to buy you back how much am i worth now alexei said coming in with a dopp kit have i gone up i didnt ask that everything alexei put on his jacket and woolen sailors cap you go first he said suddenly in charge the street that goes to the big mosque ill use the back give me five minutes if anything seems wrong come back here you forgot something but youll be out there alexei shrugged how far is the car were walking alexei looked at him then took out a gun and put it in his jacket pocket the lights he said nodding to the switch outside leon headed past the high walls of the university grounds he could hear his footsteps no one else around two men in jellabas and skullcaps lost in their own conversation he slowed giving alexei time forcing himself not to look back you could see the great dome from here a weak milky light in the square facing the mosque the night so clear at lilys had turned misty the cobblestones slick alexei would have left by now slipping through the streets some route hed worked out when he should have been inside and then he was there a shadow suddenly turned solid walking with him the mosque getting closer filling the end of the street some voices in the square leon felt the hand on his sleeve alexei looking back over his shoulder then jerking them off the street wedging them into an arched doorway on the narrow side street backs flat against the wood he took the gun from his pocket and held it waiting leon slowed his breath no voices a soft indistinct sound behind maybe footsteps if you were listening for them he glanced over at alexei his face was rigid the wool cap covering his short receding hair so that the head seemed almost skeletal like a death mask as still as georg had been and just for a second leon saw him the same way already dead even if he got him out once he said whatever he had to say thered only be some half existence listening for sounds assuming he got there now he was breathing again fear pumping life back and leon could feel his shoulder move and realized they were breathing together the same adrenaline rushing through them real footsteps now then a shadow moving down the street backlit by the streetlamps it stopped at the side street as if it were listening too then started again a shuffling sound not trying to be quiet the shadow weaving slightly maybe a drunk but someone whod been behind them they waited alexeis gun close to his chest following the footsteps down to the square until they were out of hearing another minute nobody coming back up the hill to find where hed lost them then another to make sure and alexei nudged leon toward the street they walked quickly making up time still not talking but leon felt shaken the mask still in his mind contours of bone the shape of a head lifeless süleymans mosque and its outbuildings bulked up ahead but all the details were lost in the dark the old medrese the cylinder burial türbes the leafy courtyardleons dream of istanbul where he used to come just to sit listening to the hum of the prayers inside now all in shadow someones hiding place the way alexei saw things how he had begun to see them too he led them past sinans tomb and down the steep streets of broken cobbles littered with clumps of garbage on galata bridge a few fishermen were still tending rods where are we going alexei said you wanted the pera not far from there the lighted cars of the funicular would be a risk but alexei was already winded and climbing the hill seemed worse leon looked at him on the platform a man in a wool cap with a duffel some sailor docked in karaköy out for a good time no one followed them on top marina opened the door in the silk kimono leon thought she wore only for him its you she said a question are you alone its late she said another question noticing alexei i need a favor a bed for a friend just the bed she looked past him who is he hes trouble for me just a customer who wants to spend the night you have customers like that dont you she stared at him ill give you the going rate what a bastard you are i didnt mean it that way no you have no idea who he is he paid for the night thats all you can show the money if anybody asks who police leon shook his head anybody but nobody will one night he paused a favor she looked at him then opened the door dont stand in the hall alexei dumped the duffel bag inside looking around the room then at marina much better he said whats he done marina said lighting a cigarette nothing hes a customer thats all you know he looked down at the kimono her breasts half showing and you what have you done nothing i wasnt even here if anyone asks she finished thats the favor she snorted then turned to alexei there she said pointing to the bedroom door i appreciate this leon said he took out his wallet how much ill let you know she said waving the cigarette then heres fifty on account he held out the bills fifty she said raising her eyebrows and its not police in case you need to show that he paid you think id do this for fifty she said slipping the bills in her kimono pocket then how much no this she opened her hand to the room the risk everything he met her look thank you alexei was standing in the bedroom doorway smoking his eyes half shut fixed on her he took off his cap running his fingers through his flattened hair marina put out her cigarette then shrugged does he speak turkish no german a little english all right anything special what does he like her voice wearily matter of fact taunting him just the room im not asking you to do that no she said raising her eyes to him other things the hall light operated on a timed switch but he ignored it feeling his way instead toward the dim landing in the dark the usual wet plaster smell seemed even stronger feline he waited at the outside door for a few seconds to see if anyone was in the street then turned left down the hill for a block and circled back up no footsteps behind in tünel square the tram had been turned around and was waiting for the conductor to start a few passengers slumped in their seats the whole square seemed motionless in fact opaque in the misty air and for a moment leon imagined them all dead too the conductors hand frozen on the controls every face like georgs and alexeis immobile he felt his chest squeeze and forced himself to breathe out a kind of protest what would happen to him someday when tommy surprised in a second georg clutching the table alexei jolting himself alert with fear but already gone leon started for the tram what you thought about when you were exhausted but in the doorway he and alexei had been the same get on the tram and go back to cihangir watch the ferries the room as quiet as the clinic lilys garden seeing ghosts talking to them receding then real eyes darting across his face do something for me shed said then brought his head down the conductor rang the bell waiting for his straggler leon grabbed the pole about to swing up then stopped remembering the doorway again alexeis mask he stepped away waving the tram off even the sleepy passengers now awake watching him a scene something noticed five minutes ago hed been slinking around buildings now he walked through the lighted part of the square and into sofyali sok still busy with latenight restaurants down to meşturiyet not looking behind loud steps nothing to hide at the pera he went straight to the elevator an american in a good suit somebody who might be staying there the elevator boy in a pillbox hat and white gloves took him up without a question a birdcage lift parisian grillwork and red plush he walked down the hall not hesitating a soft tap then a louder one yes he heard from inside a rustling sound maybe belting a wrapper she opened the door eyes widening her hair was down brushed out and she had taken off her makeup her face still a little shiny from the cold cream but flushing now real color you came she said surprised then clutched the lapels of her bathrobe i didnt think you would come her voice slightly out of breath is that all right she was still holding the door and he felt as if he might pitch forward the momentum that had carried him from the square suddenly stalled my hair she said touching it nervously a gesture so beside the point that he smiled your hair she caught his eye but didnt smile back i dont know what to say say come in he paused unless you dont no she said shaking her head and opening the door wider he stepped into the room a small lamp by the bed the lights of the golden horn through the window beyond i was reading she said just to say something closing the door and backing against it as if he had pinned her there ive never done this before he kissed her leaning his body into hers warm no he said kissing her again hands on her now feeling her body move against him no she said breaking away for air so why he started but she had reached up pulling him down again her mouth on his and his head filled with the taste of her new not like anybody else i dont know she said the words in a gasp near his ear he leaned down and kissed her neck smelling the last trace of perfume just something when we met i thought what he said still kissing her maybe its my last chance for what he said raising his head caught by the words i dont know she stared at him for another second then reached over and slid his jacket off his shoulders ask me later then they didnt say anything kissing in a rush their breathing louder ragged undoing his tie buttons still backed against the door as if they were hiding in a closet stealing the minutes he slid off her robe the shoulder straps of her nightgown letting it fall from her breasts then cupping them bending down to kiss them not fleshy like marinas just filling his hand but nipples hard already all of her taut one touch and you felt the skin move under your fingers a string vibrating little gasps of air over your head she pulled the nightgown the rest of the way down crumpling the silk at her feet and he reached behind hands on her cheeks pulling her toward him kissing her mouth again pulling the soft skin even closer as if he could pull it inside of him she moved a hand down between them clutching at his prick still in his pants stroking the length of it until they both broke off out of breath and he threw off his shirt starting on his belt then kissing her again backing her toward the bed mouth still on hers hands on her behind and then laying her down snapping off the light shoes socks stepping out of his pants standing next to the bed looking down at her naked just the light from the window her skin seemed to be rippling not still legs opening to the patch of hair the lips beneath already wet to the touch he moved a finger over it excited by the wet some involuntary yielding and then she reached up grabbing him and pulling him to her and he thought he might come then her eagerness more erotic than anything marina had ever done he moved onto the bed his prick still in her hand drawing him into her not waiting wanting to hurry too moving her hand away so he could put the rest in all at once the skin inside slick with sex one sliding motion then the warm softness closing around him he stopped dropping to his elbows and kissing her not wanting to move inside just feel her holding him but her skin had begun to ripple again moving against him and he started moving too finding her rhythm then moving with her only the movement familiar the feeling something new sex with her not anyone else she let out a sound the most private thing there is something nobody else ever heard and he put his head near hers wanting to hear more the sounds urging him on making everything go faster so that he could feel the sweat now the heat of it and hear himself panting his prick swelling with sensation almost apart from him when she cried out he could feel her clenching then going loose the string snapped then more sounds in his ears the wonderful abandon not caring who heard still moving with him as if each thrust set off another release then another until finally he could feel it racing up in him faster then spurting out an explosion of pleasure helpless leaving every part of him exposed he lay motionless for a second and then he felt his weight on her the sweat and the world started seeping back he rolled off onto his side his heart still racing then slowing down waiting for the deflation that always came embarrassed back in himself but she had turned to him running her hand along his face and it wasnt marina something else thank you she said so quietly that he thought he might have imagined it no you he said moving his hand now calming each other like animals i didnt mean to be so fast she smiled he leaned forward and kissed her hand at the back of her head next time well go slow she touched him below how much time do you need keep doing that shifting slightly so that she could take all of him in her hand hard again then looking into her eyes where did you come from he said running his hand down her back wanting to touch her everywhere as if he could read her skin know her with his fingers she made a little gasp responding to his hand a shivering as it crept lower then fell back letting him kiss her everywhere her nipples then moving below everything slower this time unhurried his mouth moving so slowly that she shuddered when he reached her sex teasing and kissing it until she was open to his mouth moving against his tongue and he went deeper tasting the inside of her smearing until she made a sound a muffled cry and reached down with her hands to stop his head no in me she said her voice shaking and pulled him toward her then in and this time even that was slower a rocking so that when they came both panting it wasnt an explosion but an overflowing afterward she lay with her head on his chest both of them drowsy a chance for what he said hm you said ask me later she was quiet for a minute to have something different i guess why me i liked you the way you look your chin she said putting a finger on it thats it and youre here she said leaving his chest sitting up not ankara no complications running into each other things like that she got up and went over to the table and picked up a cigarette the match like a small flashbulb lighting up her naked body its funny isnt it how people talk after no clothes no secrets i think i know everything about you and i dont really leon said nothing reaching for a cigarette of his own why didnt you want me to stay with you at the clinic there was nothing you could do there he washe died another attack you didnt need to be there for that died she said dismayed im sorry you were fond of him yes i could tell the way you were with him so thats one thing i know about you she looked at him one layer she walked over to the window altan said it was because your wifes there she exhaled some smoke whats wrong with her she waited a minute then turned you dont want to talk about her he looked at her bare skin nothing covered the way people talked after he drew on his cigarette hearing the silence in the room she went mad something hed never said out loud before admitted mad not away oh she said so what will you do do theres nothing to do wait see if she gets better he leaned over and stubbed out his cigarette so thats her what else did altan have to say he didnt tell me thatwhat was wrong just that she was there well now you know so youll never leave her she said her voice neutral that makes it easier for me what i told you no complications she was quiet for a minute you dont have to worry about that about anything she came over to the bed sitting next to him so what did altan talk about leon said talk about frank hes very interested in frank as if i would know anything so it must be true what he does secret work he never says and now a man like altan asks so what else could it be and you is that what he does with you secret work im just filling in for tommy at commercial corp and thats an answer she said raising an eyebrow never mind i dont care she reached up brushing the side of his head but no secrets here all right i mean in this room i dont care what you do at the consulate but not here frank never says anything we dont talk like this its different she stopped her hand dropping it do you want to know about us no i was a secretary not his when i was growing up we never had any money anything extra and i thought i wont have to worry about that ill be safe and and i am safe she looked at him and im here he touched her arm i should leave soon you dont want to stay someone might see my reputation she said amused well i never had to think about that before now you do like a farce the maid comes in andoops she covered herself with the sheet not so funny when it happens he moved his hand to her shoulder then ran it down to her breast youre an embassy wife not here not in istanbul she arched her back to the hand stroking her no he said leaning his face close to hers no complications here she lowered her head there is though one i didnt expect what he said kissing her ear i said we could justwalk away but i dont want to she said her voice naked now too i thought i could but i dont want to she turned to him do you he looked at her a feeling of pitching forward dizzy then righting himself surefooted no üsküdar enver manyas needed another day an unexpected delay but now leon did too hed been awake half the night at the pera making a new plan kay sleeping next to him one hand on his chest the reflected lights on the ceiling like plotting points on a map of turkey edirne the most likely crossing would have extra border checks now too risky even with good papers a boat from izmir would go where the greek police expected it to go trains were easy to check the orient express like traveling in a spotlight the overnight to ankara the wrong direction where she would be a complication he felt her breathing next to him something hed almost forgotten the peace afterward one more day his eyes moved over the map on the ceiling in the morning they were lazy with each other sex a hotel luxury like breakfast in bed then the moment of farce hed predicted the maid at the door leon hiding in the bathroom with his clothes later please when do you go back he said in bed again tomorrow night so we have today he said the plan already decided most of the pieces worked out in his mind dont you have to work yes he kissed her shoulder but i have to eat too take me to your favorite place he shook his head too far its up the bosphorus second favorite then dont look at mei mean like that in the light its different at night mm harder to see its like milk he said stroking her belly tell me something about you im a good driver he said his head still filled with cars how to arrange one on the asian side no something about you he leaned over her ask me later after manyas he went through the checklist hed made during the night an appearance at reynolds to tell turhan he might have to go to ankara for a few days the same story to dorothy not sure yet but dont be surprised some file requests to look busy tommys payment reqs errands to run can you keep him another night he asked marina i have my armenian its his other day put him off ill pay you its all right he paid me she nodded toward the bedroom leon looked up at her maybe it means something to him pay his own way marina he said suddenly awkward when was the last time he had a woman i dont know he hesitated not sure how to ask anything wrong she shrugged hes hungry thats all a half smile the prisoner and his last meal hes not a prisoner yet what did he tell you nothing he doesnt have to say a word theres a smell when you run whats going on alexei said coming out of the bedroom dressed neat and shaved nothing rumpled theres a hitch one more day some trouble no we just need a day he turned to marina all right but tomorrow its finished i dont care leon nodded how much for the armenian she made a brushing motion with her hand itll be all right theres a room upstairs he doesnt take long whats wrong with you she said to alexei catching his expression nothing he said turning back to the bedroom where do you think you are marina said to alexeis back her voice flat a kind of apology she watched him go into the bedroom they all want to think its something else she said even with the money in their hands they think its something else mihai was yelling into the phone in what leon took to be hebrew getting nowhere an eruption of words then silence finally a grunt what he said to leon hanging up i thought you werent coming here anymore i wasnt followed the expert i need something two

üsküdar that maybe has a car not family nobody in fact no registration if you get stopped its your problem understood leon nodded whats the second thing a contact in antalya mihai took a minute

life you can trust me with a car oh your life when did i become such a person that youd do that when leon said not worth answering he waited its just a car mihai looked at him for a minute then began writing something on a piece of paper dont play that card too often he said writing it loses value you do that not if its life or death his life leon said nothing you know üsküdar halk caddesi the first big intersection up from the ferry where the road splits on the right after the post office the garage is in the first block if you reach the mosque you overshot it give them this in antalya the old port the café across from the boat basin the big one ask for selim ill make the call he handed him the paper dont ask again for him if he dies he waved his hand they looked at each other for a second not saying anything take extra gas in the mountains not so many pumps mules if you get to the mountains agh he made a whatstheuse sound and walked over to the window how long will they have to

what tell them to go back to europe to that hell you dont own it nobody sells ships since the war and who has that kind of money so you lease not so cheap either fiftyfive thousand poundspalestinian not turkish sterling then pay the bribe tell your people its an emergency everything in palestine is an emergency he moved away from the window well he looked up the cars an old horch dont stop in the villages everyone will want to look they had lunch at a fish restaurant underneath galata bridge kay facing the old city the postcard view of slender minarets and domes behind a kite tail of circling birds it was too cold to eat outside but they had got a window table and leon twisted in his seat to point out landmarks the new mosque then süleymans farther up the hill they were drinking coffee lingering hoping the sun would come out the water in the golden horn steel gray what else he said well this she said indicating the bridge low on the water how do boats get in and out they swing it open at night four am something like that when theres no traffic all the boats pass through then for a second he imagined mihais ship limping in from constancia before dawn some tender guiding it to a dock to rot and wait not even a minaret visible in the dark people whod been in the camps slop buckets what else tell me about you that again first you what was your name before bishop ohara scarlett she shook her head bronx irish not even lacecurtain my mother was a maid but my father was a cop so theres a step up they thought until the war the first one he was killed a week after he landed i think it broke her heart anyway she had to go back to work stairs all day she said she never wanted to see another stair in her life but she made sure i didnt so i owe her for that she paid for the school secretarial school well it was that or the nuns i didnt see myself as a nun he looked at her no i meant the calling he smiled ah stop she said but pleased looking out again toward the water tell me something the truth did it matter it was me could it have been any it wasnt what kind of question is that she reached over touching his fingers barely meeting them on the tablecloth i mean you can say i would have anyway i didnt expect she stopped looking past him suddenly alert her mouth open a shadow moved over the table mr burke she said snatching her hand back trying not to be noticed like someone caught biting her nails i thought it might be you ed said disconcerted too glancing at the hand leon he nodded at him showing mrs bishop the sights the cooks tour franks idea leon said but all of them awkward now ed looking from one to the other you late lunch galip ed said absently his mind back a minute ago exports once a month i dont know why he made a show of checking his watch id better be getting back though he looked at leon i hear youve been requesting files he said nervous unable to hold back leon raised his eyes i was just curious you know if anythings come up someone at the consulate you know what people say im auditing payment reqs outside payments outside then you think ed i dont think anything im just going through the books honestly well ed said backing off literally taking a step itd be nice to know before barbara leaves shes leaving next week they got her a priority rating for a flight she doesnt sleep he turned to kay well you can imagine she says the sooner the better were giving a party at the club if you can make it im sorry im going back tomorrow leon ill try i may be in ankara ankara ed said kay looked over not saying anything just for a few days oh ed said wanting to ask more well he said another minute waiting ill see you back at the shop then a leavetaking nod mrs bishop kay kay he said awkward again a glance down at her hand the coffee cups as if the tablecloth were a rumpled sheet well that was fun she said taking out a cigarette after hed gone her hand shaking a little christ what am i doing its just ed he lit it for her were having lunch thats all and thats what he thinks nobody cares what ed thinks what was that about ankara i cant see you there why not i cant thats all everybodyd know in five minutes you cant keep coming here no so how did you think i didnt if i were thinking i wouldnt be here christ she drew on the cigarette when did you decide to go to ankara last night im not i just want ed to think i am why its none of his business or mine she looked away where are you going somewhere else she was about to speak then looked down when she said a different question tomorrow so we have today what would you like to see haghia sophia the grand bazaar somewhere where we wont run into anyone im not good at this she looked again at the water i promised myself i wouldnt think about what happens next and now its all i can think about leon reached for her hand ill come to ankara she moved it back skittish and meet where the ankara palas with everybody and his uncle in the bar she made a wry face its funny its just what my mother said would happen when i moved out the next thing youll be meeting some man in a hotel room that was her idea of the worst thing that could happen to me and here i am here you are she looked at him then smiled and we have the day you pick somewhere you like i dont care who sees they went up to the eminönü piers and caught the ferry for üsküdar standing outside her hair flying back in the breeze at the landing men in cloth caps drinking tea looked up at her foreign women a rarer sight on this side there were more headscarves even veils overcoats almost touching the ground noisy motorbikes weaving around idling buses the air heavy with diesel a taxi took them out of the square past the food market and up the long hill where are we going the çinili camii the tiled mosque youll like it can women go in mm just cover your head a woman built it one of the great validesshe was mother to two sultans the gate to the courtyard was open but the mosque itself was closed so leon went to the teahouse next door to find the caretaker a small mosque with a small adjacent medrese the courtyard simple just an ablutions fountain and a shade tree that seemed older than the buildings kay walked around the courtyard the only sounds her own heels when leon finally came back he brought the imam a bearded man in a long white robe carrying a heavy key ring grumbling at being disturbed he frowned seeing kay then peered at her closely and smiled turning to leon with a stream of turkish whats he saying your hair is the color of the red in the mihrab tiles hes never seen it in hair before he says im lucky to have a wife like an iznik tile kay laughed thats a compliment right from him they were the most beautiful tiles ever made nobody knows how to duplicate the colors now leave your shoes out here the imam was fumbling with the key its freezing theres a carpet almost the entire floor in fact was covered with intricately designed carpets but the eye scarcely took them in drawn instead to the walls covered in turquoise and blue tiles not one color but a series of shades like a musical exercise in blue in the mihrab there were lines of green and the rust of kays hair but everything else was blue and white even the corners of the ceiling tiled its like being inside a jewel kay said staring shivering a little the room cold despite the carpets its the size partly in the big mosques all you see is how big they are here you really see the tiles kay stepped forward its allowed the imam bowed extending his hand dont worry i told him id like to make a donation you can go up to the gallery too its okay twisting narrow stairs then a railed balcony barely wide enough to hold a single line but the whole room visible now vines and flowers and abstracted patterns repeating themselves flowing into each other blue into blue she smiled at the room then at him downstairs the imam stood in a corner pleased as if someone had praised his children afterward they sat on a wall under the courtyard tree in a small patch of winter sunlight its beautiful she said and no one ever comes here thats what you wanted wasnt it you do though once in a while when the weathers nice just to sit alone i mean you dont bring anna not anymore she looked away toward the fountain so what do you think about when you sit here nothing thats the whole idea the patterns on the tiles youre supposed to get lost in them let your mind drift not think you i thought there was always something going on in there he smiled not when im here she was quiet for a while scanning the courtyard the imam appeared again on his way back to the teahouse dipping his head to them as he passed but it can never be yours she said he turned to her i mean you probably know more about it than he does she said a nod toward the imam who built it where everything comes from all that but its not yours what difference does that oh i know its wonderful she waved her hand to the mosque but what about the rest when do i take off my shoes cover my head the looks people give you its not a real life here i mean it is for them but werejust visiting she paused i am anyway give it some time it takes a while what to live here but now that the wars over you could go home he said looking around i can take care of her here the clinic i dont know if i could do that there so i live here it is home sorry i didnt mean i know you just want to know more about me see if im the guy in the hotel the one your mother warned you about she looked up her eyes meeting his you are she said you must be when you said that i wanted to be there he felt the blood flow to his groin as if she had touched him there i should be ashamed shouldnt i for thinking that yes he said pulling her to her feet they caught the ferry back to eminönü and wandered through the spice market like tourists looking at the tall cones of ground spices and piles of dates at a nougat stall he thought he saw sürmeli the landlord tunic stretched tight across his back so broad he blocked the aisle who gossiped to georg maybe to everyone but then the man turned eating candied pistachios just another fat man and leon realized hed been staring and looked away they went out the side exit past the bird market cages noisy with song and fluttering look at the wicker ones kay said so elaborate ill bet they hate them anyway we had a parakeet when i was a kid wed let it out and it would come right back it didnt she started looking at him then cocked her head smiling what you as a boy im trying to picture it it was a while ago do you want to go up to the grand bazaar you cant come to istanbul and not lets go back to the hotel she put her hand on his neck and his skin jumped the talk irrelevant the day no longer lazy stretching out ahead of them suddenly running out of time we could stay in she said get room service on franks bill the pera palas waiters winking at each other over her shoulder the fat man was coming out of the market i have a better idea he said they took the tram up the hill and out to laleli not circling back from the stop as he usually did but heading straight for the flat his arm around her shoulders so fat sürmeli could see them watching at his usual window drinking apple tea his suspicions finally confirmed leon with a woman the reason hed taken the flat but there was no movement as they passed his building no curtain twitching maybe out collecting rents they were luckier at the flat itself two men carrying books came down the hall as leon put the key in alexeis door nods and muttered greetings curious a foreigner and a woman something theyd remember not alexei quiet as a mouse what is this place she said inside is this where you bring your women it belongs to a friend he asked me to keep an eye on it while hes away lies now to her but harmless they thought it was she said nodding her head back to the hall did you see the way they looked at me never mind somebody really lives here she said looking around the almost empty room not even the duffel bag to suggest a presence anymore just the lingering smell of tobacco had anyone heard alexei coughing its more a piedàterre for when hes at the university the story growing he touched her arm its not like a hotel is it she said mischievous surprised at herself somebody elses sheets she looked at the bed is there a woman who comes to change them i mean what would your friend think i dont know he said pulling her to him lets do it on top afterward adding more smoke to the stale air they watched the light turn gray at the window now what she said leaning over to stub out her cigarette then noticed his face i dont mean it that way i promised i wouldnt say that she looked away i meant really now what we cant stay here now we get dressed he said but pulling her down to him her face resting against his chest and you go back to the hotel after all the sightseeing and tell the clerk how much you like istanbul then have dinner in the dining room so theyll all notice alone bring a book and after i come and spend the night and then what i dont know he said quietly she got up and went over to the chair picking up her blouse and what if i meet somebody i know in the dining room good more witnesses for my alibi she looked over at him who thinks of these things bring a book do you see so many women like this no you could youd be good at it the stories this place she looked around so convenient to have a friend away hes never come in handy before stop asking you mean so maybe thats a story too he got up from the bed holding her by the shoulders ive never brought a woman here she looked away then started stepping into her skirt what book for my dinner how about a guide to istanbul read about what youve seen she nodded every detail and what will you be doing working so people wont think im out chasing somebodys wife you didnt have to chase very hard she said pulling at the side zipper then smoothing out the skirt anyway its so important what people think it is for you she looked at him half amused i never thought before how useful it would be secret work for this knowing how to hide make stories someone in that work itd be easy for him leon picked up his pants beginning to dress why dont you stay longer i cant besides youre going away on a trip you dont talk about so maybe its better this way what we always said just walk away oh god she said suddenly sitting down on the bed head bent now what he sat down next to her stay she said nothing for a minute looking down then raised her head no its what we said she turned to him just come and stay the night in the street he took the direct way again to the tram one last chance to be noticed this time sürmeli must have been waiting at his windowstepping suddenly into the street merhaba had leon heard about georg so sudden a rush of mournful turkish but all the time looking at kay eyes wide with interest the flat explained who was that someone georg knew at the university not quite right bending the truth again using her for cover does he know about the heart attack that was all the turkish life being so short she looked at him not saying anything at sirkeci they took separate taxis see you she said door open putting a hand on his arm what did i like best for the desk clerk topkapi the jewels she nodded then held his arm tighter i eat an early dinner he grinned dont get picked up in the bar in the taxi he went through the checklist in his head clothes the papers from manyas first thing tomorrow then the car in üsküdar safer to split up alexei could take the haydarpaşa ferry just a few streets away from the funicular impossible to miss even if you didnt know the city avoid haydarpaşa itself the station full of eyes and follow the quay on the right instead toward kadiköy an easy pickup at the end both of them on the asian side without having crossed together already on the road south even safer if they could leave tonight in the dark but there were the papers and kay what did i like best for the desk clerk get alexei out firstkeep things separate but he realized the excitement of one had spilled over into the other part of the same thing now getting away with both juggling balls faster in the air at the office turhan was getting ready to leave the monthly figures were done mrs king had called again a farewell party time and place dorothy at the consulate wanting to know if he was expected back today frank bishop what did he want he just said hed try again checking in maybe checking up but why would he someone leon should feel awkward about and yet didnt he could feel her hand on his arm again the promise of later not the little qualms that hid away in corners frank unaware at his desk in ankara something else to think about later i eat an early dinner by the time he left it was dark taksim bright with neon istanbuls piccadilly he glanced at the signs while he waited for the istiklal tram persil soap pamuk the coke substitute if he was early he could always have a drink at the bar run into somebody from the consulate say he was on his way home colgate a cinema with running lights the big branch of denizbank on the tram he stood near the back seeing his reflection in the glass not smiling exactly but his lips half curled up expectant going somewhere he thought of that first rainy night in bebek seeing himself in the mirror at home now feeling like this lighted storefronts barely noticed they were near the flower passage now past the big sweets store with its blocks of lokum in the window then a bookstore an akbank branch he felt a nagging as if hed forgotten something or seen something out of place akbank ak denizbank he gripped the rail tighter trying to remember maybe that was it not a code he leaped off at the next stop and threaded his way down to meşturiyet lights were still on at the consulate telephone night staff cleaning ladies slowly making their way through the building the snappy marine day guard had been replaced at night by a local watchman who asked to see leons id people working late leon said in turkish while the guard examined the pass always he said surprised at the turkish americans they like to work he shrugged its the time difference their bosses are still leon began then gave it up as too complicated to explain i wont be long he didnt wait for the elevator racing up the stairs instead a woman was emptying wastebaskets in the hall mister she said bowing surprised at someone on the stairs leon nodded back wondering if she sifted through the baskets one of altans eyes behind her several transoms still had lights coming through he switched on the overhead in the outer office then went into tommys and got the passports from underneath the drawer slips inside yes ak the other dzdenizbank not code bank account numbers under different names manyass flawless papers all the identification a bank would need but leon wasnt the man in the picture hed need a power of attorney or some equivalent paper akbank would accept executor he went out to dorothys desk and found some consular stationery the wording wouldnt matter as long as it looked official he typed out two one for each name giving him authority to access the accounts how much had tommy stashed away he put the passports and letters in his jacket pocket then hurried out of the office the cleaning lady had disappeared and so had the watchman maybe out back for a smoke or in the bathroom but the front door wasnt locked so leon just pushed through outside the iron gates were open a few cars still in the courtyard so there was no need to ring for a guard what if hed been a burglar but wasnt he whose money would it be technically barbaras the governments not the russians anymore assuming money was there but it had to be or why have the accounts how had it been arranged wire transfers something traceable finally proof or an envelope of cash passed under the table at the park or at one of those allied meetings melnikov exchanging more than information tommys thirty pieces of silver he looked down the street to the pera jumpy and elated at the same time withholding evidence the police would say but it had to be the link a way to prove tommy tucked away in his pocket something only he knew while he had a drink at the bar waiting to go upstairs he sensed that she was already awake her back to him maybe staring out the window at the drizzly morning he lay still watching the faint rise of her shoulder as she breathed feeling the warmth his body curved along hers it had rained during the night streaking the windows making them snuggle under the covers but now it had slowed to a fine mist the skies finally exhausted the roads through the mountains would be slick slower to drive then sun at the end citrus trees what time did the banks open she pulled at the sheet covering herself what are you thinking he said quietly a morning whisper she turned in the bed facing him how it happens what standing in the street after the funeral and you gave me a cigarette and i wondered thats all thats how it started then we talked at the reception so one thing then another i was trying to trace it in my mind how that happens he put his hand to her face i woke up and i could smell you she said on my skin i thought im lying here and hes on my skin so how did that happen one things leads to another he said a cued response she looked at him well until it doesnt ill come to ankara i go there on business its easy for you she said sliding away reaching for the robe on the floor ill arrange it im good at that you said so but im not she stood up beginning to put on the robe no dont wait a minute just stand there like that she put her hand to her breast covering herself what are you looking at just looking he leaned up on one elbow facing her her skin pale white with the window light behind she lowered her head ive never done this have somebody look at me naked never she put her arm through the sleeve anyway its cold keep it open he said getting out of bed and coming over to her i want to see you so you can remember he held her against him ill arrange something for a second she didnt move then let her arms hang loose and stepped over to the window youd better get dressed its stopping i dont have to leave yet its early yes now its the right time she turned to face him trying a smile and ill get back into bed for a while smell you on me she stood there for a minute then belted the robe get dressed okay she said softly picking up a cigarette and lighting it he reached for his pants watching her i wont be away long ill come to ankara after and maybe we can all have dinner frank looking at us and you looking at me and me avoiding you and me sneaking around with orhan thats our driver we have a car there and it would look funny if i took a cab anywhere and then what i pretend to go shopping and he waits and i run around the cornerto where some room you arranged maybe your friend here has one there too for a quick one while im supposed to be shopping it doesnt have to be like that it is like that he stopped letting his tie hang from his collar kay so its a mess she ran the cigarette around the rim of the ashtray tapping off ash my god im the other woman arent i in a hotel my mother was right smoking half hanging out of my robe quite a sight utterly depraved she looked up a small smile im glad you stayed the night it makes it less like its not then what is it he finished his tie its what we have she drew on the cigarette looking at him then stubbed it out all dressed youd better go what do we say im new at this he walked over and took her chin in his hand kissing her on the forehead say ill see you soon she met his eyes then moved back shoulders slightly drooped he picked up his jacket not really looking so that he grabbed it upside down the breast pocket hanging over the floor a quiet thump tommys passports spilling out then one of the consulate letters he looked at the pile for a second jarred then scooped them back up nothing seen no names just the fact of them obviously passports more than one kay folded her arms across her chest a protective reflex then glanced up at him he put on his jacket sliding the passports back into the pocket dont ask he said remember she kept looking at him what else dont you tell me i wonder maybe its the same with us he adjusted his collar not answering maybe you like it this way secret like your work seeing me like this its exciting for you he looked over there are two of us in this room she said nothing for a minute then nodded all right yes i like it too im just not as good at it i keep thinking it shows in my face he moved closer putting his hand on her neck it does but nobody else sees it she touched his breast pocket not patting it her hand still whatever youre doing with theseits safe he nodded ill come to ankara he said and then before she could answer you can give orhan the day off she looked up all the details the numbers turned out to be for safety deposit boxes not accounts no deposit slips no transfers no records at all but you have the date when he took the box yes of course the denizbank manager said and referred to an index card in his hand may fortyfour the nineteenth theres some irregularity no no we need to audit his assets thats all so we can settle the estate hes dead im sorry he said mr price clearly unknown to him an american with a valid passport and money to pay for a box we would need to see a death certificate before we could release the contents you understand yes naturally we dont want to close it out we just need to know whats in it any papers his wife thinks there may have been bondsshe cant find them at home if youd like to have someone from the bank present while i do the accounting the manager brushed this aside please a consulate request is there anything you need theres a desk in the room only a signature here to confirm the grant of access do people sign every time they come in the manager smiled no not the box holders one woman you know comes in every day to look at her jewels imagine if we had to ask her he looked up hesitant this is not a police matter no nothing like that a simple audit leon was shown into a vault room lined floor to ceiling with metal boxes the manager drew one out and put it on the table handing leon a key leon put a notepad and pen next to it ergin will wait outside the manager said leave the key with him now if theres anything i cant thank you enough the manager bowed as he left an embassy gesture leon looked up as he turned the key no ergin no mirrors nobody watching he raised the lid half expecting the shine of gold some treasure chest effect but there was only the dull graygreen of currency several bundles of it no identifying bank bands or other papers just money he flipped the corners of one bundle counting onehundreddollar bills in stacks of fifty five in all twentyfive thousand dollars he stared at it in dollars something the russians usually hoarded why not pay in turkish liras not a fortune but a lot of money what had tommy actually done to earn it copy cables sell names but not accumulated in bits over the years the stacks crisp and of a piece a single payout leon counted all of it just to be sure then closed the box again and locked it a big house in chevy chase with a powder room the one hed told dorothy about he wouldnt have to wire the money home pay taxes just carry it in his briefcase on the plane nobody not even denizbank the wiser for what alexei might be worth twentyfive thousand dollars a bounty hunter price but the money had already been here when tommy was killed and it was unlikely the russians would pay in advance anyway why pay tommy to kill alexei when they could easily have done it themselves if theyd had the information the manager at akbank was more scrupulous insisting on staying in the room while leon opened the box his only concession a discreet turning away as leon raised the lid onehundreddollar bills the same plain stacking bands a duplicate of the first box more than enough now for the house or maybe another life lived on another passport nothing to link tommy to either box if anything went wrong but what would no one else can open this box leon asked his wife im sorry there is no countersignature just mr riordan again someone clearly unknown of course if there were a court order the bank would be obliged who could get that the police the treasury during the time of the wealth tax there were investigations undeclared assets but mr riordan is a foreign national not i believe subject to turkish taxes his eyebrows rose with the question no then it would not concern him in any case you know the law was repealed mr riordan took out the box afterward when exactly do you know the manager checked a card similar to denizbanks last year may but technically the government could still get access a good reason not to put everything in one account mr price mr riordan tommy spreading his bets again technically but they have not done so may i ask is there some reason no just curious when the will is executed ill need to attest to the integrity of the assets i just wanted to be sure that no one no one only mr riordan he dipped his head to leon now his executor the estate will be responsible for the box fees im sorry to ask but outside leon stood for a few minutes watching the traffic snaking through taksim the air hazy with bus exhaust trying to make sense of the money what was worth fifty thousand dollars to the russians or had tommy been acting as paymaster using the deposit boxes the way he had his consulate accounts funding two networks with the same currency why would the russians waste precious foreign reserves on an istanbul payroll they wouldnt maybe not even on tommy but there was the money in ak and dz waiting for two tommys to collect it a big ship had docked at the end of enver manyass street and the noise of winches and hamals shouting drowned out the ping of the shop bell manyas bey efendi he said slipping out from behind the curtain like a cat his tail still behind youre early too early a minute leon stared at the wall families posing stiffly against painted backdrops of topkapi manyas came back with a passport and handed it over the counter nesim barouh traveling to greece leon flipped through the pages the seal is good manyas dipped his head leon took out an envelope and for what mr king owed you another dip leon pocketed the passport then pulled out the two from tommys desk i assume these were you manyas glanced at the inside covers yes last year the airport arrival stampyours too yes everything any others for him i mean just the new one you paid for he turned the page no exit stamp so he never used them not for travel manyas waited then ran his hand over the page his slender fingers almost stroking it a valuable thing an american passport not if youre dead as you say valuable to someone else then the paper its very difficult to copy a shame to waste his eyes moved up of no use to you now of course we would share like mr king tommys business partner something extra on the side but how much could it have been windfall money a few rounds for everybody at the bar and suddenly for a second he was back at the park tommy nostalgic for a room full of manyases everyone for sale when istanbul had been his playground full of secrets like his own missing it already as he planned to kill leon tommy supplied you with passports real ones a few difficult to obtain sometimes one is lost the consulate issues a replacement you might perhaps have a similar source there perhaps wanting to know now how much tommys cut forty percent the work you understand is mine changing the picture not as easy as you might think even for turkish papers he said nodding to the passport in leons pocket and other services arranging the sale mr king insisted on that no involvement no risk to you he said looking now at leon leon stared back at him a simple negotiation part of the culture a moment over tea fifty percent he said tommys cut manyas said nothing for a minute then nodded a worthy successor and how do i know what price you get a faint smile efendi a certain amount of trust is required in business mr king never complained may i he said reaching for the passports later leon said stopping them with his hand i need them for a little while need them with his picture dont worry theyre not going anywhere you can start looking for customers who would that be by the way an american passport many buyers but the best prices during the war the jews what price do you put on your life now still i think still the best prices with them leon felt his stomach move you and tommy sold passports to jews manyas looked at him who needed them more the ship was being unloaded and leon his head somewhere else followed the noise down the street gears and cranes people shouting over them he watched a load swinging up out of the ship and over the pier guided to its receiving area with furious hand signals hamals rushing over to break it up some of it would simply disappear things had been falling off ships for thousands of years in istanbul heads turned something slipped into the hand as natural as breathing did tommy skim the consulate accounts too fond of petty cash payments to sources who were just initials doing business with enver manyas baksheesh was part of life here a ship with missing cargo expense accounts with something added in everybody did it and then drew their own personal lines this but not that where had tommy drawn his fleecing jews the same desperate people who then crowded onto annas ships how much could it have been worth crossing that line making them pay for their lives while he was arranging their rescue the last person anyone in the consulate would suspect but you didnt make fifty thousand dollars selling a few passports what would he have done for that kind of money if hed already crossed a line for a few hundred something that valuable to the russians leon frowned watching another load being landed onto the pier men carrying sacks away not just a piece of cargo fifty thousand in dollars who had american dollars leon stopped following the question then not wanting to get there americans there were police cars in the consulate courtyard as many as thered been after tommy had been found drawing the same crowd of onlookers outside the gate whats going on leon said to the marine as he showed his id they got the cops here again what asking questions yeah they corporal theyre coming down give us a hand here on the double he waved leon in and started running toward a group of people near the elevator two full cars at least leon headed up the stairs instead taking them two at a time more questions about tommy hours he didnt have to waste alexei waiting envers papers in his pocket upstairs there was an odd quiet no typewriters clicking as if everyone were on coffee break dorothy had stepped out too all the lights on a sweater draped over the back of her chair leon went through to tommys office rummaging through the top drawer for tommys appointment books may last year donald price had supposedly entered the country in april and needed or knew he would need the box in may he flipped through the pages midmonth then further then went back routine appointments but the others would hardly be the sort of meetings hed record look for the money instead he opened the bottom drawer and pulled out the files hed gone through before looking for something else now mr king was proud of these having it every which way crossing the last line oh dorothy stood in the door her hand raised to her chest in a cartoon movement youre here you gave me a turn thank heavens the police have been asking in a minute i just want to see what she said noticing the files last spring did tommy take any trips trips she said the idea itself implausible out of the country last year during the war no mr bauer the police theyre down in the conference room youd really better tell them youre here theyve been phoning the reynolds office reynolds why you dont know she started fingering the button on her blouse its mr bishop hes dead frank leon said not taking this in last night well i suppose last night thats what theyre asking about anyway where everybody was last night asking here leon said still trying to make sense of this but he was in ankara no here in the consulate they found him this morning poor mary just opened the door and they had to give her something see a thing like that no warning the lights are on and she walks in and there he is blood everything she shuddered he diedhere leon said as if he were feeling his way along a wall in the dark why hed want to do it here i dont know think what it feels like for everybody what oh god you dont know do you she said her voice breaking dorothy he shot himself for a second he had no reaction at all his mind blank then a rush of pictures frank at karpićs taking an envelope smoking a cigarette in tünel square kays pale skin against the morning window hand over her breast leon lying on his elbow watching her he felt blood leap to his face had frank known where was kay mr bauer shot himself he said dully in his office maybe there when leon had come for the passports one of the lights pouring through the transoms into the hall but how could he have been mrs bishop shes downstairs with the police leon started for the door a file still in his hand just following his feet frank sitting at his desk with a gun writing a note mr bauer not hearing her already walking down the hall there were police photographers in franks office flashbulbs lighting up the pushedback chair a small overnight bag a few files in the outtray no note on the blotter no signs of any disturbance at all except for the dark stain on the carpet where hed bled two policemen with measuring tape and plastic bags were going through the rest of the room leon walked over to the desk personnel files frank hunting to the end but leaving a clean desk tidying up loose ends before he picked up the gun had he called the pera palas dont touch anything one of the policemen said in turkish leon moved his hand back no ones allowed here the policeman said cocking his head to the door leon looked at the chair again trying to imagine it had he slumped over on the desk or been thrown back against the chair did it matter a policeman wearing gloves kay downstairs there were a few consulate people waiting in chairs outside the conference room talking in low voices leon brushed past the police guards barely noticing them mr bauer gülün the burly policeman whod been on tommys payroll looked up from the table a stenographer next to him one of the consulate secretaries being questioned across from him a late start this morning his cheeks dark with stubble maybe called out too early to shave kay was at the end of the table a coffee cup in front of her face white and vague like someone whos been sick i just heard leon said you can go gülün said to the secretary mr bauer but leon was looking down the table kay winced her dazed expression now filled with something else the guilty apprehension of someone about to be punished dorothy said he kay looked away shot himself he finished to gülün is that right he was shot yes gülün said officious enjoying himself by whom is another matter what do you mean i mean that is not yet determined there are things to considerthe angle of the shot technical matters he means that suicide is not likely in fact not possible a voice from behind colonel altan got up from a chair and walked toward them you can be frank with mr bauer he said to gülün he was mr bishops colleague both you know were cooperating with us on another matter he turned to leon lieutenant gülün thinks it best for the staff not to be alarmed so a simple suicide for now nevertheless he asks questions he said with irony but in english an effect gülün would not pick up he wants to eliminate possibilities leon looked at gülün someone killed him im trying to establish the facts gülün said a strut in his voice please he opened his palm and indicated a chair leon sat glancing again at kay head down fingering her ring when did you see mr bishop yesterday an approximate time gülün said with a small wave i didnt i thought he was in ankara but he called your office your secretary says you talked to turhan its important to be thorough a mans death so he called i thought from ankara no a local call according to your secretary she never told me that i had no idea he was here looking at kay talking to both of them ah and yet you went from your office to the consulate not to meet him no i had some work to finish up saydam the night guard said you came here about seven is that correct yes about that but he did not see you leave he wasnt at the door i dont know where he was maybe having a pee he said he was always there well he would wouldnt he look gülün waved this off so we dont know an hour more how long were you here not long twenty minutes maybe half an hour and then then i went to the pera palas he glanced down at kay for a drink you were seen at the bar i dont know ask the bartender why are you suggesting i killed him gülün made a calming gesture with his thick hands and after after after i went home he said looking at gülün gülün held his gaze for a second not according to mr cicek its correct yes cicek the bekçi at your building youve had a busy morning leon said lieutenant gülün is methodical altan said quietly its correct that hes the bekçi yes that he knows where i am night and day no look what is this i was at the consulate half an hour at the most say till seven thirty when was frank shot didnt anybody hear it a shot unfortunately the police cannot be accurate about the time of death altan said mr bishop had been dead for some time when his body was found the police doctor says yesterday eveningearly not so early its impossible to say which exactly maybe when the cleaning staff is running the vacuum maybe the guard thinks he heard a sound in the street we dont know but we do know he was shot gülün said and we know you were here so we must account for your time so the pera bar and after another steady gaze i went home mr cicek must not have heard me no he heard your telephone ringing until the caller gave up do you often do that not answer your phone a standoff minute leon facing him down he couldnt kay said he was with me leon shot her a look a slight shake of his head dont madame gülün said surprised altan sat up eyes moving from one to the other he wasnt at home he was with me all night i can swear to it her voice getting fainter let me understand you spent the night with mr bauer yes she said to leon your husbands colleague he paused you are lovers we spent the night she said looking down gülün glanced at the stenographer embarrassed and stood up your husband knew this no of course not but he comes to istanbul a sudden trip so perhaps a surprise for the lovers he called mr bauer altan said calmly gülün looked at kay then at leon not sure what to do with this a moment please altan said to gülün drawing him toward the door you will excuse us more coffee kay shook her head the stenographer got up and went over to the window as if she were leaving the room too out of earshot why did you say that leon said quietly when theyd gone why not its true isnt it she said her voice flat she pushed the cup away a surprise for the lovers she said with gülüns inflection it would have been wouldnt it quite a surprise kay the nuns had it right she said to herself you pay one way or the other maybe not this way though even they wouldnt think of this are you all right i was still in bed when the phone rang could i come down theres been an accident accident so i wouldnt become hysterical i suppose and ive got the smell of you on me she got up hands on the table not that theyd know that they do now why did do you know what they asked me did he have any enemies and i thought i dont know i dont know that my husband and i dont know anything about him so maybe you do did he have enemies he must have had one she looked down then put her hand up to cover her eyes imagine not knowing that not crying but quiet now receding leon went over and touched her shoulder but she swung away out of reach an accident she said taking out a handkerchief and blowing her nose what kind of accident then this last night they said so he must have been lying there dead while we kay he said i had to make the identification is this your husband yes and all the time im thinking i dont know this man a man who gets shot he had some other life to do that like you she said lifting her head i dont know you either yes you do he took the handkerchief and wiped the corner of her eye and they were asking for you i thought maybe they knew about us but you werent here and i thought why not you left me and then what where were you he said nothing finishing with the handkerchief tell me she said her hands suddenly on his chest i hate this dont ask i cant say first frank and now you and now look i had some errands errands she said not believing him her voice rising caught up in it what errands dont ask tell me hitting his chest he took her arms i went to the bank he said looking straight at her breaking whatever spell had taken her so that she almost laughed at the simple unexpectedness of it then lowered her head onto his chest not sobbing just letting go her body limp against him kay listen to me he said into her ear so that the stenographer could only hear whispers we need to be careful calling turhan mr cicek theyre going to a lot of trouble to prove i was here could have been here but i told them you were with me he nodded and now they have a motive what motive you her eyes clouded im sorry i didnt mean i know theyd think that she said brooding then why not me the unfaithful wife they dont think anything yet we have to be careful thats all its not just police altans emniyet but he was at lilys party she said a reaction so off the point that he didnt know how to respond she turned away holding her arm this place who knows who anybody is she stopped shivering a little then looked up reading his face tell me one thing the truth you had nothing to do with this tell me that i couldnt live with myself if nothing he said a quiet second my god and i believe you just like that you say it and i believe you she said lowering her head again to his chest mrs bishop altan said coming through the door youre not well kay jumped gülün shuffled behind his face in a kind of pout watching them shes had a rough morning leon said still holding her she ought to rest he looked at gülün do you need her much longer gülün waved his hand too annoyed to bother with words and went over to his place scooping up his notes another time he said to her youll be staying on in istanbul i hadnt really thought kay said moving away from leon it would be advisable you too mr bauer until when i may have to go to ankara altan looked up at this but gülün was busying himself with his papers im asking this of everyone who was here last night he said then looked over at kay do you need someone to take you to the hotel for your rest the last said with a sting he couldnt resist kay shook her head are there things im supposed to do here what do widows do i mean i dont know dorothy can help you leon said with the arrangements we cant release the body yet gülün said the law requires an autopsy yes kay said vaguely the body hell have to be buried somewhere wont he all that would you call extension sixtytwo leon said to the stenographer ask dorothy to come down he turned to kay you dont have to do this now dorothy can get the paperwork ready no i cant just sit do nothing id go altan nodded its difficult a sudden death the shock he said his voice knowing personal one more question gülün said not looking at altan your husband he didnt call yesterday to say he was coming no this was usual he liked surprises i dont know no not really yet he flies here he flew but he hated to fly i just assumed he took the train kay said genuinely surprised at this no so something urgent something that couldnt wait he paused a surprise no message to the hotel you were out during the day sightseeing alone no with she nodded to leon ah gülün said as if some point had been made he turned to the stenographer were finished for the day a sly look at altan as he filled his briefcase by the way mr bauer we spoke to saydam the guard there may have been a cigarette some time away from the door yes unfortunately no one else was there either so anything is possible he glanced over at kay people coming in people going out dorothy appeared and everybody began moving toward the door relieved to be leaving dont mind gülün altan said to leon bringing up the rear your embassy in ankara has been making calls two men killed now of course they blame the russians but its our police who get the calls what arrests so a difficult time for him what about the gun any prints only mr bishops it was franks gun no but youre sure he didnt sure he was shot in the back of the head then why wipe the gun to make it look altan shrugged the head wound was large maybe he thought no one would look too closely examine the angle but lieutenant gülün has a fondness for that so no not a suicide were there prints anywhere else everywhere a busy office people in and out gülün will have to compile a list see if theres a match with someone who was here last night a long job there was one curiosity about the prints though whats that leon said stopping letting the others move out through the door they found prints everywhere except one filing cabinet evidently wiped like the gun personnel files like the ones in his outtray altan looked up pleased excellent gülün has not yet made that connection and you think someone took a file and wiped his prints off the drawer no i think someone put a file back which mr bishop had taken out not something you want to go missing your file then it might be noticed something you want to have back with all the others that mr bishop had never taken out somebody working here then altan nodded it would have to be poor saydams not a very good guard but still its unlikely a stranger could come in off the street shoot mr bishop and then go back out again not even a wife he said looking up gülün likes magazine stories european women a fascination they behave differently a turkish man goes to a whore not to a hotel with someones wife it would be unthinkable youll forgive me im making a point only what point that gülün could conceive such a woman slipping into the consulate to shoot her husband an exciting solution for him but of course it was more likely someone who belongs here whose coming or going wouldnt be noticed like me oh you and then down the street for a night of love no he shook his head anyway you dont have a file youre from outside brought in after mr king was shot mr bishop always said it was a traitor in the consulate you i think didnt believe him i was never sure why he glanced over at leon as if considering it again then let it go but now you see he was right there was a traitor and mr bishop found him so he had to be killed how do you know because he called you think for a minute dont be gülün the angry husband no i dont think he ever suspected he looked over a small relief for your conscience you have no altan waved him silent apologies so he packs a bag and takes a planeno time to loseand where does he go the hotel no straight to the consulate and who does he call his wife no he calls you gülün doesnt appreciate this point he called you and who are you to him the other man no his partner the man he brought in he calls you because he has news on the case he was right hes found the leak altan paused a pity you werent there to take the call instead ofsightseeing the others were still standing outside the door you left something i think he said picking up the file and handing it to leon his eyes skimming over the tab and how is your work going any ideas yet just a question the romanian you said hed never been to istanbul but he did come to turkey you had the dates i assume you got this from passport control why do you ask because he must have someone here whos helping whom he knew before where did he go do you know ankara and edirne what was he doing in edirne leon said looking at the file as if he were thinking out loud a visa signed by antonescu so government business government business last year what kind of business would they have altan shrugged maybe asking for peace a way out a day visa its usually for a courier not long enough i think to make a friend here who helps in the hall the group had begun to break up gülün rescheduling the people still waiting kay farther off talking to dorothy by the way altan said why are you going to ankara business he caught altans raised eyebrow tobacco business youll spread yourself too thin i didnt ask to do this leon said opening a hand to indicate the consulate frank asked me and now hes gone so naturally you feel an obligation to help thats what i told gülün we are allies in this there he is a voice in turkish down the hall he can tell you hes the one who promised me the money a man in a rough jacket holding a cap in his hand shaved but grizzled as if the razor hadnt been sharp enough he was walking fast toward leon now one of the consulate clerks following leon looked up at first not recognizing him people were turning to the commotion gülün stopping in midsentence altan stepping aside as the man pushed forward everything happening as fast as a shot tell him the man said to leon the extra day because of the weather you said id be paid for it leon stood there for a second still not reacting then went over to the fisherman blocking him from gülüns line of sight yes yes he said in turkish low trying not to be overheard youll be paid right away if you calm down dont make such a racket the fisherman pointed to the clerk he didnt believe me he kept asking for a name i dont know i said how would i know a name work like that they dont give you names he turned to the clerk you see i told you he was there he can vouch for me it wasnt my fault it rained ill take care of this leon said quickly to the clerk moving the man away by the elbow feeling everyone still watching dorothy take him up to the office go up with her well get you the money two hundred the fisherman said i still had the expense of the boat keeping him a frantic look to dorothy to get him away he turned to the others excuse me id better go up a routine matter nothing wrong ill be back in a minute he said to kay who was looking lost the turkish a mystery to her but it wouldnt be to gülün leon turned back avoiding him what had anyone heard the clerk still seemed puzzled not a visa applicant someone whose presence he understood work like that they dont give you names just get him out of here before he could say anything else leon started for the stairs a moment mr bauer altan said he looked at the fisherman go he said sharply cocking his head to the stairs expecting to be obeyed a cops authority the fisherman bent his head and started backing away please altan said to leon heading back to the conference room ill be right up leon said to dorothy just keep him there altan closed the door then slammed leon back against it hand on his throat what do you think youre doing he said his voice rough the way hed talked to the fisherman is it possible you think im gülün leon said nothing too shocked to respond altans hand like a vise someone else you can trick what was he doing in edirne now using leons voice somebody he knew before he dropped his hand leon now gulping air what was the point of that little charade not a charade leon said breathing heavily i wanted to know about edirne then why not ask jianu he jerked his head toward the conversation outside since you picked him up leon touched his throat is this how emniyet does it my friend if this were an emniyet inquiry youd know a fit of temper only much deserved lying to me how many sides do you work for maybe none just you he made a sound in his throat a hint of disgust what does it matter its over soon how much time do you think you have left for these games leon said nothing do you think i can protect you again he shook his head gülün is a fool but not a complete fool he is interested in you and people talk a strange little scene just now and hell think about that too the minute he understands the minute he puts you on the quay that night he acts what do dont altan said cutting him off theres no time you met the boathe has a witness now you were there mr king was killed now another colleague killed the man investigating the first crime and youre even sleeping with his wife gülün makes the connection so will any jury i cant protect you from that he took a breath and why would i want to a murder solved two your ambassador will be grateful justice served i didnt kill frank i believe you altan said easily but no one else will youll hang unless unless we can save gülün from himself change the story and why would you do that because i dont care about justice being served gülün hears the fisherman he hears one thing i hear another you were there then you have our friend or you know where he is and i tell you or you let me hang a generous offer considering so you can shop him mr bauer what do you care scruples at such a time lily said you were like that i think maybe to criticize me a little but maybe you just dont know the world no matter youre running out of time leon stared at him how long altan said i dont know hours you can run upstairs pay off your fisherman and get him out of istanbul before gülün thinks to question him but such men arent hard to find this one leaves a loud trail so you buy a little time only to do what leave the country gülün would have you stopped at the border appeal to your ambassador who wont believe you either so what do you do with this time run wait for gülün to come maybe the pera a tender farewell scene youre so sure im going to hang for something i didnt do arent you its a chance i wouldnt want to take turkish justice sometimes not as perfect as one would like no and people get beaten too by emniyet they say is that next try to beat it out of me i could and worse but the americans dont understand these things he looked over and its possible yourethe martyr type a long job anyway not necessary people make mistakes when theyre running its hard to think youll make them too and ill be there he looked up meeting leons eyes but i dont protect you then thats your choice why not just call gülün in now you havent made the mistakes yet i dont have jianu and it seems you dont want to tell me so gülün will come in his own time he cocked his head and maybe its a little for the sport a head start to give gülün the chase he paused before you trip thats what you want to trade your life for a man like jianu i havent traded it yet altan stared at him for a second then reached for the door not yet he turned the knob opening it your fishermans waiting better hurry altan said now to leons back the clock is running on the stair landing stopping to catch his breath he felt he could hear an actual ticking how long he looked up the steps think for a minute down the corridor a police photographer was probably still taking pictures a crime scene and the man who could link him to it waiting in his office first deal with him then what the car in üsküdar alexei on the ferry to haydarpaşa the mountain road but all that seemed impossible now the drive endless exposed something else think people make mistakes when theyre running he tried to slow his breathing how long before gülün put things together not a complete fool there would be roadblocks a car that might be traced back to mihai no matter what he said but how else somewhere theyd never look he felt himself turning to the steps then stopping his feet refusing to move he couldnt count on more than today altans head start i believe you but no one else will oh mr bauer i was just coming down dorothy on the stairs what am i supposed to do with him somewhere theyd never look coming he said his feet moving now do we have turkish liras petty cash would id need a voucher the fisherman was sitting in the outer office fiddling with his cap impatient my secretary is going to get your money leon said signing the form dorothy had put in front of him two hundred right i didnt know there would be police he said still uneasy about altan now theyve seen me dont worry its not about this something else he handed the voucher to dorothy then waited until shed left sorry about the delay with the money well you did say the man who used to arrange the money died so things got lost died the one they said was shot alert now yes and now its you he said looking at leon leon glanced toward the door tell me something do you have your boat the fisherman nodded you interested in another job what another one from romania no here one night five hundred the fishermans eyes widened to the black sea ill tell you tonight not far but five hundred suspicious there could be police he waited while this sank in like last time the fisherman thought for a minute well thats always the risk isnt it thats what you pay for and youre good at it one night five hundred in advance on the boat all of it he twisted his hat thinking where well where not in town the same place he said you remember the fisherman nodded as soon as you get the money here go to the boat and take it out on the bosphorus anybody asks youre going home go right up sariyer anywhere up there and put in until tonight he took out his wallet and handed him a hundred liras extra for dinner no raki then come back and pick me up the same place as before im taking you two of us then you drop us and go home one night what time late leon did a mental calculation say eleven okay five hundred on the boat the fisherman looked at him then nodded five hundred a verbal handshake good heres dorothy with the money count it make sure its right mr woods wasnt thrilled about this its a lot of petty cash ill talk to him all there good ill walk you down he started to lead him out turning to dorothy im going to take mrs bishop to the hotel ill be back later why are they asking questions she said blurting it out to catch him on the run if he did it himself leon stopped he didnt did he its just like tommy two now it gives you the willies here down the hall she caught herself then glanced over at the fisherman how do you want this charged the petty cash req we have to charge it somewhere its one of tommys the payment accounts with the initials ill do a memo when i get back oh she said interested the fisherman part of tommys world tommy who still had to be explained if leon got the chance that reminds me he said taking a file out of the desk drawer and putting it in a briefcase with the others look he said to dorothy if it bothers youabout frankgo home ill be out most of the day anyway youd think theres nowhere safer wouldnt you marines and gates and everything and now look in his office and you know the way people talk what way well tommy now mr bishop and you knowing both of them so i did it he said easily dismissing it dorothy i didnt mean but you were here troubled wanting to know mr burke asked if you were still here when i left he thought id been with you you were here late not here jacks office you know my husband he has to go back to ankara so i waited around with access to the files already in the building well i was probably long gone he looked at her dont start imagining things okay weve got too much to do keep moving by the way when hirschmann was here when they were getting people out how did they pay dorothy looked blank for a second dazed by the quick switch to hire the ships you mean she said feeling her way liras if they could if they were paying turks otherwise gold gold sovereigns not dollars not the ship owners she said still uncertain what was being asked theyd have problems explaining where they got it government agents it didnt matter they had foreign currency reserves so if we were sending a ship to burgas wed probably have to pay the charter in gold but the bulgarians on the other end in dollars and the romanians sometimes antonescu got paid in dollars why are you asking this i think some of it may have gone missing no tommy would have said he was very careful about money you had to be you couldnt trust the romanians theyd take the money and not send the people youd have to arrange it like thatpart on delivery leon stared at her his mind racing ahead his stomach dropping not the russians something worse is that what you wanted to know dorothy said tentative really asking why tommys secretary more had they talked in bed never about this how could you live with yourself knowing but tommy could planning powder rooms outside the fisherman kept his face down as they passed the police cars still idling in the courtyard leon hadnt bothered introducing kay still stunned her face empty off somewhere take a taxi leon said go straight to the boat efendi tolerant almost amused me in a taxi he dipped his head to kay awkward at eleven he said to leon perhaps something in advance on the boat and then like some trick in a vanishing act he slid away between two parked cars what was he saying kay asked he was thanking me no he wasnt you feel okay he said not answering i dont know she said half to herself i dont know what im supposed to feel to see somebody like that the blood you want to wipe it off and then you dont want to touch it and then you think its my fault it wasnt you think it though she lowered her head you think it he took her arm to lead her into the hotel but she shied away an involuntary reaction you want to come up now and then leave i want them to think im there i have some things to do what things do you think i killed frank what well they do or theyre going to but you were with me i said theres something else i have to get out i dont want you to get involved in this just go up the elevator with me so they think im with you get out of istanbul if you do that they will think i can explain it somewhere else not here explain what look if you dont want to do this ill go maybe that would be the right thing anyway but we cant just stand here youre so sure somebodys watching its istanbul he took a breath if you dont want to its okay ill figure something out thats right thats what you do you and frank she looked up alarmed whoever did it hes going to try to kill you too the same work no he said quickly then stopped disconcerted what if hed taken franks call knew what file he was going to pull hed be a threat the next target move he wont have to if the police get me they think i did it kay i cant stay she slid her hand through his arm now this she said to herself again her lips grim they were quiet in the lift eyes forward on the art nouveau grillwork then aware of the elevator boy watching them go down the hall what are we supposed to be doing she said inside going to bed with frank there is that what they think of us maybe or were going over our stories making sure they match he looked over or were wondering how this happened whats next she lit a cigarette quiet thats something to think about isnt it he opened the briefcase starting to riffle through the hirschmann file you brought work she said thrown i just want to check something to be sure she drew on the cigarette thoughtful youre really going away where he looked up at her not saying anything you think id give you up to the police if you dont know you wont have to for how long not long and whats your plan for me what do i do wait while you run from the police my god i never even talked to the police until now he touched her arm ill be back if the police dont get you he looked at his watch stay in for a few hours okay with my lover she said thats right who tells me nothing he looked at her ill be back he turned the knob what if theyre already here her voice like a hand trying to stop him theyll be in the lobby watching the elevator the stairs having coffee some dates this time of year they wont be on the fire stairs they werent he took a backstreet down the kasim paşa side of the hill then circled up avoiding tünel marina was in her kimono putting on nail polish its about time you said one more night only she said holding her fingers out to the air were leaving alexei said ready not yet yes one night only marina said youll make trouble for me dont worry ill get him out today you think its a hotel here no better alexei said looking at her better for you marina said had any visits leon asked from our friend she shook her head blowing on her fingers the landlord comes tonight well be gone leon took out alexeis new passport and handed it to him barouh alexei said looking at it what kind of name is that a jew marina said blowing on her nails again alexei grunted shrugging this off leon brought out one of tommys passports recognize him alexei looked at it carefully its a different name remember the real one king like king carol they use that for a name in english leon took a breath his stomach dropping again finally there tell me about the meeting in edirne alexei peered at him not sure where this was going you know that how twice right alexei nodded the first time he had hirschmann with him i never knew the other ones name big guy from the jewish committee you were making a deal for antonescu selling jews how many three hundred a few more from the transnistria camp how much leon said flatly three hundred dollars a head alexei said merchandise we had used this price before we delivered them to constancia the jews had to pick them up the mines any german ship that was their risk they give you money at the first meeting alexei nodded half that was the purpose of the meeting the arrangements had been made why are you asking this tell me about the second meeting only king this time alexei said then stopped waiting let me guess he was supposed to bring the other half fifty thousand dollars but he didnt why not did he say your government stopped the exchange they said the money was supporting the enemy of course this was foolishness the money was for antonescu only he was like carol he wanted to take the treasury with him so jews for dollars why not the american jews would pay but you stopped it no leon said quietly he said you did took the money and then betrayed him what happened to the people they were sent back to the camp no one was coming now to pick them up there was no deal or any others after that leon said running his hand over the top of the briefcase they stopped no more exchanges without the money he was not you know humanitarian antonescu and anyway now the russians were there he didnt have time but these people would have been saved he would have made good on that they were already in constancia he looked down again at the passport youre looking for him thats why youre asking this no hes dead he was the man we shot on the pier you would have recognized him you knew about him the only one who did he looked down again at the briefcase seeing tommys pink face not just one ship all the others that didnt follow to do something like this for fifty thousand dollars youre surprised people do worse for less leon looked up not worse and they believed him this story it was easy to believe the romanians look what youd already done alexei tapped tommys passport then handed it over to leon and you there was no one following on the tram back to taksim but to make sure leon got off just before the french consulate and used side streets to approach denizbank from behind the same manager still eager to help not surprised by leons explanation of a mixup in his notes ergin again waited outside the door leon hesitated for a second staring at the neat stacks in the box he glanced up to see if anyone was watching no one he snatched up the bills in batches slipping them into his briefcase another second looking at the empty box then he closed it taking a deep breath now robbery a criminal act but stealing from whom blood money he called ergin and watched him turn the key to lock the box would the weight of it feel different when he thanked the bank manager he felt his briefcase somehow glowing the stolen money like a light inside that everyone could see waiting to set off an alarm at the door he imagined tellers with their hands in the air getaway cars police waiting but no one in the street seemed to notice him know that a crime had taken place he took a taxi from a hotel rank he turned and looked out the back window as they left the square down the sweeping curve of aya paşa the usual traffic how much time did he have he had to get alexei out of marinas by nightfall and stash him where now past the park hotel the old german consulate the island of plane trees curving toward the cihangir apartments where mr cicek listened to ringing phones he thought of his picture window the water view and wondered suddenly if he would see it again something he hadnt imagined before not being able to come back the door closed behind him was anyone watching some car across the street with a bored policeman smoking not even looking twice at the taxi a man in back with twentyfive thousand dollars in his lap crossing another line büyükada mihai was out of the office down at the hasköy docks but leon had kept the taxi and they were there in minutes just wait i shouldnt be long with the meter youd be better off with an allday rate a higher fare all right leon said not wanting to argue someone with money in his pockets he looked down the street no cars idling unless the taxi itself were the tail now tracking his every movement but it had been a random pickup hadnt it what it felt like always looking over your shoulder there were health quarantine signs posted but no barriers the victorei listing slightly was eerily quiet as if everyone on board really was sick or some ghost ship had drifted into the golden horn there were patches of rust on the hull and makeshift clotheslines strung up across the top deck laundry flapping like ragged sails its not permitted a harbor policeman coming from behind passengers are not permitted im not a passenger leon said flashing the front of tommys passport captains expecting me the magic of an american passport the guard nodded to the gangplank leon started up noticing the garbage in the lapping water alongside peels and eggshells that hadnt yet flushed away there were sounds now ropes creaking and voices from inside the ship a baby but still subdued saving strength the lassitude of a hospital ward up top people wrapped in shawls and blankets were huddled on benches facing the weak winter sun there was a flutter of interest when they saw leon someone from the outside maybe news sitting up but their posture still wary people who knew everything who had been in the camps sallow skin drained and skeletal the faces anna used to see mihai was with the captain and a boy volunteered to get him while he waited leon walked across the deck low murmurs in a language he didnt know presumably polish open stares on the other side of the water süleymans mosque rose up the hill in a cluster of swelling domes the old picturebook city a kind of mirage the end of the black sea crossing everything foreign now home gone for good so whats so important you risk typhus mihai said they look all right leon said nodding to the passengers you should see down below we send them up in shifts so everyone gets some air down there itsso never mind what do you want is there somewhere we can go what here mihai said looking at the deck for a kaffeeklatsch find a square inch he checked his watch they go back down in fifteen minutes just try moving them early im serious off the ship then all right come on mihai said leading him toward the bridge whats the occasion what happened at the consulate you didnt shoot him i hope airy but looking at leon from the side you heard everybodys heard its istanbul anything to do with your romanian friend in a way what way its a long story ill tell you later i see the quarantine signs are still up bastards a few more days we really will have typhus living like this he peered at him i thought you were making a trip a little drive to the country i changed my mind just like that ill tell you that later too everything later and the boat in antalya who is he one of the passengers asked mihai in romanian a british he wants to stop us here american a friend the man snorted whose ours so when do we leave soon the man waved his hand down in disgust theyre all afraid of being sent back mihai said as they walked away we should have been there by now leon looked again across the horn the pincushion of minarets what do they think its going to be like like poland that one lost his whole family the pogrom in jassy big open grave he thinks its going to be better than that thats all in the bridge cabin a man was leaning over a chart spread across the table the sea of marmara the thin bottleneck of the dardanelles then the open water filled here with numbers and channel markers the orange trees somewhere in the imaginary distance ah he said looking up the new rations finally did you have any trouble with the harbor police unloading we had to pay extra for the water no mihai said shaking his head not the rations yet a friend david our captain oh david said ignoring leon disappointed when mihai i know the truck will be here aciman promised he nodded to leon a social visit we can have a few minutes david hesitated then realized he was being asked to leave and nodded awkwardly he moved away from the map you heard there was more trouble with pilcer the rabbi the one suitcase allowance he wants an exception for the synagogue how can he leave the menorah you know like before tell him to throw his clothes over then one suitcase the extra fits another child he can get new once we get there he says its special to them one suitcase the captain shrugged leaving he says thats what the nazis said for the train and hes the one who survives tell him he calls me a nazi again ill personally throw him over and the menorah he flicked his hand a gesture of contempt the orthodox he turned to leon as the captain left just what palestine needs more torah scrolls haganah asks for young people and who do they send make a soldier out of that they want to bring europe with them what europe the ovens a bullet in the head my father was the same and my uncle every day in shul hours and outside you could see what was happening come with me i said get out now no were too old to make a new life he paused so they lost the old one my sister at least listened now haifa she helps meet the boats pull people out of the water before the patrols get them and he wants to bring menorahs he looked up aware that he had been rambling so whats so important what do you want to help get you out of here oh moses you want to part galata bridge no leon said opening the briefcase go out when they raise it this morning now that everyones feeling better he handed over two stacks ten thousand dollars thats what you said wasnt it mihai lifted the money as if he were weighing it then looked at leon where did you get it whos going to ask the harbormaster the health officials you can go tonight im asking dont another long story it was money to help jews now it will but not the same ones use it leon said looking directly at him no one knows leave tonight before they ask for more an overnight recovery from typhus insist you cant stay here much longer how long would it take to pay them off not long when do they raise the bridge three thirty something like that not sooner leon said thinking mihai peered at him what do you want nothing leon said ten thousand dollars for nothing they were going to buy jews out with it leon said so buy them out now no strings he reached for another stack and that two places on the boat five thousand dollars however you want to use it there are no places on the boat standing room so mihai said money to help the jews he lifted a stack and money to help a killer of jews raising his eyebrow toward the other stack thats who it is two places whos the other one me you mihai said slowly you want to take the butcher to palestine on this boat just hitch a ride for part of the way and you think i would do this he held out the money there are no places leon shook his head the moneys yours its not a condition no an obligation what made you think i would take this i thought youd want to get them out of here not for this price hear me out one minute you leave tonight there might be an inspection so we wont leave with you hes traveling as a turk all the boats come out of the horn at once its busy when youre out of the city past the princes islands you pick us up i have a boat arranged the other passengers dont have to know who two more well stand if we have to near cyprus the boat from antalya picks us up were gone as far as youre concerned we were never here he stopped its the last place they would ever look for him yes mihai said and you were never here is that how you arrange things for your conscience these days pretend they never happen he put the money on the table then looked up at leon why are you doing this he said his voice softer do you know anymore for your country the one you dont live in why do you leon said nodding to the boat a house is burning someone jumps out what do you do keep walking not try to help then help them mihai looked down at the money the devil bargains this way the devil you dont see yourself come to this side of the table i have to get him out and that makes it all right hell die well people do mihai said his voice hard he went over to the window millions no deals he looked down at the deck these people he said waving his hand brooding who knows what they did to survive sonderkommandos maybe some of them you dont ask if you werent there you have no right the romanian you met on the deck he told me what they did at jassy people like your friend they tortured families together to find the others they didnt beat you they beat your wife made you watch if youd like us to stoplike that they raped a girl in front of her father a mistake he never told them anythinghe went mad so a waste except for whatever pleasure they took he looked away toward the deck they all have stories like this so who knows what bargains they made and all you want me to do is take some money i keep my soul but i help the butcher thats your idea jianu doesnt matter anymore they do and what happens after you get him out he tells your people things about the russians maybe even true so they know something for a while so the russians change them and the game goes on but hes out of it he goes free and you want me to help thats the business youre in now and what do i get a boat so old maybe it sinks but maybe it gets them there he stopped looking down on the deck the flapping laundry quiet for a few minutes so i answer myself to get these people to palestinewhat would i do is it even my choice he picked up the money absentmindedly flipping the corners then looked up at leon but i dont forget you did this arranged such a bargain for me the debts canceled were quits what debt whatever debt there was between us its paid he put the money in his pocket and reached over for the other stack how far past the princes islands leon didnt say anything for a second dismissed mihai waited the silence a kind of prodding off büyükada well signal the other ships will be heading for the main channel harbor police too just have the captain go slow dont worry thats the only speed he can go if youre not there we wont wait understood your friends a turk now a turkish jew mihai looked up you think of everything im assuming the deal is we get him there alive thats why youre going the bodyguard no i have to leave too the police are looking for me mihai went still why they think i shot frank why would they think that mihai said quietly and tommy leon said looking at him the boat at bebek the fisherman turned up they saw him he can identify me put me there that night so they add two and two and get five he can identify everyone there that night but there wasnt anyone else leon said meeting his stare just me he took one more stack out of his briefcase whats that i can explain what happened to washington im bringing them a witness theyll believe my house present im not so sure about the turkish police once they have an idea they dont like to be wrong especially when our people say they are so i may not be able to come back if not this is for anna ill make arrangements to move her but youll need thisto handle things mihai said nothing for a minute why didnt you tell me this before he said finally that it was for you its for both i need him you have another witness no there was no one else there ill swear to it another second not talking its interesting how you do this mihai said looking away draw these lines this is acceptable not that do you argue with yourself you should study talmud youd be good at it you can find anything there though maybe not why you should save the butcher no one else or youd never work here again mihai looked back then nodded accepting this and your fisherman will he swear too if it comes to it he likes the work its easy money hed want to do what we say and when his jobs over theres another one hes bringing me tonight make yourself scarce so he doesnt spot you trigger any memories you hired him this way i know where he is if hes with me hes not with the police and if he is someday the job puts him in a spot hes accusing me but helping me to escape for pay how do you build a case around that and then theres all the other work things hed rather not talk about in turkey they dont need to build a case leon nodded then lets not get caught he handed over the stack for anna you may not need this the ambassador makes the right calls i could be back in no time in good standing but just in case youll take care of her mihai pocketed the money an answer he looked at the briefcase is that it or does the money keep coming like a magic hat just a little pocket change traveling expenses he touched mihais upper arm thank you listen to me mihai said gruff but not removing the hand any police david puts you off orders its understood its not for you this ship its for them there wont be any trouble its the last place theyd look yes mihai shook his head and turned away the last place who else has to do such things just to live survive the ovens andthen help the killers and maybe its not even the worst before were finished with this his mouth turned up slightly a wry tic what leon said catching his expression rabbi pilcer if he knew what im taking instead of his menorah he told the cab to take him back to the pera but then a hunch asked to pull up instead to a pay phone near the koç shipyards thank god you called kay said the police are there no i mean they may be i dont know but gülün called asking for you and i told him you made sure i was okay and then went back to the consulate he buy it i dont know he wants you to call him he has a few questions polite well for him i cant come back then he must have men there and probably at the consulate the reynolds office cihangir the door really closing now where are you ill meet you he looked through the glass at the taxi waiting by the curb the stretch of empty road by the docks some cranes moving silently in the distance out in the open kay you cant just go not like this just go i have to see you do you know what its like sitting here like a wake like his caskets in the room kay theyll put a tail on you i wont be gone long come up the back then like before dont just go i cant go to the pera somewhere else then please just tell me her voice catching some nerve finally snapping he glanced again at the taxi not laleli georgs in nişantaşi a story for the neighbors a photograph georg wanted him to have and how was the dog assuming they had a key wondering who the lady was the whole maze of istanbul and nowhere to hide leon im thinking a movie anonymity in the dark but not where a new widow would go somewhere in plain sight that would make sense to them outside the cabbie flicked away the end of a cigarette leon followed its arc a few sparks to the gutter okay he said quickly go to the concierge methodical now as if he were laying down cards ask him to recommend a good shop in the bazaar for copper silver work hell know one they all do then take a taxi to the beyazit gate therell be a lot of gold shops just inside keep going straight ill find you she was quiet for a second im going shopping leon for an urn for franks ashes be sure to tell the concierge that theyll ask him what you wanted my god she said her voice squeamish i know but its something youll have to do sooner or later they might even give you a little room out of respect i doubt it but theyll still want to keep their distance and its something you wouldnt be doing with me no so they wont be looking for that give me fifteen minutes then go downstairs why the bazaar why not somewhere over here because its easy to get lost in the bazaar everybody does so they wont be surprised when they lose you leon waited in a stall a few doors down from the entrance back half turned fingering necklaces while the salesman scurried around the shop bringing out more trays every inch of wall space seemed to be covered in gold dangling and shiny who bought it all the line of stores stretched for at least a mile all crammed with jewelry shimmering with reflected light in a few hours the market would be locked only night guards in the empty shuttered streets but now it hummed the noise of a thousand voices rising up to the domed ceiling when kay came through the gate she stopped for a minute dazzled trying to get her bearings a winter coat and hat the western clothes like a magnet to the shopkeepers inviting her in as she walked down the passage leon waited a few more minutes watching the people the salesman brought out another tray and then leon spotted him a man in a suit who could have passed for a relative of gülün maybe actually was stubbly cheeks eyes fixed ahead keeping kay in sight two more minutes no one else not a team leon left the shop and began to follow tracking kays hat in the stream of bobbing heads she passed feraceciler sok the first big cross street and then began to loiter gazing into shop windows waiting for leon to appear the policeman stopped too turning away slightly leon went over to one of the tea boys who darted through the market like mice appearing around corners with trays and vanishing behind rolled carpets he handed him a coin the woman in the hat say my name and lead her toward the iç bedesten then take the first left the coin disappearing into a pocket the boy gone almost as quickly something out of ali baba leon watched as the boy approached kay just brushing by but she turned after him not looking back the policeman picked up speed leon took a parallel street circling in this part of the bazaar the streets were a grid easier to plot curios and souvenirs now inlaid boxes he stepped into a doorway just after where she would turn and handed the shopkeeper a tenlira note then stood to the side a screen nearby any minute around the corner kay she started for the shop dont come in just look at the window hell have to stop she raised her eyebrows who youll see him he looks like gülün probably a cousin go up two streets then left and duck into a stall wait till he passes and then come out now hell be looking for you when he sees that youre behind him hell have to keep going stay behind let him get a street or two ahead then take a quick right therell be a lot of leather shops bags and things just follow the street ready she began walking leon stood out of sight until the policeman went by the shopkeeper looked at leon efendi her husband leon said the shopkeepers eyes widened an unexpected drama leon handed him another note if he comes back you never saw her the shopkeeper dipped his head the note gone as quickly as the boys coin leon hurried toward the narrower streets with leather and clothing everything hanging on hooks in tiers almost blocking the light where hed told her to turn a few minutes people offering him wallets and belts then finally a glimpse of the hat this way did he turn back i dont know flushed slightly out of breath they took the curved passage back toward beyazit gate a circling the policeman wouldnt expect as he wandered through the aisles looking for her outside they crossed into the square scattering pigeons and went through a plain door that opened onto a cloistered courtyard with a marble fountain in the middle whats this a library he probably doesnt even know its here it was an inn for the mosque see the doors thats where people stayed kay exhaled as if shed been holding her breath can we sit down its okay leon led them to one of the low walls surrounding the courtyard after the bazaar the air seemed eerily quiet the only sounds a few birds drinking at the fountain pool the last of the afternoon sun he thought of the crowded benches on the victorei deck people wrapped in blankets we dont have much time will he keep looking for a while all this just to see you its serious now isnt it how long can you do this before she looked at him i had the feeling at the hotel i might not see you again no he said brushing her cheek with his hand whats wrong you look she smiled a little makeup never works when you need it does it am i all blotchy he shook his head dont be nice she said taking out a handkerchief im probably a mess well its the right day for it its not as if i didnt have feelings for him i mean i married him she blew her nose nodding to some question and cheated on him not a very good wife was i so maybe its not just for him maybe me everything she wiped the corners of her eyes you think crazy things she took a minute looking over toward the market what happens when i dont bring an urn back you were overwhelmed you couldnt go through with it not today she looked down another one of your stories you like it she said cocking her head back to the bazaar the cat and mouse its easy for you losing someones easy the rest isnt but you enjoy it sometimes he said turning it over its seeing if you can stay up there he pointed to some imaginary balance beam not fall anyway he said taking a breath we cant stay long one more minute she touched his hand then moved hers back its like a church this place if somebody sees she twisted her ring are you leaving soon tonight what i was thinking he waited at the hotel the police maybe you cant come back she looked up take me with you what just as we are you dont have to the way we are i dont care what people think i cant cant why where are you going at least tell me that i wont get in the way if they follow and youre good at this i cant he said stopping her its not just me he paused youre safer here safer she said ill be back in a day or two maybe or maybe shot like frank in your cat and mouse and then whats my life kay well its possible isnt it so tell me what to say when they ask he went to ankara why i dont know and make up a story for me what happens if you dont come back i will and then what then well see she was quiet for a minute well see its not much is it she stood up folding her arms across her chest my god look at me ready to run away with you where i dont know like criminals and frank not even buried what kind of woman does that she held up a hand before he could answer i know you cant so now what buy an urn when im feeling better she pulled a piece of paper from her pocket the concierge said this one was the best she looked over at him what did you mean its not just you going somebodys going with me who kay and thats why its not safe he nodded then looked at his watch we have to go walk away she said quietly all day at the hotel i kept thinking what if its the end she looked at him as if she were trying to memorize his face like frank it could be the same work secrets and now hes dead for what his country she turned her head whatever it was to make someone do that its funny what people will do for their country things they would never do for each other so what if its like frank hes not coming back im not dead she walked over to him putting a hand on his shoulder no but maybe not coming back either she took a breath so when i leave here she left it dangling go out past the mosque to the taxi rank if he spots you hell just think you wandered off and hes picked up the trail again ill wait here go back to the pera talk to the concierge tell him i couldnt go through with it and whats the rest she said idly dinner in my room or downstairs with a book so they can see im not waiting he looked at her never mind its all right she said moving her hand up to the side of his head a tentative touch then brushing his hair back i just wanted to see you in case do you know the awful thing im not sorry isnt that terrible her voice breaking a little at the end to say that today leon got up taking her by the arms no kay said patting his chest no goodbyes just come back he nodded and then well see she said then suddenly reached forward putting her arms around him head next to his but for a second nobodys here he felt her tight against him hands tugging at his coat just for a second she said the creak of an opening door oh she said startled breaking away a woman in a headscarf looking like a nun in the cloistered walkway kay stepped back her eyes anxious as if a platform whistle had just blown then lowered her head and started walking to the door leaving it ajar for the turkish woman only a quick last glance over her shoulder then into the square where gülüns cousin would see her willing to run away with him and then whats my life her hands pulling at him for a minute he stood still a ticking in his ear feeling suspended up on a high rope with his arms held out too far away from the edge now to go back everyone below looking up waiting marina didnt want any more money just get him out of here before its trouble alexei had gone into the bedroom to get his duffel packed and ready everything as trim as his short hair youre so rich leon said no but youre nice to me not so many are so maybe its thanks for that nice leon said thinking of sweaty sheets call it what you like you like to think the best not like him he thinks the worst of everybody maybe hes right she looked up at him hell be trouble for you someone like that he talk to you he didnt have to you take someones clothes off you know things he smiled nodding at her kimono do you ever get dressed a life in silk lying on beds a painters idea of a harem yes like a lady very nice shoes hat sometimes like a turkish lady with the scarf my old friend kemal comes with me an escort so i can go places like where leon said intrigued here and there shops youre surprised you think i live in bed waiting for you no yes youre surprised what would you do if you saw me on the rue de pera walking there in a dress say hello no youre with somebody maybe or you dont see you know why because you dont expect it to see me you know what i do sometimes kemal takes me to the bar at the park and i see men who come here and them they dont see its me they dont expect to see me there so they dont maybe they think youre working alexei said coming out of the bedroom the hotel bar ha marina said annoyed you think i go looking for business not in the streets alexei said volleying not yet go fuck yourself thats the language you use with him she said to leon what he understands she turned to alexei so youre ready what are you waiting for thanks for everything alexei said playing with her she waved this off i dont do it for you alexei bowed so now ive met one with the heart of gold she said something in armenian that leon couldnt understand presumably a curse spitting it out i hope they catch you you deserve it alexei moved closer to her putting his hand to her throat so quickly it seemed to have already been there just dont help them hey leon said surprised you wouldnt do that would you alexei said waiting for her to shake her head before he took his hand away pig for christs sake leon started dont waste your breath shed sell you out too how much i wonder he said looking at her for you she said not much all right leon said ending it you ready alexei made a thankyou flourish to marina and went out to the hall what was that all about leon said to her he wanted it for free after he ran out of money for a man like that dont think the best of that one get rid of him but you wouldnt take the money before to hide him then its a crime they ask i say no i never helped just money to fuck me how did i know who he was she looked up i still dont leon leaned over and kissed her on the cheek thank you she flinched dont think the best of me either i took what he paid go she said shooing him out before the landlord she paused maybe youll come see me again like before when its over with him ill buy you a drink at the park she raised an eyebrow then smiled go she said closing the door they walked single file down the stairs just the sound of their footsteps and the faint dripping of water the familiar cat smell at the door leon looked out then steered alexei left around the hill that was a hell of a thing to say leon said a girl saves your life shes a whore and what does that make you alexei said nothing following him they passed the dervish lodge then the church where tommys funeral service had been kay sitting ahead face hidden by her hat so this business with your mr king who kept the money hes just a thief thats your thinking not with the russians no so its safe the consulate not exactly somebody was shot there last night alexei stopped for a second looking over at him one of your people from ankara head of the soviet desk but hes killed in istanbul so there is someone here he said beginning to walk again thinking but why the embassy yes theyd want someone inside but a consulate passports you can pick up a lot here tommys group was here dont forget alexei shook his head the war it was different the cable traffics in ankara thats where you want your people how many can they have americans are hard for them to recruit usually locals so maybe a local here too saydam the guard gone for a smoke or maybe to make you look here not in ankara your man was here alone no one came with him just his wife a few days ago alexei grunted his wife well not her no its something a romanian might think of not the russians not melnikov theyre not all melnikovs yes all they think with this alexei said making a fist then smiled a little amusing himself but think how perfect for her to have the russian desk in bed lying side by side on pillows some other face not hers but they must have these hills alexei said a little winded they had come downslope from galatasaray but were now climbing again past the italian hospital and the police they think i did it you alexei said surprised why i was there leon paused why not say even gülün knew im sleeping with his wife alexei peered at him at a loss then grunted you should have told me before now theyre after both of us thats twice the risk only for a few hours then were gone and where now another flat no i figured you could use a bath after all the exercise they stopped at a wooden door with a list of services posted alongside a public place alexei said you can sit here for hours and nobodyll even notice you just a man in a towel the hamam wasnt old probably turn of the century but it had been modeled on the historic baths in sultanahmet the entrance hall a large rotunda with a fountain where men sat drinking tea cooling off from the steam in the hot room they were given towels and slippers and changed in the cubicles surrounding the courtyard then went through the temperate room alexei adjusting the towel around his waist a tight wiry body with dark scars on one side that leon realized might be bullet wounds little flecks elsewhere knives nine lives eight of them gone they walked into a wall of steam in the hararet and for a second leons eyes started to water stung by the heat he could feel the wet air pushing down into his lungs a searing like standing too close to a fire a man was being kneaded by a masseur on the marble slab in the center and attendants were scraping a few others with coarse mitts but everyone else just sat lazing on benches with their eyes half closed like lizards in the sun they took in leon and alexei then went back to the heat chests glistening leon looked around the room once scanning faces indistinct in the steam then joined alexei leaning back against the wall of course sometimes its a matter of opportunity alexei said brooding back in the earlier conversation you dont have to plant someonehes already there he was quiet for a minute and then he has to protect himself youre lucky you think so leon said offhand youre looking for him yes he must know but he shoots the russian desk first maybe frank found him i havent thats not why im there remember im supposed to find who killed tommy im looking for myself tangling again like the calligraphy in the tiles around them alexei smiled an interesting board but how do you win it youre going to win it for me i just have to get you out alive with the russians looking now police not just me anymore you easier to identify he closed his eyes again someone who sleeps with the wife he shook his head then sighed out loud giving in to the steam it feels good the heat women turkish baths i should have come to the americans sooner but you were busy alexei lifted an eyelid thats right busy he wiped sweat off his upper arms then got up and went over to the basin pouring water over his head and chest the man getting the massage moaned everything hidden in the steam the street outside miles away how did you get that leon said nodding to the scar on alexeis side he sat down again stalingrad i was lucky if it had been deepersepsis no field hospital you died right away or you died later you were at the front i thought intelligence antonescu liked to put us in the forward units to make sure no deserters no defeatist talk the russians did it too hed risk intelligence officers that way think how many he killed himself why not let the russians do it he wiped his forehead youre surprised its what they are these men look at stalin never safe sooner or later everybody goes so the trick is to go later if youre lucky leon said imagining the field littered with bodies you were hit twice this alexei said pointing to the smaller scar no this was a woman in bucharest you dont expect it from a woman she shot you alexei shrugged she was a little bit he touched his temple again lucky not a good shot and the others leon said pointing curious now shrapnel also stalingrad he ran his hand down his side like a war map no except for ilena a crazy temper but a good fuck like that one back there he said jerking his head toward marinas flat well you know she said youre a regular a good fuck something between them easy lockerroom friends leon said nothing but these days alexei said you never know if its your last so theyre all good the russian desk hows that leon stood up and went over to the basin sluicing himself why couldnt everything wash off like sweat selling jews for antonescu sending them back străuleşti fucking marina theyre all good now he rubbed a soapy mitt over his chest scouring it as if he were wiping away alexeis hands touching him the same woman more water when he turned back the whole room seemed to be behind gauze not quite clear bodies shiny with fat hairy leaning over with their heads down or sitting back faces raised to the starshaped pinpricks of light coming through the dome the fleshy democracy of the baths everyone just a body who were they all shopkeepers and rug salesmen maybe a policeman off duty a dockworker not real in the steam bodies to hide behind he looked at alexei smaller somehow in his towel paler the war map of scars just little bruises from this distance skin beginning to sag the inevitable gravity before leon had seen a fighter in military trim but now the body was older as slack as all the others the same tired face leon had seen when they walked out of laleli you never know if its your last not a monster a man in a towel both you werent in the war alexei said when leon came back his voice drowsy no my eyes in romania they take you even if youre blind i tried i was too old for the draft but i went anyway and i couldnt get past the eye test all theyd have let me do was hold down a desk somewhere i was already doing that here explaining himself some point of honor and thats why you started doing this work i guess it came up thats all no eye tests for this and now its over the war you want to fight the next one he snorted a soldier you think you know what its like what you have to do he went quiet for a minute private the first time its difficult but then its easier what to kill somebody no betray them you think you cant do it it closes up he put his hand to his throat a choking gesture thats how it was for me anyway i couldnt breathe but you have to do it so you do and after that its easier youll see he said facing leon alexei turned back closing his eyes again drifting with the steam do you know what i remember about the war the cold no mountains there just wind i thought i would never be warm again and now look sweating maybe theyll send me somewhere where its warm when theyre finished with me we never discussed that what should i ask for where is it warm in america i dont know florida florida alexei said pronouncing it in syllables just go wherever they can hide you you think its like trotsky im so valuable the russians send out assassins he shook his head once i say what i have to say they dont care he paused neither will you he stretched a little enjoying the heat they have nice women in florida jews alexei opened his eyes looking over at him always that with you he leaned back again ilena was a jew leon was quiet trying to imagine what the story had been what shed known or maybe it had been before străuleşti a lovers quarrel angry enough to shoot and then miss his sixth life or seventh youve paid for a massage alexei said looking toward the masseur its okay leon nodded whats the word uğma but just lie down hell know leon watched alexei flop on the warm marble the tellak kneeling over him hands already working his shoulders a fullbody massage lying out there in plain view he squinted at the other men in the room none of whom were watching lost in their own worlds moustaches and stomach folds bodies the womens baths would be the same not corots pink nymphs but drooping breasts and doughy thighs little boys pretending not to look as towels came unwrapped kay naked in the hotel window selfconscious an alabaster light then he saw her again in bed with frank just talking murmuring in bed with the russian desk think how perfect well not the wife but what if frank had called the hotel you dont expect it from a woman standing behind him at his desk an easy shot facing down gülün he was with me each others alibi but leon hadnt been not all the time not while hed been in tommys office the unreliable saydam gone somewhere else somebody in ankara it was frank who thought there was a plant in the consulate who had killed tommy except he hadnt leon had his mind idling in whatifs began racing now everything she had ever said to him hating secrets his tell me or maybe something simpler like ilena picking up a gun in a bucharest hotel doing it for love not missing this time coming up to him at lilys do something for me what did he know about her really everything his mind stopped so still now that he felt the trickle of sweat on his chest and then he felt it on hers brushing it with the back of his hand how do you know because you do the rest all steam and circles fever dreams not like alexei suspecting everybody the only life he knew how long did it take for that to happen you think you know what its like in bed now his skin still slick but not with kay marina alexei on her other side leaning over winking at him sharing he opened his eyes panting not sure where he was smoke no steam hot in his throat as he gulped it down the bath awake again but the room still insubstantial wispy how long had he been out crazy dreams with alexei in them now in his head but not here he looked again at the marble slab empty a turk being pummeled near the edge he stood up dont panic he wouldnt have been taken without a fight some noisy struggle unless he had walked out by himself waiting for his babysitter to nod off a plan of his own leon went over to the basin and poured water over his head as if he still hadnt completely awakened dont draw attention he looked around the room the same interchangeable bodies no alexei not on the benches in the alcoves gone check the cubicles see if his clothes are still here he hurried through the temperate room back to the big rotunda and stopped short alexei was drinking tea by the fountain a new towel wrapped around his waist leon breathed out a relief that was almost a physical shudder whats wrong alexei said i didnt know where you were leon said hearing himself a parent whod lost a child in a store you should drink some tea replace the sweat unconcerned only leon rattled aware suddenly that alexei had become his lifeline that without him everything would go wrong he picked up a towel and started to dry himself catching a flicker of movement over alexeis shoulder a newspaper page being turned hürriyet where özmen had his column picking things up at parties then passing them on to the emniyet they said altans ears everywhere lily more than a friend like topkapi with its peepholes and listeners still the same istanbul another impatient turning the man probably looking for the sports section then the paper dropped a little and leon saw his face enver manyas not looking back at leon eyes fixed on the page maybe willing them there the paper went up again now what alexei said leon sat down keeping his voice low the man behind with the newspaper he knows us us he made your passport he had your picture his place isnt far from here maybe a coincidence just a bath alexei took this in then nodded change your clothes now the big street below there was a café on the corner wait there fifteen twenty minutes if i dont come then go the rest of the way down the hill there was a mosque ill find you there in control as if he were reading from some map in his head he may not be go change now alexei got up heading for the toilet not looking behind leon sat for a second more glancing at the row of men in towels what if there were others or none why not just walk back to enver and say hello get a reaction but the only way to really know would be to see if he followed either of them go change orders outside the air felt cold after the warm bathhouse he started down a café hed never even noticed but already on alexeis escape route like the stairs to the roof in laleli he ordered tea and sat with his back to the wall looking out the window not as many people out now just a few heading down to the trams and never the same one twice he ran his fingers nervously over the tulip glass what if alexei didnt come snatched at the door a few days ago leon had wanted him to disappear the easy solution now there was no end to it without him nothing anyone would believe the room was quiet just the click of dominoes a smokers cough he should be here by now leon imagined a gang of men leaping out of the shadows at envers nod and then there he was stopping for a second at the window to make sure leon had seen then heading down toward the bosphorus leon threw some change on the saucer its all right alexei said on the street but still moving quickly leon catching up if theyre out here they have to wait for him they wont know which one i am but if hes right behind you no he slipped in the toilet you have to be careful there the wet floor a second before this registered slipped if hes still inside then so am i theyll wait were all right you killed him leon said a tightening in his chest you dont know if i dont believe in concidences and if he was and they find him we have a head start its all you can ask for sometimes a little time he said his voice cool discussing logistics leon stopped taking a breath you killed him an echo you can get another forger anyway i knew when he followed me to the toilet you knew leon said almost spitting how could you know you didnt know but im safe so are you by the way he took a minute he knew my face leon glared at him still not moving dont worry alexei said theyll think its a fall its easy to twist your neck if you fall that way no marks the only thing that concerned him its murder leon said well selfdefense he looked at leon like your mr king a cold streak like real ice ran down leons back and meanwhile were standing here in the street by this time someone else uses the toilet and everyones shouting and you want to talk about it this is what we do where now the tram leon said a vacant sound again public a taxi might remember a tram wont keep your head down they got a seat in the back leon expected a rush of police cars and sirens heading toward the hamam but the street was quiet the water twinkling with boat lights in the distance at findikli the tram bell announced the stop and he was back in manyass shop the ping of the bell over the door the dusty pictures of boys in white circumcision cloaks careful eyes hooded a life could turn in a second just the drop of a newspaper a glimpse of a face leon stared out the window seeing alexeis head in the reflection no marks after a while they passed the swirls and arches of dolmabahçe palace not even times going to help it annas voice laughing as she said it life turned in a secondthe drop of a newspaper a hand slipping from yours in the water neither one coming back ive been thinking alexei said what if you had been alone back there leon turned to him you know washington to visit leon said not sure what was being asked ive been thinking alexei said again after its over the talks i could be useful somebody has to train people its dangerous amateurs before it was something new to you and donovan was a crazy mandropping people in no one comes back and then the civilians pay too but now theyre closing it down a few people to state thats it wars over alexei shook his head the turtle goes back in the shell no not now why do they want to talk to me and somebody will have to train you to be like you twist heads alexei caught the edge in his voice and looked at him slightly puzzled what do you think this is past yildiz then the cluster of lighted streets in ortaköy get off here leon said we have to eat something theres no food later no leon said seeing the hollow faces on the victorei waiting for rations they bought kebabs from one of the outdoor stalls and ate them in the square on the water pulling up their collars against the breeze a drink would be nice alexei said better keep moving we still have a while anyway a walk would do us good itll be cramped on the boat were going by boat alexei said jerking his head up why a boat leon looked at him surprised i dont like boats this onell get you out alexei looked away toward the water another boat at least a better night this time sharp and clear with enough moon to see the road after they left the town a stretch now without a quay just a shoulder no other pedestrians but cars seemed to stream past without noticing them then they were in arnavutköy a line of waterside yalis with elaborate fretwork and streets behind to wind through a maze for anyone following do you have a sense for it now leon said curious when anybodys tailing you no i use my eyes were all right how much longer leon checked his watch were still early he looked up one quick stop they kept to village streets then circled back to the shore promenade empty except for a few night fishermen too late now for couples in bebek they turned off just before the khedives palace familiar streets the back way to the clinic no one behind they went in through the garden gate what is this place leon raised his hand a signal to be quiet they went off the path stopping at the tree outside annas room just the usual nightlight like a hovering ghost leon started for the french windows then stopped no need to go in risk being seen he could say goodbye from here no one would hear him anyway the room utterly still a tombs quiet and suddenly disconcerted he realized that this visit all his visits were really trips to a cemetery paying respects at the grave the way they had visited his fathers flowers in hand his mother solemn leon bored and uncomfortable not knowing as he did now that she wasnt visiting his father but some younger part of herself what she used to be he stood for a second looking through the window expecting the faint light to grow dimmer until the room was finally dark instead there was a quick shaft of light as the door opened a nurse coming to check behind her a man sitting on a chair in the hall reading a newspaper another manyas leon ducked behind the tree keeping watch anywhere he might go even here gülün taking no chances kays hotel cihangir hunting for him but not in the garden or he wouldnt still be standing here a car out front the nurse smoothed out the blanket and left taking the light with her he motioned alexei toward the gate police he whispered careful a followme gesture down the backstreets to the shore road still too early for the boat the quay wide open anybody waiting visible in the moonlight they passed the steep road up to robert college and he thought of tommy barreling down sure how things would go they went into the café where hed called tommy the first rainy night the same old men smoking come to the park mehmets martinis finally a drink alexei said when his raki arrived he took a sip so what was that place where my wife is alexei peered at him but said nothing a clinic another look oddly sympathetic so the goodbyes he poured more water into the glass watching the liquid cloud leon shook his head shes in a coma not quite the truth but just as good alexei looked closely at him again and police there its no good you doing something like that save the goodbyes for later when were gone he sipped more raki so now its the russian desk leon looked away not answering the russian desk the pale light of the window behind her something to think about another chancemaybe the only one hed have but what kind of life once they left the hotel room he glanced toward the wall looking for the clock the ticking but it seemed to be in his head there was no time in a café hours to dawdle the ferry to the islands from eminönü used to take an hour and a half two to reach büyükada the fisherman wouldnt be any faster at least an hour to get to eminönü another hour as a cushion for any delays they should be all right but they had to bethe victorei wouldnt wait a promise how fast was the fishermans boat if they were early idling off büyükada wouldnt be a problem this time of year the crowded port nearly empty hotels shuttered in the summer it was different carriages and donkey rides and hikes to sandy coves in the south theyd rented the house for august on a spur off the road up to the monastery looking down through the woods to the sea at night the pines and wild roses and jasmine carried on the breeze before the war youre very quiet alexei said im thinking alexei grunted i dont think you were right about manyas leon said to say something who the forger take that chance with your life not mine alexei said he signaled for another raki anyway what does it matter a man in that work something always happens leon looked at him not saying anything but it must have mattered to him once before life had become this cheap before the stacks of corpses hed had a wife parents now dreaming of florida the ticking was louder intolerable maybe the boat had come early he pushed back his chair its time alexei said then tossed back the rest of the raki wincing they crossed the road onto the quay the empty space outlined in police chalk marks in his mindrumeli hisari looming up ahead alexeis duffel being lifted out tommys car squealing in mihai and leon pinned flat on the pavement now they stood waiting quietly near the edge the water slapping looking at a single light coming toward them out of the dark almost there they were on board before the fisherman could even tie up its the same man alexei said to leon he works for me a private deal immediately discussed the princes islands were too far its longer than you said no it isnt leon said his mouth thin frustrated all of them still at the quay efendi beginning to haggle how much alexei stepped between them derhal he said almost growling the fisherman stepped back cowering then retreated to the motor leon glanced over alexeis eyes steady capable of anything they stayed close to the shore away from the cargo ships in the channel retracing the walk from ortaköy the bosphorus was calm except for the wakes of the freighters and they made good time passing the charred ruins of the çirağan where abdul aziz had committed suicide if he had and murat v had been locked away the sort of things georg used to tell them when there was a break in the cargo traffic they crossed over to the asian side heading past leanders tower the lights of the city around them now on all sides only the usual water traffic ferries and fishermen no police boats haydarpaşas teutonic facade where the trains left for ankara nobody else came with him just the wife kadiköy fenerbahçe then the open sea to the islands shore lights fewer now the water dark alexei kept hold of the side looking front and back his knit hat over his ears against the chill when they pulled farther away from the shore he went over to the steering cabin and grabbed the signal light the fisherman yelled at him in turkish what are you doing leon said he needs that to signal the ship not yet he put it between his feet when he does its here another wail from the fisherman leon mollifying him for christs sake he said to alexei how well do you know him hes working for us he cheats at cards a long rainy night in some black sea hut hurricane lamps so now what do we break his neck alexei ignored this focusing on the narrow funnel of light in front finally some window lights in the distance is that it not yet the boat chugged past kinaliada then headed south between heybeliada and büyükada finally idling near the lower tip of the island where the victorei would pass tell him to kill the light alexei said still alert looking in both directions no houses behind them the empty stretch of the marmara in front city lights far in the distance the boat hidden now in its own patch of watery darkness rocking slightly with the waves how much longer alexei said the bridge opens around three depends where they are in line a convoy pouring out of the golden horn most of them hugging the european shore then sailing straight for the dardanelles only the victorei veering off toward the islands another fishing boat leon shook his head a freighter was anyway romanian and now now its taking jews to palestine alexei looked at him for a long minute his face moving from one thought to another were going to palestine cyprus theyre dropping us jews to palestine alexei said turning it over no one will think of that raising his eyes a compliment no leon said feeling pleased then embarrassed to have felt it alexei snorted a kind of laugh with himself jews to palestine the boat dipped then rocked harder the wind picking up alexei clutched the gunwale whats wrong leon said nothing i dont like boats i told you almost a child pouting vulnerable something leon hadnt seen before and then they waited the fisherman had cut the motor so there were only sounds of buoys now soft tinkles and the wind blowing things on deck the byzantines had exiled people here where they couldnt be heard he thought of the whistles and screams when annas boat had gone down sirens on the shore his own rescue boat blowing horns the air shaking with noise closer to the city just past yaniköy which should have made it easier and in the end didnt matter children without life jackets panicking taking water every time they shouted clutching an endless night a few even saved the others slipping under so close they could see the shore and then the awful questions afterhad the harbor boats come fast enough had they wanted to come at all there the fisherman said leon looked out a bright beam slicing across the water then the glow of the bridge followed by a thin string of mast lights hung like flags the portholes dark the boat moving like a shadow no faster than a ferry leon imagined the engine below creaking and hissing but turning getting them there a miracle bought with tommys money the fisherman waited a few more minutes then started up the boat signaling the ship the waves were rougher now alexei pale from the water the victoreis deck seemed stories high efendi the fisherman said to leon rubbing his fingers leon gave him the envelope with the money watching him tuck it into his shirt youre not going to count it i trust you the fisherman said smiling and now its quick here he handed leon a grappling hook they pulled alongside a rope ladder was dropped and leon tried to hook it bringing the fishing boat up against the victorei and holding it steady in the rocking waves leon mihais voice through a primitive megaphone shining down a light leon waved can you reach he said to alexei ive got it hooked jump for it alexei looked at him whiter ill be right behind some trouble the fisherman said a sneer he couldnt resist how do you say go to hell alexei asked leon cehennèm ol leon said alexei cocked his head to it not repeating it and lunged for the bottom rung grunting as he pulled himself up grabbing on to the next another then finally a foothold lets go mihai shouted from on deck the engines had idled but the ship was still moving drifting pulling the fishing boat with it hold this leon said handing the fisherman the hook go back tonight not a word right and thanks the fisherman looked away embarrassed leon lifted his arms not quite high enough steady he said to the fisherman then bounced grabbing the step slick with cold water his arms straining as he pulled himself up to the next and again until his feet could take his weight you okay he shouted up at alexei who didnt answer clinging to the ladder the fishing boat slid out from the hull then sputtered and roared away while they were still on the ladder nothing below now but water mihai and another man hauled them over the top alexei landing like a flapping fish winded trying to pick himself up tell david to start mihai said then turned to leon you made it not looking at alexei someone not there any trouble leon said after the dollars no a leap into health now its just the engine to worry about but at least were moving büyükada however seemed just where it had been any change of speed unnoticeable a long night over here mihai said its out of the wind looking at alexei now his face deliberately blank indicating a short bench near the bridge where is everybody leon said expecting to see people lining the rails jubilant sleeping if they can or hunkering in blankets on benches the way theyd been before indifferent to istanbul saving their strength heads drooping on shoulders next to them the few still awake staring at alexei and leon wondering but more interested in the uneven throb of the engines below thank you alexei said thank him mihai said brusque theres a boat david said coming out of the bridge signaling no maybe putting into büyükada but were just sitting here go see whats happening down below will you wed make better time rowing a sudden wave rolled the boat pitching mihai forward onto alexeis chest he pulled away right back he said to leon stay over there your romanian friend alexei said you never saw him i never see anybody he grabbed on to a rail the boat rocking again with a wave its getting rough they sat in the niche by the bridge hes the one told you about străuleşti leon nodded so why does he take me i paid him that one no something else maybe its a trap hes not doing it for you get some sleep in this he opened his hand to the wind the boat had begun to creak one of the blanketed figures shuffled over a man with a shaved head and said something in what leon took to be polish answered with an idontunderstand hands up another language probably yiddish finally german who are you that they stop the ship for you nobody leon said we were late no people are late on the dock not out here haganah youre haganah yes what else an honor he said extending his hand alexei shook it leon watching his eyes fixed on the numbers inked on the mans forearm the man made a lipssealed gesture and started back to his bench a sudden thud below then a grinding the whole frame of the boat shuddering but moving again the few lights on büyükada beginning to recede maybe your friends pushing alexei said sitting back enjoying himself the movement of the boat like a promise in a few hours the aegean you never saw him before you understand i heard you the first time he opened his eyes why hes not part of this alexei looked at him then around the deck the glance its own comment the boat lurched again faint noises came from below groans there would be crammed bunks slop buckets spilling over a woman staggered out of the door to the hold hand over her mouth and ran to the railing stretching as far as she could hoping her vomit would clear the side disappear in the water a painful heaving loud the people on the bench unconsciously moving away from her sputtering then more retching only thin streams of bile now the first of many if the water stayed rough she wiped her mouth with the end of her shawl eyes toward the benches too sick to apologize her breath taken now by a hacking cough another woman got up and held her by the shoulders steadying her until the coughing stopped some words probably a thankyou carried off by the wind she nodded gulping air then started back looking over toward leon and alexei a frozen moment silent too stunned to speak voi she said finally to herself trying to make sense of what she was seeing walking now in a kind of determined stagger through water a waking dream voi closer now making sure then trembling măcelar a sudden scream heads lifting on the benches călău călău people getting up her finger pointing to alexei now then a scream piercing people coming up behind her alexei said something in romanian the tone of a denial another scream her whole body vibrating about to explode măcelar the language now part of the nightmare the people on the benches not sure what was being said responding to pure sound butcher someone yelled explaining another stream of romanian the force of hysteria someone murmuring her sister in the background the finger again călău călău and then she lunged for him her fingernails on his face reaching for his eyes feral alexei grabbed her arms trying to hold her away but she had the strength of the mad scratching and pulling at him hands turned to claws alexei gasped with pain pushing himself off the bench so that she now had to reach up to rake his face still screaming the people behind her excited their shouts swirling around leons head in a frenzied babel everything happening in a second stop he grabbed her arms from behind amazed at her strength as she yanked away everyone around them shouting the whole ship seeming to have come awake the feel of people moving below ruining everything alexei shielded his face with his arms still trying to quiet her in romanian duck away but they were surrounded now the crowd surging like a mob stop leon tried holding her again shed break down soon the rage turning to uncontrollable sobbing draining her strength away but not before she could lunge at him one more time tearing at his skin hate spilling out of her călău executioner someone echoed translating people coming closer a wave of them then something slicing through whats going on mihai shouted breathless grabbing the hands that had broken away from leon a gush of romanian from the woman mihai looking pained a quick glance at leon people around them still shouting what is it hes a nazi how could he be a nazi a romanian nazi people coming up from below the air crackling like radio static more romanian he put them on a hook mumbling then yells the woman finally breaking down the way leon had imagined wailing that scraped on the nerves not stopping mihai whats going on here we have a right yes yes calm please you want to have a riot before were safe hes a nazi on this ship are you crazy get him to the bridge mihai hissed at leon his eyes sharp knives of reproach not so fast the man with the shaved head whats going on hes not haganah more romanian they hung them like meat someone translated a second of quiet taking this in alexei said something in romanian another denial it wasnt me leon guessed then the woman shrieked back the crowd now got louder splashes of words unsettled leon moved in front of alexei enough mihai said barking it so who is he whats going on hes cargo on this boat for cyprus not palestine cargo what do you mean cargo everybody go back sit down ill explain later the romanian woman crumpled into a heap crying pulling at the air as if she were rending it a grief too large to contain no now someone shouted its a trick maybe he warns the british not until the last jew mihai raised his hands please this is crazy talk hes a help to us a help how the woman lifted her head and yelled something at alexei a curse with a raised fist again a denial leon glanced at him what was he saying i wasnt there i wasnt part of it i couldnt stop it some version of what hed said to leon but was it true did the sister know had anybody actually seen him and for a fleeting second his stomach sinking with the dip of the boat he didnt want it to be true wanted alexei not to have been there at all wanted him at least to claim the fragile innocence of those who just let it happen mihai was speaking romanian to the woman gathering her up his arm around her go back he said to the others its a mistake the woman didnt hear this inside herself now only leon catching his eye dismayed lying for him but what was the alternative no right thing to do he steered alexei toward the bridge the crowd still milling on the deck confused how a mistake how could she make such a mistake but they had all been on the long marches crammed in refugee trucks and they knew how minds finally snapped pointing out of windows at everybody because everybody had done it mihai handed the romanian woman over to another woman then turned to the crowd go back now theres no time for this who are these men you stop the boat for them so who nobody cargo i told you the rest drowned out by the siren so loud it cut through everythingthe people shouting on deck the lumbering motor tarps flapping in the winda giant whoop meant to startle a loudspeaker rasped something garbled in turkish the crowd rushed over to the railing a police boat approaching the side signal lamps flashing searchlights sweeping up toward the railing we have to stop david yelled from the bridge theyre signaling mihai said nothing looking down they can shoot if we dont guns already drawn on the police boat but how did they know lurking in shadows since bebek but not in the broad stretches where they would have had to be seen the deal made with mihai no one else blood money mihai nodded to david then looked at leon face strained prepare to board the loudspeaker still in turkish so the passengers already rattled began to panic mihai held his hands up to them for quiet then leaned over the side with a megaphone what do you want were the victorei our papers are in order leon leaned forward to hear keeping his face out of the light maybe a routine check another bribe not given away after all police your new passengers a quick turn of his head mihai meeting leons eyes any police david puts you off its understood its not for you this ship endgame and for an instant leon felt an odd lightheaded release the clock stopping mihai looked from leon to alexei then turned back to the rail what new passengers we are only ourselves yes yes a cocky gravelly sound on the loudspeaker gülün all right passenger search a ladder a seconds pause gülün drawing his gun now mihai nodded to two sailors to lower the ladder then turned to the crowd again listen to me do you want to go to palestine a shocked nod of heads then do what i say go back say nothing nothing but what nothing or i leave this ship theyll take me away he waited a silence only the police boat still shrieking do you understand you saw nothing no one take her down below he said looking at the romanian woman give her something the rest tell them to stay in their bunks ladders down the sailor shouted a kind of alert theyll send us back mihai said understand people began to move and then maybe youll explain you can take over this ship any time you want mihai said then held out the megaphone the man looked down then turned and headed for the stairs anyone else mihai said leon looked at him confronting everybody spending what was left in his account no reserves good he glanced over the rail get ready he said waving people back to their places then went over to leon and alexei suddenly at a loss as if hed forgotten about them shouts from the water climbing feet banging against the hull ill take him below leon said almost afraid to look at mihai the debt too great now no people know or they will theyll kill him i dont know how long i you want to give us up leon said mihai flicked his hand brushing this off then glanced around the deck breathing in sharp intakes finally beginning to panic is there another ladder the other side alexei said thinking out loud ladder to what theres no boat to hide well hang on nobodys going to look outside the boat mihai looked up at him a kind of reluctant salute then nodded they hurried across the deck heads following them and lifted the clump of ladder and flung it over the side the anchor ropes barely noticeable in the coiled piles near the railings the lifeboats refuge for stowaways were overhead a different search area from the other side of the ship a shrill whistle some signal to the search party that triggered involuntary cries on deck the sound of roundups whistles and boots a woman started crying burying her face in a mans shoulder i wont sacrifice the ship mihai said to leon these people deserve i know just pull us back up when its over alexei said a gruff familiarity mihai stared at him more noise from the police party almost at the top like a wakeup hand on his shoulder quick he said turning putting his body between them and the police alexei looked at the rope then at leon suddenly nervous again all right leon said going first he climbed over the railing and started backing down the rope steps feeling for them his last sight of the deck a row of heads watching him one signal was all gülün would need one finger pointing but the row didnt move huddling into itself turning to mihai now leon looked up nobody come on then a foot another working their way down until alexeis head was below the rail too both of them dangling on the side of the ship the wind slapping the bottom of the ladder against the hull leon kept going past a row of portholes his weight steadying the ladder if this were a building he could make his way along the ledge to the window climb in out of sight to people whod be waiting for them the story everywhere now some rag in the mouth to muffle the sound everything quick no noise then the splash of water maybe not even heard on deck another wave where are you going alexei whispered his hands gripping the rope out of sight where in the water a little further okay here hang on the rough sisal began cutting into his palms he shifted more weight to his legs feeling the wind press into his back he could hear loud voices up top gülün bullying eyes peering at him from under cap brims and shawls just one but no one spoke do you want to go to palestine worth everything a wave broke against the hull sending jets of spray upward wetting the bottom of his pants spattering drops on his neck hands a sudden light from the porthole to his right maybe a flashlight going through the hold seeing the bodies stacked in bunks a photograph from the war would the police ask them to get down look behind everyone or hurry through anxious to get out of the smell before any hands could touch them a baby started crying wakened by the light another wave sprayed icy water as the ship listed slightly the rope ladder swung out from the hull leon looked down a black void then braced for the swing back making his shoes take most of the impact how long could they hang here wet hands clutching rope he shifted his weight again feeling the strain in his arms not thinking anymore not having to decide anything just holding on he had even stopped wondering what they were saying on deck what mihai would do if gülün ordered the ship to turn around but why would he unless he was sure leon was on board not any ship this ship he thought of the hamam the tram ride but no one had been hovering behind not even in his imagining what had he said to kay more voices closer to this side of the ship at first he felt it was more spray from below and then he felt the drops on his head random but steady when he raised his face there were more coming faster he flattened himself against the rope hunching his shoulders to keep the rain from dripping down his collar cold seeping into his wool jacket he heard alexei swear to himself but maybe it would make gülün hurry decide his tip had been wrong if it had been a tip more flashlights sweeping through the sleeping quarters bunk by bunk at least they were dry there not soaking on deck like the others another whistle signal maybe calling the searchers back up top how long before they gave up you couldnt get everybody in a roundup people hid beneath floorboards squeezed behind stairs the wind came up again blowing rain against the ship and leon shivered his hands stiff with cold clothes heavier pulling at him then a loud crash a lifeboat being lowered off its davits theres some mistake these people are refugees mihais voice closer now the search party moving to this side take the cover off a policeman not gülün the rest of his turkish cut off by a freighters moaning foghorn not too far off the rain like a light curtain making everything blurry the whistle blew again in the hold lights moving away just the deck now and the lifeboats hiding places exhausted they were going to make it hanging like bats in the dark the ship lurched in the wake of the passing freighter the ladder swinging out again farther this time then crashing back to the hull their shoes banging the metal knuckles scraping alexei moaned then another swing pushed by the momentum of the first shoes hitting the side again a light appeared on top someone shouting in turkish nothing leon heard mihai say a bright shaft pointed downward flashing then fixed on where they had just been the curve of the hull keeping them just out of its beams stopping short not strong enough to reach all the way to the water frantic shouts leon holding his breath then a sudden burst of gunfire an automatic spitting bullets stop leon flattened himself against the ladder head tucked in maybe just a warning shot wouldnt gülün want them alive a prize catch unless it didnt matter to him leon guilty gülün commended either way the hull was smooth nothing to grab on to if the ladder swung again another burst leon could actually hear the shots hitting the water feel a quick thud on the rope they must be spraying bullets into the dark just to see if there was anything to hit and there would be a matter of minutes before the ladder swung out again into the light idiot gülün screaming now the sound of running on deck passengers whimpering in the background the gunfire loud as bombs to them leons muscles locked still waiting dont shoot alive you idiot wanting his day in court after all leon glanced down black nowhere to go his body getting heavier in the wet clothes he felt more drops on his hands then looked at them not icy warm thicker he moved his head to taste blood alexei dripping on him are you hit a scratch alexei said but panting in trouble haul them up gülün was yelling get the searchlight alexei gave a stifled cry with the first jerk of the ladder no winch just hands heaving it up they felt the ladder rise then stop again bouncing one of alexeis feet slipping from the rung so that his hands took more weight leon looked up to see alexeis leg poking at the air trying to find a footing again then a new light almost blinding the police yanked the ladder again shaking it and alexeis other foot slipped his body sliding down toward leon feet dangling just his hands now one of them dripping blood there they are one of the policemen pointing his gun into the light dont shoot just get them up here help with the rope another pair of hands a heave this time with real force just as a swell rolled the boat the ladder swinging out as it rose the jerk upward finally stronger than alexeis grip his feet smashed into leons head then the rest of him a rock slide leons hands leaving the rope without his being aware of it just rolling into an endless fall alexei clinging to his jacket dragging him and then not there only the shock of icy water for a second he was too stunned by the cold to register anything almost unconscious then all the sounds came the shouts from up top the ladder flapping back the frantic splashing alexei spitting and gulping water leon moved toward him suddenly followed by the light which had picked them up alexei was flailing slapping the water at random and gasping for air i dont like boats leon swam over his clothes like weights he tried to approach from behind cup alexeis chin above water lift him up to a float something he could tow everything hed been taught boys who couldnt swim would clutch at you make things worse alexei ive got you meant to reassure take away some of the panic lie back gurgling not hearing just seeing leon and grabbing on a desperate clinging his head slipping under pushing himself back up again on leons shoulders wheezing for air more shouts from the ship the thwack of a life preserver hitting the water somewhere near then nothing the muffled quiet of underwater leon sinking under alexeis weight he forced himself up bobbing let go ive got you well both then under again swallowing water this time alexei on top trying to climb on him a human raft leon tried to move away but only managed to wriggle in place as if he were wrapped in chains and now he was sinking again and he realized an ice pick of fear that he could die saving alexei a man whod do anything to survive leon nothing more than driftwood something handy his lungs began to burn churning the same used air and for a crazy second he thought of where he was that he might drown somewhere in the view from cihangir alexeis hands still gripping his coat taking him down too a hint of lightheadedness no time now get up he turned his head his mouth near alexeis hand and bit down sharply only a second of release before the hand started clutching again but enough for leon to duck away then surface sucking air alexei still grasping his other hand he looked over their eyes locking alexeis glassy with terror and leon saw what alexei must have seen in the others his victims the terrible last moment when they knew they would die a kind of animal bewilderment now his turn all leon had to do was let go of his hand not responsible for any of it an easier death except for the frantic eyes how the child must have looked slipping from annas grasp and what if she had held on pushed under by the thrashing the child not even aware that anna was taking water sinking he let his hand grow slack making alexei struggle to keep it and he saw how it must have been even the same dark water anna letting the hand slide away to save herself not knowing the child would take her under either way alexei made a noise flinging his mouth back for air arms flailing again then his head dipped as if he were being pulled under and leon imagined hands at his feet străuleşti hands clawing at his cuffs proof of the rightness of things except things were never made right they passed thats all he swam closer pulling alexei up then holding him under the chin keeping his head above water listen to me his voice rough hoarse alexeis hands came up again grasping leon smashed down on them pulling free then caught alexeis coat as he was going under twisting his body around so that leon was behind as he yanked him back up hand under his chin again a violent sputtering fucking listen to me he said into alexeis ear ive got you do you understand youll be okay if you do what i say do you understand alexei nodded making an indistinct sound his breath a ragged gurgling his hands still punching the water stop leon said try to float a meaningless term alexeis legs still scissoring beneath them more sounds stop or ill let you go ill let you go a muffled squeal then the feet stopped now rigid a new deadweight even heavier relax let the water do the work itll hold you another noise from alexeis throat a yelp of disbelief werent there pools in bucharest lakes in the mountains why hadnt he learned to swim he tried to imagine alexei as a boy a kid in the streets but no picture would come and he realized that he knew nothing about his life that he was just a stranger whod dropped in at the end of it like the life preserver thrown from the deck im here he said alexei stopped thrashing so quiet that for a second leon thought he was gone but that would have made him stiffen and leon felt instead his body growing limp a giving in he moved closer the back of alexeis head resting against his chest another breath not as ragged his body looser moving with leons as a wave lifted them entirely in his hands no escape hatch to the roof gun drawn at the door only leon leon looked up past the misty halo of the bright light the deck railing crowded now people yelling and waving their hands seeing a different drama a sea rescue mihai was motioning him left he glanced overthe life preserver bright white against the water he paddled toward it its okay ive got you afraid any movement would startle him now on the deck there were more whistles instructions a new rumbling from the passengers leon heard gülün ordering the police boat to pick them up in a few minutes theyd be caught netted up like fish saving alexei for what saving himself to be a murderer the running itself evidence against him he grabbed on to the bobbing ring here hold this he said but alexei didnt reach for it safe where he was and leon saw that his arm was bloody stanched only a little by the cold water and now starting again to leak through his matted sleeve he thought for a moment of putting the ring over alexeis head but hed never manage to work his arms through not the bleeding one so he just hung on keeping alexeis head up against him theyre coming alexei said yes so we didnt make it were alive for the russians alexei said his voice low hang on mihai yelled through the megaphone around him people were looking down through the light rain leons arm began to cramp on the lifesaver feeling the cold think what to say to gülün a minute later he could hear the boat coming around the bow another light shining toward them alexei turned his head theyre coming he said just hold on leon said missing his tone let me go and then before leon could react he twisted his head free of leons hand and dropped away pushing against leons chest leon stared for a second at the water the empty space where alexei had been before he realized what had happened no he said as if they were having a conversation then no again this time to himself he ducked under the lights so bright above the surface stopped after a few inches everything black but he couldnt have gone far a few feet leon dived down then started back up where alexei had gone under reaching for anything hands stretched out water running through his fingers he broke the surface gulping nothing leon mihai shouting from above he dived again deeper this time hearing a motor now the boat closer he moved his arms sweeping across the space in front of him water then a piece of something cloth not seaweed he snatched at it using it to pull himself closer then brought up his other hand more cloth a jacket holding it now with both hands kicking pushing them up when they hit the air alexei started coughing too weak now to fight back when leon grabbed his collar from behind the boat light swept in an arc followed by a sudden shot leon not sure whether to duck again a helpless target stay where you are a loudspeaker said in turkish evidently a warning shot fired when they disappeared more yelling from the deck let me go alexei said barely audible hang on ive got you leon said ignoring this holding him up alexei stared at him eyes suddenly wide undefended taking him in as if leon were the last thing he would ever see why almost there leon said reaching for the lifesaver alexei coughed choking on some water im tired almost there leon said again no tired its enough leon glanced over alexeis head had begun to loll how much blood had he lost not yet he said i need you alexei looking up at this a rope hit the water near them more lights grab hold leon looked at it winded still holding alexei a second to get his strength back move another shot fired into the air like a whip cracking then sharp cries from the ship oddly like dogs tell him to go to hell alexei said barely lifting his head you cant stay in the water well freeze i dont feel it thats worse you should yes alexei said looking up ah he took leons hand smiling faintly an awkward clutching not a shake not expecting to be towed by it just making contact leon looked back surprised a camera shutter opening seeing him now the kid in the street just a glimpse before he could run away again all right alexei said nodding his eyes going to the boat its your move his voice faint running out of air part of the quiet that was filling leons head the clock finally stopping at an end gülüns boat was rocking nearby the motor still churning policemen shouting and pointing to the rope all distant noises background sounds where the ticking had been there was no next move just an automatic reach for the lifesaver then a hook to drag them in check and the victorei in gülüns hands all the anxious people on deck pawns again his idea somewhere theyd never look take the rope leon saw it floating on the surface a lifeline a noose your move the boat ran its siren again a screaming alarm loud enough to fill the quiet in leons head a rush of prickly feeling in his numb hands no not the siren a different horn behind them a new light flashing over the water leon glanced around trying to make out the shape past the blinding light smaller than the police boat gunwales of polished wood the kind of boat you saw tied up in front of a yali fast just for the pleasure of it bearing down on them now with another siren whoop a shot was fired from the police boat presumably into the air like a sentry a loudspeaker crackled hold your fire idiot the speedboat on them now fishtailing to idle next to gülüns like a skier at the end of a run are you crazy shooting at me altan furious there was an exchange leon couldnt hear over the sputtering engines then another ring thrown to him this one from the speedboat more yelling between the boats altan taking over in the lights leon could see gülüns face flustered and petulant and them he said jerking a thumb back to the victorei let them go leon said close to the side now they didnt you my friend are in no position to ask for anything altan said hold on to that get them into the boat he said to someone on board no alexei said suddenly when we see the ship leave altan blinked stopped by this dont be ridiculous youll freeze then hurry alexei said eyes level as if altan were the fisherman someone else to stare down he turned to leon its what you want yes leon nodded so altan annoyed yelled across to gülün then turned back to them he says his men are already off the boat get in then signal it to leave you came for me so theres the price or i take this one with me fierce no indication at all that it was leon supporting him a bluff as smooth as a swimmers stroke altan stood still for a second stymied they dont pay for me alexei said jaw clenched against the cold signal altan turned toward gülüns boat another exchange argumentative then a bark in altans voice giving orders gülüns shoulders rearing back then sagging leon felt the water lapping at his chin waiting feet no longer there just part of the cold a series of lights flashed up to the victorei followed by a policeman shouting into the loudspeaker a seconds lag for the translation then a roar of voices from the ship the sound of a goal scored leon saw people slapping mihai on the back as he stood frowning staring down at leon not sure what to do leon lifted his hand a little and waved him off there was a shuddering grind in the engines as the boat started up again more cheers now mihai waved back barely raising his hand still troubled leaving someone behind get in altan said nodding to the rope when it leaves alexei said still making his improbable bargain the ship had begun to slide away its wake lifting the smaller boats he turned to leon its all right leon looked at him a wordless thankyou more trying to see behind his eyes again always something for the jews with you alexei said trying to be wry closing the shutter but his voice trailed off his eyes drooping leon shook him wetting alexeis face to see the eyes open again someone trying to nap then paddled with one arm to altans life preserver a long pole with a hook snagged the ring and started pulling them then there were hands lifting them up alexei not letting go of leon until he was pried away both of them wrapped in blankets it was only then with the first hint of warmth that leon started shivering hes bleeding they shot him i can see that altan said motioning for one of his men to look at the wound he shouted something to gülün who then ordered the police boat to pull away hes disappointed altan said to leon such good work too gülün sullen was saluting behind the police boat the victorei was becoming a string of lights on the marmara tommys money and the butchers price whatever it took leon pulled the blanket tighter hes out one of altans men said holding alexei he lost a lot of blood leon said so did enver altan said smoothly looking at him he turned to the driver lets get going the boat recoiled a shotgun effect as the engine kicked in throwing everyone against the sides it swung around heading back for the bosphorus polished wood a rich mans boat what are you doing here leon said his head getting fuzzy gülün you prefer his boat he works for you altan shrugged in a way but he doesnt always know what to do no leon said making a sound too tired to talk then noticed the driver a familiar face above a serving tray lilys boat he said finally a courtesy gülün found us no i told him a good idea by the way clever a ship of jews i bribed them they had nothing to do leon started but altan waved this off how far were you going cyprus leon said voice flat altan tilted his head slightly calculating then nodded i never thought of that he said an appreciation but you knew about the ship leon said slowly trying to think what mattered not until the end how leon said dully how did you wanting to know then dreading it the fisherman altan said i paid him more a second to react then leon started to smile an istanbul answer not kay not mihai complicated betrayals just a market price hes still out the man with alexei said radio ahead to have a doctor at lilys were going to lilys leon said confused would you rather the police why lilys so we can talk talk leon said his voice distant make plans leon tried to get hold of this then let it go what you said before about enver he was i hope that wasnt you he had a family leon said nothing no it would have to be him altan said looking at alexei slumped under his blanket dont forget what kind of man he is leon looked up not understanding then its easier what what the americans want the americans leon repeated his mind wispy fogging up like the faint drizzle around them altan nodded oh leon said with a faint snort youre working for us now i work for turkey altan said his voice quick some nerve touched only turkey he relaxed his shoulders but right now im in a position tooffer a favor to friends what favor shuddering again the wind colder altan opened his hand toward alexei youre giving him to us altan caught leons expression i know so much work so clever you surprised me but its just as well he said his hand now taking in the absent victorei the night the americans dont want him in cyprus they want him in istanbul leon tried to follow a riddle he couldnt solve now but drifted into the pocket of warmth under the blanket the boat thudding against the waves making spray not resisting the pull anymore going under galata bridge he awoke with sun in his face the soft rustling of slippers in the hall quiet as brushstrokes annas room some other hospital but the comforter over him was satin and the light against the far wall glowed in colors streaming through bits of stained glass lilys one of the rooms in the old selamlik the smell of coffee brewing a shape near the door moved becoming a woman ill tell madame she said out the door before leon could answer he sat up the comforter sliding off his bare skin so that he had to catch it hold it to his chest he noticed a brazier in the corner bright with coals he moved his toes a test recovered from the icy water i thought youd sleep longer lily said followed by a woman carrying a pile of clothes all dry such a time getting off the wet ones how do you feel wheres alexei the romanian eating breakfast well lunch this hour already making eyes at ayşe and last night he was half dead men cest incroyable why here i help murat sometimes she looked up at him so now thats our secret yes she nodded to the maid to put the clothes on the bed ill let you dress were in the garden room she started to go then turned smiling to herself so now i know what what youd look like in the morning i always wondered your hair the way it sticks out un petit garçon adorable i dont feel adorable ouf she said waving her hand then dropped it all business hurry murats waiting but only alexei was at the table his face bland and cheerful as if waking up in luxury was simply part of the natural order of things the next turn of the wheel what is this place he said motioning to the maid to bring more coffee a friend friends like this in istanbul imagine what america must be like almost winking enjoying himself he looked at leon youre all right what time is it alexei looked up at the sky a peasants clock almost noon they patched you up leon said nodding to the bandage on alexeis arm alexei nodded but no more tennis he said then when leon didnt react a joke a few hours earlier dragging leon into the water ah both of you good altan said coming in alexei stiffened wary everyone feeling better altan said what are we doing here alexei said recovering staying out of sight the police wont bother you now but lets not tempt them he looked at alexei you want to get to the americans in one piece and whos taking me you no leon thats his job alexei accepted this with a grunt when as soon as they get here meanwhile enjoy the day its always good after a rain isnt it everything so clear an unintended irony leons head still muddled get here from where he said the consulate no ankara altan said not elaborating then why the ship alexei said suspicious all the arrangements compromised altan said once we knew that we had to get you off leon stared at him trying to make sense of this compromised alexei said a word to the police luckily intercepted altan said almost breezy someone i think didnt like you very much no sense at all now but the ship got out leon said alarmed you didnt have it stopped later we made an agreement altan said indicating alexei he checked his wristwatch they should be there tonight in palestine leon said an odd sense of relief at least one thing gone right more likely with the british mediterranean fleet back to cyprus after all but thats not in our control is it this to alexei now its up to them alexei nodded watching him i wonder if you would do something for me while were waiting alexei said nothing you knew melnikov a prominent figure here now very interested in turkey it would be so usefula matter of dates when you knew him after stalingrad i know but when exactly useful to whom to turkey im not working for turkey no the americans but we have an arrangement with the americans then let them ask they will but maybe not so soon a small matter to them but something more to us nothing i think to you he paused a persuasive man melnikov there was a turkwell born in kars a turkish mother you would think a source of loyalty but a russian father so russian during the war when melnikov persuaded him to do some work against turkey we know what happened to himnorilsk not the reward he expected but there was another man and him i dont know by name no if you did an easy job for us just a name but if we had the dates we could match the dates a matter of elimination where was melnikov when not so difficult the americans will ask anyway so an exercise for you since youre here alexei glanced at leon and why not a little something for altan the victorei well away now leon blinked his eyes a kind of nod exactly its not possible alexei said well do the best you can altan said casually general movements theres some paper over there i find it helps putting things down one thing then another one comes more coffee ayşe im going to steal leon for a few minutes arrangements for later youll be all right here alexei looked up a tiny flicker of anxiety as if he were still clutching to leons jacket in the water theres the garden if you get restless altan said but no further please we dont want to take any chances disappoint the americans he took leon through the sofa and out onto the terrace facing the bosphorus busy with boats a few geraniums in pots had been brought outside to sit in the sun shall we start altan said half to himself enver leon said the first thing that came to mind you knew all the passports when a man wants to be someone else its always interesting altan said then stopped you want to know about enver hes of no importance so unnecessary to do that a madman that one he cocked his head back toward the garden room two children and now i have to arrange a pension for the widow who gives me the money for that maybe your new american friends leon said trying it out arent they paying you for him another look back toward alexei paying i dont think you understand how it is then how is it altan looked over almost a reprimand calm yourself mr bauer leon were working together now you know how did that happen your ambassador and your mr barksdale who altan smiled new to me too from washington he came especially a military plane especially for what mr bishop worked for him so there was a concern and you thought youd give him a ring and see if there was anything you could do for him no he called me he asked for my help there were you know liaisons during the war official channels but this was unofficial altan nodded as you say so how much did you ask for alexei altan glared at him trying to decide whether to be offended or move on why not leon said the russians are paying why should you work for free altan took out a cigarette lighting it with a hand cupped against the breeze a minutes stalling let me explain something to you we need the americans now so we help them theres no price for that how can there be without them wed be he opened his hand to the air letting the phrase finish itself then turned to leon we cant be neutral anymore what happened to the balancing act between us and the bear altan smiled a little i know you better now colleagues we dont have to pretend the bear wants to eat us you dont which would you choose so we get alexei and what do you get altan drew on the cigarette looking back to the bosphorus taking another minute to frame an answer very beautiful isnt it not last night no but now look its always beautiful to me asia europe he gestured back and forth and istanbul the bridge you say not us you a bridge to what some storybook in your head maybe byzantines ottomans not the occupation the british ships there he nodded toward the water the shame soldiers coming back in rags no all dancing girls and sherbets stories youre in love with the past well maybe all of us a little he turned to face leon we dont think were a bridge we think were the center the world used to spread out from here in every direction for years but then it began to shrink piece by piece then all at once and now theres only us turkey so we have to keep that the bear would eat us hes always wanted to eat us an easy job now no more empire this city a backwater yes he held up his hand no objections they think so so do you only turks here now and who cares about them so we have to make you care make you our friends comrades hah against the comrades he flicked the cigarette toward the water pleased with his wordplay so we do what we can for our friends a small price to pay he looked over you see why it was so important to find him even use gülün a matter of state he said but you kept running and clever he shook his head palestine not greece leon looked away unexpectedly pleased i thought you would give him to the russians leon altan said his tone puzzled as if leon hadnt been listening we are giving him to the russians leon turned the air around him suddenly still nothing moved boats waves everything stopped in place i told you last night altan said the americans dont want him not now not if they can use him to trade to trade leon repeated flatly no sound at all now not even birds in the garden room alexei would be writing down dates asking ayşe for more coffee trade for what their man in the consulate a much bigger fish now than our romanian killing mr bishop who next maybe you jianus information you know ishow old months at least maybe years useful but not so important as someone still operating inside leon saw alexei back in laleli extending his hand squeezing an invisible lemon if he is inside leon said his voice plodding one thought then another it could have been well thats what youll find out me yes of course you make the bargain with melnikov who else i cant be seen as interfering even now we should be indoors who knows if someone is watching involuntarily leon looked out at the water hes there altan said and now another man dead they have to act thats why barksdale called can you help and of course i knew you must have jianu so everything could be arranged if i got to you in time and i did he turned his hand up then lowered his voice jianus not so important now this one is then why would the russians trade him for alexei no one defects a matter of principle with thememotions even he said correcting himself you remember melnikov at the party dont worry theyll trade they cant afford to let him go set an example the one inside its just a question of time now before the americans get him they have to but such a messlooking here looking there turning everything upside down much easier to have him delivered worth throwing jianu back to get him then what was that charade before leon glanced toward the house people flying in from ankara leon would you rather have him believe that youre taking him to the russians animals were herded through gates the lining up itself meant to reassure pacify them make the rest easier something every butcher knew but not before you got a few dates out of him squeezing harder only pulp left altan shrugged leon looked down suddenly at the wooden slats of the terrace feeling them about to open the jolt of a trapdoor his whole body poised for a second in midair leon no louder than a faint echo all sound pulled into some vacuum on the bosphorus a swirl of silent birds were diving for something he couldnt make out a fish something hapless flailing on the surface until it slipped under theyll kill him eventually the birds were regrouping swooping up then diving again he turned to altan i wont do it his breath ragged the way it had been holding on to the life preserver altan looked at him surprised wont do what give him to the russians do you think you are working for yourself youre part of this its been decided he peered at leon you dont believe me ill phone you can ask barksdale yourself its what they want and suddenly his stomach fluttering began to cramp knowing that he didnt have to call that it was true youre part of this theyll kill him he said again this is a concern to you no such tears for enver i notice i didnt kill him youre not killing this one either who are you working for him the americans want a trade you do it then altan shook his head why would i go to melnikov to suggest this the man in the consulate is nothing to usthe americans problem melnikov will believe you he already thinks you work for them and now it turns outhes right he looked over at leon isnt he the logic of it encircling him the slats holding i was just supposed to pick him up leon said quietly talking to himself we all think that at the beginning that its easy so you learn you cant be sentimental about him you have to think whats important to you he waited its been decided another moment staring at leon now ive explained you to barksdale bebek all that business they trust you to do this leon stared back saying nothing ive explained you and then it was too late his silence had answered for him good altan said now the arrangements you meet with melnikov let him decide the place for the exchange then he wont be suspicious but somewhere public you bring jianu he brings their maninteresting to think what melnikov will tell him no lining them up in a stall make sure its somewhere you can have your people waiting you dont want to make a spectacle hell be armed no matter what you say so you too agree to that but not his manor jianu no dramatics they like a formal exchangestart here you there a meeting in the middle like a duel always afraid of tricks they think everyones like them he held up a finger but soontoday if possible i dont want to keep jianu here anyway its better for them too before their man can suspect he looked up a place where he cant run when he sees your people my people leon said altan opened his hand an offering gesture but you cant be involved gülüns men dont always wear uniforms but you see them at the door and you know theres no way out melnikovs menyou wont even have to guess cossacks out to here he indicated burly shoulders nothing ever fits a place with exits would be good haghia sophia somewhere like that but let him pick a guarantee for him that hes not walking into a trap they like that and if they start shooting they wont that would ruin it for the next time leon looked up one of their men in washington i think youll talk to him another time about that trade a man in washington leon said feeling his stomach clench again well there always is more than one so for a while hes not sure who you mean and they all lie lowa good thing for you if not hell like you thinking there is but there must be its always safe to play that card whats the matter he said taking in leons face ah did our friend already play it always make them think you have more leon how would he know do you think they would tell him that leon looked at the water people hear things sometimes by chance and people lie he saw the flat in laleli again tidy duffel packed ready to go alexei hunched over the board plotting moves so your first meeting somewhere neutral where emniyet wouldnt notice altan said smiling right under my nose an innocent encounter the bar at the park like during the war easy days for us all of you watching each other no he said thinking the pera mrs bishop youre with her in the bar melnikov comes in says hellohe met her here at the partyyou invite him to sit she has to go an errand or however you want to arrange that he looked over youre good at those things try not to leave the hotel with him when hes there we can keep an eye on you afterward he made a brushing motion with his hand hed know we were following even us what about me wont he have me naturally so after take a ferry to üsküdar therell be a taxidont worry itll know you his people will have a longer time getting one and the asian side its confusing for them he looked at his watch youll be back in time for tea all worked out leon said no not all altan said preoccupied not hearing anything in leons voice now the phone call lets go over that how did you get the number his private number hell expect all their consulate phones to be tapped are they mm so is this one but how did you get it not something he hands out georg leon said not even thinking georg gave it to me altan looked over good he nodded pleased georg good leon took up the part i found the man georg said you were looking for what man altan said lowering his voice playing too the translator fluent in romanian russian some german hard to find but i did altan was quiet for a minute running the conversation through his mind then smiled a little so you did a french door opened behind them domnul jianu altan said the romanian word a courtesy youre finished with your lunch do you have a cigarette he asked leon then to altan american cigarettes you get spoiled thats all they have in america altan said pleasant leon handed the pack to jianu keeping his hand steady what did his face look like some telltale blush giving him away but maybe people only saw what they were looking for a magic mirror effect the smooth reassuring look of someone you thought you knew its arranged alexei said lighting the cigarette almost a phone call altan said alexei looked up they want to hear from me personally leon said make sure not even a catch in his throat his voice smooth too someone else alexei nodded accepting this lets see if the lines open now altan said beginning to move better stay inside this to alexei with a look to the house boats have eyes too but youd be the ones watching alexei said i thought altan met his stare not only he made an ushering gesture toward the house leon he said heading inside leon stood rooted to the deck waiting for alexei who drew on the cigarette watching altan go be careful of that one alexei said his voice intimate something between them i dont trust him leon looked at the water afraid of his face again hes right though you never know no alexei said and started for the door putting his hand on leons shoulder as he passed leon kept staring out the birds had gone away was anyone in fact watching what would they see the long white terrace motorboats tied to mooring poles the flash of the sun on the french windows pretty placid as calm as the water where the fish had been how am i supposed to act kay said touching her hair nervous like someone having tea tea mata hari used to stay here it says in the brochure ill bet she never had tea at this hour she did there were only a few people in the pera bar this early the winter sun still warming the apricot walls lamps with fringe velvetcovered cushions the fussy luxury of an orient express car i dont think i could have done it what sleep with generals steal things out of their pockets i dont think thats how its done now leon said a half smile no she said quickly another pat to her hair how is it done you drink that and look happy to see me and disappear when he gets here leon nodded go to my room and not know what this is about either she looked down at her cup happy to see you it scares me how happy i was i thought i wouldnt i said id i know and you did she looked up for how long one last thing and then its over until the next time no over really she said then started picking at her finger does it work that way just quit i thought it was like the army she took out a cigarette something to put in her hand when did you decide this today what happened today she said looking up he shook his head nothing nothing she said back lighting the cigarette at least you didnt say its because of me id have probably believed it too she shook the match out im an easy lay only at first she raised her eyebrows then smiled thats it youre supposed to be happy to see me better she said a full smile now then looked down will you come later he nodded wait for me do you know i actually felt that a jump here she moved a hand down to her stomach just hearing that she knocked off some ash fidgeting glancing around the room whos watching anyway i dont know he said following her glance i mean whos supposed to be watching who would be altan must have someone would melnikov risk a meeting alone barksdale still not sure of him the barman the waiter the turkish woman with the hat i dont know he said again hearing himself this time the absurdity of it everybody all the time if you keep doing it someone always is thats what its like all the time a conversation with himself now youre part of this youre going to bend that spoon he looked down at his hands his thumbs pressing against the thin neck of polished steel you do that theres nothing in your face and then i hear a snap and i see somethings been going on all the time he dropped the spoon looking away someone caught tell me what you were thinking just now dont make something up what you were really thinking he picked up the spoon again staring at it tell me what do you do he said still looking down as if he were reading when theres no right thing to do just the wrong thing either way she said nothing for a minute not expecting this and you cant avoid it anymore doing something he looked up what do you do not really a question not even to himself i dont know she said stalling then met his eyes are you talking about me what no he said moving his hands over catching a spill i didnt mean he stopped not you he said softly oh she said just a sound her face flushing surprised again she reached over covering his hands then what drawing him in as if they were in bed no secrets he looked at her for another second then shook his head nothing we could get up right now and walk out of here she said still clutching his hand her eyes fixed on him just keep going before theres anything more we could do that through the doors past one of gülüns men on altans leash past the consulate ive explained you altan waiting i cant he said moving his hand away she kept hers on the table why not one last thing what last thing well what we can find out who killed frank frank she said thrown pulling her hand back how what do you mean thats what hes coming here for no are you doing this for me dont what does it matter who somebody thats all it doesnt change anything and next time itll be somebody else maybe me her eyes flashed then looked away a backing off she drew on her cigarette to calm down you think a russian did it she said not this russian smile again hes here over her shoulder he could see melnikov hesitate at the door an entrance then head straight for them he did everything he was expcted to dohis surprise at seeing them remembering kay from lilys party not wanting to intrude but persuaded to staybut all of it done so clumsily that only his awkwardness made it seem authentic leon thought of lily gliding through her guests melnikov ordered vodka then having exhausted his script he sat waiting for leon a silence anyone in the room would notice ill be right back kay said powder room youll excuse me melnikov stood as she left formal then turned to leon where is he safe we can do it this afternoon how much do you want blunt not the playful ritual of the bazaar a trade your man in the consulate what man the one who killed frank there is no such man yes there is frank found him thats why hes dead so will we now that we know hes there but wed like to speed things up theyre both damaged goods now an even trade melnikov thought about this how do i know you have him youll see him i bring mine you bring yours dont come emptyhanded its a onetime offer pick the place and no money not even a tip for you maybe next time melnikov stared at him not sure how to take this this isnt hard take it or leave it and if i leave it then we get both of them bad arithmetic for you melnikov shrugged but hes already talked only to me or hed be in washington now he likes to wait for the right movea chess player but you know that he said you were a little slow so i guess his informations still good melnikov sat back annoyed were wasting time youll want guarantees so do we can you bring him today melnikov hesitated running the tip of his tongue between his lips a wolfs anticipation i think you may be surprised he said finally leon looked at him done a life discarded in a second enver slipping in the bath only if you dont show up melnikov snorted then picked up his glass draining it you pick the place leon said again well goodness here you are big as life ive been wondering i thought maybe youd gone home barbara king ed burke trailing behind leon stood kissing the cheek she offered i hope youre coming to my party i left about a hundred messages now turning to be introduced to melnikov ed hanging back as if the physical presence of a russian was upsetting the bogeyman real isnt it a little early barbara said noticing the glass then kay was coming back kay she said stretching the syllable ive been meaning to call those first few days i know what its like and suddenly it was the crowd outside sirkeci everyone in motion trying to get out of each others way melnikov wary suspecting tricks but about what kay slightly panicky someone whod left her post for a second and now saw people rushing through the gate ed flustered for no reason at all embarrassed maybe for leon his interrupted tryst only barbara blithely enjoying herself eyeing kays dress taking the confusion for some kind of evidence a vindicated house detective ed have you met ivan melnikov ed now reluctant barely managing to get through a handshake melnikov just as publicly diffident so that for a second leon wondered if in fact they already knew each other melnikovs face a mask giving nothing away i think you may be surprised leon looked at the other tables people talking to each other or pretending to try not to leave the hotel altan had said but how could they stay now not even one drink barbara was saying a citron pressé i never see you im late already kay said fluttering but cant it wait ten minutes leon could see her thinking a movement in the back of her eyes not the hairdresser she said women and their hair melnikov said indulgent as if nothing more could be said and us im sorry leon said youre going to the hairdresser too barbara said playing the consulate he turned to melnikov i promised wed be there by to meet the new guy ed said interested now they saybut you must have seen him first thing i mean hed want he stopped whats he like melnikov looked at leon presumably his new boss someone leon would know hes from washington ed leon said trying to be light you know i think they even get their suits from the same place and then they were in the lobby ed and barbara left in the bar but still looking at them everything a question mark well now id better have it done kay said brushing the back of her hair mrs bishop melnikov said taking her hand a pleasure not lingering someone keeping an appointment he moved back so leon could say goodbye thanks for the tea kay said one eye to the bar leon took her hand well do it again he said something for melnikov and the bellhops then low only to her wait for me she shuddered as if a draft had just swept through the door what her eyes wide then darting across his face i just had the strangest feeling she put her hand on his arm holding him in place what she glanced toward the door melnikov waiting i dont know she said her fingers still gripping him just a feeling leon looked back over his shoulder hes watching she dropped her hand all right she said then caught his sleeve wait i know what you said before two wrong things theyre not the same they cant be you have to decide its not like that you wonder she said not listening to him did i do the right thing but at least you made the choice her voice intense as if no one else were in the room then she lowered her head well listen to me she let go his sleeve did i do the right thing kay i still dont know youd better go she said glancing to melnikov again leon looked at her disconcerted wanting to touch her the room full of eyes the clock beginning to tick again wait for me he said code for everything else an attractive woman melnikov said in the street no this way up to tünel the route already picked out and now a widow yes you were close to him not particularly i knew him a careful man but not with our friend jianu i never understood that we didnt knowi admit that to you it should have been easy for you so what happened a man so careful he trusted the wrong people but it was you he trusted melnikov said the way it made sense to him and with his wife twice wrong i think and now you ask me to trust you you wont come alone neither will i we can trust each other that much like a timeout time when you stop the game a little truce to make the trade then it starts again but no money melnikov said still brooding i thought you were keeping him for that maybe hes more valuable to us this way us and how is it more valuable to you he looked at leon a man of many loyalties our jianu and you only one leon said not biting stars and stripes melnikov said still looking skeptical his voice almost a sneer and what was that a saturday evening post cover but that was before now it was someone ordering a trade youve tried this already with georg i dont want any money so it was something else to make you give up your prize noting it filing it away for the future but not leons almost out of it just play out the hand maybe he isnt worth as much as we thought melnikov looked at him for a moment calculating again then started walking almost at the square now the scraping sound of a tram being turned around you dont know how to talk to him he said flatly but you do yes hell talk to us leon looked at the square sunny a break in the clouds and felt the chill of a dripping basement thered be screams everybody screamed finally everybody talked people were pouring out of the funicular station just in time melnikov said where are you going we need to have you noticed people always take it coming up a jeton a small price to avoid the hill but down so mostly empty private the few people boarding were heading to the front car to be off first you see melnikov said getting into the last car no one a good place to talk no ears except the man who just then got in standing by the window until he caught melnikovs eye and backed out again going to the next car an almost slapstick retreat one of melnikovs own too eager or just somebody off the street the buzzer rang doors sliding shut and they started down through the tunnel old concrete and bare bulbs what the way to melnikovs basement might look like just the two of them now its safe melnikov said how many men will you bring all business negotiating a contract as if they were in one of the banks on voyvoda caddesi at the foot of the hill guarantees procedures handing over someone to be killed meeting the funicular cars going up at the halfway point then swallowed up again by the narrow passage melnikovs eyes never leaving him someone whod killed his own men means to an end but what was the end now at the bottom he stopped himself from rushing out waiting for the doors to slide all the way open six oclock then melnikov said and it was done over the claustrophobic ride melnikovs eyes they crossed tersane dodging cars suddenly back in real life everything opening up before him the smells of the karaköy market the amateur fishermen dangling poles off the bridge trams and cars and peddlers and the minarets beyond the scene hed known a thousand times before but bathed in an unnatural light now the city wonderful again because it was done you have not said where melnikov said you pick melnikov spread his hand turning the choice back to leon somewhere with people he said leon flipped through mental postcards not haghia sophia gloom and frescoes taksim cars waiting close by a tram was coming across from eminönü another from this side like seconds marking out paces crowds streaming by oblivious he stopped almost laughing at the obvious here he said pointing galata bridge they left early alexei in a life vest this time more boats he said but not the creaky fishing trawler one of lilys motorboats sleek with wood trim i hope youre not afraid of flying too altan said the story was a drive to the airport army transport out what should have happened days ago then why the boat the airports on the european side leon said we cant risk the car ferry they watch it keeping him safe relax alexei made a resigned grimace the boat slapping hard against whitecaps pitching up and down after they passed the dolmabahçe mosque leon looked up the hill trying to find his window thered be mail waiting curious mr cicek wondering what the police had wanted alexei was taking everything in his first real look at the city spilling over its hills in the weak afternoon light leon checked his watch almost dark but at this time of year a lingering dusk light enough for melnikov to see them on the bridge they swung into the golden horn then idled just far enough away from the bridge to keep it in sight the cranes and drydocks of the shipyards ahead they wont expect us to come down the horn altan said indicating the factories and oily water farther along he was scanning the bridge through binoculars who alexei said the americans no altan said catching himself anybody force of habit so feeble that it passed as an excuse theres no one on the bridge now alexei said not meaning the crowds how do you know i looked when we passed under you dont need those if you know how to look they say a lion can sit looking at grass and then for one second somethings not right a movement one second and he knows altan made a face aslan he said wryly lion leon looked at the bridge could anyone really see that way a seconds movement in a place perpetually in motion the iron arches the pontoons at their feet people crowding onto the jetties from the ferries the lower level of fish restaurants and stalls trams sliding overhead the sprawling marketall the same to him nothing out of place how much longer now he turned and gazed toward the docks trying not to look at alexei around the curve was kasim paşa and then the yards where the victorei had waited in quarantine any news of the ship he asked altan it took altan a minute oh the jews no how would i hear we dont follow them to palestine id like to know leon said a request you know it was said there was typhus leon nodded a miracle recovery it cost ten thousand dollars turkish medicine altan stared at him more embarrassed than offended how many on the ship alexei asked four hundred leon said a few more you saved four hundred jews altan said to alexei an ironic taunting in his voice and i only owed you one life alexei said to leon you dont owe me anything leon said quickly alexei put his hand to his chest an abbreviated salaam bereket versin you know turkish altan said surprised a few words you pick things up he looked at altan aslan altan turned back to the bridge why are we here alexei said to leon what happens now its not time yet therell be a car leon said nodding to the eminönü side where melnikov must be waiting in the big square filled with buses and stalls frying mackerel from the boats tied up alongside ill walk you over and then were done alexei kept looking at him not saying anything nothing to it leon said uneasy then why did you bring a gun alexei said looking to leons pocket in case leon said vaguely in case i run alexei said so careful the americans where would i go in washington lets hope theyre not so careful a long job if they dont believe me skip the soviets man there then leon said trying it if you want to build some trust or was he just for me keep me interested alexei turned to the bridge not answering in high places leon said the one nobody knows who isnt there is he alexei was quiet for a moment he must be he said finally dont you think someone must be a safe move he turned back to leon to keep me valuable thats all he pulled up the collar of his jacket hunkering down what does he think hell find he said looking at altan in the front of the boat still scanning the bridge leon joined him on the seat their jackets touching ten minutes altan said over his shoulder get ready alexei pulled the duffel bag closer well then its goodbye he said to leon he looked down oddly hesitant you know that jobtraining your peoplethe one i talked about if you could mention it to someone if you think it would help a word from you leon nodded cutting him off each word like a tug on his sleeve he got up leaning against the gunwale as if there were something to see in the water tell me it cant matter to you now i mean were here so what i think doesnt alexei lifted an eyebrow what did you do at străuleşti why do you ask this alexei said leon looked at him waiting make it easier for me its not enough your ship i want to know a long silence alexei looking at his hands what you told me leon said what i dont even remember anymore what i said but you have to know something that happened he looked out toward the old city in another world quiet again then turning back to leon outside only outside i never went in didnt i say that its the truth the meat stamps the hooksi wasnt part of that craziness i was outside he stopped like a guard of what i dont know outside he looked up but i could hear is that what you want to know what i heard no no its better dont listen someday maybe somebody asks you he said looking at leon and what do you say i had to do it all you can say is i was there but outside i was outside he stopped do you think it would have made any difference if i hadnt been there leon said nothing none maybe a difference to me he said his voice lower not to hear it but not to them he took a breath so now stop asking me this wait a few years when you see what things are like then ask and thats the truth didnt i say so leon nodded everyone else is dead thats right theres only me to say everyones dead not just them everyone people i knew but you werent standing outside then you want to blame me for this there has to be somebody so it makes sense he waved his hand go ahead and will that make any difference either he shook his head theyre dead you want justice for them not in this world all right lets go altan said motioning the driver to pull up to the jetty careful of the step alexei stared at leon thats what things were like that time its different now leon looked back no squeals this time nothing to hear a simple exchange people passing by good luck altan said taking alexeis hand to steady him for the climb out of the boat friendly helping him along alexei made it in two steps the duffel following gülün and his men will be at the top of the stairs altan said to leon glancing toward the bridge dont look for him or the aslan will know he said sarcastic just the two of you until its too late then bring melnikovs man back lets hope hes not a turk after all this leon stood not moving eyes fixed on altans upper lip no moustache all right all right a matter of minutes thats all something alexei had donehow many times what he wanted to do in washington handing over names already had done for altan at lilys it gets easier but just then lifting himself out of the boat the minutes felt endless altan waved and pulled away they made their way to the bridge through the karaköy market sidestepping pools of melted ice streaked with fish blood strands of wilted greens cats lurked behind the stalls waiting for scraps there was more food near the steps of the bridge stuffed mussels and braziers with chestnuts they stopped for a minute on top catching a breath before they waded into the crowd dont look for gülün anybody just start walking meet in the middle no advantage on either side not too fast as formally paced as a gunfight except in a western thered be no one else in the streets the townspeople cowering and melnikov dressed in black to make everything clear instead there were water salesmen with silver canisters strapped to their backs and hamals wheeling carts and a simit peddler with a tray of bread rings balanced on his head leon felt the gun in his pocket not something youd want to use in a crowd just in case in case what they had to shoot their way back altan had never said but now that they were here leon knew alexei would recognize melnikov not a stranger and might have to be persuaded to keep going prodded forward maybe even shot if he tried to bolt in the foot a knee somewhere to keep him alive for melnikov the gun was for alexei and melnikov would have his own ready to use on the other side his man unsuspecting too until the final minute maybe until he recognized leon someone whod killed frank and would kill again meanwhile betraying them all to the soviets there were two people in this trade not just alexei a frontier justice maybe the only kind there ever was think of it as bringing someone to trial what kind of car alexei said american i dont know they didnt say in front of the mosque thats all each step a foot closer his eyes darted over the fishermen lining the rail waiting for one of them to turn his head as they passed not a fisherman what it must feel like hunting preparing to kill a lion watching the grass they were on the horn side of the bridge traffic coming from behind maybe a burst of gunfire from a passing car the russians were capable of anything any deceit but all he saw were taxis on their way to sirkeci dont look back alexei sure to notice so far not even wary trusting the car to be there trusting leon everything as planned then why the dismay this constriction in his chest leon feeling that it was he who was being brought to trial betraying alexei had said gets easier leon glanced over now eager almost boyish what he must have looked like in bucharest leon scanned the crowd up ahead maybe a quarter of the way across now melnikov here soon i think you may be surprised some teenage boys ran out of the stairway from the restaurant level below where he and kay had had lunch looking at minarets ed embarrassed to stumble on them years ago how many times had he walked across this bridge feeling lucky to be here now a shiver he sensed everything was about to change even in this halflight things seemed sharper as if they knew hed have to remember them be asked about them one day and what would he say i was outside listening he glanced over at alexei again a head snapped on a bathroom floor because it was in the way im not you a wave of panic rose in his throat like bile im not you but everything now set in motion melnikov already somewhere in the sea of heads coming toward them the simit man was back partly blocking the view leon leaned a little to his left and saw the hat the same floppy brim shed worn at tommys service just in from ankara not sure if it was proper to smoke in the street later shy against the window light walking now with melnikov no he kept moving kay raised her head looking into the crowd looking for him or for some story melnikov had made up to put her at ease part of him visible now just over her right shoulder as if she were a kind of shield to use before he threw her away someone in ankara the russian desk no leon hearing her voice not the traffic everything she had ever said almost dizzy with it any of it real none of it still coming toward them what is it alexei said alert a scent in the wind nothing leon said his voice hollow emptied out nothing wrong about everything walking unable to stop a life can change in a second and never be the same a hand sliding away in the water a shot fired on a quay more voices then altans on the terrace you have to think whats important to you meaning something else but what was not even a second less and everything changed forever one more and he would be them not an accidental killer one of them twisting necks throwing people away maybe he already was the second already passed alexei not seeing them yet wondering what kind of car it would be no leon said out loud not even bothering to lower his voice alexei turned to him all attention head up a twig snapping in the woods dont dont look listen quick his mind racing the others still coming its a trap see the stairs just ahead no more than a minute at this pace he took out the gun and slipped it into alexeis pocket a thiefs movement give me the duffel one hand over the other then only leons when i say head for the stairs after that run alexei said finishing it im sorry leon said the word not big enough and you but there was no time not for an answer anything almost at the stairs ready leon said lifting the bag now he pushed into the simit peddler a shove with the duffel the man pitched forward teetering the tray sliding off and spilling simits into the crowd away from the stairs noises of surprise everyone looking then rushing to help the man a general swarming leon looked up kay seeing him now melnikov coming from behind his gaze to leons right past the commotion to the blur of alexei running away alexei stopped recognizing him then looked back to leon mouth open moving pieces a second just long enough for melnikov to raise his gun and fire a sharp clanging noise the bullet hitting iron then shrieks sounds of panic the simits scattered again as people ran for cover another shot as alexei disappeared down the stairs melnikov started running pushing kay aside everyone scattering ducking against the bridge railing when he reached the stairs he glanced over at leon panting his face almost a snarl before he plunged down from below leon could hear screams shouts of protest people being shoved he remembered the crowds shopping lined up for the restaurants another trap why had he sent him there but where else could he have gone a head start at least a minute to save himself melnikovs men raced after him to the stairs leon swiveled his head gülüns men invisible before were rushing down from the karaköy side bottling him up leon imagined downstairs women crouching men yelling alexei running toward the freedom of eminönü seeing melnikovs men coming down frantic back and forth the stalls a maze batteries and shoes and toys knocked to the floor as people were crushed against them another shot the sound different the bridge was still emptying people hurrying to the ends afraid now of being caught in any cross fire a tram unaware had begun to lumber across and a few people ran over to it hanging onto the side kay stood still looking at leon her face bewildered jumping when she heard the shot below what was she seeing now before wrong about everything she looked behind her a quick check then moved toward leon another woman following not a turk western dress someone leon knew but couldnt recognize out of place and then even more confused he did dorothy wheeler who knew where all the files were what frank must have found whod been walking behind kay next to melnikov i think you may be surprised more shots from below coming from both ends as if they were firing at each other then suddenly alexei was at the top of the far stairs a backtracking maneuver his head poking up like a rabbit out of its hole no a fox eyes desperate and calculating trying to outrun the hunt he looked around the road almost empty traffic stopped at either end and started back to karaköy sprinting wiry arms pumping as he came toward them leon could almost feel the surge of adrenaline faster not far a minute of luck thats all but the fox never won leon saw that the bridge was like a broad open field without cover an illusion of escape he hadnt saved alexei hed only given him a head start to be killed but at least running all anyone could really hope for a running start leon kay heading toward him too dorothy had disappeared thank god stoi jianu the blast of a shot melnikov firing from the top of the stairs more screams from the railing alexei turned looking back over his shoulder catching a second shot in his chest the force of it almost spun him around his body slumping over then forcing itself back up the last ninth life just enough strength to lift his gun hand shaking trying to keep the shot from going wild leon pushed kay to the ground covering her stay down sounding like someone else hoarse another crack in the air from his right he heard melnikov grunt then yelp surprised and looked up the eerie quiet of a moment of elastic time melnikov slowly dropped to his knees a forest trunk falling holding his side alexei still bent over but starting to move awkward steps staggering to some invisible finish line then melnikov fired a miss this time but the sound speeding everything up again alexei tried to run faster but his feet splayed tripping over themselves until they finally stopped and he crumpled onto the road the gun clattering away from him dont move leon said to kay then got up and ran to alexei blind to everything around him kays voice behind men rushing toward him the fishermen at the rail lifting their heads to watch jianu melnikov called again weaker this time on the stairs there was a clomping of feet gülün barking out some order leon dropped next to alexei he was gulping for air blood pouring across his upper chest the gun he said raspy moving his eyes to the side get the gun leon picked it up jianu leon looked behind melnikov getting up holding his stomach so alexei said still breathing in gasps hold on well get an ambulance for you leon said but who wanted him alexei shook his head then blinked at the gun you do it not them leon froze the gun suddenly cold in his hand alexei nodded its time leon stared at him my friend his eyes locked on leon now not them leon heard the scrape of a shoe on the road melnikov moving what are you doing kay said to melnikov somewhere in the distance do it alexei said another blink some awful permission he moved his hand limp covered with blood to touch leons arm his eyes sure so wide that leon thought he could see to the back of them who he was please he said his voice fainter leon knelt paralyzed one second alexei looking at him as if there was no one else on the bridge please leon fired alexeis body jerked an electric jolt his eyes even wider then everything settled quiet are you crazy melnikov was yelling close now the bridge noisy again with men running leon turned as if he were protecting alexei already dead with his own body but melnikov wasnt aiming at alexei his other hand still clutching his side bleeding eyes rabid with fury durak he said spitting it when the gun went off leon was too surprised to duck here like this why now what was the point shooting him no more to melnikov than stamping his foot then the fire exploded in his chest literally the heat of flames and some force like a hand in his face pushed him back falling over no kay yelled hitting melnikov but he was pointing the gun again feet planted apart rooted she reached for it trying to force it up from the ground melnikov knocked her away durak he said again to leon then looked up as more feet approached and raised the gun a reflex some shouts in turkish and then an explosion so loud leon thought it came from behind his ear this time melnikov didnt make a sound just looked down at the new hole in his tunic and dropped leon could make out gülün kneeling by the body gun in his hand something garbled in turkish orders leon kay said her face over him her voice highpitched almost a keening kay only a shield dorothy but what could she have known passed on why do it money maybe like georg lost in an idea she couldnt let go now thered be questions months of them squeezing a trial if that was useful housecleaning protecting flanks and then a new melnikov would plant a new dorothy and it would start again dorothy traded away all alexei was worth at the end leon heard more voices in the road loud then fainter receding the dusk suddenly getting darker and in some part of him aware of what was happening he was curious would it really be a white light appearing from the end of a tunnel and enveloping him until he was part of it what alexei must just have seen but it wasnt light it was faces hazy like underexposed film but moving closer until they were right next to him phil in his cockpit waving georg walking his dog in yildiz mihai at a boat rail the faint suggestion of a smile and then anna in lilys garden that first spring worried because they were happy before anything happened her face so close now he felt he could touch it all the faces of his life then they went away finally a voice said ill get the nurse light not that light the enveloping one just daylight white walls leon a face mihai leon tried to speak his tongue stuck some water yes yes a plastic straw a stream of cool liquid soaking into his dry throat they said youd be dehydrated even with the drip mihais face now in focus concerned where is this obstbaums i had you moved the hospital theres a risk of infection even kleinman said after an operation an operation he had to take a piece of your lung where the bullet hit take a breath see a little less no more smoking so maybe a good thing not so good for your business though considering leon tried to smile then wet his cracked lips with the straw youre lucky you know that a matter of inches he said and then and now look the man of the hour watch theyll give you a medal something what for being lucky he shrugged but thats what theyre always for isnt it leon tried to follow this still catching up how are you here you were how the train from aleppo like always thats days two youve been out maybe rabbi pilcer prayed for you he has a direct line he said pointing a finger up so he thinks somebody must have you almost died yes yes you knew it doesnt feel like anything leon said to the ceiling then looked back i saw you mihai stopped thrown by this then took the water away wonderful with wings this is what happens a little disappointing leon reached over the sheet to cover mihais hand resting it there mihai looked up surprised not sure how to respond the ship mihai nodded all safe four hundred new citizens so thank you for that leon shook his head him jianu he made them let you go why for his sins you think he feels something not that one how do you know a man tries to cut your throat you know everything about him leon was quiet looking toward the window everything else too complicated you dont forget what thats like ever mihai said touching his neck as if a knife had actually been there he looked away anyway its finished now he pays its what i said from the first the first night thats not why i killed him why you killed him mihai said slowly looking at leon no why he asked me mihai didnt say anything to this he wanted me to do it leon mihai said gently maybe its a little fast all this so much talk he paused altan said the russians people saw them its still a little confusing maybe all the drugs not the last shot leon said that was me he lay back as if it made any difference now altan already shaping the way it happened you couldnt fight the next war until youd lied about the last one yes mihai said humoring him it was the right thing to do leon said his voice trailing off vague maybe you should rest now ill tell the nurse no leon said gripping his hand talk i want to know tell me what durak leon said the first thing that came into his mind you know russian what does durak mean fool leon smiled yes that makes sense he would think that who melnikov he said it before he shot me and i was but not then before he lifted his hand slightly brushing the air wrong about tommy everything durak he raised his eyes im glad about the ship so thats one thing thats why you came back theres another you can get more out not from istanbul its not so easy now italy more typhus leon said no getting out of romania its safer from the west through vienna away from the russians istanbuls finished for us the officei dont know how long youre going to italy no palestine home he looked up tentative his voice casual you too why not to do what grow oranges fight the british are going to make a mess the arabs hate us like the poles therell be another war leon finished but this one we dont lose you like all this so much he waved his hand over leons bandages come to palestine with one lung were not so picky we take anyone whos with us he took a breath there are other ways to fight leon turned im not with anybody and thats why you buy the victorei out and now who do you see when you die a joke to keep a door open an exit if he needed it i saw phil too mihai cocked his head my brother who was shot down i used to think sometimes i was doing this for him helping working for tommy but thats just something you tell yourself to make it okay he turned to face mihai how do you help somebody whos dead so who would i be helping this time anna mihai looked away uncomfortable no four hundred still alive and more coming he hesitated it could be useful with the british not being a jew another pause whats here for you i cant take her there leon said quietly do you want me to leave her is that what youd do mihai sat back at a loss then got up and walked over to the window me no he looked out youd better sleep the room confining now im awake mihai started fingering some plants on the windowsill restless so who is this woman she comes every day kay she was franks i know who she is who is she to you leon said nothing well see she knows about anna leon nodded not just a friend i think he held up his hand before leon could say anything shes here mihai looked at his watch soon every day he made a half smile shifts me then her he looked up she was afraid shed miss you that you wouldnt wake up before she left before she seeing her walking across the bridge in her hat melnikovs shield not stopping this time leaving when all he could say i dont know she has a priority they arranged it they trying to think his mind fuzzy sorting this out so tell me whats what mihai looked over i dont judge but what was there to tell nothing decided and then it was when is she here beginning to move one hand on the sheet relax mihai said coming over to stop him youve got tubes coming and going youll knock this over he nodded to the drip let me see this probably isnt good for you you know the commotion i mean head back come on i dont leave until i seeokay better so much better that leon felt his eyes begin to close seeing mihai leave in a narrow strip like watching someone through a venetian blind there was a voice in the back of his head anxious then another farther away a mans voice german only a few minutes yes he goes in and out if you see that let him go he needs the sleep all right kays voice the smell of her perfume he may not know you mihai said mihai now mossad is giving out medical degrees at the door heads bent toward each other but kay restless shifting her feet looking back at the bed the way she had been that first morning in tünel having her cigarette jumpy not sure of things kay leon said the sound sticking a little in his throat you see she said to obstbaum hurrying over to the bed he does obstbaum nodded tapping his wristwatch at her and left thank god she said to leon taking his hand ive been so worried youre leaving he said the scratchiness clearing she took her hand away mihai told you he said i wanted to tell you myself altans making you go why would he do that no witnesses hes making up some story not what happened leon she said soothing people were there on the bridge it waspublic he got you a priority trying to put things one after the other assemble them he wants to get you out of the country did you give them a statement she looked at him disconcerted dont please you almost died on the bridge and youre still she stopped it was me i want to go why i cant stay here she said picking at the sheet i had time to thinkwhile you were out i never did before it was alwayslater lets talk about it later but then i did she grazed his hand i want to go home but you cant ill stay with my sister for a while she said ignoring him until we drive each other crazy the way we always do and thensomething franks insurance isnt going to go very far she looked up this isnt what you want to know is it no she went over to the night table busying herself ive been thinking how to say this and now she handed him a glass with a straw here youre supposed to keep drinking he took some water then watched her as she circled the bed youre all dressed a suit with an openneck blouse a silver pin on the lapel lipstick a seat opened up today i wasnt going to take it if you were still today he tried to prop himself up against the pillow she adjusted it for him i wouldnt go without saying goodbye she said then stopped fluffing the pillow and sat next to him running her hand across his forehead oh god how do i do this dont dont go no stay theres still so much to see she said using a guides vioice then stopped except i dont want to see it anymore i dont want to worry about drinking the water and wonder what people are saying all that screeching over the loudspeakers how many times a day do people have to pray anyway five he said quietly okay she said nodding its not any of that itsi woke up on the bridge do you know what that was like for me watching you die why were you there what did melnikov tell you still wanting to know that you asked for me that you she waved her hand oh what does it matter he got me there so youd go through with it i guess i didnt really ask him she looked down i should have known you wouldnt do thatask for me she lifted her head and then everything started the guns people killed she looked at him they said none of that was supposed to happen the guns it was just a trade until you she hesitated why did you it wasnt a trade he said throat still dry but they said we knew what they were going to do to him after they were finished with him he stopped the words still far back pulling them thats not evenstanding outside inside putting them on hooks inside she said trying to follow he closed his eyes too weak to unravel any more he trusted me he said she looked at him a minutes delay as if she were translating so you helped him and they shot you too she said finally i thought you were dead everything juststopped stopped but you were still breathing eyes open and you said something i thought maybe its the last time do you remember what you said he shook his head waiting you said her name you called her you were looking right at me eyes open and you were calling her kay no its all right its justwhen i heard it i knew like somebody shaking me awake she was the love of your life is she stopped is i wassomething else she bit her lip i went to see her down the hall i wanted to see what she looked like she nodded answering an unspoken question if she was prettier than me and then i didnt go in get close enough to tell i didnt want to know what if she isnt its better if i think she is dont she reached over stroking his forehead again i know its just the way it is its not something you can she stopped moving her hand away its just id like that too to have that so maybe ill find him back home not so exciting she said twisting her mouth spreading her hand to take in the city outside maybe somebody who plays golf and takes the train but stillthe love of my life like her she leaned over and kissed his forehead anyway i have to think there is one she looked into his eyes her face soft i hope it wasnt you that would be so unfair wouldnt it only a few days while you were asleep i was thinking about that how many there were and then i thought dont count what if its two three just a few and it seems like she stopped so better not he reached up putting his hand against her cheek the iv line dangling as if it were part of a string he was trying to hold and you know maybe its enough like this to have a taste stop before she looked away you dont see it at the beginning i dont know why not how else would it end what did i think this was what did you think it was she moved his hand back to the bed and stood up so before that while we still feel she moved to the chair picking up a hat and purse you know at least it makes it easier you like this she nodded to the hospital bed with all those things in your arm so you have to stay there otherwise you know what it would be like youd get up and hold me and then how could i go her eyes filling now because id think it was you the one she came back to the bed and leaned down kissing him on the forehead a goodbye kiss then his arms went up around her pulling her closer and the kiss became something else a secret until he felt moisture in the cracks of his lips smeared with her listen to me she said later youll think different things about me she put her fingers to his mouth before he could say anything you will i just want you to remember this part was true will you remember that he said nothing afraid she would remove the fingers actually go your cars here obstbaum in the doorway kays head jerking back coming she said barely getting it out obstbaum lingered at the door so she just squeezed leons hand a different goodbye still caring about how it must look to him she cocked her head toward the hall the quiet room at the end i hope she comes back think how shed feel knowing you waited for her she turned to go leons hand resting on the bed but in his minds eye stretching out and then seeing obstbaum dropping back by the time she reached the door obstbaum had disappeared but it was too late to reach her now and his body was sinking into the sheets the way it had felt on the bridge when he thought he was dying but would you do something for me kay said turning eyes brimming he looked up not having to nod knowing she could sense it dont tell her about us he waited she wouldnt like it but thats not it its something for me i want to be the one you cant talk about i want that much they took the catheter out that afternoon and gave him broth his first food it was important to move not lie in bed so he was walked around the room baby steps wheeling the iv rack with him a nurse at his side not too much at once to the door then back a rest in the chair by the end of the day he could go to the bathroom by himself altan came just as it was getting dark out of bed already thats a good sign he said flipping on the overhead light leon looked up from the visitors chair where hed been staring at the floor a little gloomy sitting like this in the dark altan pulled up another chair a bustling motion settling a briefcase by his side and you so lucky the last man standingthats the expression yes what are you going to say happened say what did happen no you wont it was a mess and jianus dead nobody got him so what are you going to say his voice still weak a slight croaking well as to that altan crossed his leg and sat back so that his face went partly in shadow the phantom moustache flickering back and forth on his lip everybodys dead except you so its your story he looked at leon how they killed each other and gülün finally gets his medal no that wouldnt be convenient he said drawing out a cigarette and lighting it a turkish officer shooting a russian people would be upset oh he said noticing leons face its not allowed he looked at the cigarette maybe this once something between us so who shot him jianu they shot each other unfortunately some innocents got in the way he nodded at leon fortunately they recovered and theyll believe that why wouldnt they its what everybody wants what suits jianus dead which is what the russians wanted and you know i think theyll be grateful melnikovs dead too a brutal man even for them you heard about stalingrad his own men think what a relief to have him gone of course they cant say this he drew on the cigarette the americans avenge their mr bishop and we we get to protest to both guns in the streets endangering turkish citizens apologies have been demanded even the russians are embarrassed an excess they should learn from the ottomans the silk cord no noise no pop pop but very effective of course they wont learn that its not in their nature he looked up but at least this way an acceptable story and who shot me if they killed each other jianu before if we say a russian theres no end to this official protests swords waving everybody a gazi its enough now jianu was that kind of man he looked straight at leon first mr king poor enver now melnikov and you anybody else you can think of while youre at it some unsolved cases you can throw in the file christ alexei killed everybody thats what im supposed to say you already have altan said lifting the briefcase you think only emniyet does this arranges things he patted the case we have the statements gülün confirms yours no medal this time but a different reward for his discretion he paused taking in leons expression you think its corrupt the old empire my friend everybody changes the story the russians theyve believed their own lies for so long that he let the thought finish itself and now the americans youre just learning how to live in the world he looked over at leon they shot each other you recovered its the convenient story but there were witnesses not everybodys gülün so you got rid of her you sent her home who oh the faithful mrs bishop you couldnt take any chances with her you got her a priority leon she didnt need anyone to do that for her all she had to do he stopped you still dont know she didnt tell you leon said nothing feeling for the armrest altan made a kind of sigh through his nose that she leaves to me he put out the cigarette so foolish the americans using the wife his idea too im told why to save money she has time on her hands why not put her to use to get what what people say at parties in ankara amateurs alexeis assessment too a professional shake of the head and what happens complications he said rolling an eye at leon emotions theres no place for that she wanted the trade her husbands killer he glanced away maybe she feltwell whatever reason i told barksdale it wasnt necessary dont give up jianu its just a matter of time but no they listened to her an amateur leon was listening now too just a trade shed said until you why did you always a mistake using a wife think of the risk the one can be used against the other but they werent leon said dully leading him wanting to know his voice sounding like an echo still a risk two it compromises any operation no she never said a word of course not you were the operation he felt the chill on his back air coming through the open hospital gown then the weight again his body sinking into the chair not that it did much good altan was saying you didnt give her anything i thought now shes got him but she didnt no leon said another echo you never gave jianu away not even to her he said oddly admiring i couldnt leon said his voice still far away leon he looked up aware now that altan had been talking i was supposed to keep him safe thats what it was all for everything that happened to keep him alive his mouth began to turn up as if he had heard a joke back where his voice was keep him alive altan raised his eyebrows a nurse watching a patient you all wanted him leon said everybody then nobody did altan shifted in his chair in my opinion a waste what can he do for anybody now dead nothing thats what he wanted altan looked at him not sure how to take this all this to get dorothy leon said the idea still implausible no no a very devious man melnikov altan said sitting back settling in i dont think he trusted you your mistress a little insurance to keep your gun in your pocket mrs wheeler to distract you while the real one is taken away of course eventually you would realize the mistake all those questions with no answers but by then too late hes gone who leon said only half listening mr wheeler naval attaché an expert on the black sea and much else it seems leon raised his head another joke off somewhere alexei always said hed be in ankara he said yes the logical place she knew altan shook his head the soviets would never use a husband and wife theyre too experienced for that he said making a point she knew nothing which of course came out an odd marriage but maybe not what do any of us know but suspicions yes a woman who noticed things so maybe she knew and she didnt know both its possible dont you think yes anyway we detained mr wheeler before he could go so not such an ordeal for her polite questions i understand you detained him the black sea was an ottoman lake once when the bear takes an interestwe like to know why a few questions but now the americans have him he opened his hand they paid for him you paid for him a face he couldnt even remember leaning over dorothys desk he went along with this setting her up leon altan said a mock patience what would be the sense of telling him you never know how people are going to react of course he was in no position to object they were getting him out maybe later he could send for her maybe she refuses they often do im told given what its like there but we got to him first he leaned back again pleased as if he had tied a bow that had come out right like the statements in his briefcase dorothy would have to make one too what she knew and didnt know left behind leon looked up from the chair youre all bastards arent you all of you tommy and he stopped too tired to follow his own thought bastards altan stared at him for a minute then nodded slowly humoring him but in a good cause he said getting up and walking to the window then turning to leon what did you think this was another echo her voice again what did you think this was in the beginning maybe not thinking at all good cause leon said his voice rough with scorn what cause altans body went still not rising to this he took out another cigarette do you know how long we have been doing this the empire should have been finished two hundred years ago more from then on there were only bad choices good for someone else maybe but bad for us how much money to borrow how much land to give up all bad choices but we survived we found a balance between the ottoman solution he said ironically i like to think its a kind of wisdom life is like that dont you think mostly bad choices all you can do is keep your balance between them you lost the empire leon said flatly altan peered at him through the smoke annoyed and we learned from that too sometimes one bad choice is worse than the other ferengi who want to use us to fight each other so we keep our eyes open now we have to know how things are its the only way to protect ourselves to know no matter what you have to do who gets killed altan shrugged its not a perfect world for whom are you in mourning leon looked away no one everyone disposable as hed been tommys gun firing at him good altan said coming back from the window its important in this workto keep a clear head he picked up the briefcase and put it on the table to open it its been interesting watching you i didnt think you could do it so many complications but no good instincts you areresourceful impossible to train someone for that my only concern was this weaknessits a mistake to form a personal attachment trusting a man like jianu of course hed take advantage try to escape that was sloppy but in the end you did what you had to do so you learn from that leon looked up another story you know i killed him so gülün said i confess i was relieved i didnt know if you were hard enough to thats not why no well it comes to the same thing he pulled out a paper for the americans whats that your statement how they killed each other why are you doing this what difference does it make to you if the americans knew how it really was theyd never trust you again this way who knows they might give you a medal i dont want a medal altan nodded or a job either theyll offer you one i think here sign but youre finished with all that reasons of health maybe he said touching his chest finished leon said waiting for the rest you cant serve two masters you might be tempted to play them off against each other two i need to trust my people your people people who work for me i think itll be good the two of us he held out a pen sign it leon stared at him the soft click of a lock turning in his head and if i dont my friend you dont want to put that gun in your hand everything changes for you it starts all over again on both sides and this time youre jianu we have better things to do he gestured again with the pen what makes you think id ever do that work for you leon the best warriors the ottomans ever had were the janissaries all foreign born all loyal they served the empire he looked over and the empire served them they were slaves only in a manner of speaking chains of selfinterest would describe it better golden chains you are the perfect janissary i dont want anything from you no there are other statements here he said reaching in and pulling out some papers for another file i thought somewhere safe the fishermans what happened at bebek jianu can no longer tell us now theres only you if a judge believes you he pulled out more paper gülüns other statement so puzzling what reason could you possibly have for shooting jianu selfdefense a man lying there without a gun of course other statements can be arranged from people on the bridge so theres no doubt now two men killed bebek the bridge think how many stories we could make up to link them perhaps you have one of your own but the facts will be that you were there both places and killed both men he stopped leon even with bad choices there are worse choices leon stared down at the paper the one that said he hadnt done anything at all a story of good intentions im not a traitor yes i know the good patriot leon we want the americans to protect us i dont ask you to work against them just what people say at parties leon said sarcastic well the foreign community its true we like to have ears there but theyre leaving istanbul the wars over were not a second looking for the word strategic anymore if only the russians would go too but no so we need other ears their turkish friends some of them you already know friends of georg what do they say to them a foreigner who speaks turkisha valuable asset an american working for me no turk would ever suspect and resourceful think of it this way its what you would do for the americans except you do it for me unofficial the way you like to work he paused the air still for me but not against them you have my word your word leon said almost laughing yes my word altan said nodding to the papers not gülüns not the fishermans none of them mine you have that so you see what a perfect janissary arrangement it will be we will have an obligation to each other sign please leon took the pen and now you should rest altan said glancing at his watch then at leon as he wrote a hasty scribble his head down as if he didnt want anyone to see obstbaum will be angry with me would you like help to the bed no altan put the statement in the briefcase so we understand each other you know im looking forward to this he began moving to the door one thing he said stopping you dont mind a personal curiosity who did shoot mr king leon said nothing for a second how long ago had it been then he met altans eyes i did altan tilted his head a little surprised you he said but why selfdefense altan started to smile as if leon had said something clever then rolled his eyes a genial salute of course selfdefense he nodded leaving its as lily says an istanbullu later lying in bed he looked for a wall clock and realized he had entered annas timeless world there were no hours at the clinic no days each the same as before all continuous thoughts came out of sequence at random with no purpose beyond themselves unless you tried to follow them he had been thinking of the blue tiles at the çinili camii the way they shaded into turquoise and gray and he wondered if he was really thinking about kay or just the perfect peace of the courtyard that day sitting near the fountain kay telling him he could never really belong here asking questions for frank but at some point she had stopped maybe even that day he would have known felt it when theyd gone back to laleli it was important to remember that she had stopped maybe the night of the party when things changed watching him with georg he saw the round face again shiny with sweat and fear apologizing the last thing he did in his life too late to change but did anyone even given the chance he saw other faces barbara and ed touched by death and going on as before and he saw how it would be for him back to days at the office furtive thursdays with marina drinks at the park the nightly brandy at cihangir with his war memorial of photographs all the same except for the meetings with altan the deceit that would give an edge to all the rest then eat away at it until nothing else was left visits to anna with nothing to say because everything in his life was now secret even from her he swung out of bed backing against it until he was no longer dizzy then took hold of the iv rack and moved it with him in the hall just the dim nightlights and soft sibilant turkish coming from the nurses station something about the supervisor changing their shifts ordinary life he had put on slippers and now slid quietly over the waxed linoleum at the end annas room had the usual light near the floor some moon coming through she opened her eyes when he touched her hand dont be frightened i know its late i couldnt come before now that she had registered the disturbance the hand touching her she retreated eyes blank thinking what maybe everyone at obstbaums had the same mental life stray thoughts out of order im down the hall he said are you surprised i never thought id be here did you he stopped like talking to a child not what hed come for what they could do anymore ed and barbara going on as before but it wasnt before im going to sit down he said i get tired he pulled the chair nearer to the bed theres so much to tell im not sure where to start he sat for a minute staring trying to find a narrative then gave it up the funny thing is he said slowly sitting back i thought i was doing the right thing each time when i helped him in the water i never even thought about it how could you do anything else and then when i shot him each time i thought it was the right thing to do but it couldnt have been could it both he looked up as if she had said something then nodded he asked i was the only one he had left to ask so what does that make me not that anybody cares he wasnt what he thought of him in the hamam showing his scars his face in the doorway on the way down from laleli already a death mask a good man he finished the opposite the opposite repeating it convincing himself still i used to think i was but who gets to say ive been thinking about that who gets to say he rubbed the bandage over the iv on the back of his hand the thought circling during the war its okay killing people then its not can you turn it off just like that like some switch in peoples heads once you start he looked up again but she hadnt moved her face smooth not a line anyway its done you dont get to do it over his eyes went to the window any of it i guess everything youve done drifting thoughts out of sequence again i met somebody he pulled back hearing kays voice she wouldnt like it i thought that was right too and stealing the money everything and now another minute the silence like sleep it just happened meeting her i didnt plan it he made a face she did i guess i dont know but thenshe didnt expect anyway she said so this thought getting away too his mind wandering out to the garden where he and alexei had stood watching the dark room saying goodbye but there was something else important do you believe someone can lie he said and still tell the truth his face still turned to the window lie about things but not the two of you what happens between you that has to be the truth doesnt it or we wouldnt have anything even for a while he stopped aware that he was talking out loud that she might actually have heard something she couldnt hear he turned back to her covering it the rest i dont know thats a funny thing too i wanted tommy to give me a job and now ive got it but not for him he leaned forward we need to think about what to do work for altanits not illegal exactly but its something and it wont stay that way whatever he says he wants me to think i can get away with it everything but the minute hes finished with me alexeis lemon now theyre all bastards all of them they throw people away our side too he looked up but even so he thought of phil kneeling with the ground crew we have to leave istanbul he said his voice firmer planning he thinks im trapped but he doesnt know about the money the rest of it just sitting there nobody knows we can use it to get out there are waysthats what ive been doing i can do it im resourceful he said a rueful joke to himself we could go to italy help mihai with his boats again anywhere we could go home he leaned over but her eyes were just as still as before and looking at them he saw that there wasnt any home just where they already were inbetween it wouldnt be hard to do if you came back he said for me to arrange things altan wouldnt suspect and what could he do once we were gone you cant want to stay there wherever you are and id be with you id never leave you you know that she knew that she knew that about me we could and then he was suddenly out of breath leaning back against the chair knowing that none of it was going to happen that all the plans were just a last defiant wriggle before altans chains settled around him i thought it was all for the best something i could do he said quietly for the war no not just that exciting i thought it would be exciting be one of those people at the park feeling a tightening around his chest not fear something staring at him implacable his new life there wouldnt be any starting over no new evenings together in cihangir what would there be to say both of them locked in silence for their own reasons even here having to be careful everywhere anna lost to him now too then for only a second he thought he saw her finger move maybe sensing it feeling it with him the way it would be and he reached over and covered her hand its going to be all right really he said quickly reassuring this is the best place for you and when youre better dont worry about altan i can handle him hes no worse than the rest look at tommy i just have to keep him interested you learn these things and actually im good at this thats why he i dont want you to worry about anything holding her hand tighter his voice bright making conversation keeping everything from her now not just kay everything hed have to do you always liked it here and you know a janissary if he played his cards right could become an important man wouldnt that be a kick in the head the last thing we expected but bubbling keeping her spirits up away from the rest and wed still have the money if we need it so theres nothing to worry about well be fine he stroked her hand you know on the bridge when i saw your face you looked just the way you did when we first met so that must mean something dont you think nothings changed he paused not for you he looked away out to the garden itll be spring soon in a month the judas trees outside would start to blossom all along the bosphorus you could come back for that he said he waited a minute for an answer and then nobody said anything at all authors note the horrors of străuleşti the sinking of the struma ira hirschmanns heroic work for the war refugee board rescuing european jews and the tireless efforts of mossad le aliyah bet committee for illegal immigration are all matters of historical record and appear here only as background the events and people in istanbul passage are fiction much has changed in istanbul since the city now sprawls beyond its hills to accommodate an estimated eleven million more people old tram lines have been discontinued the fabled park hotel was torn down to build a parking garage with the same fabled view robert college is now bosphorus university street names have changed the old rue de pera had already become the istiklal caddesi but now aya paşa caddesi where leon lived is ismet inönü caddesi etc word spellings in a country that has used a western alphabet only since keep taking new forms haghia sophia or aya sofya abdülhammit or abdul hamid meyhanes or mihanyes alternative spellings extend into the balkans too the black sea port may be constancia or constanţa and its country romania rumania or roumania given all this my hope was to use only those place names and word forms current in but source materials show the same variants and inconsistencies so in the end the usage here is whatever i felt would be most familiar to the reader or sometimes just personal preference of course as any grateful visitor to istanbul knows much has not changed sinans beautiful buildings still give the city its timeless profile and the fishermen and simit sellers still line galata bridge about the author joseph kanon is the author of five previous novels stardust alibi the good german the prodigal spy and los alamos alibi won the
