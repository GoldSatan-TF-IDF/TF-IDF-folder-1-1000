harry turtledove fort pillow i jackson tennessee was a town laid out with big things in mind the first streets were ninety feet wide the first courthouse was built of logs back at the start of the s now more than forty years later buildings of red and gray brick prevailed oaks and elms helped shade those broad streets the madison county seat had not flourished quite so much as its founders hoped still with the forked deer river running through the town and two railroads meeting there jackson was modestly prosperous or a bit more than modestly it was a considerable market for lumber and furs and produce from the farms in the forked deer valley when civil war tore the united states in two jackson went back and forth between union and confederacy several times confederate general beauregard made his headquarters there in early from that summer to the following spring jackson lived under the stars and stripes as one of us grants supply depots then nathan bedford forrests cavalry ran the yankees out again in june us general hatch defeated the confederate garrison and reoccupied the town now in april forrest was back and the stainless banner replaced the us flag forrest had his headquarters in the duke home on main street two years earlier grant had stayed in the same two story georgian colonial house the dukes were happier to accommodate the confederate cavalry commander than they had been to host his opponent in blue although forrest went to church on sunday morning he did not treat the sabbath as a day of rest for one thing he couldnt afford to for another his driving energy made him hate idleness at any time he paced back and forth across the dukes parlor like a caged catamount boots clumping on the rugs and thumping on the oak planks of the floor he was a big man two inches above six feet towering over the other confederate officers in the room he could have beaten any of them in a fight with any weapons or none he knew it and they knew it it gave him part of his power over them though his chin beard was graying his wavy hair had stayed dark his blue eyes could go from blizzard cold to incandescent in less than a heartbeat i wrote to bishop polk last week that i was going to take fort pillow he said he had a back country accent but a voice that could expand at need to fill any room or any battlefield i reckon we can go about doing it now all the pieces are in place his aide de camp captain charles anderson nodded yes sir he said general bufords raising cain up in kentucky and weve got enough men looking busy down by memphis to keep the damnyankees there from moving north along the mississippi about time we gave that garrison what it deserves forrest said past time by god niggers and homemade yankees he scowled at the idea wonder which is worse anderson said beats me nathan bedford forrests scowl deepened that black men should take up arms against whites turned every assumption on which the confederate states of america were founded upside down and inside out you sooner get bit by a cottonmouth or a rattlesnake dr j b cowan the chief surgeon on forrests staff looked up from his cup of sassafras tea no he said id sooner not the concise medical opinion made forrest and the rest of his staff officers laugh but mirth did not stay on the commanding generals face for long most of the white union troops in fort pillow were tennesseans themselves enemy soldiers from a state that belonged in the confederacy when they came out of their works they plundered the people who should have been their countrymen if half of what forrest heard was true they did worse than that to the womenfolk and so well move then forrest said captain anderson yes sir colonel mccullochs brigade is at sharons ferry along the forked deer right forrest said anderson nodded forrest went on and general bells got his brigade up at eaton in gibson county he waited charles anderson nodded again yes sir thats where he was last we heard from him forrest waved dismissively yankees havent got enough men up there to shift him so thats where hes at all right how many soldiers you reckon mcculloch and bell put together have andersons eyes took on a faraway look under his mustache his lips moved silently he wore a neat beard much like bedford forrests id say about fifteen hundred sir bout what i ciphered out for myself wanted to make sure you were with me forrests gaze sharpened now captain how many yankees dyou suppose fort pillow holds it cant have half that many this time anderson didnt hesitate though he did add theyve got a gunboat out in the river to support the place thats bluff country forrest said gunboat wont be able to see up high enough to do em much good send orders to mcculloch and bell captain get em moving tomorrow i want them to hit fort pillow first thing tuesday morning we will take it away from the united states and we will free this part of tennessee from yankee oppression yes sir anderson said once more general bell in overall command no general chalmers forrest made a sour face hed tried to have james chalmers posted somewhere other than under his command but hed been overruled both here in the west and by the war department in richmond chalmers was a good better than a good cavalry officer but not respectful enough of those set above him in that way and in some others he was more than a little like forrest himself though he had the education his superior lacked ill draft the orders sir and ill send them out as soon as you approve them captain anderson said good thats good tell general bell especially not to sit around there lollygagging hes got a long way to travel if hes going to get there by morning after next hed better set out just as fast as he can andersons pen scratched across a sheet of paper ill make it very plain forrests aide de camp promised forrest nodded anderson was a good writer a confident writer he made things sound the way they were supposed to as for forrest himself he would sooner pick up a snake than a pen fort pillow was not a prime post when it rained as it was raining this monday morning lieutenant mack leamings barracks leaked pots and bowls on the floor caught the drips the plink and splat of water falling into them was often better at getting men of the thirteenth tennessee cavalry us out of bed than reveille would have been one of the troopers in the regiment swore as he sat up listen to that for a while and you reckon youve got to piss even if you just went and did he grumbled piss on the rebs said the fellow in the next cot pipe down both of you leaming hissed he was about twenty five with a round face surprisingly innocent blue eyes and a scraggly corn yellow mustache that curled down around the corners of his mouth some of the boys are still sleeping snores proved him right quite a few of the boys were older than he was the buglers horn sounded a few minutes later some of the men slept in their uniforms the ones whod stripped to their long johns climbed into federal blue once more some of them had worn gray earlier in the war most of those troopers were all the more eager to punish backers of the confederacy a few perhaps might put on gray again if they saw the chance leaming chuckled softly as he pulled on his trousers that wouldnt be so easy the united states wanted men whod fought for the other side to return to the fold the confederates were less forgiving in places like western tennessee the war wasnt country against country it was neighbor against neighbor friend against former friend some of the troopers wore government issue kepis more used broad brimmed slouch hats that did a better job of keeping the rain out of their faces come on boys leaming said lets get out there for roll call dont want to keep major bradford waiting bill bradford was a man with pull the thirteenth tennessee cavalry was his creation recruitment and promotion were informal in these parts since bradford came into us service with a lot of men riding behind him that won him the gold oak leaves on his shoulder straps and hed made an able enough commander so far pulling his own slouch hat down low over his eyes mack leaming went outside along with the thirteenth tennessee cavalry four companies of heavy artillery and a section of light artillery were lining up for roll call and inspection leaming lips skinned back from his teeth in a mirthless grin the artillerymen came from colored outfits the officers and senior sergeants were white men but the men they led had been slaves till they decided to take up arms against the whites whod held them in bondage and who wanted to keep on doing it nigger soldiers leaming thought he didnt like fighting on the same side as black men in arms he was no nigger lover even if he fought for the usa a negro with a springfield in his hands went dead against everything the south stood for leaming also wondered if the blacks would fight if they could fight they looked impressive enough they were on average both older and taller than the men in his own regiment they drilled smartly going through their evolutions with smooth precision but could they fight hed believe it when he saw it major booth who commanded them seemed to have no doubts leaming might have trouble taking colored troops seriously nobody in his right mind though could lightly dismiss lionel booth he was a veteran of the regular army his face weathered though he was only in his mid twenties one cheek scarred by a bullet crease though he and his men came up from memphis only a couple of weeks before he was senior in grade to major bradford and in overall command at fort pillow back when the war was new confederate general gideon pillow ordered the first chickasaw bluff of the mississippi fortified with customary modesty he named the position after himself as the crow flew fort pillow lay not quite forty miles north of memphis following the rivers twists and turns the crow would have flown twice as far near enough general pillow didnt think small when he built his works his line ran for a couple of miles from coal creek on the north to the mississippi on the west the next confederate officer who had to try to hold the place built a shorter line inside the one pillow laid out that didnt do any good either when the confederates in the west fell back in federal troops occupied fort pillow the us army kept nothing but the tip of the triangle between the mississippi and coal creek the present earthworks protected only the bluffs at the apex of the triangle and ran for perhaps four hundred feet the federals did keep pickets in rifle pits dug along the second shorter confederate line these days six pieces of field artillery aided the defenders two six pounders two twelve pounders and two ten pounder parrott long guns they were newly arrived with the colored troops from the sixth us heavy artillery and second us light artillery having come under artillery fire leaming liked it no better than anyone else in his right mind he assumed the confederates felt the same way major bradford strode up in front of the drawn up ranks of cavalrymen leaming saluted him all men present and accounted for sir he said military formality sounded good outside the perimeter defined by the soldiers in the rifle pits where would the troopers of the thirteenth tennessee cavalry go if they didnt ride out in force they were asking to get bushwhacked to get knocked over the head and tipped into the mississippi or buried in shallow graves with their throats cut thank you lieutenant bradford returned leamings salute with a grand flourish he enjoyed being a major he didnt much enjoy losing command of the fort to major booth he couldnt do anything about it though not unless he wanted to arrange an accident for the younger man nodding to leaming he said have the men fall out for sick call fall out for sick call leaming echoed four or five men did one of them shifted uncomfortably from foot to foot sir permission to visit the latrines he said when leaming nodded he scurried away most of the sick men probably had some kind of flux of the bowels camp in one place for a while and that would happen no matter how careful you were bad air or something leaming thought doctors couldnt do much about it an opium plug might slow down the shits for a while if you were already plugged up the surgeon would give you a bluemass suppository instead leaming didnt know what the hell blue mass was by the way it shifted whatever you had inside you he suspected it was related to gunpowder after roll call he went up to bradford and asked any word of trouble from the rebs not here the other officer shook his head i reckon general hurlbut started seeing shadows under his bed thats all why else would he send us all those darnn niggers he had even less use for them than leaming did worried about forrest i expect leaming said way he chased fielding hurst into memphis colonel hursts sixth tennessee cavalry us had had the misfortune of running into a detachment from forrests force not long before hursts men were rough and tough and nasty they needed to be like the thirteenth they were homemade yankees and the hand of every secesh man in the state was raised against them however rough tough and nasty they were they couldnt stand up to forrests troopers major bradford chuckled unkindly i hear tell hurst ran away so hard he galloped right out from under his hat what could be more fun than hashing over another outfits shortcomings i hear tell he left his white mistress behind leaming said and his colored one too now bradford laughed a dirty laugh he had to have variety unless he put em both in the same bed at the same time with a sigh he pulled his mind back to matters military but anyway forrest isnt anywhere near here hes off at jackson and thats got to be seventy miles away i was talking with one of the officers who came up with the coons leaming said you know what forrest had the nerve to do son of a bitch has the nerve to do damn near anything thats what makes him such a nuisance major bradford said what is it this time he sent memphis a bill for the five thousand and however many dollars colonel hurst squeezed out of jackson while he held it leaming said bradford laughed again this time on a different note he better not hold his breath till he gets it thats all ive got to say hell be a mighty blue man in a gray uniform if he does besides thats not all hurst has squeezed out of the rebs not even close dont i know it mack leaming spoke more in admiration than anything else colonel fielding hurst had turned the war into a profitable business for himself people said hed taken more than from confederate sympathizers in western tennessee leaming couldnt have said if that was true but he wouldnt have been surprised the thirteenth tennessee cavalry had done its share of squeezing too but the sixth was way ahead of it so anyhow major bradford went on i dont reckon weve got to do a whole lot of worrying about bedford forrest right this minute sounds good to me sir leaming said corporal jack jenkins had always hated federals riding along these miserable roads in the rain did nothing to make him like them any better jenkins yawned in the saddle the order from jackson had reached tyree bells brigade in eaton in the middle of the night bell got his men in motion by midnight black as the inside of a hog somebody near jenkins grumbled black as a niggers heart somebody else added the horses hooves plopped in the mud plenty of niggers in fort pillow jenkins said plenty of niggers and plenty of tennessee tories he had no more love for the men from his state who clove to the dsa than did any other tennessean who followed the csa keep em moving come on keep em moving that was clark barteau colonel of the second tennessee cavalry cs you want those damn missourians to get there ahead of us protected by the darkness somebody said have a heart colonel they aint got as far to ride as we do had barteau been able to see who was complaining he would have made the trooper sorry for it as things were he said and you bet your life they didnt set out as fast as we did either sons of bitches are likely asleep in nice warm beds even now weve got to work harder but well make all this hard work payoff aint that right nobody said no not out loud men recognized a loaded question when they heard one too much growling and people would get in trouble even if the officers couldnt see who was doing it they recognized voices and they knew who was in the habit of saying what he thought when mccullochs brigade does get moving i reckon hell say hustle it up you want them bastards from tennessee and mississippi to get there first jenkins said he didnt pitch his voice to carry several soldiers close by laughed one of them repeated it for a pal who hadnt heard the pal passed it on it made its way down the line of horsemen jenkins hadnt particularly meant it for a joke he knew how officers got men to do what they wanted you had to coax and cajole everybody in a cavalry regiment knew everybody else people had grown up as friends and neighbors you couldnt just give an order not even the damnyankees could get away with that very often you had to give a reason keep people sweet jack jenkins was not feeling sweet the horse in front of his kept kicking up mud hed got splattered a couple of times once right in the face but he had to stay close behind in this dripping darkness he could easily lose the road and if he did how many men would follow him to nowhere up in a tree an owl hooted unhappily it couldnt like the weather any better than he did with raindrops pattering down it couldnt hear scurrying mice and it couldnt see them either nobody could see anything here come on colonel barteau called keep moving got to keep moving yall want to learn the homemade yankees a lesson right you bet colonel was that a trooper who really did feel like punishing the federal soldiers in fort pillow or was it some lieutenant pretending to be a cheery soldier jenkins couldnt tell which made him suspect the worst he was hardened to the saddle but a ride like this took its toll when he finally dismounted he knew he would walk like a spavined chimpanzee for a while one more reason to take it out on the coons and the galvanized yankees in fort pillow he thought and rode on maybe ulysses s grant was prouder of the three stars on his shoulder straps than benjamin robinson was of the three stripes on his left sleeve but maybe he wasnt too no doubt grant had risen from humble beginnings he was a tanners son hed failed at everything he tried till the war began only the fighting gave him a chance to rise and the same was also true of sergeant ben robinson next to him though u s grant had started out a nobleman ben robinson was born a slave on an indigo plantation not far outside of charleston south carolina hed heard the big guns boom when the confederates shelled fort sumter not long after that his master ran short of cash and sold him and several other hands to a dealer who resold them at a tidy profit to a cotton planter with a farm outside of jackson mississippi not without pride ben knew hed brought the dealer more money than any of the other hands he was somewhere around thirty six feet one and close to two hundred pounds and he worked hard or as hard as any slave was likely to work seeing that he wasnt working for himself once drunk his new owner told him if all niggers was like you ben wed have a hell of a time keeping slaves the white man didnt remember it the next morning ben robinson never forgot it he probably would have run off anyway when federal troops got down to corinth mississippi hed long been sure he could run his own life better than any white man could run it for him but finding out that his master more or less agreed with him sure didnt hurt hed been a stevedore a roustabout a strong back for the yankees too till they started signing up colored soldiers he was one of the first men to volunteer even the very limited very partial freedom he had as a laborer struck him as worth fighting for his size and strength got him accepted at once and along with the good head on his shoulders they got him promoted not once but twice officers in the sixth us heavy artillery were all white most of the sergeants were white too for a colored man to get his third stripe was no mean feat ben robinson had heard that there actually were a handful of negro officers in the us army there was even a major a man named martin delany but hed been born in the usa and educated like a white man for somebody whod started out a field hand and who still couldnt write his name sergeant was a long long climb a soldier in robinsons company tossed a well gnawed hambone on the ground is you a pig nate the sergeant called way you leaves your rubbish all over i reckon mebbe you is take it back to the kitchen an throw it out there nathan hunter scowled at him is you happy you gits to play the white man over me a lot of negro soldiers preferred to take orders from whites not from their own kind it was as if theyd been taking orders from white men for so many generations that seemed natural to them but if another black man told them what to do they saw him as a cheap imitation of the real thing dont want to be no white man robinson meant that from the bottom of his soul all the same he tapped his chevrons with his right hand dont got to be no white man neither all i gots to be is a sergeant an i am this here place bad enough if we do try an keep it halfway clean ifn we dont we might as well be pigs fo true still scowling hunter picked up the bone and carried it away ben robinson nodded to himself military punishments werent so harsh as the lashes a master or an overseer could deal out quite a few of the men in the sixth us heavy artillery joined the army with stripes on their backs but marching back and forth with a heavy plank on your shoulder or sitting out in the open gagged and with your hands tied behind you and your knees drawn up to your chest while they werent painful were humiliating for men whose sense of self often was still fragile stripes could be easier to bear than embarrassment although robinson had the authority to mete out such punishments himself he wouldnt have done it had he tried a soldier would have gone over his head to an officer probably straight to major booth better to let the men with shoulder straps and with white skins take care of anything really serious he walked over to the twelve pounder for which his company was responsible the smoothbore gun threw an iron ball as big as his fist a mile or hurled a round of shrapnel just as far at close range canister turned the piece into an enormous shotgun that could mow down everything in front of it ben set a proud affectionate hand on the smooth curve of the barrel almost as if it were the smoothly curved flank of a woman he loved he hadnt seen combat yet but hed practiced with the gun he knew what it could do he frowned he knew what it could do if it got the chance sergeant joe hennissey belonged to company a he had no more rank than robinson but he had white very white skin red hair and a beard the exact color of a new penny he had a better chance of getting something done than robinson did the negro waved to him reckon we got us some trouble here sergeant he said and why might that be the old sod still filled hennisseys voice to most whites an irishman was only a small step up from a negro to ben robinson looking up at the whole staircase the distinction between the irish and other whites was invisible when they made this here fort they made the goddamn parapet too thick robinson kicked at it eight or ten feet of earthwork got to be thick enough to be after keeping out the secesh cannonballs now hennissey said oh yes suh ben knew he wasnt supposed to call the other sergeant sir but he did it half the time without even thinking calling a white man sir was always safe the redheaded sergeant certainly didnt seem to mind but look here suh suppose them rebels is comin at us an suppose they gets down in the low ground under the bluff we cant git the guns down low enough depress em you mean depress em thank you kindly robinson was always glad to pick up a technical term we cant depress em enough to shoot at the rebs when they is gettin close to we almost like not havin no guns at all you know what is sayin suh hennissey scratched his beard once he started scratching he seemed to have trouble stopping he wasnt scratching for thought any more but because he itched seeing him scratch made ben want to scratch too he was lousy most of the men at the fort were we cant be doin much about where the guns are at the irishman said at last but i wouldnt worry my head about it too much ben me boy for one thing we can hit the secesh bastards while theyre still a ways away so theyll have the devils own time coming close at all at all am i right or am i wrong reckon yous right suh robinson said reckon i am too hennissey said smugly and even if them sons of bitches do come close have we got the new era down there on the river or have we not be after tellin me if youd be so kind the gunboat she there suh ben robinson agreed hennissey clapped him on the back all right then youll fret yourself no more about it will you now reckon i wont robinson said good thats good then hennissey walked away was it good then still not convinced robinson walked over to the edge of the bluff and looked down at the mississippi sure enough the gunboat floated there seen from more than four hundred feet above the river the new era seemed as small and as flimsy as a toy boat floating in a barrel of water could its presence make up for the problems with the field guns well he could hope so anyhow major william bradford was a lawyer before the war turned western tennessee upside down and inside out since then hed stayed busy doing the same thing as a lot of other tennesseans on both sides paying back anybody with whom he had a score to settle hed done a good job better than most because of that he and the troopers of the thirteenth tennessee cavalry us he led were marked men whenever they rode out of fort pillow he didnt mind if anything it made him proud they were marked men because theyd left their mark on their enemies and when those enemies also happened to be enemies of the united states well so much the better he made himself nod to lionel booth when their paths crossed good morning major he said his voice as smooth as if he were in a courtroom morning major booth replied he spoke with a missouri twang hed been a sergeant major in a missouri regiment before winning officers rank he was shorter and squatter than bradford homelier too thought the tennessean who was vain of his looks but booth was also senior to him even if younger and so commanded inside fort pillow bradford didnt like that but couldnt do anything overt about it can your niggers really fight he asked booth i expect they can the other man said and i expect they wont have to alls quiet around these parts itll likely stay that way general hurlbut doesnt think so or he wouldnt have sent you up here bradford said was that bitterness he knew damn well it was fort pillow had been his ever since the thirteenth tennessee came down from paducah in january now it wasnt any more the loss stung better not to show it though he couldnt get rid of booth however much he wished he could the senior officer shrugged when you build yourself a house youre smart to dig a storm cellar down underneath maybe you wont need it chances are you wont matter of fact but if you ever do youll need it bad so thats what we are were your storm cellar bradfords eyes flicked to the negroes whod come north a couple of weeks before they were going about their business much as any other soldiers would have they paraded smartly enough they probably marched better than the men from his own command for whom spit and polish was a distinct afterthought but marching in step didnt make their skins any less dusky or their hair any less frizzy bradford had just asked if they could fight he didnt want to do it again not in so many words he tried a different question that amounted to the same thing if bedford forrest did show up here some kind of way could we hold him off to a union man from west tennessee that was always the question a preacher face to face with the devil would have had the same worry how could he help wondering am i strong enough fielding hurst hadnt been and bradford was uneasily aware that the sixth tennessee was a bigger tougher outfit than the one he led on the other hand forrests men had caught fielding hurst out in the open the garrison here had fort pillow to protect it and lionel booth maybe because he came from missouri didnt hold forrest in the same fearful regard as local men did major if he showed up here we would whip him back to wherever he came from booth said not the tiniest trace of doubt in his voice we can hold this fort against anybody in the world in the world mind you for two days i like the sound of that bradford said which would do for an understatement till a bigger one came along no reason you shouldnt the truth always has a good sound to it major booth tipped his hat and went on his way he sounded like a preacher who was ready to wrestle with the devil all right despite his reassurances bradford hoped the devil stayed far far away he was no coward but he didnt care to borrow trouble either and nathan bedford forrest was trouble with a capital t bradford climbed up onto the earthworks enclosing the federal garrison and peered east his nerves sent him up there not his common sense he knew that the drizzle sometimes it was real rain coming down drastically shortened his range of vision he could barely make out the two rows of wooden barracks still left from the forts earlier larger incarnation let alone the rifle pits beyond them he knew those pits were there and also knew soldiers in blue manned them but they might have been a mile beyond the moon for all his eyes told him what else was out there that his eyes couldnt see from everything major booth said he didnt think any rebel soldiers were within forty miles of fort pillow bradford hoped the younger man was right and had no particular reason to think him wrong he found himself worrying even so nerves he thought again and made himself walk along the parapet for a while before coming down again a few soldiers both white and colored sent him curious looks he ignored them he seemed to ignore them anyhow lionel booth now he thought booth really was nerveless bradford envied him for that as well as for his seniority maybe such calm really did come with combat experience bradford hoped so hed raised the thirteenth tennessee cavalry only the autumn before none of the men in it had much none of them had much experience in a us uniform anyhow more than a few had fought for the confederacy before switching sides theyd ridden whichever horse looked like a winner at the moment bill bradford didnt worry about that they werent likely to change sides again nobody on the other side would trust them now whenever they came out of the fort in fact they needed to worry about bushwhackers who resented their changing sides once a colored sergeant bawled out a private for going around with filthy boots but for his dialect he sounded like every other sergeant bradford had ever heard the major wondered how often either negro had worn shoes before joining the us army not very not unless he missed his guess they had them now though and they acted like soldiers now would they act like soldiers when bullets flew and cannonballs screamed through the air bradford shook his head he had a hard time believing it he shrugged before long forrest was bound to go back down to mississippi then these coons would go away too and whether they could fight or not wouldnt matter a bit ii come on ride hard colonel robert mcculloch called as the second missouri cavalry cs squelched west toward brownsville tennessee you dont want those bastards from mississippi to get ahead of you do you matt ward laughed when he heard that how many times has black bob talked about those mississippi fellows he asked the man riding behind him he think maybe we forgot about em since ten minutes ago beats me zachary bartlett answered he was doing his best to keep a pipe going in the rain and not having much luck ward had given up trying to smoke till he got somewhere dry a splat and a hiss declared that the pipe had just taken another hit goddamn thing bartlett said without rancor goddamn rain ward said and his friend nodded he went on how long till we get to this brownsville place anyway shouldnt be much longer bartlett said hed said the same thing the last time ward asked about an hour earlier ward decided that meant he didnt know where the hell brownsville was either somewhere between jackson and fort pillow ward thought that took in what about seventy miles of ground anyway the second missouri had been riding west since before daybreak ward had done a lot of hard riding in his time this grinding slog through mud and through streams without bridges was as rough as anything hed ever tried somebodyd said bedford forrest was coming too coming after all hed started out after the second missouri headed for fort pillow could he catch up how soon was he really coming at all or was it just another rumor one of the nine million that soldiers invented and passed around to give themselves something to do and something to talk about ward didnt know he didnt waste a lot of time worrying about it either if forrest decided to ride west from jackson he did that was all if he didnt they could whip the turncoats and coons in fort pillow just fine without him general chalmers knew what he was doing and besides you own niggers zach he asked me bartlett laughed mirthlessly likely tell my wifes brother bought himself a couple three and hes so goddamn proud of it its like his shit dont stink how about you nope ward shook his head which made water drip from the brim of his slouch hat i got a cousin who does but hes down in arkansas somewhere but i reckon youve been to a slave auction or two same as i have well hell who aint been bartlett said good way to kill an afternoon even if the likes of us aint got the money to buy some of the gals are damn fine lookin too his frown looked meaner than it was for it pulled tight a knife scar at the corner of his mouth what you aimin at anyways youve seen all them niggers standing up there on the block ward said im not talking about the wenches now i mean the bucks you reckon somebody you can buy and sell like a sack of flour you reckon somebody like that can fight not so it matters his friend answered without hesitation i tell you this though any nigger who tries pointing a gun at me thats one dead nigger right there well you can sing that in church ward was slimmer and darker than bartlett and envied the other trooper his scar he didnt want to get cut or shot himself hed seen wounded men and dead men too he knew bullets and knives hurt but he wanted a mark to show the world and maybe show himself hed been to war all over the confederacy whites believed negroes couldnt fight they believed the federals were a pack of monsters for putting negroes in uniform giving them guns and letting them fight and they maintained elaborate organizations designed to crush slave uprisings before they really got started those organizations worked rebellions were suppressed so ruthlessly they didnt happen very often but having plans to put down revolts said negroes might fight after all if they ever got the chance matt ward didnt recognize the contradiction not with the top part of his mind hardly any white southerners did but it was there inescapably there and it nagged at him the way a tooth will when it hasnt started to ache yet but isnt quite right either he sensed it was there and he wished he didnt mccullochs brigade got into brownsville a little past noon riding in from the west brigadier general bells brigade had just come into town from the northwest between them the two forces stretched brownsville to overflowing quite a few negroes were on the muddy streets there seemed to be more slaves in this part of tennessee than anywhere else in the state and there must have been more still before it started slipping back and forth between the csa and the usa brunswick stew a white woman called lifting a ladle out of a covered pot wards stomach was rubbing against his backbone thank you kindly ma am he took the ladle and got his mouth around it like a snake engulfing a gopher the stew was full of potatoes and mushrooms and some kind of meat mighty fine he said when hed swallowed some of it whats in there with the vegetables squirrel the woman answered reckon weve got the best brunswick stew anywhere right here in brownsville if it wasnt rainin like this id give you a biscuit to dip in the gravy ill take anything i can get ward eyed her she was older than he was she had to be close to thirty but she wasnt bad looking he tried a smile she smiled back but not that way shed already stuck the ladle into the pot again and was offering it to somebody behind him shed give out brunswick stew she didnt seem inclined to give herself away with a shrug matt ward rode on finding out didnt cost him anything she might have been interested in a quick poke could he have got off his horse mounted her and then saddled up again fast enough not to land in trouble he thought so hed gone without for quite a while more ladies with pots of stew and rhubarb pie and other good things to eat stood at the edge of the street brownsville seemed strongly pro confederate ward wasnt surprised any place where there were lots of blacks and not very many whites the whites would want to keep them in line and that meant backing the csa he wondered what these nice women thought of the idea of nigger bucks with guns in their hands wouldnt they use those guns to outrage southern womanhood hed wanted to outrage southern womanhood himself only a couple of minutes earlier but that was different and he knew exactly how it was different too he wasnt a black up ahead black bob mcculloch was shouting a guide we need a guide to fort pillow his thick dark beard with luxuriant mustaches that almost swallowed his mouth helped give him his nickname i should say you do a woman told him all the swamps and bogs and marshes and i dont know what all between here and the mississippi youd get lost fastern greased lightning if you tried to go without one yes maam the brigade commander lowered his voice to answer her then raised it again to a bellow that could carry across a battlefield a guide we need a guide other officers took up the call till brownsville seemed to echo with it mter what the local woman said ward hoped they found one if they bogged down he didnt want to think about what general forrest would do to them then he was far more afraid of his own commanding officer than of the damnyankees and he wasnt ashamed to admit it i can get you there the answer came almost from matt wards elbow the man who made it looked as if hed been through the mill he wore a collarless shirt with no jacket and a ragged pair of homespun trousers his eyes were wild in a pale face his hair stuck out in all directions who the devil are you ward said my name is shaw wj shaw the wild eyed man replied that bradford son of a bitch had me shut up in fort pillow till yesterday i managed to sneak off and i just got here this morning you bet i can take you back there give me a rifle and ill shoot some of those bastards myself he wanted to do it the eagerness all but blazed off him it was so hot matt ward was surprised shaw didnt steam in the rain the trooper raised his voice colonel hey colonel heres your man i reckon black bob mcculloch had to fight his way back against the tide of cavalrymen moving west even when he shouted at the men to get out of his way they couldnt always and quite a few of them werent inclined to either confederate soldiers were always convinced they were just as good and just as smart as the officers who led them when mcculloch finally did get to talk with w shaw he didnt need long to decide that shaw was the man they needed give this man some food he yelled get him a horse get him a good horse goddammit get him a rifle and some cartridges much obliged sir shaw said with his mouth full one of the ladies on the street was feeding him brunswick stew ill pay you back for your kindness and ill pay that bradford shitheel back too only the other way oh you bet i will mr shaw we aim to be at fort pillow by sunup tomorrow morning mcculloch said you lead us there on time and well be in your debt sir not the other way around i can do it but youll have to ride through the night shaw said youre damn near forty miles away you know mcculloch nodded oh yes mr shaw i know that very well but wherever you go well go with you you dont need to worry about that not one bit some of us rode all through last night if we have to do it again to clear those niggers and homemade yankees out of fort pillow we will colonel we have a bargain wj shaw stuck out his hand robert mcculloch leaned down in the saddle to clasp it shaw went on id be honored to join this force not just to guide it and wed be honored to have you mcculloch replied you do what you say you can do and you wont join as a soldier either youll be an officer straight from the start thats right kind of you shaw said right kind somebody led up one of the remounts not a great horse but not an old screw either he swung up into the saddle colonel mcculloch nodded so did matt ward a glance was plenty to show that shaw knew what to do on horseback black bob thumped ward on the shoulder reckon you found us a good one matt before ward could answer the colonel cocked his head to one side he looked east something going on back there you make out what ward looked back the way hed come too somebody was a broad grin spread across his face general forrests here sir nathan bedford forrest stayed happy about sending someone else off to deal with fort pillow while he stayed behind in jackson for about ten minutes after that he started to fume after that he started another round of restless pacing and after that he could feel that he was wearing himself down if you want something done right do it yourself he muttered there in the parlor of the house that had held general grant and now held him hed lived by that notion his whole life long hed had to since his father died young and left him the man of a large family hed farmed that way hed bought and sold slaves that way and hed got rich doing it too and hed used the same rule when he was on the memphis city council not long before the war and hed used that rule when he fought hed enlisted as a private now less than three years later he was a major general he had no formal military training he had next to no formal education of any sort which was why he so disliked picking up a pen he couldnt hold a train of thought when he wrote and he spelled by ear he knew no other way to do it but he also knew educated men laughed when someone spelled that way if he hated anything it was being laughed at but regardless of whether he could spell he could damn well fight hed whipped uncounted officers trained at west point they all thought the same way they all did the same things they all looked for their foes to do the same things when somebody did something different they didnt know how to cope with it he had nothing against jim chalmers except his forrestlike problem with subordination the virginian made as good a division commander as he had in the end though forrest lost the struggle with himself if you want something done right do it yourself he shouted for captain anderson and dr cowan and the rest of his staff officers what the devil are we sitting around here for he shouted we need to get them damnyankees and our runaway niggers out of fort pillow the surgeon held out his hand to forrests chief of staff told you so he said anderson ruefully passed him a brown confederate banknote forrest turned away so they wouldnt see him smile so cowan had expected he wouldnt be able to stay away from a fight had he well theyd all served with him for a while now surgeon and chief of staff paymaster and engineering officer and the more junior men as well they had a pretty good notion of how he thought he swung back toward them what are you waiting for he said get your horses saddled up weve got some powerful riding to do if were going to catch up with mccullochs brigade dr j b cowan gave him a courtly bow sir most of us have our horses ready weve been waiting on you well shit forrest said and the officers laughed he went on while im saddling my beast gather up as much of the nineteenth tennessee cavalry as you can well take some of colonel wisdoms regiment along with us so nobody can say we just came along for the fight even if we did dr cowan enjoyed poking fun at him and probably did it more than anyone else had the nerve to even if we did forrest agreed goodnaturedly come on lets move riding hurt it had for some time now and he feared it would till the end of his days hed taken several wounds including one at shiloh the doctors had thought would kill him and one from the pistol of a junior officer of his hed thought that one had killed him and hed given the lieutenant a knife wound in the belly that brought his end from blood poisoning forrest himself meanwhile went on he went on and no one but he knew the price he paid john bell hood had lost an arm at gettysburg and a leg at chickamauga and was a slave to laudanum to hold the pain at bay forrest a stranger to whiskey and tobacco had no more to do with opium in any form if he hurt he hurt and he went on on days when he hurt badly he was apt to be meaner than usual if he met the federals on those days he took it out on them hed lost track of how many us soldiers hed killed himself something on the order of a couple of dozen he didnt think any other general officer on either side could come close to matching his score if no yankees were close by when the pain got bad his own men had to walk soft forrest patted his horses neck as he rode west mccullochs troopers had left the road a chewed up ribbon of mud like any good cavalryman forrest took care of his mount before he took care of himself when he wasnt in combat when he was he wasnt sure whether hed had more horses shot out from under him than hed killed damnyankees it was close one way or the other bullets that hit the horses were mostly meant for him he didnt intend to let himself get killed till he whipped the invaders from the north out of the confederate states too bad for the animals but the country needed him more than it needed them invaders he said and then something more sulfurous still the garrison in fort pillow wasnt even made up of invaders yankees at least fought for their own side you could respect that even if you thought theyd chosen a bad cause but the men of the thirteen tennessee cavalry us what could you call them but traitors they sold out their own land to join the enemy some of them had fought for him in earlier campaigns maybe they thought they could lord it over their friends and neighbors and kin if they switched sides maybe they just thought theyd get easier duty and better rations if they wore blue instead of butternut whatever they thought he aimed to show them just how big a mistake they were making as for the rest of the soldiers in fort pillow forrest muttered again loud enough to make captain anderson send him a curious glance angrily nathan bedford forrest shook his head negroes had no business being soldiers and the damnyankees had no business trying to turn them into soldiers negroes were property like horses and mules and cattle if any man believed that to the bottom of his soul bedford forrest did how not when hed got rich trading in them if you put horses and mules and cattle into blue uniforms and gave them rifles could they fight of course not the idea was ridiculous nigger soldiers were just as ridiculous to forrest he hated the yankees who armed negroes and tried to train them to fight not the blacks themselves he wouldnt have been surprised if some of the bucks in fort pillow had been through his slave pens in memphis one time or another he had no trouble with blacks as long as they worked in the fields or in the kitchen or somewhere like that deep down in his belly he was convinced northerners didnt know anything about negroes or they wouldnt try to put weapons in their hands how could they know when they didnt live side by side with them the way southern whites did his own slaves had gone to war with him as teamsters and jacks of all trades hed promised to free them when the fighting was over which no doubt went a long way toward keeping them quiet in three years of warfare only a handful had seized any of the countless chances to run off he took that to mean they were satisfied with their lot if it also meant they were scared to death of him well that wasnt so bad and why shouldnt they be most of the federal soldiers who ran up against his dragoons oh the confederates called them cavalry but they mostly fought on foot they used horses to get where they were going in a hurry were scared to death of them and of him too he got into brownsville about two in the afternoon brigadier general chalmers greeted him with a half sour might have known you couldnt stay away might have known it myself forrest allowed the first word came out mought he was a rich and famous backwoodsman but a backwoodsman all the same he said fit when he meant fought too and had several other turns of phrase that marked him for what he was he lost no sleep over it to his way of thinking a man could be a gentleman without sounding as if he had a mouth full of butter he got straight to business you find a guide to take us through the swamps and such sure did chalmers answered shaw he shouted when forrest found out major bradford had held w j shaw in fort pillow he sharply questioned the man the last thing he wanted was a homemade yankee deliberately turned loose to lead his men astray and bog them down he didnt need long to decide shaw was nothing of the sort what the guide felt toward bill bradford was what any good tennessean should feel for the traitors who wore blue as far as forrest was concerned good enough mr shaw he said setting his left hand the one he counted of higher worth for he was left handed on the guides shoulder lets go catch us some federals ill get you there general shaws eyes glowed with pride so did nathan bedford forrests with hunger jack jenkins yawned as his horse pushed on through the darkness hed been in the saddle for twenty four hours more or less he didnt think hed ever been so weary he hoped the horse didnt founder it had carried him for a whole day and they still had hours to go before they reached fort pillow somebody in front of him said reckon well surprise the damnyankees when we hit em jesus christ we better jenkins said nobodyd reckon we could come so far so fast wouldnt believe it myself if i wasnt doin it hope that shaw fella knows where hes goin the other trooper said jenkins had no idea who he was he couldnt see the man at all and made out his horse only as a vague blur splashes and drips and hoofbeats did a good job of disguising the other mans voice and no doubt jenkinss too not knowing who he was didnt mean disagreeing with him not when he spoke such plain good sense if he doesnt were up the creek jenkins said in this part of western tennessee that might be literally true the hatchie river bottoms people called the country between brownsville and fort pillow mississippi had some swamps and sloughs and marshes that seemed to go on forever this country struck jack jenkins as being as bad as any farther south and all the worse at black black midnight one thing said the talkative trooper up ahead of jenkins dont reckon we got to worry about any niggers gettin ahead of us and warnin the garrison i should hope not jenkins agreed nobody could go fastern we are hell i dont see how were goin as quick as we are as if to underscore that a wet branch smacked him in the face as he spluttered the other soldier said not likely no but you never can tell what some crazy coon might try an do but i dont figure any niggerd go around after dark in these parts hed be sure a hantd get him another branch tried to yank the hat off jenkinss head only a quick desperate grab saved it he jammed it town tighter with luck the next branch wouldnt be so lucky weather like this country like this god damn if i dont halfway believe in hants myself he said plenty of whites raised by negro mammies and wet nurses soaked up slaves superstitions almost as readily as pickaninnies did the only people whod raised jack jenkins and his brothers and sisters were his father and mother and his mothers bachelor brother they were hardscrabble farmers too poor to do anything but dream of owning slaves of their own that didnt mean jenkins didnt know about hants he heard about them from his white friends and from the colored boys who fished in the creeks side by side with him with kids the lines of separation between whites and blacks werent so sharp as they were once people grew up if a negro boy was more likely to wear ragged clothes and go without shoes than his white counterpart the white might be inclined to jealousy not to thinking he was only a slave and not worth wasting much money on so maybe things did haunt these woods and swamps jenkins couldnt swear they didnt but he knew bedford forrest rode somewhere toward the rear of this column jenkins didnt and wouldnt believe any hant ever hatched could shift old bedford drain lake river spring lake big slough the names came out of the night as if hants wheezed them forth somebody said the rivers and creeks were full of bigmouthed black bass jack jenkinss mouth filled with spit when he heard that no time for fishing now though no time for anything but riding soft marshy ground close by the countless streams woods wherever the land climbed a little higher down by the hatchie and the smaller streams that flowed into it cypresses stood tall some of them actually grew in the water their knees sticking up to help support them cypresses made jenkins shiver in the language of flowers they stood for mourning and death maybe that was as foolish as letting fear of hants keep you inside after dark but maybe it wasnt too on higher ground oaks and beeches supplanted the cypresses vines hung down from them jenkins got more than one wet slap in the chops brush and ferns crowded close to the trails sometimes it was hard to make out what was trail and what was undergrowth without wj shaw the confederate troopers might well have lost themselves in the swamps even with him there were times during that seemingly endless night when jenkins thought they were lost in darkness absolute with no moon or stars overhead how could you tell where west lay shaw seemed able to or at least was confident he could had such a lean muscular column fifteen hundred mounted men ever penetrated this country by night before by the way the animals reacted jack jenkins would have bet against it wild hogs tied deep into the woods grunting and squealing the thought of roast pork made jenkinss stomach growl hed eaten a couple of bites of brunswick stew and a weevily hardtack biscuit when they rode through brownsville but that was quite a while ago now bobcats yowled when they ran away raccoons made eerie noises that sounded almost as if they ought to be speech and once an owl glided by all ghostly not more than two feet in front of jenkinss startled face its wings were silent as a bug inside cotton batting had he blinked while it flew past he never would have known it was there what else lived in these woods deer and bear without a doubt the deer were bound to be long gone their sharp ears alerting them to danger and their swift legs carrying them away from it turkeys probably stayed asleep in spite of the horsemens racket damn fool birds jenkins thought if they werent asleep theyd be standing under drips with their beaks agape and some of them would go on drinking till they drowned up above passenger pigeons would be roosting in the trees a lot of them would already have flown farther north to breed but some remained in this part of the world jenkins had seen the red eyed birds flying in the rain before dark rain didnt faze them a bit though sleet might knock them from the sky and fog confused them and made them land wherever they could passenger pigeon pie made mighty good eating too thanks to the birds nobody who could afford a shotgun was likely to starve there were so many of them it was almost as if god put them there as an unending bounty for the whites who spread across his land stay close to the man in front of you an officer shouted dont go wandering off the trail yes mother a trooper called other riders snickered confederate soldiers took their superiors no more seriously than they had to confederate officers knew that as well as their men did they hated it this one swore if the officers had their way they would turn the confederate army into an outfit as full of spit and polish as the us army wished it were from what jack jenkins had heard ordinary federal soldiers gave their superiors a hard time too one of their officers was supposed to be known to his troops as old bowels but the men in gray were looser than the men in blue people on both sides said so the damnyankees tried to lord it over everybody their own soldiers included outfits like forrests on the other hand were even looser than the loose confederate average officers won respect when they did win respect because of the men they were not because they wore bars or stars on their collars no wonder the yankees want nigger soldiers jenkins exclaimed all but blinded by the flash of his own insight h he werent so tired it might not have struck him such a blow as things were it seemed a truth of biblical proportions what do you mean asked somebody not far away whats a nigger good for doin what hes told and thats the long and short of it so said the cavalry corporal with the assurance of the pope speaking ex cathedra that hed had little to do with negroes bothered him not a bit he went on the federals they want everybody to do what they say all the damn time so niggers with guns are perfect for them could be said the other voice in the night just one thing wrong with it though whats that jenkins demanded angry that his brilliant perception should be challenged in any way he was almost too weary to stay in the saddle but not to ride his hobbyhorse you can give a coon a rifle hell you can give a coon a cannon and call the nigger son of a bitch an artilleryman the other soldier said but even if you do you cant make the black bastard fight jenkins considered that a yawn almost swallowed his consideration he welcomed the next wet vine or branch or whatever it was that hit him in the nose it woke him up a little well hell he said thus revived you know that an i know that but what do the damnyankees know anyways he was convinced hed proved his point and the other trooper didnt argue any more so maybe he had on they rode on and on and on they paused for a few minutes every so often to let the horses rest a little drink from streams and puddles and eat the handfuls of oats their riders doled out to them the way jenkinss mount hung its head told him how weary it had to be as weary as he was or maybe more because he didnt have so much on his back he patted the horses neck dont worry about it he said dont you worry about a thing we got to be gettin close to the damn fort dont we he wished he hadnt added the last couple of words they only reminded him he had no idea how far off fort pillow was with luck the horse wouldnt know he was bluffing it sighed like a tired old man when he swung up into the saddle again so did he he felt like a tired old man though he was only twenty five bedford forrest drove everybody like hell himself included jenkins had never gone on a ride to compare with this one he hoped to god he never did again on some roads he might have dozed in the saddle confident the horse would keep heading the right way even if he didnt pay attention he nodded off a couple of times but jerked back to consciousness whenever he did too easy to go astray here to get lost in the swamps he didnt want to give the officers any excuse to come down on his head every so often he heard voices stiff with authority screaming at troopers who blundered no he didnt want that happening to him but whenever he yawned he had to fight to stay awake and he yawned more and more often now little by little the rain eased and then stopped jenkins needed a while to realize it had all the leaves and branches were still soaking wet and drips pattered down on his hat some of them slid down the back of his neck too he couldnt figure out how they did that the brim of the hat was supposed to keep it from happening no matter what it was supposed to do the back of his neck got wet little by little also the shape of the horse in front of him grew more distinct little by little he began to make out the man atop the horse up above the clouds that still hid the stars even if they no longer wept dawn was on the way it wasnt here yet but it was coming how much longer somebody asked the words werent far from a groan if the answer was anything like another half day despair if not mutiny would soak through the ranks alarmed at the thought jenkins looked around now that he could see a little farther men and horses all had their heads down no one seemed any peppier than he felt but no one seemed ready to give up or give out either that was good he didnt want to have to try to turn the troopers around if they decided theyd had enough of course if they decided theyd had enough they would have to let major general forrest know it if you were brave enough to do that werent you brave enough to face the federals too rein in rein in the call from up ahead was soft but urgent we need the horse holders when mounted troops went forward to fight some of their comrades had to stay behind to hang on to the horses the usual proportion was about one in four forrest used far fewer he always aimed to get as many of his men into the fight as he could big pete burrhead its your turn jenkins called to the men he led excitement tingled through him if they were dismounting they had to be ready to go into battle which meant theyd got to fort pillow after all and before the sun came up big petes horse went lame hes way the hell back there somewhere a trooper said jenkins swore he told off another soldier to take big petes place the soldier swore too he wanted to get up there and fight few people who didnt want to get up there and fight joined forrests cavalry somebodys got to do it clem jenkins said i picked you not far ahead rifle muskets began to bang iii lieutenant mack leaming lay on his cot happily halfway between slumber and wakefulness part of him knew reveille would sound soon the rest was warm and comfortable under a thick wool blanket on an iron framed bed with a tolerable or even a little better than tolerable mattress a little earlier hed been dreaming of a redheaded woman hed seen in brownsville the dream was more exciting than the brief glimpse hed got of her he knew he wouldnt get it back you never did but he kept trying the buglers horn didnt wake him the sounds of running feet and shouting men did oh jesus christ he said sitting up in bed and groping for his shoes like most soldiers he slept in the rest of his uniform his first thought was that some of the men had got into the sutlers whiskey of which there was more inside the perimeter of the fort than he would have liked dawn was a hell of a time for a drunken riot to start but you never could tell that was true of his own troopers he thought it was bound to be even more true of the colored soldiers just up from memphis then he heard gunfire and he flung himself into his shoes and dashed out of the barracks if his men and the coons were going at each other then all hell had broken loose he would have to figure out in a hurry whether to try to put out the fire or to make damn sure the thirteenth tennessee cavalry ended up on top but the gunshots werent coming from inside the earthwork as soon as he left the barracks he realized that the fire was coming from farther away he looked around gauging the growing light it couldnt be later than half past five a sergeant ran by as fast as if the seat of his pants were on fire what the hells going on gunter leaming shouted sir theres rebs outside the fort sergeant gunter answered theyre shooting at our pickets in the rifle pits rebels leaming shook his head there cant be there arent any rebels closer than jackson as if to make a liar out of him brisk fire came from the south and east we sure as hell aint shooting at each other gunter said since leaming had wondered if the men in the garrison were doing exactly that he wasnt completely convinced but the distant catamount screech of the rebel yell persuaded him that sergeant gunter knew what he was talking about what in the name of damnation is going on out there major bradford asked from behind leaming bradford had taken his own sweet time getting out of bed sir the confederates are attacking the fort leaming answered what have you gone clean round the bend bradford yelped theres no secesh soldiers within seventy miles of this place i thought the same thing sir leaming said but listen major bradford did even in the pale uncertain light of first dawn leaming watched the color drain from his face how bradfords lips silently shaped the word how could they get here without anybody knowing he managed aloud maybe forrest really did sell his soul to the devil the way the niggers say what are we going to do sir lieutenant leaming asked i dont know bradford said which struck his adjutant as a fundamentally honest response but not what he wanted to hear from the regimental commander bradford gathered himself or tried to i dont see how we can surrender though lord only knows what forrests men would do to us let alone to the niggers here didnt major booth say we could hold this fort against anybody and anything for a couple of days leaming asked perhaps incautiously he said it yes how old were you lieutenant before you found out what people say isnt necessarily so major bradford loaded his words with all the scorn his courtroom training could pile onto them mack leamings cheeks and ears heated he hoped the light was still too dim to let bradford notice him flush he was in luck the regimental commander had stopped paying attention to him bradford was looking toward the tents that housed the newly arrived colored troops and their white superiors where in tarnation is major booth anyway booth chose that moment to pop out of his tent like a jackinthebox the senior officers tunic had several buttons undone he wore no hat his hair was all awry but his eyes flashed fire even in the gray light before sunrise so the rebs have shown up have they he shouted a fierce and unmistakable joy in his voice well good good major bradford might have been looking around for a judge with whom he could lodge an objection good major booth shouted again mack leaming inclined toward bradfords opinion no visit from bedford forrest was good news for anyone who followed the stars and stripes but booth went on well give the bastards a bloody nose and a black eye and well send em back to mama with their tail between their legs isnt that right boys the negro soldiers spilling out of their tents screeched and capered and carried on but the screeches were defiance hurled at the confederates many of the capers the black men cut were lewd but also showed they intended to fight and the way the colored troops carried on brought smiles to the faces of the thirteenth tennessee cavalrys troopers many of whom had seemed as uncertain and afraid as major bradford and mack leaming himself are we going to fight those secesh bastards major booth bellowed yes suh the colored artillerymen yelled back are we going to whip those secesh bastards booth bellowed even louder than before yes suh the negroes got louder too lieutenant leaming hadnt imagined they could eyes still blazing booth peered this way and that bradford he shouted where in gods name are you bradford im here sir major bradford answered he had to say it again before he could make major booth hear him what do you require of me we dont want to let forrests men drive our pickets back into the fort right away do we booth demanded bradford hesitated mack leaming didnt think the federal garrison wanted to do any such thing some of the ground within the large perimeter gideon pillow first laid out was higher than the position at the juncture of coal creek and the mississippi the garrison now held if the confederates got sharpshooters on that high ground they could fire down on the us soldiers inside the present small earthwork that wouldnt be good at all do we major booth repeated more sharply than before he knew the right answer whether bill bradford did or not uh no sir major bradford might not know the answer but he could take a hint all right then goddammit booth said get some skirmishers out to help the pickets he cocked his head to one side listening to the gunfire out beyond the breastwork dont send a boy to do a mans job either major the confederates sound like theyre here in numbers very well major bradford said and turned to mack leaming order companies b and c out to the picket line companies band c yes sir leaming dashed away shouting company b forward to the picket line company c forward to the picket line we have to hold off the rebs at long range the men inside fort pillow were running around like ants after their hill is kicked the colored troops white officers screamed for gun crews to man the half dozen cannon that had come north from memphis with them negroes not serving the guns took their places along the earthwork with the whites from the thirteenth tennessee cavalry they started banging away at whatever was out there they didnt just shoot at the confederates either to show their scorn for the men who might have owned them in the not too distant past they shouted filthy obscenities out toward the enemy and backed them up with more lewd gestures dont you act like those niggers leaming shouted to his white troopers forrests men are bad enough any which way you see any sense to ticking em off worse he spotted one of the officers in company c logan get your men moving faster yes sir the young lieutenant answered were doing our best sir never mind your best dammit leaming said just do what youve got to do yes sir lieutenant logan said again what else could he say before long about fifty men carrying rifle muskets and cartridge boxes stumbled out through the mud toward the rifle pits beyond the two rows of disused barracks outside the perimeter as major booth had before him mack leaming paused to listen to the gunfire out there booth had it straight the confederates were putting a lot of lead in the air how many men had bedford forrest brought through the swamps east of fort pillow anyhow too many leaming thought worriedly that had hardly gone through his mind before one of the troopers going out to the picket line caught a bullet in the face and crumpled his springfield falling from his fingers another soldier also fell grabbing at his leg his howl of pain pierced the gravel onatinroof rattle of musketry how many men have they got out there leaming wondered and shivered one way or another the garrison would find out fire captain carron shouted sergeant mike clark pulled the lanyard the white man was in charge of the gun a friction primer already stood in the touchhole a goose quill filled with gunpowder and topped with shredded match a looped steel pin was fixed in the primer and the lanyard hooked to the loop when clark yanked it out the match caught and set off the powder below there was a hiss when the finely ground powder in the friction primer caught then a roar as the main charge went off fire and smoke belched from the twelve pounders muzzle away flew a shrapnel round to come down with luck on the advancing confederates heads sergeant ben robinson watched for the burst along with carron and clark and with the rest of the colored artillerymen who served the gun long the captain said and then something more pungent robinson bring the range down fifty yards down fifty yards yes suh robinson said fifty yards was two turns of the altitude screw he had to make sure he turned it the one way and not the other he didnt want to raise the guns muzzle instead of lowering it meanwhile the rest of the crew got the twelve pounder ready to fire again one negro soldier used the worm a giant two pronged corkscrew on the end of a pole to bring smoldering bits of wadding and cartridge bag out of the barrel another shoved a dripping sponge down the guns iron throat to douse any bits of fire that remained when the sponge was withdrawn yet another black man shoved in the cartridge full of black powder while he was loading the next round of shrapnel and the wadding that helped give it a tight seal sergeant clark jabbed a sharp awl through the touchhole and punctured the cartridge bag again and again the whole colored gun crew manhandled the piece back into its proper position even in the mud recoil had shoved it several feet to the rear when captain carron nodded in satisfaction sergeant clark inserted another friction primer and fixed the lanyard to it fire carron yelled again the twelve pounder roared and jerked backward nobody in the gun crew stood behind it when it went off the heavy carriage could crush a man almost like a man squashing a bug fireworks smelling smoke made robinson cough the shrapnel round burst somewhere between a quarter mile and half a mile away red fire at the heart of another burst of smoke a savage glee filled ben robinsons soul that burst and the balls flying from it might maim men whod bought and sold negroes with no more thought or care than if they were cattle what could be sweeter hey charlie ben called to the loader aint this grand we finally gits to shoot the buckra you mean charlie key said robinson nodded the loaders grin showed a lot of white teeth one missing in front in his black face the gun go off the first time i aim os quit this world altogedder gun go off the first time i almos go off myself robinson said charlie key laughed his grin got wider bring it down again about a gnats hair captain carron said a gnats hair yes suh robinson gave the altitude screw half a turn that was about as small a change as would mean anything at all then grunting with effort he helped shove the twelvepounder back up to the parapet fire the white officer yelled the white sergeant pulled the lanyard the gun boomed and rolled back the negroes who crewed the piece reloaded it and muscled it into position again they worked a lot harder than the whites set over them ben robinson had worked harder than the whites above him his whole life long he knew that wasnt always so on small farms where the landowner could barely scrape up the cash for a negro or two everybody worked like a mule on plantations like the one where hed grown up though blacks worked hard so whites didnt have to whites made no bones about it either things were different here captain carron and sergeant clark knew more about the business of serving a gun than did the men they commanded and that wasnt the only difference as robinson told charlie key he could finally do what hed wanted to do ever since he was a pickaninny he could hit back at the whites whod treated him like a beast of burden almost his whole life long the rest of the guns brought into fort pillow were banging away too shrapnel rounds and solid shot hissed through the air we gots the range you wants mistuh captain suh robinson asked as the twelve pounder got ready to fire again what oh yes captain carron checked himself yes sergeant thank you ben robinson preened a lot of whites on both sides of the battle line thought military courtesy a waste of time like most colored soldiers he saw things differently to him military courtesy meant treating everybody the way his rank said he should be treated his rank not his color and robinson had earned enough rank to be treated with respect even by a captain tiny in the distance a gray clad soldier threw up his arms and reeled away when the next round of shrapnel from the twelvepounder burst near him you see dat charlie key whooped you see dat ben uh sergeant ben i seen it robinson said dat one dead secesh they both capered and danced in glee if their company commander and gun chief watched with wry amusement as they carried on if they did ben neither noticed nor cared he wished he could kill all the confederates from the mississippi to the atlantic as easily as hed slain that one trooper with only half a dozen cannon not all the colored soldiers inside fort pillow had one to serve most of them fought as infantry going through the foot soldiers practiced motions with their springfields load in nine times load the drill sergeant had taught them by the numbers and the training stuck and firing at bedford forrests men along with the dismounted troopers from the thirteenth tennessee cavalry bullets came back at them too mini balls minnies to most of the men whined through the air when they werent close when they were they cracked as viciously as an overseers whip ben found himself ducking whenever he heard one of those cracks he tried not to but couldnt help himself shame filled him the last thing in the world he wanted was to play the coward in front of the whites whod given him the chance to shoot back at the confederates then he saw that captain carron and sergeant clark were ducking too as were the other negroes in the gun crew he realized people couldnt help it when bullets flew by that made him feel better hows it going here major booth came up to the gun and peered down the long iron tube at the advancing confederates you fellas giving the rebs hell yes suh robinson said his voice was the first and loudest among those of the negroes serving the gun but everybody sang out a white crew couldnt do any better sir sergeant clark said hearing that ben wanted to burst his buttons with pride a white sergeant an experienced artilleryman said he and his comrades were doing well if he couldnt feel good about such praise what could he feel good about major booth took their good performance for granted which made ben robinson even prouder i didnt expect anything different booth said not one thing you hear only thing that matters is how well trained a gunner is the only thing you hear me sergeant the gun doesnt care if the men serving it are black or white or green itll shoot the same way for anybody as long as he knows what hes doing well they do sir clark said and then aint that right boys the negroes raised a cheer robinson had been called boy before this didnt feel like that clark would or at least could have called a group of white soldiers boys the same way he wasnt using it as an insult or to deny the negroes manhood just the opposite in fact major booth grinned and nodded and slapped ben on the back well weve sure as hell trained em all right that was true theyd had to start from the very beginning even wearing shoes was something ben robinson and a lot of the negroes had had to get used to marching in step seemed pointless but after a while he realized it did a couple of things it got him used to automatically obeying the kinds of commands he heard in the army and it made him understand he was part of something much bigger than he was he wasnt taking on jeff davis and robert e lee and bedford forrest all by his lonesome he was part of this enormous outfit and everybody was doing it together knowing understanding in his belly that he wasnt alone made soldiering a lot easier even before he started practicing on a field piece we aint gonna let you down major booth suh he said most of the rest of the black men serving the gun with him nodded no matter how scared you were you didnt want to show it not in front of the man whod turned you from a field nigger into a soldier i didnt reckon you would booth said i wouldnt have let you go into combat if i thought you would a minnie cracked past overhead major booth ducked too just like anybody else he grinned and chuckled and shrugged i dont expect the bullet with my name on its been made yet now you fellows i know youre going to work hard here and i know youre going to be brave here that right yes sub the gunners shouted as one man good major booth said now ive told the sutlers to put out whiskey and dippers along the line you need a little shot of nerve you go on and take one dont take too much youve still got to be able to fight the gun but a little never hurt anybody white or colored and thats the gods truth after booth went on his way sergeant clark eyed the gun crew soon as you see me havin a drink you can take one yourselves that sound fair to you the colored artillerymen looked at one another reckon so sergeant robinson said the others either spoke words of agreement or nodded they couldnt very well tell the white man set directly over them no regardless of what major booth said and clarks comment did strike ben as fair he wasnt asking them to do anything he wouldnt do himself brasher than the other negroes charlie key said i gots me a thirst and then some sergeant when you reckon you ply the dipper he mimed dipping up whiskey and pouring it down mike clark looked at him dont aim to use it at all he answered calmly as the blacks stared in dismay clark went on weve got lots of men with springfields on the line some of them get plastered well hell so what theyll still put a bunch of minnies in the air and some of emll hit half the time riflemen hardly aim anyhow but weve only got six guns weve got to make every shot count best we can we better have clear heads for that dont you think you with me ben considered yes they called popskull dutch courage but with a big slave trader and his men coming at fort pillow how much extra courage did the negroes inside need looks to me like yous right he said to clark with regret but without any doubt onliest thing i wish is i wish we could get them gun muzzles down lower depress em i mean he trotted out the word sergeant hennissey gave him if the secesh boys slide down under us we cant touch em damn thick breastwork clark muttered ben robinson nodded hed said the same thing the day before the white man went on well we just got to make sure they dont get that close come on you bucks quit fooling around here lets give em another round they served the twelve pounder with a will a minnie cracked past matt wards head almost close enough to lift the slouch hat right off it almost close enough to drill me between the eye thought the trooper from missouri he shoved that down into the nightmare place where such notions naturally dwelt losing his hat to a bullet was something he could think about without shivering but if all the branches and vines in the hatchie bottoms couldnt steal that hat he didnt fancy losing it to a damnyankees mini ball either another bullet zipped past this one not quite so close matt didnt think the federals had a whole lot of men in the rifle pits out beyond their earthwork but the soldiers they did have were shooting as fast as they could load a welltrained man with a springfield could get off two rounds a minute and the men in those pits knew what they were doing a shrapnel round from the fort itself screamed down and burst with a roar off to wards right along with the rest of colonel mccullochs men he was on the left of the confederate line closest to the mississippi he and his comrades pushed north toward fort pillow at the other end of the line barteaus regiment of bells brigade would be advancing west along coal creek ward and his companions nearby were already inside the first line of works around fort pillow the line laid out by the general whod named the place after himself that was high ground from where ward crouched he could see into the much smaller perimeter the galvanized yankees and their colored stooges held the range was longit had to be more than a quarter of a milebut his rifle would reach that far a minnie thudded into a stump not far away thank you jesus yelled a trooper in back of the stump the garrison inside fort pillow hadnt done much of a job of clearing the approaches to their position the attackers could take cover behind lots of bushes and stumps and fallen trees cautiously ward raised his head from behind the stump that sheltered him he fired at a man in blue in one of the rifle pits the enfield carbine he carried bucked against his shoulder the rifle musket spat fire and a puff of blackpowder smoke the yankee in that rifle pit kept moving around so ward supposed hed missed him shit the trooper from missouri said without much rancor he ducked down and reloaded biting the paper cartridge and pouring powder and a cloth patch into the enfields muzzle sending the minnie after the powder and wadding and ramming it home drawing back the hammer to halfcock so he could set a copper percussion cap in place and then raising the carbine to his shoulder and firing this time the soldier at whom he aimed flinched and crumpled a mini ball weighed almost an ounce when one hit it hit hard he bit open another cartridge after a long fight soldiers whod done a lot of shooting had so much black powder on their faces they looked like refugees from a minstrel show ward wished he had a breechloading repeating rifle like the ones some federal cavalrymen were starting to carry a regiment armed with rifles like that had the firepower of a brigade with ordinary weapons wish for the moon while youre at it ward muttered tasting sulfur from the powder those fancy repeaters needed equally fancy brass cartridges even if you captured one you also had to capture the ammunition to go with it and keep on capturing more and more otherwise the rifle would be useless except as a club ward wondered why the confederacy couldnt make rifles like that and the ammunition to go with them probably for the same reason it had trouble keeping its men in uniforms and shoes a lot of the troopers in mccullochs brigade wore tunics and trousers and shoes damnyankees didnt need anymore some of the trousers were still blue forrest insisted that shirts at least go into the dye kettle right away if they turned butternut your buddies were less likely to try to plug you by mistake more than a few confederates carried captured yankee springfields too theircaliber minnies and the enfield bullets both worked in both weapons if it wasnt for everything the federals make we couldnt hardly fight em ward thought that was funny if you looked at it the right way it was worrisome if you looked at it wrong so ward did his best to laugh he slipped another percussion cap onto the nipple and looked for a new target there was some damnfool nigger cutting capers on the main earthwork the black man acted like a drunk that not only made ward angry at him it made the missourian jealous he drew a careful bead and pulled the trigger he couldnt have missed by much the negros comic tumble behind the breastwork would have brought down the house in a play but this wasnt a play it was real matt ward wanted that man dead now the coon might pick up a rifle and hurt somebody with it two or three minnies from the fort cracked past the stump behind which ward hid they knew he was here which meant it was time to go somewhere else hed fired several shots and the clouds of smoke belching from his carbine announced his whereabouts to the world he scrambled to find fresh cover a little closer to the fort and to the firing pits in front of it other troopers were doing the same thing and cheering one another on as they moved only a couple of wounded men staggered back toward the rear one had a hand that dripped blood the other son of a bitch ward said softly hed seen some nasty wounds but this was one of the worst a mini ball had caught the trooper in the lower jaw and carried away most of it blood splashed down the soldiers front shattered teeth gleamed inside his mouth his tongue flopped loose and red like butchers meat could you live after a mutilation like that if you could would you want to youd never be able to show your faceor what was left of itin broad daylight again if you had a wife would she stay with you if you didnt how could you hope to get one wouldnt you just want to pick up an enfield or a shotgun and finish what the yankee bullet had started those were all good questions matt ward did his best not to think about any of them he tried to move up on the enemy soldiers in the rifle pits major william bradford had been in some skirmishes before this fight but never a real battle this was a different business from everything hed known up till now he didnt care for any of the differences the confederates here werent going to ride off after exchanging a few shots with his men they meant it he didnt need to be us grant to figure that out they had numbers on their side too the volume of gunfire told him that so did the way they pressed the attack along the whole perimeter from the mississippi all the way over to coal creek not far from him a colored soldier from one of the newly arrived artillery units fired his springfield calmly reloaded as fast as a white man could have and fired again the negro nodded to him them secesh keeps comin suh we shoots all of em he said uh right bradford made himself nod he knew bedford forrests men hated the idea of negro soldiers they denied that negroes could be soldiers if negroes could fight as well as whites that knocked the confederacys whole raison dtre over the head the rebs could see as much perfectly well but bill bradford though no confederate was a tennessean and a tennessean from a county with more slaves than white men he didnt believewell he hadnt believednegroes could fight either if they made him see they could he would have to do some fresh thinking and few men are ever comfortable doing that worst of all though was what the battle was showing him about himself with a majors oak leaves on his shoulder straps he had rank enough to imagine himself a bold commander like general shermanor even like general forrest for whom every vs officer had a thorough and wary respect now reality was rudely testing his imagination what happened when the bullets started flying he got flustered and fearful and he knew it hed been the next thing to paralyzed till major booth told him to send out a couple of companies of skirmishers would he have thought of it for himself if booth hadnt he hoped so but he wasnt sure dammit he wasnt sure when a minnie struck home it made a wet slapping sound that chilled the blood a white mana trooper from the thirteenth tennessee cavalrygroaned and clutched at his shoulder welling blood made his dark blue tunic even darker he stumbled away toward the surgeons tender mercies that could have been me bradford thought with a shudder once lodged in his brain the idea wouldnt go away know thyself some ancient had said this was knowledge bill bradford would rather not have had one of the cannon that had come north with the colored artillerymen bellowed the crew reloaded the gun with the same matteroffact competence the negro fighting as a rifleman displayed they had a white sergeant and a white captain but they didnt need anyone to tell them what to do they knew and they did it no answering confederate cannonballs came forrests men seemed to have no artillery with them that was the one bit of good news bill bradford saw confederate soldiers in gray in butternut and even in blue swarmed everywhere out beyond the perimeter their fierce yells of fury and defiance put him in mind of the baying of wolves another cannon crashed half a dozen guns had seemed plenty to defend fort pillow the earthwork along which they were mounted wasnt very long but no matter how many rounds they fired at the rebs forrests men kept pressing ever closer a shell from the gunboat in the mississippi arched up over the bluff atop which fort pillow sat it burst somewhere to the rear of the attacking rebels bradford swore under his breath the new era had to supplement the firepower in the fort itself make em shorten the range theo bradford yelled ill do it his older brother captain theodorick bradford passed signals down to the new era with blue wigwag flags the system had seemed good enough on paper in the heat of action it was liable to be slower and clumsier than bradford wished it were major booth went from one gun along the earthwork to the next encouraging the crews to keep firing give em hell booth yelled those bastards dont know what hell is show em damn you and the colored men responded they laughed and cheered and served their cannon with a will not even white men obeyed bradford so readily he envied the more experienced officer for his ability to command major he called what is it major booth asked mindful of the civilities even under fire a bullet snapped past his head he ducked then laughed at himself for ducking warm work isnt it erso it is bradford couldnt act so cheerful about it theyre putting a lot of pressure on the skirmishers sir shall i send out more men or shall i pull back the ones weve already got out there neither booth said at once if you send out more well lose them skirmishers cant stop the rebs from coming forward three times as many men out there couldnt stop them and the ones we do have are enough to slow the enemy down if you pull them back into the fort though forrest will push right up to the earthwork i want to put that off as long as i can major bradford said perplexed if we can hold the rebs out till reinforcements come up the river from memphis the fight is as good as won booth said no way in hell forrest can overrun us then his men will skulk off and go back to thieving and murdering and bushwhacking thats all theyre good for and they can keep doing it from now till doomsday without changing the way the war turns out one damn bit uh yes sir bradford wondered if he could have been callous enough to sacrifice the skirmishers in the hope of saving the fort and most of the garrison he didnt think so even if he could see it was the right move along with his other talents lionel booth might have been a mind reader he patted bradford on the back i know theyre your men and i know youre fond of them major but every now and then we need to take some losses for the good of the greater number do you see it i see it i dont like it when a minnie cracked past bradford he ducked as booth had he couldnt laugh about it it made him feel like a coward even if it was altogether involuntary a wounded man screamed bradford set his teeth against the appalling cry booth hurried on to hearten the next gun crew iv surviving skirmishers ran back toward the earthen parapet warding fort pillow hale soldiers helped their wounded friends every so often a man whod loaded his springfield before retreating would fire it at the oncoming rebs to make them keep their heads down lieutenant mack leaming watched a couple of federals go down but only a couple most of the men whod set out for the earthwork reached it in safetyor as much safety as us soldiers could find anywhere on this field a mini ball snapped past in front of leamings nose too close for comfort he flinched half a minute later another near miss made him flinch again fifty yards away troopers from the thirteenth tennessee cavalry shouted that another officer was down the confederates seemed to be taking dead aimthough leaming wished he didnt think of it quite that wayat anyone inside the perimeter who wore shoulder straps and more than his share of brass buttons though clouds still covered the sun most of the time leaming didnt think it could be much past eight oclock looking at his pocket watch never even crossed his mind the confederates hadnt been attacking for much more than two hours and theyd already driven the federals back inside the fortress proper that wasnt good and leaming knew it how could the garrison hold out till reinforcements got here from memphis leaming spotted major lionel booth who was still going from gun to gun encouraging the colored cannoneers major he called excuse me major yes lieutenant booth sounded as calm as if on parade leaming didnt think he really was that calm but even being able to seem so was a valuable asset to an officer what do you need sir how many rebs do you reckon are out there leaming blurted booth considered he ducked when a bullet cracked past above his head but he didnt seem especially flustered id say fifteen hundred maybe two thousand he replied at last from the weight of fire thats about what it feels like to me is that all sir leaming said in amazement isnt that enough two and a half maybe three times what weve got in here booth said with a wry chuckle more than i figured bedford forrest could throw at us ill tell you that but does someone else think there are more when i asked major bradford sir he said he thought forrest had six or seven thousand men leaming said did he now booth started to say something then visibly changed his mind what did come out of his mouth after that brief pause was well lieutenant you have to remember this is major bradfords first real combat your first few times youre liable to see things that arent there he sounded indulgent like a father talking about a boy who didnt want to go to sleep without a candle by his bed leaming hoped the fortress commandant felt indulgent about him too this was also his first real combat and he was scared he was scared spitlessthe sahara couldnt have been drier than the inside of his mouth the first few near misses hed almost pissed himself that would have been a fine thing for an officer to do in front of his men youre getting along just fine lieutenant booth said so maybe he could seem paternal toward more people than major bradford i think there are only a few people who arent afraid on a battlefield and theyre men who dont care if they live or die nothing wrong with being afraid the trick of it is to go on doing your job whether youre afraid or not youre not shirking and thats all anybody can ask of you thank you sir leaming was no catholic but that felt like absolution from a priest major booths grin showed crooked teeth its all right the more rebs who try to rush this place the more rebs well shoot thats all let em come by god how are they going to make it over the parapet well hang on till help from memphis steams up the river and then well see who runs and how far shells from the new era climbed high over the bluff slow enough to be easily visible to the naked eye then rained down someplace not too far from where confederate troopers were moving seeing those bursts and the clouds of smoke rising from them heartened leaming even so he said i wish we had better signal arrangements with the gunboat the way things are shes almost firing blind i wont say youre altogether wrong but i think were doing as much as we can booth replied signal flags are about as good as we can manage im afraid even if they arent perfecther crew cant see their targets the ground up here is too high thats all and the rebs are moving faster than we can let the new era know where theyre moving to but some of what the gunboat fires off is bound to come down on their heads heres hoping sir mack leaming said when booth put things the way he did the new era didnt seem so very formidable after all leaming was glad nobody else inside fort pillow had heard the commandant that left him the only one to have his spirits lowered major booth seemed unworried about what the gunboat could or couldnt do he hardly seemed worried about anything touching the brim of his black slouch hat he went back to encouraging the gunners despite their steady fire and despite the work of the white and colored riflemen behind the earthwork forrests men steadily worked their way forward they came close enough to let leaming hear their officers shouting orders close enough to let him hear their wounded men groan when they were hit they came close enough to let him draw his revolver from the holster and fire two or three shots at them the first shots hed ever fired with intent to kill he couldnt see if he hit anybody that was probably just as well and then instead of sliding forward the confederates slid back they still kept up a steady and galling fire but they didnt seem to think they could simply storm the parapet any more we taught them respect by god leaming thought those loping caterwauling shapes had been everywhere in front of the fort or so it seemed to him he found major bradfords estimate of their numbers far easier to believe than major booths six or seven thousand rebs looking at them out there he could have believed there were six or seven million of them not far away two colored soldiers passed a dipper of sutlers whiskey back and forth both of them grinned one of them raised the dipper in salute to lieutenant leaming want a snort suh he called no thanks leaming answered dutch courage nigger courage what difference did it make and some of the whites from his own regiment were drinking too put a soldier white or colored anywhere near whiskey and hed find a way to get outside it one of the negroes aimed an obscene gesture at the confederates out there in the distance his friend thought that was the funniest thing hed ever seen and sent the rebs something even nastier several bullets snarled past them they went right on laughing they werent afraid anyhow and they were fighting the enemy the colored men at the halfdozen field guns kept firing steadily while the colored soldiers serving as riflemen loaded and shot shoulder to shoulder with the troopers from the thirteenth tennessee cavalry leaming wouldnt have believed it if he werent seeing it with his own eyes he had trouble believing it even though he was seeing it with his own eyes a negro let out a shrill screech he staggered away from the parapet clutching at his left elbow do jesus the surgeon gonna cut off my arm he wailed from what leaming knew of wounds he was likely to be right if a bullet shattered bones you almost had to amputate otherwise the injured man would die of fever shy a limb he might live po george one negro said hard luck another agreed they both fired their springfields less than a minute after george got hurt the other colored soldiers shot at any confederates they saw too niggers really can fight lieutenant leaming thought in swelling wonder maybe its not a question of keeping them slaves from here on out maybe we were lucky to hold them in slavery as long as we did by now the white captain and sergeant nominally in charge of ben robinsons twelvepounder had seen that the colored gun crew knew what it was doing they gave fewer and fewer orders they gave fewer and fewer suggestions the black men were doing plenty all by themselves to give the confederates out beyond the earthwork a hard time when bedford forrests troopers pressed close to the parapet sergeant robinson ordered a couple of rounds of canister on his own he looked back to captain carron after he did it but the officer didnt say a word he just beamed and nodded and ben robinson went on fighting the gun each round of canister had sheetmetal sides and a thin wooden plug at the top it held two or three hundred round bullets in effect it turned the twelvepounder into gods shotgun at short range it was supremely deadly a man caught by the full fury of a blast of canister might be blown to red rags he might simply cease to be torn apart so completely that nothing recognizable as a human being was left or he might be killed or maimed in any number of more ordinary ways the rebs didnt want to come close to any gun that was firing canister no matter how much ben robinson hated those secesh sons of bitches he couldnt blame them for that he wouldnt have wanted to make the acquaintance of a canister burst himself who would look at em run charlie key yelled you ever reckon you see secesh run some of the confederates couldnt run some of them would never run again the rest didnt want that to happen to them give em anudder round jus like de last one charlie yelled robinson shook his head they outa range now he said mournfully dont want to waste the canister we aint got but a few rounds too bad charlie said how come dey dont give us mo powerful good munition aint nothin else make the rebs scamper like dat he mimed scampering himself he was a dangerous mimic canister shift damn near anythinganything up close robinson said out past a couple hundred yards though it aint much so we got us dese shrapnel rounds an shot fo de longrange work a twelvepound iron ball would tear a fearful hole in a tightpacked group of men since the rebs werent fighting that way shrapnel bursts did more damage here ben robinson knew he could hurt the white men whod done so much to make his life a misery sell me away from home will you he thought furiously as he lowered the altitude screw on the gun carriage sell me at all will you treat me like a piece of meat will you treat my sister like a piece of meat will you that was a separate outrage one that burned all by itself sergeant clark pulled the lanyard the shrapnel round roared away the gun rolled back as sergeant robinson put his shoulder to the carriage to wrestle it forward again he hoped some of the iron fragments from that round blew a white mans balls off lets see you come round the slave cabins with a bulge in your pants then god damn your scrawny soul to hell the reloading ritual began once more it felt almost like a dance only the music was missing and the gun crew didnt really need it they could go through the steps with no accompaniment but the boom of the springfields to either side and the whine and crack of enemy minnies darting past like any soldier of any color robinson had hated all the hot sweaty hours he spent on the drill field learning how to handle a cannon he knew the rest of the colored men in the crew felt the same way hed hated white sergeants screaming at him dumbass coon clumsy fool and those were some of the nicer things they said but they turned raw black recruits into a real gun crew something that was more than the sum of its parts and he owed them a reluctant debt of gratitude for that hed also heard that drill sergeants were just as merciless toward whites that made him feel a little better fair was fair give em hell boys major booth came up behind the crew the gunners worked harder than ever under the commandants eye that no doubt was exactly what he had in mind when the gun was ready he tipped his hat to sergeant clark and asked may i do the honors uh yes sir clark handed him the lanyard booth gave it a hearty tug the gun thundered looking pleased with himself booth returned the match to the sergeant a couple of bullets thumped into the earthwork close by more cracked past enemy fire always picked up when major booth was around suh you wants to be careful ben robinson told him they got sharpshooters out there tryin to pick you off booth laughed lightheartedly ben always remembered thathow cheerful the commandant sounded as if hed just heard a good joke they can try sergeant he saidhe was always careful to use colored underofficers ranks when he spoke to them the bastards have been trying for a while but they havent got me yet yes suh ben didnt see how he could say anything else he couldnt very well tell major booth to go somewhere else because when the rebs were shooting at booth they were also shooting at him he wanted to but he couldnt and then he heard the unmistakable wet slap of a bullet striking flesh my god im hit major booth exclaimeda cry more of disbelief than of pain booths hands clutched at his chest bright blood welled out between his fingers my god he said again more weakly this time blood bubbled from his mouth and nose too that meant it was a bad wound about as bad as a wound could be the thought had hardly crossed bens mind before major booths legs gave out and he crumpled to the ground lawd ben robinson whispered major booth wasnt just the commandant here he was the man whod turned the negroes he led from field hands into soldiers if booth couldnt go on leading command would fall to major bradford and booth couldntthat wound looked sure to kill him and to kill him fast as for major bradford a lot of the men in the thirteenth tennessee cavalry had no more use for colored soldiers than the confederates had they didnt fight for the usa because they wanted emancipation they fought for the usa because they couldnt get along with their neighbors who fought for the csa captain carron came out of the horrified trance that seemed to grip everyone around the fallen major booth take him to a surgeon he said maybe the sawbones will be able to do well something anyway his voice trailed off a surgeon couldnt do much for a chest wound any more than he could for one in the belly a man either got better or he died major lionel booth was going to die the way he plucked at robinsons sleeve when the negro started to lift him told him as much booth tried to say something but more blood came out instead of words he fought to breathehe was drowning in his own blood when robinson and two other soldiers from the gun crew laid him in front of the greensashed surgeon the white man said good god its the major yes suh robinson said help him if you can suh help major booth echoed feebly please help please his eyes rolled up in his head he gone charlie key asked the surgeon felt for a pulse at booths wrist not yet he answered hes he broke off then said something vile aimed not at the negroes but at fate now hes gone lawd robinson said again what is we gonna do major william bradford felt the weight of the world crashing down on his shoulders hed resented major booth when the younger officer brought his colored artillerymen up from memphis hed resented him yes but hed come to lean on him too booth knew more about soldiering than he did and that was all there was to it booth didnt get stuffy about passing on what he knew and bill bradford knew hed learned a lot in the couple of weeks since booth arrived rather more to the point at the moment lionel booth had kept his head when the confederates attackedand when bradford was on the edge of losing his now he was down now fort pillow was in bradfords hands again no matter how much he wished it werent we can hold on we will hold on bradford thought and maybe booth isnt hit as badly as people say no sooner had that hopeful thought crossed his mind than a soldier came pelting toward him from where the surgeon was working hes dead the man shouted hes dead sir well so much for that major bradford thought unhappily its all mine now it was his before booth and his coons got here he didnt want it back not like this but what he wanted didnt seem to matter he gathered himself or tried to keep firing he shouted to the embattled garrison and immediately felt a fool what were they going to do stop not likely not with bedford forrests wolves prowling out there bradford tried again well whip em yet you tell em major that was one of his own troopers they would follow where he led but what about the niggers theyd have to wouldnt they he was the senior officer left alive no matter how little he wanted the distinction to land on him at this time in this way major major major bradford suh this time one of major booths colored soldiersone of his colored soldiers now for better or worsedashed toward him from the parapet as if all the furies of hell were at his heels what is it bradford asked what is it now he almost said but he swallowed the last word in the nick of time it would have sounded too much like panic he felt panic hammering hard inside him but didnt want to show it that would only make it spread suh the secesh done shot lieutenant hill through the head out by the old barracks the negro answered he fall down he twitch a few times an he dead now jus like major booth oh good god bradford exclaimed one thing on top of another hill washad beenbooths adjutant which meant hed become post adjutant when booth took command now he hadnt outlived his superior by more than a couple of minutes yes suhone thing after another but i reckon wes hurting the rebs too the negro said he still showed fight that was good well just have to carry on the best way we can bradford said and then thank you for letting me know yes suh the colored sergeant answered he gave bradford a salute that would have won the heart of any drill sergeant on a practice field bradford tried to return it as smartly hed already seen the negroes set more stock in such gestures than did the troopers he led his salute was spoiled when a minnie cracked past overhead both he and the colored man ducked he would have been humiliated if he did and the artilleryman didnt as things were they smiled at each other both admitting that bullets could scare a man no matter what color he was after a bob of the head the negro trotted back to his station lieutenant leaming bradford shouted and then when that didnt accomplish anything mack where in damnation are you right here sir leaming said what do you need a nigger just told me the rebs have killed lieutenant hill outside the works that makes you post adjutant again major bradford answered good lord leaming said i think their sharpshooters really are trying to pick off our officers were losing them too fast for anything else to make sense are you all right sir yes bradford lied hed always been proud of his majors tunic with its two rows of seven brass buttons each now like josephs coat of many colors his tunic with the many shiny buttonshe made sure they stayed shinywas liable to land him in danger he imagined some skinny mangy rebel drawing a bead right between the rows squeezing the trigger and he flinched though no bullet came close what are your orders sir lieutenant leaming asked what else can we do but keep on with what weve been doing bradford replied major booth was sure help would come from memphis we just have to hang on till it gets here thats all yes sir leaming stepped closer to bradford so he could lower his voice damned if the coons arent fighting sir i wouldnt have believed it either bradford said a good thing though without em we couldnt have held this place ten minutes against that swarm of rebs out there thousands of those bastards thousands sir major booth didnt think there were all that many of them leaming said he guessed fifteen hundred maybe two thousand at the outside nonsense major bradford said look at them just look at them theyve got more soldiers running around than a dog has fleas and if major booth were as smart as he thought he was he wouldnt have walked into a minnie now would he i guess not sir his adjutant answered however many rebs there are doesnt matter anyhow bradford said can you imagine what theyd do to us if we surrendered they hate colored soldiers and they hate tennessee union men they could have the army of northern virginia out there and wed still have to fight isnt that right lieutenant yes sir i guess it is when you put it like that leaming answered all right then well fight on just the way we would have if major booth were still here bradford hesitated then blurted i wish he still were but fort pillow was his again no matter what he wished nathan bedford forrest rode toward the sound of the gunfire ahead it was somewhere near ten in the morning hed been in the saddle since setting out from jackson he was so tired he could hardly see straight his horse had to be every bit as weary the ideal cavalry trooper was a little bandylegged fellow who didnt weight more than pounds well over six feet tall and somewhere close to pounds forrest didnt fit the bill but he was what he was and the horse had to put up with it he knew exhaustion would fall away from him like a discarded cloak once he got to the battlefield most of the time he was a quiet softspoken man in a fight everything changed his voice rose to a roar that could span the field no matter how wide he became a furious and ingeniously profane swearer some men turned pale when they foughtthey were afraid of what might happen to them forrest went hot and ruddy like iron in a smiths forge instead of being hammered though he smashed the damnyankees himself his nostrils twitched yes that was the brimstone reek of gunpowder in the air it smelled like old scratch coming up from the infernal dominions for a look around forrests lips skinned back from his teeth in a fierce mirthless grin he intended to make fort pillow into hell on earth all right the ground around the fort was only indifferently cleared a good many trees still stood and stumps fallen trunks lay scattered every which way even inside the outermost perimeter plenty of cover still remained he watched his men use it to good advantage scooting forward from one stump to another as if they were in an indian fight from the days before he was born seeing a trooper not far away forrest called wheres general chalmers who wants to know the man answered not looking up from the revolver he was reloading bedford forrest thats who forrests voice crackled with danger the way the air will crackle just before lightning strikes when the battle fit hit him he was almost as hard on his own men as he was on the federals now where is he you son of a bitch the trooper hadnt been pale why should he be when he was safely out of enemy rifle range but he went white when he raised his head and saw general forrest he almost dropped a percussion cap and had to fight to say hehehes over yonder sir he pointed west and a little south all right forrest said i dont see you in the fight once you finish loading that hogleg though youll answer to me man to man you hear yyyyes sir the man answerednot the first time nathan bedford forrest had reduced a man from his own force to frightened stammering but what he did to the federals he found brigadier general chalmers about where the trooper said he would chalmers was urging his men forwardalways a good thing for a general to do especially when he wasnt far from the firing line himself nothing encouraged soldiers like officers who shared their risks hows it look jim forrest asked james chalmers whirled even in the informal world of the confederate army even in the extrainformal world of forrests command an officer who led a brigade didnt expect to be addressed by his christian name unless a superior did it hello sir chalmers said saluting so you finally made it up here did you no but i reckon ill get here pretty soon forrest answered dryly his brigade commander blinked then decided he was joking and laughed well im glad to hear that sir we can use you it looks pretty good from what ive seen of it forrest said i think so brigadier general chalmers nodded they sent out skirmishers after we started driving in their pickets but we shifted them too just about all the federals are back inside the main position there they should have hung on to some of the knobs around it they should have but they damn well didnt now weve got men on em and we can shoot down into their works this isnt the best place for a fort with a small garrison no matter what general pillow thought when he set one here already knew that myself forrest said if the yankees cant figure it out too damn bad for them the riffraff theyve got in there theyre asking for everything we give em a bullet cracked past chalmers flinched so did forrest he was no more immune to that reflex than most of his soldiers were it annoyed and angered him but he couldnt do anything about it however little he cared to admit it even to himself he was made of flesh and blood like any other man straightening chalmers said you might do well to get down from that horse sir it makes you a target for the bastards holed up in there you wouldnt want some damn nigger to be able to say he shot the great general forrest would you no but im not going to worry about it either forrest answered and i want to see this place for my own self from one end to the other and the horsell tote me around fastern i could go on shanks mare he always carried out his own reconnaissance when he could more than once hed seen things nobody else did he went on you keep crowding our boys forward you hear jim im doing it chalmers said shortly i know you are keep doing it do more of it get em close to the enemy use that high ground i dont want the federals moving around a lot in there they should ought to be scared to death to step away from that parapet im doing it chalmers repeated this time he smiled a little ive got sharpshooters picking off the union officers whenever they see the chance too there you go forrest said thats what we need if those coons and galvanized yankees havent got anybody to tell em what to do they wont tend to something that needs tending and well get the bulge on em that way he started to ride on toward the mississippi but a minnie caught his horse in the neck blood gushed forth hideously red and stinking like a smithy forrest tried jamming a finger in the wound a trick that had kept another mount of his alive for some little while this horse writhed and thrashed and reared then crashed to the ground pinning forrests leg beneath it pain shot through him he roared out curses kicked at the animal with his free leg and beat it with his fists it rolled off him and thrashed away its life kicking slower and more weakly as blood rivered out of it general chalmers ran up to forrest are you all right sir he asked alarm making his voice almost as shrill as a womans can you get up dont rightly know forrest made himself try it his breath hissed out between his teeth moving hurt like fire but he could move anyhow dont reckon anythings broken he said his right trouser leg was torn his flesh was bruised and scraped and battered the whole leg would be purple and black and swollen tomorrow if it wasnt already but it bore his weight even if it screamed he took a couple of limping steps yes he could manage you were lucky chalmers said as he tried to walk off the worst of it lucky my ass forrest ground out if i was lucky that damned yankee minnie wouldve missed my horse if it did hit the stupid critter he wouldnt have fallen on me that theres luck general this you can keep this the fall could have broken your legor your neck chalmers said the minnie could have hit you instead of the horse all that would have been worse forrest agreed dont mean what happened was good he glowered at the beast that had brought him from jackson its writhing was almost over now its blood pooled on the muddy ground and started soaking in a man had an amazing lot of blood in himyou found out how much when he spilled it all at once a horse had even more forrest had had plenty of horses shot out from under him but he didnt think hed ever had one hurt him so much when it went down got to get me another animal will you tend to that for me yes sir chalmers said and then stubbornly youd still be safer on foot id be slower on foot forrest said nothing else matters now and you dont think dismounted men are getting hit a wounded trooper howled and cursed as his friends led him back toward the surgeons forrest pointed to him the way a schoolmaster would have pointed to an example on the blackboard he chuckled when that occurred to him because his own acquaintance with teachers and blackboards was so brief and sketchy he could read he could write tooafter a fashionhowever little he cared to do it even if he had no education he owned other talents in abundance he had nerve and a fierce and driving energy he also had an unfailing knack for seeing what needed doing at any given moment and he could make people listen to him and take him seriously and do what he told them to do set against all that knowing how to spell didnt seem so important he had men under him who could spell he was the one who set them in motion a horse james chalmers shouted now get general forrest a horse one of the troopers brought up a large sturdylooking beast a horse needed to be of betterthanaverage size to bear a man of his weight thank you kindly edgar forrest said youre welcome general edgars face glowed with pride bedford forrest knew him well enough to call him by name edgar didnt know forrest could call most of his men by name he learned names quickly and they were the easiest handle you could grab to get somebody to follow you mounting hurt it would have hurt worse if the blamed horse had fallen on his other leg jim chalmers would have said he was lucky it didnt forrest didnt give a damn what chalmers would have said almost getting his leg broken wasnt lucky not so far as he could see when he booted the horse into motion riding hurt too but walking would have hurt worse and it would have been slower and speed counted now speed always counted to bedford forrest plenty of people knew how he talked about getting there first with the most if you got there first sometimes having the most didnt even matter over the next hour he painstakingly reconnoitered from the mississippi to coal creek like general chalmers captain anderson begged him to do the job on foot so he would offer the yankees less of a target voice testymaybe the pain was talking through himforrest answered im just as apt to be hit one way as another and he had that sturdy horse shot out from under him though it was only wounded but got yet another remount and finished the reconnaissance when he did his smile was purely predatory weve got em he said v below the bluff on which the innermost line of fort pillows works sat a crescentshaped ravine ran north into coal creek corporal jack jenkins crouched in that ravine only a few feet away from general forrest when forrest declared that he and his men had the federals inside the fort jenkins was glad general forrest thought so forrest commonly knew what he was talking about jenkins hoped the general did this time he hoped so yes but he was a hell of a long way from convinced if coal creek ravine wasnt hell on earth you could see it from there jenkins had ridden through the hatchie bottoms to get to fort pillow coal creek seemed a distillation of everything that was worst about the bottom country the ground was muddy enough to suck the shoes right off a mans feet every sort of clinging vine and thorn bush seemed to grow there all of them clutching at trouser legs and tunic sleeves when jack and the other troopers in colonel barteaus regiment tried to push on toward the fort poison ivy poison oak poison sumac jenkins tried not to think about any of those if he broke out in welts later on then he did that was all now he just wanted to close with the enemy one thing worked in his favor and in favor of the rest of the men in the second tennessee cavalry cs because fort pillow stood so high above coal creek ravine and because its earthen rampart was so thick the soldiers inside the fort had to crawl out on top of the earthwork to shoot down into the ravine when they did confederate sharpshooters farther back and higher up had clean shots at them after a couple of federals were wounded or perhaps killed the rest seemed less eager to expose themselves the cannon inside fort pillow would not bear on the ravine at all every so often shrapnel rounds or solid shot would snarl by overhead but they always came down far to the rear that didnt mean the troopers in coal creek ravine went altogether free of bombardment the yankee gunboat out in the mississippi lobbed an occasional shell into the ravine jenkins hated the gunboat it could strike with impunity for the confederates werent able to shoot back at it but it was firing blind just as the bluff and the fort atop it shielded the gunboat from cs fire so they also shielded the confederates from the sailors who aimed the boats cannon some of the black men and tennessee tories inside fort pillow had nerve enough to keep exposing themselves to confederate fire one negro soldier crawled out on top of the earthwork and had his pals within the fort pass him one loaded rifle musket after another so he sent an almost continual stream of bullets down into the ravine corporal jenkins took a shot at him so did a couple of other confederate troopers not far away the smoke that burst from their rifles announced where they were in moments the negro sent minnies whistling through the undergrowth close to each of the three men as jenkins reloaded he said to hell with me if that niggers not too dumb to realize how much trouble hes in i wouldnt be crazy enough to stick myself out there thats for damn sure one of the nearby confederates agreed more bullets whipped past the colored man had he been whiteeven if he were only a homemade yankeejenkins would have respected his courage but the corporal didnt want to admit even to himself that a negro had courage if a black man could be brave wasnt he much the same sort of man as a white and if he was much the same as a white how could he also naturally be a slave those two things didnt fit together jenkins could see that as plainly as abe lincoln could where it forced the president of the united states to conclude that all men should be free it forced the southerner and most of his comrades to deny the possibility that negroes could show the same sort of courage as white men if jenkins saw a black man exposing himself to enemy fire then the blueuniformed negro couldnt be brave he had to be stupid instead another minie ball clipped leaves and twigs a few feet away from jenkins this heres warmer work than i reckoned it would be he said well get em another trooper said long as they dont get reinforced from down the river well get em and even if they do weve still got most of the high ground well make em sorry they holed up in there squelching through the mire at the bottom of coal creek ravine jenkins thought of high ground as little more than a rumor something slithered over his boot and vanished in the bushes maybe it was just a water snake not a copperhead or a cottonmouth he hoped so because he didnt know how far away it had slithered after what seemed like forever and was probably fifteen minutes or so the negro soldier let out a holler and scrambled back into the fort somebody nailed the son of a bitch jenkins exclaimed about time you see where he got it one of his friends asked gleefully not me jenkins shook his head i was ramming a cartridge home that was true but he wasnt sorry to have been screened off by the undergrowth the damn coon had come too close to hitting him a couple of times so where they shot him right in the ass the other cs trooper said probably give him a brain concussion jenkins said remember that yankee general who said he was going to make his headquarters in the saddle that was general pope he had his headquarters in his hindquarters just like that nigger the other man said once he ran up against bobby lee it didnt matter where his headquarters were at anyways youre sure right there jenkins said every federal general whod operated against robert e lee had come to grief the confederates luck wasnt so good out here in the west but they were still in the fight and the union troops holed up in fort pillow would pay for forgetting it a bullet cracked past bill bradford close enough to make him duck he imagined he felt the minnie tug at the brim of his slouch hat but the hat seemed untouched when he took it off and looked at it he set it back on his head pulling it down low as if to make himself a smaller target another confederate fired at him again the bullet made him flex his knees this time though he felt no phantom tugs he scowled at the cloud of blackpowder smoke rising from one of the barracks in front of the fort the confederates seemed to infest both rows of wooden buildings captain carron he called yes sir the artilleryman answered standing by his twelvepounder will that piece of yours reach those barracks halls the rebs have got men in them and theyre close enough to make the fire annoying that was a polite way to put it when the rebs almost parted his hair with a minie ball major bradford wasnt just annoyed he was scared green captain carron shook his head sorry major but i cant do it the gun wont depress far enough to hit those huts damnation bradford said how am i supposed to shift the devils sheltering in them then you could burn them out carron suggested bradford hadnt thought of that now that the artillery officer planted the idea in his mind though he found that he liked it lieutenant leaming he said where the oh there you are yes sir here i am his adjutant agreed what do you need from me sir i want you to gather aa storming party i guess youd call it bradford answered the rebs are shooting at us from those barracks he pointed i want the men to take torches along with their springfields they are to burn down the buildings and then return to the fort is that clear yes sir leaming said do you think fifty men will be enough shall i send some niggers along with our tennessee troopers if fifty cant do the job no larger number can bradford said and no leave the niggers here inside the fort i dont know how well theyd fight out in the open and they shouldnt go out where they can be captured anyway forrests men dont love colored soldiers all right sir leaming replied ill tend to it there was some small delay assembling the storming party there was a larger delay equipping the troopers with torches but they swarmed out of the fort bravely enough hurrah they shouted as they went forward hurrah the us war cry wasnt so impressive as the rebel yell but they showed good spirit the confederates didnt have many men in those barracks buildings h they had they could have slaughtered the onrushing men from the thirteenth tennessee cavalry they did knock down a couple of soldiers but only a couple then the men in blue reached the first row of barracks major bradford whooped when smoke began to rise the rains of the past few days had soaked the wood hed feared it wouldnt catch but two or three of the buildings started burning his men also fired at the confederates lurking there and theyd gone out with fixed bayonets they could skewer any reb who got too close most of the time a bayonet made a good knife and a good candle holder but not much else in close combat where a foe might jump out any time though the federal assault naturally drew the enemys notice confederates ran toward the two rows of barracks buildings too the rebs rushing up had no kind of order but they outnumbered the men from the us storming party come on bradford shouted to the tennessee troopers inside fort pillow and to the colored artillerymen now fighting as infantry shoot those rebel bastards dont let them gain a lodgment there he wondered if the negroes knew what a lodgment was it didnt matter they could see that letting the confederates shoot at them from cover at close range wasnt a good idea as he ordered the black men to shift position behind the earthwork so more of them could fire at the wooden buildings he paid them the highest compliment any officer from tennessee could give he forgot what color they were he treated them the same way as he treated the troopers from his own regiment in time of danger they were all just soldiers maybe some of the negroes had dipped up a little too much dutch courage they capered and gestured to show their scorn for the enemy along with obscene taunts they thumbed their noses and stuck their thumbs in their ears and waggled their fingers they made ridiculous faces their expressions all the more absurd because their teeth and tongues and eyeballs showed up so well against their dark hides and major bradford laughed and slapped his thigh and urged them on let the rebs see his men werent afraid even if he was let them see negroes could fight too he wouldnt have believed it himself but he had no more doubts they could they really could a minnie kicked up dirt between matt wards feet as he ran toward the two rows of wooden huts in front of fort pillow another snapped past at about breast height a couple of feet to the right and it would have torn his heart out he didnt have time to be afraidor maybe he was already as afraid as he could be and one more near miss made no difference he dashed past somebody who lay on the ground writhing poor bastard he thought and tried not to remember that that could still happen to him with luck it was only a flesh wound and the other man would get better if it didnt fester without luck well that was one more thing you didnt want to think about then he got in back of the second row of wooden shacks bullets stopped flying all around him his relief lasted perhaps half a minute after that he realized the fight went on and at close quarters this was different from shooting at the enemy from long range you had to think about when you pulled the trigger here because you were hideously vulnerable if you fired and missed and had to reload ward wished for a sixshooter instead of his singleshot enfield wishing didnt make a revolver fall out of the sky he edged up to the space between two buildings ever so cautiously he stuck out a hand as if to feel if the enemy was there when no one shot at him he looked into the space no yankee rushed toward him or worse waited with aimed rifle musket for a target more deadly than a hand carrying his own weapon at the ready he moved up toward the first row of buildings smoke made him cough the homemade yankees had already fired some of the barracks he saw a running shape through the smoke friend or foe the other soldier saw him too and started to bring his musket up to his shoulder that decided matt anyone who aimed a weapon at him was an enemy no matter which uniform he had on ward shot first the other soldier screamed and staggered and fell he fired too but wildly into the air he wasnt dead he feebly tried to crawl back toward fort pillow that told ward he really was a damnyankee rushing forward the missourian drove his bayonet home again and again hed never used it before but hed never been in a mad cramped fight like this before either he was amazed and more than a little appalled at how many times he had to stab before the other man stopped moving sometimes people were harder to kill than anyone who hadnt fought in war could imagine just then with the enfield unloaded ward felt all too easy to kill he reloaded as fast as he could trying his best not to drop the cartridge or fumble with the ramrod or do any of the other stupid things that would waste time hed heard of men who in the heat of battle rammed home cartridge after cartridge without ever putting a cap on the nipple with the roar of gunfire all around they got too excited to notice that their piece wasnt roaring or belching smoke or kicking sometimes they would cap it with several rounds in the barrel then the rifle musket commonly blew up in their face cartridge bitten open and rammed home copper cap on the nipple enfield half cocked ward nodded to himself he was ready to shoot again the smoke got thicker he coughed and rubbed at his streaming eyes between the smoke and the black powder he got on his face whenever he reloaded he hoped his fellow troopers wouldnt shoot him for a nigger the row of buildings closest to the fort was on fire the damned tennessee tories had done that much and ward didnt see what he and his comrades could do but let those huts burn the second row remained intact the barracks there could still give the confederates good cover if the federals didnt fire them another indistinct shape came through the smoke no this fellow had a torch in his hand which left no doubt whose side he was on forrest ward shouted and fired at him to his disgust he missed before hed sniped at men inside fort pillow from several hundred yards and was pretty sure hed scored hits here he could damn near spit on this bluebelly but he missed him it was embarrassing it happened all the time but it was still embarrassing jesus god the enemy trooper screeched when the rifle musket roared not thirty feet away and the minnie cracked past him he dropped the torch and dashed back toward fort pillow in great terrified bounds his feet hardly seeming to touch the ground ward didnt think a catamount could have caught him let alone a mere man missing him hadnt been so bad then he was out of the fight here anyway matt ward tried to console himself as he reloaded again you could talk yourself into believing almost anything if you tried hard enough more and more men in blue uniforms ran back to the earthwork on the bluff unless the wind suddenly swung it didnt look as if the second row of wooden buildings would catch and if they stayed intact ward and the other confederates whod saved them would be able to go on peppering fort pillow from the cover they gave that was the point of the clash for a little while the smoke and flames rising from the nearer row of barracks buildings let lieutenant mack leaming believe both rows were on fire but the bullets still coming from the wooden structures soon disabused him of that notion the men hed sent out to burn both rows of buildings at major bradfords orders had torched the first row but not the second they wouldnt have the chance to do it now they were falling back toward fort pillow some of them were running scrambling up the forward face of the bluff as far as they could go others moved more slowlythose were men who would pause to shoot at the rebs when they got the chance still others helped wounded comrades toward what they hoped would be safety a bullet whistled over leamings head he didnt worry about bullets that whistled they were too far away to be dangerous bullets that cracked bythose were the near misses the scary rounds people said you never heard the one that got you leaming didnt know if that was true and didnt want to find out either lieutenant why are those men retreating major bradford demanded sir there are probably too many secesh troopers to hold off leaming answered if they dont come back theyll all get killed but they didnt do what i sent them out there to do bradford said no sir leaming said sometimesoftenthe least answer you could give was the best one but they needed to burn those buildings bradford said we are in danger as long as forrests men can fire from them yes sir lieutenant leaming said it wasnt as if bradford were wrong they were in danger from the confederates in the barracks buildings as if to prove as much a minnie snapped past over the majors head bradford automatically ducked so did leaming what are we going to do we cant let them establish themselves there the commandant said we cant stop them from establishing themselves there leaming thought we tried it didnt work major bradford had to know that as well as he did since bradford had to know it leaming couldnt think of any answer for him then he had a happy thought maybe the new era can shell them out maybe major bradford brightened he had great faith in the gunboat in the mississippimore faith than its performance so far justified as far as leaming was concerned go tell my brother to direct the gunboats fire against those buildings yes sir lieutenant leaming tried to sound cooperative not resigned hed given the major the idea after all he trotted over to captain theodorick bradford at the edge of the steep bluff leading down to the river your brothers compliments sir and he says for you to tell the new era to pound the stuffing out of the barracks halls and drive the rebs out of em well ill try theo bradford said dubiously he held up the pair of large wigwag flags and semaphored with great vigor leaming peered down down down to the new era from this distance the gunboat seemed hardly bigger than a toy an officeror maybe a sailoron her deck signaled back whats he say leaming asked says theyll tryi think captain bradford sounded harried i wish to god i had a spyglass so i could make out his flags better i cant be sure what hes telling me half the time can he read you leaming asked anxiously i sure hope so theodorick bradford saidnot the most encouraging response he could have given but the new era had the request the gunboat did its best to comply its guns swung in the direction of the twin rows of barracks halls leaming admired thatthe sailors far below couldnt see what they were aiming at one after another the cannon went off fire and smoke belched from their muzzles he watched the shells rise into the cloudy air then descend toward their targets booms said theyd hitsomewhere were those on the mark leaming asked captain bradford shrugged damned if i know i can see the gunboat or else i can see what its shooting at i cant do both at once he waved the wigwag flags again the more shell the boat puts down the better the chance that some of them will come down where we want them to i see leaming said he didnt say what he saw which was bound to be just as well since he couldnt change anything complaining wouldnt do him any good but major william bradford plainly thought the new era was a vital part of fort pillows defenses against forrests men and so the gunboat might have beenif only it could hit its targets with something resembling accuracy as things were mack leaming grimaced as things were the new era was doing the best it could and he had to hope that would be enough not long after nathan bedford forrest finished his reconnaissance of the ground in front of fort pillow a soldier in a butternut tunic and blue trousers trotted up to him hed issued orders that shirts captured from the yankees had to go into the dye pots right away so his men wouldnt shoot at one another by mistake trousers were supposed to be dyed too but that was less urgent whats up red he asked about half a dozen men in his command answered to that nickname this lanky mississippian had hair the color of a newly minted copper penny and ears that stuck out a good four inches he said ammunition wagons just came up general did they by heaven forrest said about time yes sir red said he probably didnt worry about the struggle theyd had moving those wagons along the narrow rutted muddy roads that went through the hatchie bottoms especially the troubles theyd had moving them along in pitch darkness he did have sense enough to ask any special orders for em just make goddamn sure you get those cartridges up to the men who need em the most forrest answered red sketched a salute and went back the way hed come bedford forrest slowly nodded to himself up till now his men had had only the cartridges they carried with them they were supposed to bring enough to fight witha rifle musket and cartridges were all a soldier really needed but some would have more ammunition some less and some none at all forrest knew only too well that plenty of soldiers were naturalborn knuckleheads with the wagons here at last though he didnt have to worry about that any more he wished he would have been able to bring field guns forward too but that just wasnt in the cards one of the federals cannon roared the guns in the fort and the ones on the boat in the river were nuisances but they werent anything worse than nuisances if he could have dropped shells into that cramped space inside the us earthwork though he shrugged worrying about mighthavebeens wasnt his style another cannon inside fort pillow fired at his men those really were niggers manning the guns in there easy enough to seem brave when they were shooting from inside an earthwork they wouldnt act like such big men when they met his troopers facetoface his hands folded into fists he was sure of that oh yes for now though the coons were having a high old time skylarking and fooling around and mocking forrests men as if the confederate soldiers would never have the chance to pay them back they gave the troopers obscene gestures one negro even turned around and dropped his pants to show them his bare brown backside forrest hoped that negro would take a bullet where it did him the most good no doubt all the confederates who saw him did their best to give him what he deserved but he pulled his trousers up again waggled his bottom at the attackers one last time and jumped down behind the rampart again in spite of himself forrest laughed say what you would that negro had nervewhich only made him need killing more ordinary blacks were no great trouble they did what they were told the same way ordinary whites did an uppity nigger though an uppity nigger was trouble he might as well have smallpox or measles or some other deadly contagious disease he could infect others with what he carried and if he did he made them dangerous to white men too we got here just in time sir captain anderson said coming up beside forrest quiet fury filled the aidedecamps voice hows that forrest asked well sir the longer we let these niggers think theyre soldiers the longer they have the chance to believe it the more trouble theyll be in the long runnot just facing us but spreading their nonsense to other coons anderson said bettermuch betterto nip all that in the bud i was thinking pretty much the same thing forrest said if we teach those sons of bitches a good lesson every smoke who puts on a federal uniform will remember it from here on out anderson said dont know much about lessons dont care much about lessons neither forrest grimaced remembering his own brief irregular schooling i just want to get in there clean this place out and then go give the damn yankees another boot in the behind somewheres else a boot in the behind isnt what that one damnfool nigger deserved captain anderson still seethed a minnie up the cornholethats more like it hell get his forrest said we can find out who he is and damn well make sure he gets his yes sir but captain anderson remained discontented hes not the only nigger acting that wayhes just the worst i know i know a shell from the gunboat in the mississippi crashed down not far from the row of wooden huts the confederates had captured the cannon in the fort wouldnt bear on those barracks buildings but the gunboat kept pestering them another shell burst over there somebody screameda sliver of iron must have struck home forrest pointed that way heres something for you to do captain what is it sir find yourself some men who dont look like theyre busy doing anything else bedford forrests mouth quirked in a wry grinyou could always find plenty of men like that on a battlefield he pointed west toward the great river take em over there if we have to storm the fort well want to grab the riverbank just as quick as we can well be able to shoot back at that damn gunboat then and well make sure the damnyankees cant land any reinforcements too ill do it anderson said reinforcements are about the only thing that can save that place arent they nothings going to save fort pillow nathan bedford forrest said you hear me nothing here they come again captain carron shouted sure enough a couple of hours after their first headlong assault on fort pillow was beaten back the confederates made another push sergeant ben robinson and his crew served their twelvepounder like steamdriven mechanical men they sent one round of shrapnel after another at bedford forrests troopers but the rebs were able to get under the range of the gun the way robinson had feared they would because of the thick earthwork the crew couldnt depress the cannon enough to bear on them when they drew near it was up to the soldiers with springfields then the colored artillerymen who didnt have a big gun to serve and the dismounted troopers of the thirteenth tennessee cavalry they had the same trouble the gunners did though to a lesser degree because of the thick parapet protecting fort pillow they couldnt easily fire down on the enemy soldiers coming up the steep ground toward them if they tried they exposed themselves to secesh sharpshooters the rebs were good marksmen they wounded several federals who tried to pick off their friends all the same forrests men had to run a gauntlet to get too far forward for vs gunfire to bear on them enough of them got hit to make the rest lose heart most of them fell back out of easy range with only a few hanging on down below where the men in the fort had trouble shooting at them seeing forrests fierce fighters move away from fort pillow made charlie key and sandy cole and the rest of the blacks in the gun crew jump in the air and click their heels together look at em run charlie shouted just look at em run they aint so god damn tough confederate minnies still cracked past the gunners they aint quit yet neither robinson pointed out if you forgot thator maybe even if you didntyoud stop a bullet with your face charlie was too excited to care so was sandy cole so what if they aint benuh sergeant ben he said so what you ever reckon youd live to see the day when we had guns an the buckra was runnin from us feel so good watchin em go i reckon i done gone to heaven you keep carryin on like a damn fool a minnie send you straight to heaven ben said gruffly he knew what a sergeant was supposed to sound like hed had several fine white examples and his own manner proved him an excellent scholar all the same he knew just what sandy was driving at one of the reasons slavery persisted in the south was that whites intimidated blacks blacks had always been sure that if they got out of line if they tried to rise up whites would fall on them like an avalanche whites would be bold whites would be fierce whites would be fearless negroes believed it anyhow how could they help but believe it when every sign of unrest was ruthlessly put down ben robinson had believed it himself back before the war started whites were so sure of their own superiority they convinced negroes of it too didnt most colored men prefer lightskinned women to their duskier cousins werent very black men men with broad flat noses and wide lips reckoned uglier than those formed more in the image of their masters but how could you go on thinking somebody was better than you by nature when he ran away for fear that you would blow him a new asshole with your springfield wasnt he a man just like you wasnt he a frightened man just like you it sure looked that way to ben sandy cole and charlie key werent the only negroes jeering at the confederates as they fell backfar from it the gun crews were fairly restrained their officers seemed to have them well in hand but the colored artillerymen serving as foot soldiers alongside the whites of the thirteenth tennessee cavalry were lapping up the sutlers whiskey as if someone would outlaw it tomorrow robinson didnt know if that meant they werent shooting straight he didnt need to be grant or sherman to see that they werent thinking straight scuse me capn suh he said yes sergeant robinson what is it captain carron gave his three stripes their due suh kin we git the sutlers to put up them whiskey barrels now robinson asked reckon the men done plenty drinkin reckon mebbe some of em done too much drinkin i dont think its harming them any sergeant the white officer answered it keeps their spirits up you might say he smiled at his own joke ben robinson didnt carrons head swung this way and that as he looked along the line the tennesseans are drinking too you know yes suh robinsons agreement was thick with disapproval if anything the troopers made rowdier drunks than the colored artillerymen one of the white men yelled something at the confederates that would have made robinson want to kill him were it aimed his way they is actin like fools their ownselves captain carron frowned ben knew why hed called white men fools even in the vs army even when it was an obvious truth a negro wasnt supposed to do that ben robinson might not have been a slave any more but he wasnt exactly a free man either not even in the eyes of the power that had put a uniform on his back two colored soldiers both laughing like idiots shouted things at the confederates that made what the tennessee trooper had said sound like an endearment that was so funny they had to hold each other up then they shouted something viler yet but they might not have said anything at all if the drunken white man didnt give them the idea even through the din of cannon fire and musketry those insults carried out there beyond rifle range some of bedford forrests hardbitten troopers were shaking their fists at fort pillow ben didnt want to make forrests men any angrier at him than they already were why couldnt anybody else see the plain sense in that vi noon came and went the firing from around fort pillow and from within the embattled fortress went on and on major william bradford began to have its measure indeed he began to think it mattered less than it did when bedford forrests men first attacked bradford had feared they would storm the earthwork theyd triedtheyd tried hard from first light of day till now theyd tried and they hadnt had any luck to bradfords eye that meant they couldnt have any luck keep shooting men he yelled kill em all theyll never break in never you hear me the vs soldiers white and black cheered raucously theyd taken fresh courage too the colored men especially began treating war more as a game than as a serious business they danced and sang and yelled bits of filth at the confederates men from the thirteenth tennessee cavalry did the same thing sir do we really want to tick the rebs off like this lieutenant leaming asked what difference does it make bradford said grandly he felt like dropping his trousers and waving his backside in forrests face the way that one negro had he didnt do it but he felt like it but then a minnie snapped past just in front of his nose so close that he could feel the wind of its passageor at least so close that he thought he could hed seen a couple of men who got hit in the face he wished he hadnt of itself his hand came up to caress his handsome features yes they were still intact even so the near miss made him stop thinking about what his soldiers could do to the confederates and start worrying about what forrests men could do to fort pillow he walked over to talk to theodorick who was wigwagging signals to the new era if that also took him away from the rebels fire well he wasnt altogether brokenhearted hello bill theo said were giving em hell arent we as if to prove his point the gunboat roared out another volley bradford smiled as the shells hissed through the air and again when they burst among the rebs see how you like it you bastards he thought but then he brought his mind back to business send a question down to captain marshall if youd be so kind he said at your service his brother looked attentive what is it ask him if the new era can support us with canister if we have to come down by the riverside if the confederates broke into fort pillow that meant it sounded much better when he said it the way he did though but no matter how he said it theodorick understood the true meaning is that likely the older officer asked sudden alarm in his voice and on his face no no no william bradford said quickly as much to reassure himself as to ease theos mind i just want to cover every possible contingency there was a fine impressivesounding word all right bill theo sounded relieved he waved his flags to draw the new eras notice then started semaphoring again his younger brother admired his speed and what looked like his precision though semaphore signals were a closed book to the major isnt anyone paying attention down there he asked but then down on the gunboat in the mississippi someone with flags of his own wigwagged from the foredeck they have the message theo reported well what do they say about it bradford demanded nothing yet his brother answered they have to pass it on to captain marshall and wait for his reply all right i understand bill bradford also had to wait he liked it no better than any other busy important man would haveso he thought of himself after what seemed a very long time but couldnt have been more than a couple of minutes the sailor with the semaphore flags on the new era started using them at your service in every way captain marshall says theodorick told his brother thats good thanks a lot theo bradford took off his hat and waved it in salute to the gunboat though the sailors far below probably wouldnt notice more than a little reluctantly he made his way back toward the firing nothing had hit him yet nothing would hit him he kept telling himself so over and over again whenever the law had to say something repeatedly it was a sign nobody was paying attention to it as an attorney bill bradford understood that principle applying it to his own case didnt occur to him which might have been just as well captain young he shouted where are you captain im here sir john young answered after bradford called his name several times fort pillows provost marshal was a large solidly built man with a habitual scowl and a black beard so thick it was almost like a pelt what do you need bradford pointed toward the new era i want you to get some men to take a store of cartridges down to the riverbank if we have to fight down there dont want it to be just with whatever ammunition we chance to carry with us captain youngs frown deepened if we have to fight by the riverbank that will mean the rebs have carried the fort he said major bradford waited with a scowl of his own after a pause that stretched young added sir yes i know it will bradford said would you rather not nail new shingles on the roof in case of rain young grunted well when you put it that way that is precisely how i put it captain bradford drew himself up again he didnt have to wait so long this time with a crisp salute young said yes sir ill take care of it he started shouting for soldiers before long he had men lurching and staggering down the side of the bluff two of them carrying each heavy crate all right sir he reported when the job was done weve got half a dozen cases of minnies down there if those arent enough to keep up the fight god help us all yes major bradford said god help us all bedford forrest watched the fighting at fort pillow from a swell of ground about a quarter of a mile from the federal earthworks sharpshooters from colonel mccullochs brigade not far away sniped at the union men unlike the troops farther forward who simply fired as fast as they could the sharpshooters took their time and made sure they had good targets before they pulled the trigger there you go forrest shouted encouragement keep banging away at them theyll fall down one of the sharpshooters whooped so maybe the soldier hed aimed at did fall over forrest hoped so the men in blue inside the fort were putting up a stronger fight than hed expected he still thought he could overrun their workswith his men on so many high spots around fort pillow they could fire into the fort with devastating effect and could keep the enemy from doing as much as he would want to when the final assault came still that final assault was liable to prove more costly than he looked for when he set out from jackson and so a slow smile spread over his face even if the colored troops and homemade yankees inside the fort hadnt fought unusually well he supposed he would have trotted out one of his favorite ploys he used it for one simple reason it worked often enough to make it worthwhile captain anderson he yelled where in the tarnation is captain anderson then he laughed at himself to hell with me if i didnt send him down to the riverbank my very own self he called to one of the soldiers on the little rise with him hey zach go down to the river and bring captain anderson here will you sure will general zach hurried away bedford forrest smiled sometimes an order phrased as a request worked better than any other kind touchy about their personal pride a lot of confederates resented being flatout told what to do rough steeply sloping ground and fallen trees made zachs trip down to the riverbank slower than it might have been captain anderson couldnt come back up much faster even if he was on horseback sketching a salute to forrest he said whats up sir forrest pointed toward the fort im going to give those people in there a chance to surrender sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt sure worked in union city three weeks ago a smile stole over andersons face poor colonel hawkins has surrendered to you twice now even though you were only there once well so he has forrest grinned too his detachment under colonel duckworth that intimidatedbuffaloed reallythe luckless isaac hawkins into yielding union city was a good deal weaker than the force that surrendered to it a lot of the federal officers who went into captivity were furious at their commanderwhich did them no good at all all right sir lets see if theyll throw in the sponge captain anderson always had paper and pencil handy go ahead headquarters forrests cavalry before fort pillow april twelfth eighteen sixtyfour forrest had sent in a lot of surrender demands he could begin one without even needing to think about it his aidedecamp scribbled furiously then the general commanding paused whats the name of the yankee son of a bitch in charge there charles anderson always had such minutiae at his fingertips he made a good aidedecamp booth sir lionel booth hes a major yes i remembered that well then he paused again captain anderson poised the pencil forrest resumed major booth commanding united states forces fort pillow major he weighed phrases in his mind the officers and men of fort pillow have fought well as usual fought came out as fit this time he shook his head no that wont do it hasnt got the right pitch to it start again sir anderson asked hed seen forrest edit despatches on the fly before reckon id better hows this forrest said the conduct of the officers and men garrisoning fort pillow has been the delay this time was to let andersons pencil catch up such as to entitle them to being treated as prisoners of war listening he nodded yes thatll do im up with you sir captain anderson said what next i demand the unconditional surrender of this garrison promising you that you shall be treated as prisoners of war forrest knew hed repeated himself but let it go the federals were bound to be anxious about the point he went on my men have received a fresh supply of ammunition and from their present position can easily assault and capture the fort every word of thats true his aidedecamp said when he caught up with forrests dictation he grinned again forrest and the commanders who served under him had lied like ananias in several surrender demands most recently the one that bagged union city they didnt always work either the fortress up at paducah kentucky had held out against his forces not long before even though his men controlled most of the town for half a day now for the warning anderson asked oh yes even though the federals inside fort pillow couldnt hear him bedford forrest sounded lionfierce as he continued should my demand be refused i cannot be responsible for the fate of your command respectfully nb forrest majorgeneral commanding read that back to me anderson yes sir anderson said and then when it was done does it suit you yes itll do forrest said shall i deliver it to the enemy myself anderson asked no i want you back down by the river fast as you can get there forrest replied ill send somebody else he looked around for another man and spotted one of general chalmerss staff officers not far away ready to do anything chalmers might require of him well i need him more than jim does now forrest thought captain goodman he called yes sir walter goodman was not only braveno one who wasnt brave served under forrest for longbut had a pretty good head on his shoulders what can i do for you sir take a flag of truce and ride up toward the fort forrest answered that drew chalmerss notice too forrest thought it might he went on captain anderson here has written out a call for the federals to surrender will you take it to them he held out the paper of course sir goodman said good forrest nodded to himself again hed phrased the order as a request but that didnt make it any less an order round up a couple of more officers as you go forward if you care tothatll give you a properlooking truce party ill take care of it captain goodman read the surrender demand he looked up with a frown on his face ask you a question sir what is it forrest said something not clear you say the garrisons entitled to be treated as prisoners of war goodman replied does that include the niggers too the federals are bound to ask and theyve got a hell of a lot of coons in there forrest grimaced unhappily what to do about negroes in blue uniforms had bedeviled the confederacy since the usa started arming them the usual practice codified by a law out of richmond was to return runaway slaveswho formed the bulk of the colored troopsto their owners here though yes dammit well treat the niggers as prisoners of war if they give up now i want that fort and i want it before the yankees can bring reinforcements up the river he glanced over to general chalmers chalmers didnt look happy about it either but he nodded walter goodman looked sorry hed asked all right sir he said but a lot of the men wont like it he wasnt wrong if anything ordinary confederate troopers hated the idea of colored soldiers worse than their officers did but challenging or even seeming to challenge nathan bedford forrest was the wrong thing to do bristling the general commanding snapped if i say well take nigger prisoners as long as the federals give up now then we damn well will have you got that captain oh yes sir captain goodman said hastily all right then forrests temper cooled as quickly as it rose go on forward and see what this major booth has to say for himself if he has any sense hell quit now while hes still able to brigadier general chalmers said we can storm the place if hes stubborn looks that way to me too forrest agreed captain goodman shouted for a white cloth he could make into a flag of truce when he had one he started up toward fort pillow forrest sent captain anderson back down to the mississippi well he said as firing began to fade with men on both sides spying the white flag now we see what happens next look sir an excited trooper from the thirteenth tennessee cavalry called to mack leaming the rebs are sending up a truce flag so they are lieutenant leaming didnt sound as happy as the private did forrest used flags of truce all the time he was known to take advantage of them too if he saw the chance to do it for the moment though the rattle of musketry from both sides faded major bradford called out a command to his brother for gods sake theo let the new era know weve got a ceasefire yes sir theodorick bradford waved the wigwag flags as if suddenly stricken with st vitus dance a few minutes earlier gunfire would have drowned his voice and his younger brothers now they rang clearly the loudest things on the suddenly quiet field leaming bill bradford shouted are you there leaming the commandant couldnt have been standing more than twenty feet away from leaming but his back was turned so he could call to his signals officer im here sir the adjutant replied bradford turned well so you are he said with a sheepish smile pointing out toward the approaching confederate truce party he went on i want you to go find out what the enemy has in mind yes sir leaming couldnt help blurting by myself sir major bradford started to nod but then checked himself well maybe not he allowed we dont want forrest to reckon we can only spare the one man do we now thats what meant sir leaming said gratefully and it was part of what he meant anyhow going out there alone to face forrests fearsome fighters even under flag of truce also struck him as too much like sticking his head in the lions mouth if he didnt have to admit that out loud he didnt want to fair enough major bradford said take captain young with you then hes a sharp fellow and solid as a rock andhe looked around and nodded toward the first other officer he sawtake lieutenant van horn with you too and a few mounted men for swank yes sir leaming nodded too he liked that a lot better easier to stay brave when you werent trying to do it all by yourself and bringing along second lieutenant dan van horn was a downright good idea he came from the sixth us heavy artillery colored and could report directly to his fellow officersthose of them left aliveabout what went on van horn was a young man younger than mack leaming he still looked excited about the fighting which was more than leaming could say john young didnt but he wasnt a man who would rattle easily eitherbradford was right about that as for the troopers leaming picked the first four men he saw and told them to get up on horseback less than five minutes later he and his companions carrying their own flag of truce went down from fort pillow toward the confederates who waited on the ground that sloped up toward the fort from the end of the battered rows of barracks buildings nearer the mississippi all the rebs were mounted leaming young and van horn moved forward on foot good morning gentlemen polite as a cat the cs officer holding the white flag saluted his us opposite numbers i am captain walter goodman general chalmerss adjutant general accompanying me are captain tom henderson commanding our scouts and lieutenant frank rogers he didnt bother naming the enlisted men with his party pleased to make your acquaintance captain goodman leaming saluted too the formal courtesies of war went on even while men did their best to murder one another so did life in general only a few feet away a robin hopped over the muddy ground now and then pausing to pull up a worm leaming introduced himself continuing i have the honor to be post adjutant with me are captain john young our provost marshal and lieutenant dan van horn captain goodman hadnt said what lieutenant rogers did lieutenant leaming didnt mention that lieutenant van horn led colored troops he also didnt name the troopers from the thirteenth tennessee cavalry whod come forward with him goodman held out a folded sheet of paper please take this to your commander lieutenant it is general forrests demand for the surrender of the fort i will convey it to him sir leaming said may i read it first so i can clear up with you any questions he is likely to have by all means captain goodman nodded and gestured be my guest leaming unfolded the paper from everything hed heard bedford forrest was not an educated man by the smooth flowing script he saw he doubted the confederate commander had written this note himself but it held forrests fierce arrogant tone all the same i do have a question leaming said when he finished reading it ask sir ask walter goodman was the soul of politeness he might have been trying to sell leaming a phaeton or a surrey not trying to talk him into going into captivity he might have been but he wasnt general forrest says i demand the unconditional surrender of this garrison promising you that you shall be treated as prisoners of war leaming read captain goodman nodded again the federal officer went on you will know we have colored troops inside the fort does this promise extend to them as well they too will be treated as prisoners of war and will not be killed out of hand or reenslaved yes sir that is correct the niggers will be treated as prisoners of war on the same terms as white men if you surrender now walter goodman said as it happens i raised this point myself with both general forrest and general chalmers wanting to make sure no unfortunate misunderstandings arose from it they both stated very clearly that they will accept the colored soldiers under the terms of this demand goodman leaned toward leaming his politesse did not slip not quite but he let the hostility below show through bear in mind also sir that if you refuse we shall not answer for the safety of any man within fort pillow black or white is that plain it could scarcely be plainer captain with captain young and lieutenant van horn beside him leaming had to affect a nonchalance he did not feel very well any further questions goodman asked no sir i will carry this message to my commanding officer leaming had seen that the demand was addressed to major booth booth would be reading it from the pearly gates from which place his comments were unlikely to return but the confederates didnt need to know command had devolved upon a less experienced man leaming did not mention major bradfords name he just turned to his companions and said lets go i expect major booths answer in short order goodman warned proving again that he didnt know booth was dead no delay here will be tolerated i will make that very plain sir leaming said once more he said not a word about to whom he would make it plain his footfalls and those of the two officers with him and the clop of the horses hooves and jingle of their harness were the only sounds he heard as he walked back up to fort pillow guns had been thundering and cannon roaring since first light the silence now felt almost eerie major bradford waited just inside the gun port from which the truce party had set out what do they want he called about what youd expect sir mack leaming held out the paper captain goodman had handed him here is forrests demand bradford rapidly read through it when he finished he asked the same question leaming had what about the colored troops sir they are to be included among the prisoners of war leaming answered i raised the point with captain goodman who delivered the note to me he said both general chalmers whom he serves and general forrest agreed they will accept the negroes surrender i am not going to decide this all at once bradford said have you got paper and a pencil lieutenant yes sir leaming took the writing tools from his pocket all right then take this down major bradford hesitated for a moment perhaps communing with his muse to general forrest commanding cs forces he said mack leaming wrote it down bradford went on siri respectfully ask one hour for consultation with my officers and the officers of the gunboat in the meantime no preparation to be made on either side he hesitated again then asked do the confederates know major booth is dead no sir leaming said as you see their demand is addressed to him i didnt tell them hed been hit and neither did anyone else in the party likely just as well theyll think better of booth than they will of me he was a real soldier and im just a lawyer and a tennessee tory to boot bradford said lieutenant leaming found himself nodding those were the main reasons he hadnt informed the confederates of booths death bill bradford went on as long as they dont know lets keep them in the dark sign it very respectfully lf booth major commanding yes sir leaming did as he was asked good good nowdo you have an envelope bradford seemed endlessly worried about tiny procedural details yes sir as a matter of fact i do leaming took one from the left breast pocket of his tunic he put bradfords response into it good good seal it up seal it up tight major bradford said and with a little luck bedford forrestll give us the hour and well have reinforcements in place by the time its up and then we really will be able to tell him to go to the devil i hope so sir leaming said along with the other members of the truce party he went out of fort pillow toward the waiting captain goodman once more major william bradfords dream of reinforcements was major general nathan bedford forrests nightmare not long after his ultimatum to the men inside fort pillow went forward that nightmare looked like it was coming true a trooper from down by the mississippi came up to forrest calling general general forrest sir theres smoke on the river sir looks like a steamboats coming up bedford forrest swore horribly that was the last thing he wanted to hear god damn it to hell and gone he shouted and then hoping against hope are you sure sure as i am that im hank tibbs the cavalryman answered come see for yourself if you dont believe me i think id better forrest said grimly and rode down toward the broad river he didnt get there as fast as he would have liked the steeply sloping ground and the number of felled tree trunks made his horse pick its way along he needed almost fifteen minutes to come to the eastern bank of the mississippi and peer downstream toward memphis hank tibbs didnt have to worry that anyone would fear he wasnt entitled to his own name bedford forrest did some more profane swearing when he spied the steamer coming up from the south as hed feared they would be its decks were blue with the uniforms of us soldiers just to make things worse a glance north along the mississippi showed more smoke as if another steamboat was on the way with aid and comfort for the federals in fort pillow how was he supposed to take the place if they could pour men into it from the river forrest looked from fort pillow out to the gunboat already floating on the mississippi the enemy warship was honoring the truce it hadnt fired a shot since learning the white flag had gone in but neither the gunboat nor the men in the fort were making any effort to stop the steamer crammed with troops from approaching in their place forrest probably wouldnt have either that didnt make him love them any better captain anderson he shouted yes sir his aidedecamp wasnt far away get as many men down by the riverbank as you can forrest said pull some of them down from those buildings we took and use the little force you already gathered together he pointed down the river toward the oncoming steamboat let those sons of bitches see theyll have a nasty time of it if they try to let their soldiers off ill tend to it sir anderson saluted and hurried away a moment later forrest shouted for a runner when the soldier came up to him he said get your fanny over to colonel barteau in coal creek ravine tell him to bring his men out in the open and to take them down by the bank of coal creek i want to make sure the yankees in that there steamerhe pointed to the vesselcant swing in and land by the creek any more than they can here along the river have you got that yes sir the runner said when forrest raised an eyebrow the man gave back the instructions with tolerable accuracy forrest nodded the runner trotted off toward the far side of the battlefield men in gray and butternut rushed to make themselves visible on the low ground by the base of the bluff some of them came up along the riverbank others down from the buildings theyd gained when the federals failed to burn them all watching forrest nodded again this time to himself an officer would have to be crazy to try to land in the face of opposition like that general general you there general forrests head came up like that of a hound taking a scenthe knew waiter goodmans voice when he heard it im here goodman he called pitching his voice to carry he could always make himself heard even on the maddest noisiest field with the guns fallen silent yankees out on that steamboat might have heard him what do the federals in the fort say here is their answer sir captain goodman held out a sealed envelope what a pack of foolishness you could have seen it forrest said scornfully he opened the envelope and took out the note inside once hed read it he shook his head the son of a bitch in there is playing for time and to hell with me if i aim to let him have any can you write down my answer to take back to the us truce party yes sir goodman produced pencil and paper forrest had thought he would be able to he served general chalmers much as captain anderson served forrest himself go ahead sir to major lf booth commanding us forces fort pillow forrest paused for a moment then went on siri have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your note asking for one hour to consider my demand for your surrender your request cannot be granted i will allow you twenty minutes from the receipt of this note for consideration if at the expiration of that time the fort is not surrendered i shall assault it i do not demand the surrender of the gunboat very respectfully nb forrest majorgeneral that should do the job sir goodman said let me read it back to you he did forrest nodded ill deliver it then goodman told him and rode up toward the spot where the truce parties from the two sides were meeting up on the fortified bluff colored and white soldiers mocked the men emerging from cover to thwart the troopladen steamship the men in blue didnt fire on forrests troopers but did their best to provoke them in every other way they could we wont give you no quarter if you comes at us a drunken negro bawled after we git you we git your sisters too another negro shouted forrest could imagine nothing better calculated to inflame his men the colored soldier probably wasnt joking either white troopers from fort pillow had ranged through western tennessee theyd insulted more than a few women dear to forrests soldiers and outraged more than one why wouldnt a black man want to imitate them a corporal not far from forrest growled those sons of bitchesll laugh out of the other side of their faces when we get in amongst em a couple of soldiers shook their fists at the us soldiers inside fort pillow but no one raised a rifle musket to his shoulder and tried to avenge himself upon them unlike the federals his men showed good disciplineor maybe they were more worried about what he would do to them for going against orders than they were angry at the enemy captain goodman rode back to him sooner than hed expected whats going on forrest called to him has booth given you an answer already no sirsorry goodman answered but some of the federals in the truce party are saying maybe you arent really here at all theyre saying its a bluff like the one colonel duckworth used in union city oh they are are they forrest said will it make em happy if i advance and be recognized goodmans lips quirked upward into something that looked like a smile but was knowing and unamused well sir i dont reckon itll make em very happy if you know what i mean but itll sure enough take their doubts away then ill do it forrest said at once lead on captain i think things here are tolerable goodthe yankees wont be able to land and it looks like they know it he followed the junior officer forward past the barracks buildings and up onto the higher ground that led to the inner position the united states had fortified the us flag still floated defiantly above fort pillow forrest felt a peculiar prickling of the skin above his breastbone if a federal sharpshooter wanted him dead badly enough to violate the truce he was within range for a decent shot but us soldiers had tried to kill him since the war was new his own horse had come closer to doing it a few hours earlier than most of them had captain goodman pointed there they are sir i see em forrest said the big dark one is captain youngtheir provost marshal goodman said the other officers lieutenant van horn i dont see lieutenant leaminghes the post adjutant he must still be inside the fort talking things over with major booth these fellows here can testify for me forrest spurred past goodman and rode up to the federals i am general forrest he said will any of you know me by sight i do sir the dark officer sketched a salute captain john young twentyfourth missouri cavalry not the way id care to meet you but he shrugged you do know i am who i say i am forrest persisted yes sir young did not seem afraid he probably was forrest would have been in his shoes but he didnt show it most of the time that was what mattered on the field forrest nodded with reluctant respect captain goodman pointed west toward the mississippi where the steamer moving up from the south had come level with fort pillow her name was painted on her side in huge letters olive branch bedford forrest chuckled under his breath look how many men shes got aboard her sir goodman said they can give us a lot of trouble if she lands dont worry captain forrest said quietly she wont land vii twenty minutes major bradford stared in dismay at the note mack leaming had just handed him he saw absently that it was in a hand different from the last one hed received twenty minutes he said again in even more pained disbelief if at the expiration of that time the fort is not surrendered i shall assault it my god what answer shall i take back to the confederates sir lieutenant leaming asked he doesnt even care about the new era bradford said that had nothing to do with his adjutants question but he didnt care hed countedhe still did counton the gunboat in the mississippi to help his men hold their positions against the confederates to bedford forrest the gunboat didnt matter at all or forrest said it didnt matter at all that wasnt necessarily the same thing the confederate cavalry commander was as sneaky a man as god had ever set on the face of the earth he might be running a bluff trying to trick the garrison at fort pillow into quitting when they didnt have to but bradford was running something of a bluff of his own he was playing for time hoping to hold the fort till reinforcements came and there they werehe could see the olive branch out there in the river almost close enough to reach out and touch almost but not quite the steamer couldnt approach the bank the blueuniformed men she carried couldnt land the confederate soldiers moving out to the edge of the mississippi made sure of that mack leaming stared bitterly at the troopers in gray and butternut theyve got no business being there he said its as though theyre taking advantage of the truce should we protest to general forrest but bill bradford knew that would be hopeless as soon as the words passed his lips the olive branch was not a participant in the truce if she were she wouldnt have been poised to land her troops if opportunity offered and the confederates had already seized control of the low ground by the mississippiand the ravine in front of the fort on the coal creek side too besides forrest would just say the federals could start fighting again if they didnt like what he was up to he wouldnt listen to us leaming said which only confirmed bradfords fears his adjutant went on sir the clock is ticking youve got to tell the damn rebs something i cant surrender the fort bradfords voice went high and shrill even though leaming hadnt come out and suggested that it was on the majors mind he didnt see how it could help being on his mind if he didnt think the garrison could hold the place didnt he have a duty to the menand especially to the colored soldiers whod fought better than hed dreamt they couldto yield it and avoid the horrors of a sack but he still held hope even if the confederates forced their way inside the earthworks warding fort pillow his men could still drop down to the base of the bluff and keep up the fight there they had plenty of cartridges waiting for them now and the new era could sweep the enemy with canister the gunboat wouldnt be firing blind there her men would be able to see exactly what they were aiming at we can hold bradford said as if challenging his adjutant to disagree with him lieutenant leaming didntnot directly anyhow if we can sir youd better tell bedford forrest that we aim to try and youd better do it soon or hell just up and break off the truce on his own no sooner had the words crossed his lips than a couple of shots rang out in the distance whats that major bradfords voice rose in alarm again sir the rebs just fired warning shots at the steamer answered a soldier by the edge of the bluff who could see down to the mississippi a moment later he added shes sheering off looks like shes going to head on up the river damn bradford said feelingly forrests men could slaughter the soldiers on her if she tried to land them leaming said i got a look at her when i was parleying with the rebs the way the men are packed on her deck they cant answer back or not hardly damn bradford said again he knew his adjutant was right hed looked at the olive branch himself but what a maneven a lawyerknows to be true and what he wishes were true can often be two very different things if the steamboat hadnt appeared at all that would have been bad to have her appear in what seemed the nick of time hold out the hope of rescue and then cruelly yank it away that was ten times a hundred times worse a melodrama with such a scene in it would have been hissed off the stage and lieutenant leaming wouldnt leave him alone sir the reply to general forrest whatever you say youd better say it fast the time he gave us has to be almost up bradford didnt like the sound of that the only ploy he had left was buying a little more time give me a paper and pencil then he told leaming yes sir leaming handed them to him the paper was dirty there was no envelope major bradford had to make do without them your demand does not produce the desired effect he scribbled and handed the scrap back to leaming there his adjutant read it frowning because it was none too legible and maybe for other reasons as well what does it mean sir exactly what it says bradford snapped now take it out to bedford forrest for a wonder leaming realized hed finally pushed too far with a salute he said the one thing an adjutant could say that was never wrong yes sir jack jenkins stood by the bank of coal creek watching the olive branch steam up the mississippi he breathed a silent sigh of relief if the yankees tried landing troops nearby repelling them would have been rugged work but they didnt have the nerve he had no idea where the bluebellies on that steamer were going they could go wherever it was or straight to hell and welcome as long as they didnt stop here everything was fine look at those eggsucking yellow dogs show us their backs somebody not far away said they havent got the balls to try and stand up against us damn good thing too somebody else said aint we got enough trouble with the sons of bitches in that there fort already well done men colonel barteau said in the watery afternoon sunlight the three stars on either side of his collar glittered our show of force has successfully deterred the enemy damn straight jenkins said we made sure he didnt land here too clark barteau smiled jenkins assumed that was because hed agreed with the regimental commander now some of you better hustle back up toward the fort barteau said if the federals dont give in bedford forrestll order the assault sure as im standing here beside you some of us sir not all of us jenkins asked no not all of us corporal colonel barteau answered ill want some men to stay down here by the water if we start overrunning the enemy position up on the bluff what do you reckon the enemy therell do what would you do in a fix like that try and get down by the river i expect jenkins saw nothing out of the ordinary in a corporal and a colonel discussing tactics by european standards both the us army and the cs army were loosejointed creatures the confederates had less in the way of spit and polish than the federals did and forrests troopers less than most cs outfits they fought better than most though which was all that really mattered jenkins added that damn gunboat isnt going away worse luck he pointed to a crater in the dirt by coal creek that marked where a shell from the new era had burst wish it would barteau agreed but if it doesnt i reckon well make it sorry and i think youre right i think that whole swarm of niggers and tennessee toriesll come pelting down to the mississippi once we get inside their works and when they do i see sir jenkins wasnt a man to admire officers just because they were officers when they showed they were on the ball that was a different story you thought that through real pretty glad you approve barteau said dryly if you do see what i mean perhaps youll want to stay here quite a few troopers were already moving away from coal creek along the ravine to get in position to swarm up the bluff against fort pillow reckon i will itll be just like coonhunting back home jenkins laughed at his joke even if hed made it by accident be just like coonhunting back home colonel barteau rewarded him with a thin smile all right jenkins maybe youll have some coons to hunt youd best remember one thing though whats that sir these coons can fight back sir any coonll fight back bastards are all teeth and claws and mean a coon dogs a lot biggern any coon ever born but sometimes theyll come out of a hunt lookin like they been through a meat grinder havent you seen that yourself more times than i wish i had ive lost some good dogs that way who hasntand ive had to doctor plenty more but i wouldve had a lot more to worry about if the ordinary kind of coon carried rifle muskets like the ones in there barteau pointed up toward fort pillow ill leave doctoring bullet wounds to a real sawbones jenkins shivered sawbones was a name that held too much truth too often amputation gave the only hope of saving a wounded mans life he clutched his own rifle musket it is better to give than to receive he thought ben robinson stared out toward the confederate officers gathered under the flag of truce the rest of the colored soldiers in the gun crew were doing the same thing some of the negroes inside fort pillow went on jeering at the ragged skinny white men in butternut outside others grew more serious as the gravity of the situation sank in pointing to one officer in particular robinson asked you reckon that there fellas really and truly forrest sandy cole nodded gloomily reckon he is he said aint no use to say forrest aint here i knows him too well fo that any place where theres big trouble bedford forrest he gonna be there you seen the man yourself you know his face robinson asked i seen him all right cole answered aint i a tennessee nigger any tennessee nigger ever been sold chances are he been sold through bedford forrests slave lots in memphis yeah i seen him howd he treat you when you was there having been sold himself robinson had a morbid curiosity about such things no part of slavery was good not from the slaves point of view but being in a dealers hands being between masters was worse than most of the rest a dealer didnt need to worry about you for the long haul he just wanted to turn you into cash as fast as he could but sandy cole said coulda been worse he give us enough to eatnot fancy but enough we had mattressesdidnt got to sleep on the ground he let us washnow and again anyways werent too crowded yeah coulda been worse sounds like it robinson agreed hed known slave pens where none of what sandy said held true but it gibed with other things hed heard about the cs general forrest wasnt cruel for the sake of being cruel the way some dealers were he was in the business for money not for sport and hed made a pile of it even so the colored sergeant said shame we gots to keep the truce what you mean cole asked robinson pointed out toward forrest there he is damn him that man deal in slaves he deal in niggers you done said so your ownself powerful good general toolikely the bes general the rebs got in this part the country an there he is dont got to be no great shot to put a minnie through the goddamned son of a bitch cant hardly miss not at this range he mimed sighting a springfield at the big man on horseback mimed pulling the trigger mimed bedford forrest falling over dead sandy cole laughed but he sounded a little scandalized or maybe more than a little cant do that sergeant not with the white flags up i know robinson sighed but dats how come its a shame we gots to keep it he might as well not have spoken cole went on sides spose we shoots the general an spose the secesh gets inside the fort then what you reckon they do to us after that you tell me they dont shoot everyone of us less mebbe they hangs some or burns some i aint brave enough to shoot no bedford forrest with the truce flags flyin he had a point ben robinson wished he didnt have to admit even to himself how strong a point it was but he said do jesus sandy what you reckon the rebs do to us if they gets in even if we dont shoot forrest we aint sojers to them wes jus niggers onliest difference tween us an the pigs is they dont smoke us fo bacon no sub sandy cole shook his head no suh theres another differencedamn big difference too he patted the barrel of the gun they served after more than half an hour of quiet it was cool enough not to burn his palm difference is now we kin shoot back uhhuh sergeant robinson had thought that was a wonderful thing when he first put on the blue uniform he still did but it had a drawback he hadnt seen then what if we shoots back an they licks us anyways by the way coles face puckered he might have bitten down on a green persimmon cant let them bastards lick us cant do it sergeant they licks us its like they really is bettern we is like they say long as i kin serve this gun aint no white man bettern me robinson said mebbe they kin kill me do jesus i knows they kin kill me like i say they kin lick us they gots mo men out theren we gots in here but if they kill me they gots to kill a man whos fightin back they aint gonna kill no nigger no darkie no coon you hear what im tellin you sandy i hears you sergeant you believe me i im tryin to sergeant sandy cole said which struck robinson as honest enough the other colored artilleryman eyed him you believe your ownself course i do the automatic reply sprang to ben robinsons lips but cole had given him the truthor he thought so anyway he felt obligated to pay back the same coin is tryin to too a federal lieutenant approached the confederate truce party on foot quietly captain goodman said thats their post adjutant sir his name is leaming mack leaming hes been carrying messages back and forth i thank you nathan bedford forrest said also quietly then he raised his voice so it would carry well lieutenant leaming what does major booth say he used up all the time i gave him by god and it didnt do him one damn bit of good either forrest thought booth must have been banking on the olive branch too bad for himthat bank had gone bust the steamboat full of soldiers was leaving fort pillow behind the plumes of smoke on the mississippi to the north were closer now forrest didnt worry about those ships if this skipper didnt dare to try forcing a landing theirs wouldnt either mack leaming started when forrest called to him forrest wondered what he was so nervous about had major booth made up his mind to fight forrest wouldnt have not in the union mans position but if he had he had here is my commandants reply sir leaming held out a grimy scrap of paper forrest unfolded it he scowled at the scrawl he had to try to read it might have been worse than his own hand something he had trouble believing your demand does not produce the desired effect he said slowly even after hed read it it left him unhappy or worse than unhappy this will not do he told leaming send it back and say to major booth that i must have an answer in plain unmistakable english will he fight or will he surrender yes or no lieutenant leaming turned red he gave back a salute of drillfield precision a salute so grand it was almost an insult i shall do just as you say sir he replied and did an aboutface every bit as fancy he strode off toward fort pillow fussy fellow isnt he forrest thought he almost laughed at leamings retreating back to see if it could get any stiffer than it was already he had his doubts turning to captain goodman he said people go on and on about how im an ignorant uneducated son of a bitch but by god captain i know how to say what i mean yes sir you sure do goodman said with a small smile captain young and lieutenant van horn both stirred but neither us officer said anything after a moment goodman went on sir youve done all you need to do right up hereall you need to and more might be a good thing if you moved farther away from the fort ah forrest needed only a heartbeat to understand why reckon so i do sir goodman pointed up toward the earthwork the niggers yonder who re skylarking well theyre a bunch of damn fools but theyre only a bunch of damn fools if you know what i mean but the ones looking our way and the ones pointing our way one of thems liable to pick up a springfield and point with that instead of his finger i know theyre nothing but niggers but they dont need to be sharpshooters to hit at this range again forrest didnt need long to think about it he fought ferociously and exposed himself to all sorts of dangers but that was when his blood was up it wasnt up now he could see the good sense in what captain goodman said all right ill do that he said bring me the federals answer as soon as they deliver it he touched the brim of his hat to young and van kirk gentlemen general both officers said politely john young salutednot to show him up as leaming had but to acknowledge respect even for an enemy you think major booth will give up the fort sir captain goodman asked as forrest turned his horse toward the south i am satisfied in my mind that he will forrest answered in the spot hes in what else can he do he rode back to the position hed taken before the federals demanded proof he was on the field among the soldiers and officers gathered there was his bugler a german named jacob gaus he brandished the bugle the way an ordinary trooper would have brandished a revolver it was perhaps the most battered musical instrument in the war along with the dents caused by hard travel were two that came from mini balls shall i blow the charge sir gaus asked not yet forrest answered i still have hopes that they will see sense and surrender and if they dont if they dont jacob if they dont theyll wish they had for as long as they liveand most of em wont live long mack leaming was shaking in his boots by the time he got back inside fort pillow he had no doubt that hed spoken with nathan bedford forrest he would have believed it even if captain young told him the confederate was an impostor one look into the big rebs eyes told him everything he needed to know only a killer had eyes like those hard and cold always probing for weakness and always finding it too major bradford came up to him well bradford asked what does he say he says he wants your answer in plain english sir leaming took a certain small pleasure in relaying bedford forrests literary criticism he would have enjoyed it more were he less alarmed will you surrender yes or no i cant just come out and say that bradford exclaimed sir i think youd better lieutenant leaming replied they will assault this place as soon as forrest gives the order so that really is the famous bedford forrest is it bradford tried to keep his tone light but made heavy going of it i saw young nod but i can hardly believe it that is nathan bedford forrest leaming spoke with absolute conviction what are we going to do sir i wont decide by myself major bradford said this is a decision all the officers in the fort need to make the ones the rebs havent shot leaming thought if only they hadnt shot major booth bradford no doubt meant well but he was far out of his depth here his adjutant knew too well he couldnt do anything about that major bradford was what they had what the fight left them leaming said if youre going to hold a council sir for heavens sake do it fast they are about out of patience with us there on the other side of the breastwork bradford licked his lips leaming wouldnt have been surprised if they were dry his own were the commandant gathered up half a dozen lieutenants and captains one of whom had a bloody bandage on his hand but was still at the parapet bedford forrest demands that we surrender to him at once if were going to bradford said i am inclined to fight it out does anyone have a contrary view if you do speak up now what if they get over our wall here asked a lieutenant from the colored heavy artillery leaming couldnt call his name to mind we drop down to the bank then bradford answered and the new era will blast the rebs from here to nashville i wish to god the olive branch could have dropped off her soldiers here captain theodorick bradford said so do i leaming said the confederates moved up in the ravines to head them off as openly as if theyd captured the fort we could have given them more trouble if the truce flags werent flying forrest wouldnt have listened to us we already talked about that and the truce involves his men the fort and the new era the olive branch was not party to it technically the rebs were within their rights to refuse her the opportunity to put men ashore major bradford said he was a lawyer there were times when his passion for nitpicking punctilio drove mack leaming wild this was one of them and worse than most sir to hell with the rebels rights leaming exclaimed were talking about our necks here weve held forrest off for this long bradford said if his men try another push against the fort and fail i cant imagine how they would be able to nerve themselves for one more after that i ask againdoes anybody feel we should yield no one said a word all right bill bradford was brisk he nodded to leaming you say bedford forrest wants a clear answer do you yes sir leaming answered i shall give him one then let me have paper and pencil someone when bradford had them he wrote rapidly and handed the pa per to leaming generall will not surrender very respectfully your obedient servant lf booth major commanding leaming read there bill bradford said i hope that will be clear enough for general forrest even without his spectacles as john hancock said when he signed the declaration of independence he laughed at his own wit major leaming laughed too more from a sense of duty than for any other reason ill take it out to him sir he said unlike george iii forrest had nothing wrong with his eyes oh no when leaming reached the flags of truce he found the confederate general no longer waited by them he handed bradfords note to captain goodman here you are sir he said may i ask how your commander replies sir goodman remained polite we will not surrender leaming answered captain goodmans eyebrows leaped wont you reconsider we can take that place and it will be terrible if we do our men have good reason not to love nigger soldiers and galvanized yankees i speak from a concern for the unnecessary effusion of blood and that effusion will be very great when fort pillow falls major brbooth is of the opinion that it will not fall leaming corrected himself fast enough to keep the confederate from noticing his near slip well lieutenant all i can tell you is that when a yankee commander believes one thing and general forrest believes another general forrest commonly proves right goodman said your superior will not change his mind he is determined leaming replied captain goodman sighed on his head be it very well sir i shall take his answer to general forrest and after that after that we shall see what we shall see good afternoon gentlemen a pleasure making your acquaintance he saluted so did captain henderson and lieutenant rodgers leaming returned the courtesy along with captain young and lieutenant van horn then they and the common soldiers with them turned around and started back toward fort pillow can we really hold this place young asked quietly the confederates confidence doesnt strike me as their usual bluff and bluster major bradford thinks we can between the parapet and the new era he believes we have enough to beat back the confederates leaming paused a moment leaving it there didnt seem just to the commandant he held an officers council before sending me out with his reply no one opposed continuing resistance all right by the frown that further darkened youngs face it wasnt even close to all right but he couldnt do anything about it were going to have a hot time of it a devil of a hot time but with gods help well come through he didnt say anything about the gunboats help the new era was right down there on the mississippi leaming hoped god was close by too bedford forrest watched captain goodman ride back toward him when the junior officer got within hailing distance forrest called well captain what will it be goodman held up a scrap of paper youd better see for yourself sir that doesnt sound good charles anderson said at forrests side no it doesnt forrest nodded if the federals in there think they can hold us out theyve even bigger fools than i credit them for as goodman came up forrest held out his hand give me the note yes sir goodman passed it to him generali will not surrender forrest read it aloud he slowly nodded a couple of times major booth obliged him on one point he could not doubt the other mans meaning well we gave them a chance if theyre such blockheads that they wont take it its their hard luck not ours even to himself he sounded like a judge passing sentence its their funeral is what it is waiter goodman said i tried to tell that to leaming but he didnt want to hear it reckon hes got his orders and thats that he shrugged thatll be that all right i thought they would give up i really did forrest said everybody knows we dont mistreat people who surrender to us the way our men feel about those damned federal tennesseans and about niggers with guns in their hands well boothll find out hes made a worse bargain than the one i tried to give him captain anderson pointed out toward the mississippi what about the gunboat sir if the enemy goes down by the river its in good position to rake our boys hard weve handled gunboats before i expect well deal with this one the same way bedford forrest answered she has to open her gunports to use her cannon if weve got men blazing away at em every time they do open up shell lose gunners too quick to stay in the fight for long shoot everything blue betwixt wind and water until their flag comes down all right sir ill tend to it anderson said colonel barteau ought to have the same order in case the gunboat shifts so her guns bear on his men well captain i cant very well tell you youre wrong on account of youre right forrest called for a runner he gave the man oral orders to deliver to barteau over by coal creek when the runner had them straight he saluted and loped away what would the us soldiers be doing up inside fort pillow pontius pilate might have shrugged the shrug forrest shrugged then he washed his hands of the federals he didnt see what they could do to hold him out except what they were already doingand that wouldnt be enough general chalmers forrest said chalmers was talking with captain goodman a few feet away he broke off and nodded to his superior yes sir what do you need your men ready oh yes sir no doubt about it chalmers said when gaus blows his bugle theyll go forward as if it were gabriels trumpet jacob gaus looked at the beatup instrument he held in his right hand god can afford to issue gabriel something better than this he said which set all the officers around him laughing the bugler added or if he cant then i am afraid satan is ahead in the race bedford forrest was a steadfast believer that didnt stop him from laughing his head off now the words and gauss guttural accent were too funny to resist aiming a forefinger at the german he said you are a blasphemous toad jacob ja gaus agreed placidly but i am your blasphemous toad general that you arewho else would have you forrest needed a moment to bring his mind back to the business at hand but when he did he pointed toward the high ground the confederates had won early in the fight you still have plenty of sharpshooters on those little knolls general oh yes sir chalmers said i wouldnt move men off em not when theyre up higher than the federals position they can shoot right into the fort and the troops inside cant do a thing to stop em i know thats why i want em there thats why only a damn fool would reckon he could hang on to fort pillow unless he had a big enough garrison for the outer line now forrest pointed ahead to the ditch in front of the earthwork the us soldiers still held and thats why only a damn fool would reckon a noaccount trench like that one would keep our boys out of his works too easier fighting a damn fool than someone who knows what hes doing chalmers observed thats a fact forrest said all the same even a galvanized yankee ought to have eyes to see this by god chalmers even a nigger ought to have eyes to see this your sharpshooters over yonder can fire at that stretch of the federal works so theyre shooting along the yankees firing line instead of straight at it and the sharpshooters over there can do the same to the other stretch the technical term is enfilading fire sir chalmers said was he slyly poking fun at forrest or really trying to teach him something chalmers was not a west point man but hed been to college he was a lawyer in mississippi when secession came and helped lead his state out of the union he doubtless looked down his nose at an unschooled niggertrader like forresthe might but hed better not show it not when that un schooled niggertrader outranked him i dont care much about the technical term jim forrest said i know what i want to do and i can get it done just fine without fancy talk he snorted thinking of the evasive answer the federals in fort pillow tried to palm off on him well they wouldnt get away with it by god weve all seen that sir chalmers said there wasntthere couldnt possibly beany mockery in those words education or no fancy talk or no bedford forrest knew without false modesty that hed done more for the confederate cause in the west than just about anybody else when the war was young he saved a large part of the confederate garrison in fort donelson when his superiors after breaking out idiotically marched back in and had to surrender to the yankees he fought hard at pittsburg landing and took a wound that almost killed him that bullet still lay somewhere near his spine and still pained him his first set of cavalry raids up into tennessee and kentucky at the end of did such a good job of wrecking u s grants supply line that they delayed his attack on vicksburg by months he fought at chickamauga and still wished braxton bragg would have listened to him and pushed the pursuit that federal army would be extinct now the confederates would hold chattanooga instead forrests hands tightened on the reins if only they were tightening on braxton braggs scrawny neck bragg couldnt win and when in spite of himself he did win at chickamauga he frittered away the victory but he was jefferson daviss particular friend and so his malign influence in the csa seemed to go on forever i should have killed him forrest thought i should have challenged him not even a spineless wretch like that could have wriggled off the hook he shook his head too late now too late for a lot of things in the west general chalmers said something lost in his own dark thoughts forrest heard his voice without noting the words im sorry general he said shaking his head again that went right on by me i said will you go forward with the men when they storm the fort oh the question spawned more dark thoughts slowly forrest answered matter of fact i wasnt planning to i see by chalmerss tone and by his raised eyebrow he didnt were chalmers speaking of some other man the twoword response might have been an accusation of cowardice not with bedford forrest some gushing southern newspaper wrote that hed killed more men in close combat than any general since medieval days he had no idea if that was so but he was large and strong and fast and he usually went straight for the hottest action cautiously chalmers said do you mind my asking why sir yes dammit forrests voice was rough even harsh he disliked being put on the spot very well sir by chalmerss tone he didnt like it but he knew he couldnt do anything about it forrest was just as well pleased to keep his mouth shut if he said he had no stomach for what lay ahead chalmers would think him soft if he said he was afraid he couldnt stop it chalmers would think him weak if he said nothing at all chalmers could think whatever he damn well pleased he turned to jacob gaus you ready there oh yes sir the bugler answered anything that wants doing before we sound the assault forrest asked the officers nearby neither chalmers nor captain anderson nor captain goodman nor any of the others said a word well thenforrest tipped his hat to gausgo ahead jacob ja gaus raised the battered bugle to his lips the fierce horn call belled across the battlefield viii major william bradford watched lieutenant leaming and the rest of the truce party walk back from their parley with the confederates his brother came up beside him wont be long now no i dont reckon it will theo bradford said the confederates in the truce party rode off toward the knoll to which bedford forrest had repaired not long before they no longer held up the white flags theyd used to call for the parley can we hold em out theodorick bradford asked quietly if you didnt think we could you should have spoken up at the officers council bill bradford said angrily his older brother flushed nobody else did damned if i wanted you to reckon i was a quitter i reckoned you were somebody who would tell me what was on his mind maybe i was wrong the garrison commander said captain theodorick bradford turned away excuse me sir he said lacing the polite title with disdain he stormed off without waiting to find out whether his brother excused him or not bill bradford swore under his breath what could he do about making up with theo nothing not right now about a quarter of a mile away the confederates from the truce party were talking with the other rebs one of the men on that low rise pointed toward fort pillow and then out to a couple of places secesh soldiers had overrun bradford wished he could hear what the enemy soldiers were saying in war as in cards one peek at the other fellows hand was worth all the calculating in the world a confederate soldier raised a bugle the afternoon sun gleamed off the polished brass as if off gold for a moment time seemed to stand still poised between one thing and another then faint in the distance but very clear the horn call reached bill bradford and the embattled fort and it reached the cs cavalry troopers all around fort pillow the truce shattered like a crystal goblet dropped on a hardwood floor a shattered goblet spilled wine a shattered truce spilled claret of another sort a great roar of musketry arose inside the fort and around it yelling like fiends like devils like men possessed the confederates swarmed out of the positions theyd gained earlier in the day and rushed for the bluff shoot em major bradford screamed shoot em down like the cur dogs they are all six of the cannon inside the fort bellowed at the same time sending canister forth against forrests fighters cursing gun crews wrestled the pieces back into position and reloaded as fast as they could not all their curses were aimed at the enemy shit high high goddammit cant we lower them fuckin muzzles any more bradford heard that again and again the very way fort pillow was made seemed to conspire against the defenders but the foulmouthed colored artillerymen and their equally blasphemous white superiors werent the only ones battling desperately to keep the confederates away from the fort whites from the thirteenth tennessee cavalry and negroes from the newly arrived artillery regiments stood side by side behind the earthen parapet blazing away at the charging yowling enemy and then ramming fresh minnies into the muzzles of their springfields race for the moment was forgotten quick firing counted for more bradford ran now here now there rushing men from spots that werent so badly threatened to those in mortal peril before long he hardly knew where to send soldiers and where to hold them back the whole earthwork seemed in mortal peril and while danger might have made the defenders forget about race the attackers remembered all too well along with the usual rebel yells and random shouts and oaths forrests men raised another cry black flag black flag ice ran through bill bradford when he first made out those words through the din of musketry and cannon fire and other yells and screams in bedford forrests note demanding surrender hed warned that he couldnt answer for consequences if the federals in fort pillow refused hed warned and he hadnt been joking even if bradford believed he was black flag was the cry for no quarter hold them out men bradford yelled for your lives hold them out he drew his army colt and shot at the confederatestoo many of them were within pistol range the revolvers cylinder spun he fired again he wished his men had even a handful of newfangled sharps or henry repeating rifles they fired so fast they could easily break a charge like this you simply couldnt reload springfields quick enough some of forrests troopers fell on the steep slope leading up to the bluff wounded enemy soldiers dragged themselves away from the intense gunfire the dead lay where they fell ravens meat bradford thoughta bit of perhaps poetry hed heard somewhere in this part of the country turkey buzzards and black buzzards accounted for more unburied corpses than ravens the confederates swarming up the slope clutched their rifle muskets and shotguns and pistols in their fists hardly any of them fired but not all of forrests men were rushing fort pillow sharpshooters on the knolls a quarter of a mile outside the parapet took a deadly toll on the defenders a bullet cracked past major bradfords face so close that it made him jerk back in surprise and alarm it smacked into the side of the head of a trooper from the thirteenth tennessee cavalry that sound was too much like the one you made when you chunked a rock at a rotten watermelon the trooper let out a small startled sighnot even a groanand crumpled as if all his bones turned to water he died before he hit the ground a colored soldier got hit in the side of the neck blood sprayed everywhere the negro shrieked and dashed wildly through the fort his wound plainly wasnt mortal or didnt have to be if someone saw to it but his pain and fright were liable to kill him if the minnie didnt bradford saw more and more us soldiers hit in the flank he pointed out toward the clouds of blackpowder smoke that marked the secesh sharpshooters positions those sons of bitches are murdering us he shouted can we stop them maybe the cannon can blast them off those knolls a sergeant said but he didnt sound hopeful and bradford knew why not the guns inside fort pillow hadnt been able to shift the confederate marksmen since they gained their places what with all the fallen timber and the stumps on those low rises the rebs enjoyed cover almost as good as the earthwork gave the federals have to try bradford said but how much good would trying do matt wards mouth was dry as the egyptian desert when the bugle sounded the assault from the barracks buildings the confederates had captured fort pillow up on its bluff seemed as towering and indomitable as goliath the philistine must have to the children of israel but goliath fell brought down by davids sling bedford forrest thought fort pillow would fall too instead of a sling ward had his enfield and he had friends who would scale the bluff with him or die trying he wished he hadnt thought of it that way come on move out confederate officers and sergeants shouted all along the line from the mississippi to coal creek the better braver ones added follow me where a superior went forward the men he led couldnt very well hold back the cougar yowl of a rebel yell filled wards throat as he rushed toward the bluff and scrambled up it where rush stopped and scramble started he wasnt sure then or afterwards what seemed like all the federals in the world were shooting down at him and his comrades the muzzle flashes that burst from their rifle muskets stabbed out like dragonfire in a book of fairy tales he wanted to shoot back here and there some of forrests troopers did sergeants swore at the men who pulled trigger matt understood why and held his fire stopping to reload on this steep slope was asking to get shot but if a man didnt reload he had only his bayonet or his clubbed rifle musket with which to face the enemy once he got to the top a mini ball hit the ground a few inches in front of wards face with a wet splat bits of dirt kicked up into his face he did stop then to rub at his eyes with grimy fingers he might have done more harm than good he was still blinking frantically and shaking his head when he resumed the upward climb here and there on the muddy slope confederates tumbled down or sprawled motionless instead of going forward their screams mingled with the battle cries and the gunfire to produce a cacophonous din mercifully unknown outside of war ward tried not to hear it tried not to heed it but it made him afraid even so screams also rose from the men in blue who fired down at the onstorming confederates for a moment matt ward wondered how so many enemy soldiers were getting hurt while his own comrades held their fire then he realized the troopers posted on the knollshed been up on one of them himself for a little while before hurrying forwardwere taking a steady toll on the us soldiers at the top of the bluff he also realized something else a galvanized yankee or even a negro shrieking for his mother or simply howling out his pain to the uncaring world sounded just the same as a luckless confederate doing the same thing were he a different person that might have persuaded him of the essential brotherhood of man instead it made him want to hear the foe making those noises instead of his own comrades at the top of the bluff just outside their earthen parapet the federals had dug a ditch ten or twelve feet wide and even deeper than that they likely hadnt dreamt any attackers could come so far but like any military engineers who knew their trade they interposed a final barrier between themselves and the enemy or they thought they did some of the confederates reaching the top of the bluff tried to leap the ditch and scramble up onto the earthwork beyond matt ward didnt see anyone who succeeded that would have been a formidable jump even for a man not burdened with a rifle musket and enough cartridges to do a deal of fighting most troopers showed better sense than to try to imitate a mountain goat bounding from crag to crag instead of jumping over the ditch they dropped down into it ward was one of those the bottom of the ditch was all mud and puddles the ooze tried to suck the shoes right off his feet but he was here at the top of the bluff panting he paused a moment to catch his breath and try to figure out what to do next were the earthwork that protected the union troops thinner they could easily have shot down into the ditch and slaughtered the attackers instead they had to crawl out on top of the bank of dirt to fire into the ditch when they did they exposed all of themselves to the distant sharpshooters deadly fire now that were here that damn earthwork does as much for us as it does for the federals said a man near ward we cant get at them and they cant get at us neither but we dont need to be here ward said the wet squelching as he shifted his feet underlined the point we need to be there he pointed to the far side of the parapet long as the bluebellies hold us out they win well it dont look like them sons of bitches is gonna be able to do it much longer the other trooper said look there in the age of chivalry when knighthood was in flower besieging an enemy castle was an everyday part of war soldiers no more thought of going into battle without scaling ladders than without their pants bedford forrests troopers knew little of days gone by they had to improvise if they wanted to get out of the ditch they had toand they did it all started without orders which made it seem more marvelous to ward here and there at the bottom of the muddy ditch men went down on their hands and knees others swarmed up onto them using them as human scaling ladders to get up to where they could reach the rampart and break into fort pillow for the first little while things didnt go smoothly the wouldbe ladders didnt perform well time after time they toppled before they got very tall then a couple of sergeants who had some idea of what needed doing started yelling their heads off most of the time matt ward had no use for sergeants just because they had stripes on their sleeves they thought they were entitled to throw their weight around here though they turned out to be worth something after all with loud profane encouragement they got big men on the bottom of what turned out to be human pyramids instead of human scaling ladders they put smaller men in the next layer up and smaller men still above them they still had a couple of collapses god damn you riley you stupid clumsy son of a bitch why the hell did you have to go and wiggle then im sorry sarge stinking bug landed right on my eyelid so help me jesus what the devil was i supposed to do likely tell the sergeant said but he didnt waste any more time scorching the luckless riley so if he didnt exactly believe he didnt exactly disbelieve either it wasnt as if he didnt have plenty of other troopers to scream at the first confederate who made it up so he could rush the rampart got shot in the face the instant he showed himself he tumbled back into the ditch dead before he splatted into the mud move the closest sergeant bellowed to the men in his pyramid that yankee bastards gotta reload if you can get up there before he does more and more men went up a few of them were hit and fell in the ditch again most though gained the narrow strip of ground between the ditch and the earthwork they crouched there ducking down behind the piled dirt waiting for their orders matt ward scrambled up himself he saw colonel mcculloch no more than ten feet away waiting like everybody else be ready boys mcculloch called were almost there on the other side of the rampart the federals had mostly stopped shooting too they waited tensely for whatever happened next at my order someone shouteda confederate ward thought though accent was no help in telling the sides apart with so many tennesseans on both the cs trooper clutched his rifle musket and braced himself not that that would do any good if a minnie hit him is that general chalmers whispered the soldier next to him beats me ward whispered back now shouted the officer whoever he was mack leamings saber blade glittered in the sun hed never dreamt he might have to fight with his officers sword the saber in the scabbard was a mark of his rank nothing more and an occasional nuisance that thumped against his leg but at close quarters a slashing saber was a weapon not to be despised he wished he had a better notion of how to fight with it for the coming fight would be at quarters as close as a man could imagine in his direst nightmares are your pieces loaded a federal officer called to the colored soldiers under his command yes suh they said and sure is suh and we aint afraid of no rebs leaming wondered why they werent he was desperately afraid himself and trying hard not to show it not knowing fear seemed impossible carrying on in spite of it a mere mortal might aspire to that somewhere not nearly far enough away a wounded us soldier howled while bedford forrests troopers just outside of fort pillow mostly held their fire the sharpshooters on the rises that looked down into the federal position kept popping away at the soldiers in blue every so often a round struck home this is our big chance men major bradford shouted if we hold them out now theyre whipped bradford pointed up to the big us flag floating above the fort several minnies had punched holes through the stars and stripes but they still proudly waved that flag will never come down never do you hear me together white cavalry troopers and colored artillerymen raised a cheer bradford seemed over the worst of the jitters that afflicted him earlier in the day leaming hoped it wasnt too late he shrugged jitters or not bradford had done about as well as any man could after major booth fell his adjutant didnt see what he could have done differently if he didnt intend to surrender oh things might have gone better if they had the federals would have been able to fire all the barracks buildings not just those in the first row then forrests men would have had fewer places from which to shoot at the fort from close range and more important still the olive branch and the other steamboats might have been able to land their soldiers the confederates were out there in large numbers leaming didnt know whether booths or bradfords was a better guess but the garrison was badly outnumbered either way reinforcements would have helped the us cause if forrest hadnt sent men to the mouths of the ravines below the fort to scare off the steamships leaming still thought he shouldnt have got away with doing that under flag of truce even if it was a truce about which the soldiers aboard the olive branch knew nothing no matter what leaming thought it was over and done with now be ready boys were almost there a confederate bawled at my order another rebel shouted both voices carried an officers authority perhaps two heartbeats later the second one cried now all along the earthen rampart bedford forrests troopers popped up rifle muskets and pistols at the ready every federal soldier with a loaded weapon fired at the same time at pointblank range dead and wounded rebs spun and tumbled back into the ditch screams filled the cool air but then the confederates loosed a volley that dwarfed anything the soldiers in blue could give them far more enemy soldiers pressed against the outside of the earthwork than there were union troops to defend it not all of forrests men pulled triggersome held back so they could shoot when they needed to but even so the attackers who fired outnumbered the men inside mack leaming didnt know how many bullets cracked past him in that hellish instant he also didnt know how they all managed to miss him thank you lord ran through his head maybe he said it out loud maybe he didnt he never could sort it out afterwards he did know that far too many federals werent so lucky all along the earthwork wounded men reeled back and dead men dropped the defenders might have taken a sharp right to the chin in a fistfight if they went down now they would never rise again fight leaming shouted fight god damn you if we dont fight we all die maybe if we do fight we all die anyway some mad and hopeless fragment of his mind jeered the confederates roared and bellowed and screeched their savage battle cry leaming had heard people say it was worth a division in battle now he understood what they meantat close range the rebel yell made the hair stand up on the nape of his neck and threatened to turn his blood to water it made him want to run even if he didnt forrests men ranforward they scrambled up onto the broad rampart and dashed across it then leaped down into fort pillow some of them used the bullets theyd held back before others stabbed with bayonets or swung their rifle muskets clubfashion whites and negroes in blue uniforms met them side by side they didnt need leaming or any other officer to tell them they had to hold out that swarm of enemy soldiers if they wanted to go on breathing the colored artillerymen at the center of the us line might not have had much practice with the bayonet but that didnt keep them from using it when they had to they fought with the wild courage of men who had nothing to lose and so they werethe confederates howled no quarter and black flag at the top of their lungs no doubt the negroes would have been wiser not to mock forrests troopers during the earlier fight and especially during the truce their jeering came back to haunt them now but even at close quarters they showed discipline and courage beyond anything lieutenant leaming expected of them whites could do no betterthe whites from the thirteenth tennessee cavalry fighting alongside them were doing no better hurrah hurrah leaming ran at the confederates not away from them next to the rebel yell the union battle cry seemed flavorless in his mouth but it was what the federals had so he used it he slashed at a trooper in muddy butternut the confederate brought up his springfield or was it an enfield to block the blow sparks flew as iron blade struck iron barrel another reb lunged at leaming with his bayonet the lieutenant had to leap back in a hurry to keep from getting stuck like a hog a saber was all very well but a long bayonet at the end of a long rifle musket had the reach of a spear he slashed again this time at a trooper running by with blood already on his bayonet the man didnt even seem to see leaming till the blade bit into his arm he howled like a wolf and dropped his rifle musket as blood spurted from the wound he said you son of a bitch what the hell did you have to go and do that for instead of answered leaming cut at him again the confederate scrambled back and tripped over his own feet another soldier in butternut in fact the mans trousers were blue surely plunder from a dead federal stepped on him he howled again and cursed the man on his own side even more foully than hed sworn at leaming this way this way an officer in blue shouted doing his best to rally the negro troops he led a moment later he groaned and crumpled clutching at a bullet wound in his side with him or without him the colored artillerymen went on fighting leaming saw one of them bayonet a confederate trooper in the belly the man who fought for forrest shrieked like a damned soul as he fell a moment later a pistol shot at pointblank range blew off half the negros face with a bubbling scream of his own he went down beside the man hed speared neither of them had a prayer of living forrests troopers shot down another white us officer and then another they seemed to make a special effort to pick off the men with shoulder straps no doubt they thought the negroes would fall to pieces without white men to lead them before mack leaming saw the colored soldiers fight he would have thought the same thing now now he had to change his mind he wounded another confederate and heard another minnie snap past his head perilously close forrests men brawled ahead no matter how well the negroes fought would it do them any good at all when the assault came the halfdozen gaps cut through the rampart to let the guns of the sixth us heavy artillery colored offered bedford forrests men easy ways into fort pillowor so they thought three of them rushed straight for ben robinsons twelvepounder he fired the piece himself sergeant clark was down with a leg wound unlike some earlier rounds this one didnt go to waste canister blew the confederates to red rags one of them managed a wail the other two simply ceased to be sandy cole whooped bury them buckra in a jam tin he shouted blew em right out a their shoes sure enough several shoes still stood in the gap one of them had a foot left in it reload captain carron shouted but there was no time not all of forrests men were rash enough to charge straight into the muzzle of a gun many more great swarms of them scrambled over the earthwork and into fort pillow using the worm swabbing out shoving in another powder bag and then another round of canister the rebs would shoot or bayonet them all before they finished the job when robinson grabbed the worm then he didnt grab it to pull smoldering bits of wadding from the twelvepounders barrel instead he used it like the butt of a spear or perhaps more like a quarterstaff driving the twin iron corkscrews at the end into a secesh soldiers chest they didnt pierce the rebelbut with a startled squawk his arms flailing he fell back into the ditch from which hed climbed thats the way to do it sandy cole was laying about him with a sponge it wasnt a weapon that would kill any rebs but he had enough reach with it to keep them from bayoneting him where he stood he knocked a confederate trooper off his feet then kicked him in the face as he started to rise after that the confederate stayed down carrons pistol barkedonce twice three times in the chaos sergeant robinson had no idea whether the white officer hit anybody more and more men in butternut dashed up over the rampart and sprang down into fort pillow robinson clouted one of them in the head with the worm it made a much better weapon than the sponge the cs trooper toppled his face a mask of blood robinson snatched up the bucket of water in which the sponge rested when it wasnt swabbing out the twelvepounder he threw the water into one startled confederates face then flung the bucket at another yet another reb fired at him from perhaps six feet awayand missed the soldier swore and lunged with the bayonet ben robinson beat the blade aside with the worm black flag the confederate shouted were gonna kill us every goddamn nigger we catch you couldnt catch the clap in a whorehouse robinson retorted cautiously thrusting with the worm only thing you know about whorehouses is your mama worked in one the secesh soldier panted leastways i know who my mama is she didnt leave me out fo the hogs to eat robinson said or is you one o them hogs your ownself the confederate stared at him with eyes and mouth open as comically wide as a surprised negros were said to be ben robinson almost laughed even though forrests cavalryman might kill him yet the white never dreamt a man he wished he owned might have the nerve to talk back well tough luck for him life gave you all kinds of things you never dreamt of anybody whod been bought and sold could testify to that and the trooper stayed so surprised robinsons next lunge with the worm caught him in the pit of the stomach and folded him up like a ladys fan robinson wanted to finish him off the artillery sergeant wished he had a weapon that could finish off the reb he looked around to see if someone had dropped a rifle musket sure enough several lay on the muddy ground robinson snatched one up only to realize he would die quickly if he stayed where he was to fight with it sandy cole and charlie key were still on their feet and fighting but the rest of the gun crew was either down or fled confederates poured past them on either side here and there knots of union troops still struggled whites and blacks battling side by side color forgotten but bedford forrests men were over the rampart and inside the fort and god only knew how the federals were going to throw them out nathan bedford forrest raised a polished brass spyglass to his eye to get a closer look at the fight for fort pillow distance fell away as with everything else he paid a price the image was upside down he was used to that and it didnt faze him the fringes of unnatural red and blue around the edges of things bothered him more lousy cheap thing he muttered hed had better telescopes ones where the fringes werent nearly so bad but almost three years of constant travel left them water over the dam he shrugged this one borrowed from a confederate patriot in jackson showed enough he watched his men go down into the yankees foolish useless ditch and then only minutes later scramble out on the far side he watched his sharpshooters pick off two or three federals who leaned across the earthwork or crawled out onto it so they could shoot down at the troopers in the ditch he chuckled a little as he watched in the spyglasss inverted image the soldiers on top of the rampart looked as if they were about to fall off the edge of the world a moment later he chuckled again grimly the homemade yankees and runaway slaves inside fort pillow werent really ready to fight even if they thought they were they could have made things much nastier for his men if they were bright enough to light the fuses on some shrapnel rounds and toss them over the rampart and down into the crowded ditch the troopers trapped in there wouldnt have enjoyed that at all but neither major booth nor any of his officers had the brains to do it the federals didnt have long to think of such things and now with his own men into place right outside the rampart it was too late war didnt give you second chances even across close to a quarter of a mile the volley the confederates fired into fort pillow sounded like a thunderclap it must have hit the defenders the same way bedford forrest was sure of that even if he couldnt see into the fort that wasnt the sorry spyglasss fault several hundred rifle muskets and pistols going off at once didnt just make a thunderclap they also made the cloud from which it might have sprung his troopers vanished into that cloud as they swarmed over the rampart and into the fort more shots rang out these spaced far enough apart to be heard individually not just as part of a greater roar through the gunfire rebel yells and other cries and the screams of wounded men rang out if we get in them bluebellies is dead meat said a soldier near the general pausing for a moment as he reloaded thats about the size of it reuben forrest nodded and ill tell you something else toowere going to get in well hell yes reuben had no doubt in his mind neither did bedford forrest not really he made handwashing motions feeling like pontius pilate again well too bad he thought if the federals didnt have the brains to quit when he gave them the chance werent they asking to get crucified he nodded again they were and his troopers would give them what they asked for come on men we can do it major bradford shouted he heard other officers and sergeants in blue yelling the same thing he really believed it theyd fought so well for so long bad luck major booth stopped a bullet but even so he never would have dreamt the niggers up from memphis could fight the way they did were they as brave as white men he still didnt know if he wanted to go that farhe was a tennessee man himself after all even if he did fight for the unionbut they stood by their guns they fired over the rampart and they didnt run what more could you ask we can do it he yelled again then the confederates crouched down on the far side of the earthwork rose up like lazarus and fired a volley that smacked into his men like an uppercut from a prizefighter as soon as he saw soldiers black and white reel away from the rampart some wounded or slain others simply terrified he knew how dreadful the danger was get back to the earthwork he shouted we have to keep them out he ran forward and shoved at a trooper from the thirteenth tennessee cavalry a man he knew well get back jojo jojo wasnt inclined to listen he wasnt inclined to remember military discipline either get stuffed bill he said and pushed past his commandant he hardly seemed to know where he was going anywhere to get away from the howling yowling confederates swarming up and over the rampart bradford could have shot him in the back a man deserting his post a man disobeying his superior in combat nobody would say a word about it even if anyone from the garrison was lucky enough to be in a position to write reports about what happened here today bradford didnt fire maybe jojo would come to his senses in a little while and start fighting again a dead man wouldnt not till the day of resurrection and besides major william bradford knew too painfully well how close to cutting and running he was himself try as he would he couldnt make himself go right up to the rampart and battle it out with the confederates hand to hand he did shoot at one of them who jumped down into fort pillow and ran at him with rifle musket clutched by the barrel and swung up over his head he aimed for the rebs midsection but hit him in the left shoulder his army colt pulled up and to the right when he fired with a howl of pain the trooper reeled away he dropped the rifle musket with which he would have clubbed bradford to clutch at himself bright blood welled out between his fingers then a colored soldier hit him in the side of the head with the butt of his springfield the blow wasnt sporting but it was damned effective the confederate swayed like a tall tree almost cut through then fell at full length in the mud bradford half expected someone to yell timmmber another confederate shot the negro he too crumpled both hands flying to his belly the best he could hope for was a quick death belly wounds almost always killed if not from the force of the bullet itself then from the fever that followed punctured bowels bradford fired at the soldier in butternut even at pointblank range he missed a moment later another black man tackled the trooper they rolled on the ground punching and kicking and kneeing and biting in a spasm of hatred and fury come on keep fighting them as long as they dont get in we can whip them that voice so like his own made bradfords head whip around his brother theodorick was still very much in the fight theo had a pistol in one hand and one of his blue wigwag flags in the other he fired at a reb the man went down thats the fucker who was signaling the gunboat shouted another confederatea major nail the lousy son of a bitch half a dozen of bedford forrests troopers fired at theodorick bradford at the same time at least three bullets struck homein the chest in the belly in the leg theo bill bradford cried he shot at one of the confederates the pistol ball caught the reb just above the bridge of the nose the man went down without a word dead before he finished falling but captain theodorick bradford was also down feebly thrashing in the mud for once careless of his own safety bill bradford knelt beside his brother hurts theo choked out blood bubbled from his nose and ran from the corner of his mouth hurts bad itll be all right theo bradford said knowing too well it wouldnt his brother tried to answer but only blood poured from his mouth his eyes rolled up in his head his chest heaved once twice as he fought for air then it was still bill bradford smelled a harsh stink theos bowels had let go it was over for those few seconds no one tried to murder bradford as he bent over his brothers body that wouldnt couldnt last no matter what bradford wanted to do for theodorick he had to stay alive or hed never get the chance he scrambled to his feet and fired again the colt clicked on an empty chamber he threw it down snatched up the one theo had dropped and fought on ix matt ward hadnt thought much of the federals garrisoning fort pillow half renegade tennesseans half coonswhat kind of fight could people like that put up he figured they would throw up their hands and surrender as soon as that first terrific volley tore into them of course from what he heard bedford forrest had thought they would surrender when he sent in the flag of truce forrest proved wrong and so did ward the soldiers in blue fought with as much courage as anyone could want to see maybe that was the desperation of cornered rats whatever it was they showed no signs of yielding even if they were badly outnumbered even if that blast of gunfire killed or wounded quite a few of the men at the rampart if they wouldnt give up they had to go down a big colored man in a blue uniform swung his clubbed springfield at matt wards head ward ducked just in time the riflemusket butt knocked the slouch hat off his head but didnt knock out his brains he swore all the same he liked that hat he stabbed at the negro with his own bayonet the black man sprang away but then he swung again trying to knock the enfield out of wards hands ward wasnt an experienced bayonet fighter he didnt think any soldiers except former us army regulars were expert with the bayonet but he held on to his weapon and the black mans swipe left him hideously exposed and unable to get away only a sandbag on a practice field could make a more inviting target like anybody who grew up on a farm matt ward had slaughtered and butchered his share of livestock he knew the soft resistance flesh gave to a knife knew the feel of a blade grating off a rib and then sliding deeper but there was all the difference in the world between sticking a hog and sticking a man the negros eyes opened enormously wide do jesus he screamed then he let out a bubbling wordless shriek of pure agony he jerked away from the blade and from ward an experienced bayonet fighter would have held the lunge and gone on stabbing twisting the blade to make sure he had a killing stroke ward thought the black man would fall over dead the blood pouring from his side made that seem likely likely or not it wasnt so once free of the bayonet the negro went right on fightingnot against ward but against a nearby confederate trooper that wound had to kill him sooner or laterward drove more than a foot of steel into his chestbut it wasnt finishing him fast as ward had by the barracks below the bluff he found out how hard human beings were to kill not far from him a black soldier threw down his springfield and fell to his knees in front of a couple of bedford forrests troopers don shoot me he shouted please don shoot me i surrender aint gonna fight no mo you a runaway boy one of the confederates asked most of the negroes who fought for the usa were by the way this bluebelly talked he sure didnt come from massachusetts or new york he hesitated a split second but had to realize lying would do him no good yes suh he admitted you kin send me back to my massa i don care so hep me jesus most of the time the yankees complained because the confederates treated captured colored troops as reclaimed property not prisoners of war forrest had offered to treat the blacks in fort pillow as prisoners like any othershed offered and the us commander turned him down now the bill for such folly came due ill send you to your master all right the confederate said ill send you straight to the devil because you belong in hell he shot the black man in the head from no more than a yard away blood and brains and bits of the negros skull blew out the black toppled and lay twitching in the dirt thats telling him hank said the other cs trooper in butternut i shouldve bayoneted him in the guts let him die slow hank said shootings too good for a mad dog like that if you can kill em fast you better do it ward broke in i stuck one stuck him good and hes still on his feet the son of a bitch niggers is like rattlesnakesthey dont die till sundown hank stirred the man hed just shot with his foot well this here ones a goner bastards dead as a stump but lord only knows when ill get a chance to reload if you didnt carry a repeater or a revolver that was the rub especially in a closequarters fight like this if you fired too soon you might come to a point where you desperately needed a bullet but didnt have one if you waited too long somebody on the other side was liable to shoot you before you pulled the trigger without a minnie in his own rifle musket the question was as academic for ward as it was for hank when the federals mounted a counterattack he defended himself with bayonet and butt because they were all he had he might have been one of julius caesars legionaries except their spears were lighter and longer and less clumsy than his but some of his comrades still had loaded weapons they shot a couple of white officers after which the union charge faltered come on ward said there aint enough of em to hold us out no matter how hard they try he waded into the fight a white tennessean in a blue uniform tried to bayonet him he tried to bayonet the homemade yankee at the same time his bayonet punched into the enemy troopers thigh the federals thrust missed him the tennessean who fought for the usa yowled and sat down hard trying to hold the wound closed with his fingers ward never found out what happened to him whether he bled to death whether some other confederate killed him or whether he ended up getting taken prisoner ward also stopped worrying about what happened to the tennessee tory the instant after he bayoneted him a great cheer rose from the confederates a hardly smaller moan of dismay from the union troops the large us flag that had floated over fort pillow since dawns early light was down if that didnt mean the fort was falling nothing ever would sergeant ben robinson groaned when the stars and stripes came down that was his flag not any of the ones the confederates used not the stars and bars not the stainless banner that replaced it because from a distance it looked too much like the flag it sought to supplant and not the confederate battle flag with its blue x on red if he belonged to the united states he had a chance to be a man an american a person in his own right if he belonged to the confederate states what was he but a slave a piece of property a thing nothing nothing at all if he wasnt very lucky he feared he would be a dead man soon a glance at the sky told him the sun had hardly moved since the secesh soldiers swarmed over the rampart he wasnt joshua to hold it back in its course the handtohand fighting inside the earthwork hadnt lasted longno more than fifteen minutes twenty at the outside it only seemed to go on forever well no matter how it seemed it wouldnt last much longer the colored artillerymen and tennessee troopers inside the fort had done everything flesh and blood could do to hold out forrests men and everything flesh and blood could do wasnt enough some people were saying thousands and thousands of rebs had got into fort pillow robinson wasnt so sure about that but he was sure there were more men in butternut and gray than in blue wherever he looked what is we gonna do sergeant sandy cole shouted he and robinson and a few other company d men nate hunter and charlie key and aaron fentis formed a little knot of stubborn resistance against the oncoming confederate tide key had served the twelvepounder the other two negroes hadnt they were riflemen whod fired over the earthwork at the confederates with the gun useless and the earthwork lost they were all in the same boat yes they were all in that boat all right and it was sinking we got to fight robinson answered bending to pick up a fistsized rock and throw it at the nearest rebel we dont fight they kill us fo sure none of the other colored soldiers could argue with that cries of no quarter and black flag still rang out forrests troopers were murdering negroes who tried to lay down their arms and surrender they were also murdering men from the thirteenth tennessee cavalry who did the same thing their blood was up and they cared about nothing but slaughter watch yourself aaron charlie key yelled aaron fentis started to turn he was a squat broadshouldered man strong as an ox but not very fast he didnt have a chance of knocking away the confederate bayonet pointed straight at his midriff ben robinson did he had a rifle musket of his own now and swung it at the rebs piece the blow caught the weapon squarely and knocked it out of the enemy soldiers hands forrests trooper let out a startled yelp aaron fentis hit the reb in the head with the butt of his springfield at the same time as robinson slammed his riflemusket butt into the pit of the mans stomach down went the confederate somebody stepped on him shoving his face into the mud he wouldnt get up soon if he got up at all we can lick em sandy cole shouted the small band of negroes had licked all the rebs who came at them if the other men who garrisoned fort pillow could have done the same the secesh soldiers would be running away with their tails between their legs and if pigs had wings too many rebs that was what it came down to now that they were in the fort the men in blue couldnt drive them out robinson knew one reason his little band of soldiers hadnt been badly tested was that they looked and acted tough forrests men were no more eager to risk getting hurt than anybody else with an ounce of brains in his head they went after people who were hurt or acted afraid once all the easy marks were down theyd deal with the tougher ones somebody close by was screaming for his mother ben robinson couldnt tell if the cry came from a white throat or a black one from a us soldier or a confederate badly hurt men all sounded pretty much the same maybe people should have drawn a lesson from that in fact he was sure they should have he was also sure they didnt if they did mad scenes like this wouldnt happen kill the niggers bawled somebody else much too close unlike the other that cry would only come from a confederate kill the traitors that might have been somebody from the thirteenth tennessee cavalry but was much more likely also to come from a reb forrests troopers hated the men who fought under major bradford at least as much as they hated blacks when ben robinson came to fort pillow he wouldnt have believed that was possible after listening to bradfords troopers talk for a while he did and after listening to them he also believed the confederates had some pretty good reasons to hate them some of the things the troopers bragged about doing of course they had their reasons for doing those thingsthey were avenging themselves for other things forrests men had done to them and their kind and their friends how long would that cycle of vengeance go on how long could it go on before everybody killed off everybody else without bens even noticing charlie key managed to reload his springfield when he fired the muzzle of the piece couldnt have been more than six inches from robinsons left ear do jesus robinson yipped and jumped in the air what you shooting at damn secesh bastard mournfully the other colored soldier added i done missed the son of a bitch almos didnt miss me robinsons head still rang even after hed fired the twelvepounder more times than he could count that rifle musket made an appalling noise all the worse because it was so unexpected shit sandy cole said theys in behind us ben robinson swore too the line of soldiers in blue wasnt a line any more it had broken down into little knots of struggling men like the one of which he was a part each knot fought for itself not enough us officers remained on their feet to make the federals fight as a group any more and they were going to get defeated in what was the word in detail that was it robinson felt absurdly pleased with himself for remembering but how much good would remembering do him how much good would anything do him with the rebs howling like wolves and his own side falling one man after another he tried to knock the rifle musket out of another confederates hands he failedthe reb held on to it but the man didnt seem quite so eager to gut him like a butchered hog the way things were going that was a triumph of sorts major bradford couldnt even mourn the loss of his brother not unless he wanted people to be mourning him too and in short order he ran now here now there trying to rally the federal soldiers wherever he could for a little while he hoped they could hold forrests men out and drive them back for a little while yesbut not for long no matter what hed thought bedford forrest was in deadly earnest when he said his troopers could take fort pillow between the sharpshooters on the high ground looking down into the fort and the swarm of rebs coming over the earthen rampart the garrison had no chance to hold back the tide any more than king canute could in days gone by when bradford fired at an oncoming confederate he found hed emptied theodoricks colt as well as his own son of a bitch he shouted and then because that wasnt nearly strong enough shit he threw the revolver in the enemy soldiers face whatever the reb was expecting that wasnt it the pistol caught him right in the nose he shouted shit too much louder than bradford had clutching both hands to the wounded member he slowly crumpled instead of reclaiming the pistol bradford snatched up the springfield the confederate had dropped the colt was just a lump of iron now hed never have the chance to load in bullets and measure out charges of black powder and affix a percussion cap for each cylinder he wanted to fire with a bayoneted rifle he carried a spear longer than a man was tall that was something anyhow something yes but how much the federals defense of fort pillow was coming to pieces before his eyes things were falling apart the center could not hold and the confederates poured in on both flanks as well the flag had fallen in a few minutes forrests men looked likely to kill or capture every union soldier in the fort biting his lip bradford shouted the order hed hoped he wouldnt have to give down to the river men down to the mississippi if the rebs come after us the new era will give them canister the gunboat had kept firing all through the fight even if her shells didnt do so much as bradford wanted she hadnt tried lobbing rounds up onto the flat ground atop the bluff but bradford could scarcely blame her for that the shells could and surely would fall among his command as well as among the rebs even breaking contact with forrests troopers was hard the howling men in gray and butternut were mixed in with their foes in blue soldiers thrust at one another and swung their springfields like base ball bats whenever somebody managed to load a musket he fired at the closest soldier in the uniform of the other color here and there men rolled on the ground kicking and kneeing and choking each other in a struggle old as time little by little whites and negroes in blue made for the steep side of the bluff and started scrambling and tumbling down toward the mississippi far below if some of the negroes ranwell some of the white troopers from the thirteenth tennessee cavalry ran too who wouldnt with sure death behind and possible salvation ahead bradford wished he could do something about theos body his brother lay where he had fallen dead men and writhing wounded lay everywhere inside the earthwork testimony to how fierce the fighting was if the federals still held the fort when the battle was over bradford would have to bury poor theodorick if they didnt he shrugged if we dont chances are somebody will have to bury me a heartbeat later he shrugged again even if the federals held fort pillow he might stop a minnie or get in the way of a rebs bayonet hed worked hard to preserve the union in western tennessee and kentucky a lot of forrests troopers wanted to kill him not just because he was a yankee officer a lot of them carried personal grudges both as a lawyer and as an officer hed harried rebs and their families as hard as he could they had it coming by god but he couldnt expect confederate soldiers to love him afterwards he couldnt and he didnt he carried the springfield at high port held diagonally in front of his chest ready for a lunge or a parry he wished hed done more bayonet drill because they were cavalrymen the troopers from the thirteenth tennessee had scanted that tiresome exercise and the officers even more than the men the colored artillerymen seemed better at it than their white counterparts he watched a colored sergeant keep a reb off him with a few smoothlooking jabs and butt strokes the coons had rhythm no doubt about it who would have imagined they could go toetotoe with men who might have owned some of themwho might as a matter of law still own some of them bradford shook his head that wasnt so lincolns emancipation proclamation superseded what had been the law when it was first issued bradford had no use for the emancipation proclamation it seemed like a sop to northern abolitionists and nothing more because it freed slaves only in regions beyond the reach of union forces what did that do except win the president political capital but the answer soon became clear federal troops might not be able to free negroes through most of the confederacy but a great many slaves were able to free themselves by running off to the closest us garrison they voted with their feet against the souths peculiar institution southerners still insisted negroes were slaves by nature and never could match up against whites on even terms maybe they were right though a strong union man bill bradford had always believed that himself but what the negroes here at fort pillow were doing was making him change his mind no they and their white comrades couldnt keep bedford forrests men out of the fort but how many more men did forrest have and werent those big black bucks fighting as well as the whites beside whom they stood bradford couldnt see that they werent he also couldnt see that he could stay up here on top of the bluff much longer not if he wanted to go on breathing keeping that springfield between himself and the enemy he fell back toward the slope that led down to the mississippi moving a gun was work for a team of mules or horses not for men like the rest of the yelling cheering confederates with him matt ward didnt give a damn they swarmed over the twelvepounder literally manhandling it toward the edge of the bluff we hit that son of a bitch of a gunboat a couple times well kill it deadern a cow that gets in front of a locomotive somebody said more cheers rang out not one of the troopers shoving the cannon into place was an artilleryman forrest hadnt brought his batteries west against fort pillow considering the state of the roads the cavalry traveled that had to be wise but like any soldiers the troopers were convinced they could do anything they had the gun they had cannonballs they had bags of powder and they had a target what more did they need look wards voice broke with excitement theres that stinking scow just sitting in the water waiting for it lets give it to the damnyankees how somebody said damn gun wont point so low we lift the trail up thatll bring the barrel down ward said half a dozen confederates suited action to work grabbing the trail and grunting with effort lifting it into the air then a sergeant said that wont work boys why not goddammit one of them demanded irately on account of you cant fire steady that way and on account of the recoilll run the gun carriage right on over you and squash you like a bunch of bugs the sergeant answered jesus god you got to be dumbern a nigger if you cant see stuff like that the trooper remained irate but he couldnt very well argue because the sergeant was obviously right whatll we do then he asked put stuff under the trail till it stays up and the barrel goes down ward said he wouldnt have insulted the other confederate the way the sergeant did but the fellow wasnt what youd call smart enough stuff lay scattered across the grounds of fort pillow boards barrels sandbags what have you ward would have used bluebellies bodies to prop up the trail but nobody else seemed to want to do that even without bodies they found plenty to depress the gun barrel they loaded a sack of powder into the muzzle of the gun they didnt bother sponging it out first if any bits of wadding were still smoldering they might have been very sorry but luck stayed with them somebody shoved a twelvepound iron ball into the muzzle and rammed it down toward the end of the bore and someone else ignorant of friction primers stuck a burning splinter in the touchhole matt ward wasnt the only one who jammed his fingers in his ears but nothing happened hang on the sergeant said you got to prick the bag so the powders loose and the flame can get at it artillerymen no doubt had a special iron tool to do just that forrests troopers had to improviseand they did several of them carried horseshoe nails and hoof picks in their pockets one of those proved long enough and straight enough to do the job then matt ward put a percussion cap over the vent somebody whack it with a rock he said if that wont set the blamed thing off im a nigger ill do it the sergeant said we aimed at that son of a bitch he looked down the barrel of the gun then nodded oh yeah he smacked the cap not with a rock but with a hammer hed picked up god knew where boom the twelvepounders roar was a truly impressive noise flame and a great choking cloud of smoke belched from the muzzle of the gun cannon carriage and all jerked backward knocking down the ramshackle support the troopers built under the trail the sergeant had to spring to one side to keep from getting run over just as hed warned the men who wanted to hold the trail up by hand they missed the yankee gunboat the cannonball kicked up a truly impressive splash about fifty feet behind it and well to its left there were probably fancy nautical terms to describe that better but ward neither knew them nor cared about them all he knew was the miserable gunboat still floated several troopers cussed we shot the stinking gun once ward said we can damn well do it again right thats the spirit the sergeant said and even if we did miss we let those damnyankee bastards down there know this here forts got it some new owners right right the troopers shouted maybe they really were heartened maybe they just knew better than to argue with anybody who wore three stripes on his sleeve under his profane direction they shoved the twelvepounder back to the very edge of the bluff getting it ready to fire again didnt take so long now they had some idea of what they were doing they thought so anyhow the colored artillerymen whose captured gun they served would have laughed themselves silly those colored artillerymen never once entered wards mind like the rest of the cavalry troopers at the gun he was intent on the gunboat down in the river the sergeant walloped another percussion cap again the cannon bellowed a gust blew some of the smoke into wards face he coughed and wiped his streaming eyes on his sleeve more curses erupted from his comrades this cannonball went into the mississippi about as far ahead of its intended target as the other one was behind it well we scared em by god ward said we can still hit that damn thing the sergeant had no quit in him all weve got to do is split the difference between those two we do that we put a cannonball right through the blamed boats brisket he seemed to think his makeshift gun crew had the skill to split the difference real artillerymen would have no doubt about it the negroes whod been driven from the gun would have this swarm of forrests troopers they had enthusiasm and very little else they did load the twelvepounder again jostling one another to peer down the barrel they tried their best to aim the field piece at the gunboatand to hold it on target with that flimsy pile of stuff raising the trail and depressing the muzzle here we go this time for sure the sergeant shouted and brought the hammer down on a third percussion cap fire smoke thunder the iron shot splashed into the mississippi at least as far from its target as either of the earlier two hells bells somebody said in disgust we can see the son of a bitch down there why in blazes cant we hit it she said somebody who fancied himself an expert on things that had to do with ships boats are always she shes a god damn bitch is what she is she dont hold still for no body another trooper said sounds like a woman all right ward said his own experience in such things was limitedhed been kissed twice not counting cousinsbut he got a laugh lets try again boys yes the sergeant whod taken charge of the twelvepounder was as stubborn as they came no matter how stubborn he was three misses made his crew start melting away hell with it a trooper said as he stooped to pick up his carbine im gonna go shoot me some niggers and tennessee tories i can damn well hit them bastards thats right ward grabbed his enfield too i know how to aim this critter the sergeant squawked but they all went farther along the edge of the cliff till they looked down on the soldiers in blue scrambling down toward the riverbank ward raised the rifle musket and aimed at a white man descending feet first the homemade yankee saw him and waved desperately dont shoot he cried i aint done nothin to you killing a man in the heat of battle was one thing killing a man in cold blood killing a man begging for his life killing a defenseless manfor the trooper in blue had dropped his pieceproved something else again with a swallowed obscenity matt swung the enfield away from the other man not all the bluebellies going down the slope and already at the bottom had given up a soldier down there fired at ward he didnt know how to gauge such a steep uphill shot and the minnie slapped into the mud about ten feet below the confederate if i dont kill em theyll kill me ward thought he aimed at a negro this time nothing stayed his trigger finger the ball caught the black in the short ribs although the runaway slavefor what else could he bewas halfway down toward the mississippi the howl he let out reached ward up on the bluff the black rolled and tumbled all the way down to the riverbank nice shot another confederate trooper said he looked just like one o them clowns in the circus way he turned somersets there he did didnt he ward paused in reloading though not for longhis hands knew what to do even without direction lets see if i can get me another coon like that well it aint like we dont have plenty to pick from said the other soldier in butternut yeah ward brought the loaded enfield up to his shoulder and found another target a colored soldier rolled past sergeant ben robinson the man was groaning and trying to clutch at his chest but his arms and legs kept flying out every which way poor bastard sandy cole said he aint dead yet he gonna be by the time he fetch up longside the river aint it the truth robinson said a mini ball cracked past his head a few inches lower and he would have rolled and slid all the way down to the mississippi too the only difference was nobody would have wondered if he was dead aaron fentis looked up the slope to the top of the bluff where bedford forrests troopers were taking potshots at the whites and negroes below them why the hell those officers of ourn want us to come down here he demanded dem secesh sojers dey shoot us down like we was so many wild turkeys they say the gunboat keep the rebs off us robinson said dey say dey say fentiss voice went high and mocking i say dey don know what dey talkin bout dey say we hold out forrest too was dey right how much good dat damn gunboat do us up till now any atall i aint seen it you seen it sergeant even in disaster he remembered to stay respectful to ben robinsons chevrons he should have stayed respectful to the white officers in command at fort pillow too robinson should have reproved him for not sounding respectful enough he knew he should but couldnt make himself do it aaron fentis might be disrespectful but that didnt mean he was wrong the whites in command at fort pillow hadnt known what was going on well maybe major booth had but he got killed too soon for it to matter since then robinson wouldnt have wanted to surrender to the confederates even if they did offer to treat negroes as prisoners of war but hed thought as major bradford had thought that fort pillow could hold that turned out to be mistaken and now there was no talk of taking anybody prisoner colored man or white the rebs kept yelling black flag and firing away for all they were worth maybe they stop killin people if we surrender now charlie key said who kin do it robinson asked bleakly major booth he dead major bradford he want to go on fightin he git killed he go on fightin much longer key said then somebody else kin tell the rebs we is givin up he paused then added do jesus i surrender right now if i dont reckon they shoot me dead fo tryin that was defeatism sergeant robinson knew he shouldnt let anybody get away with it in happier times he wouldnt have but how could you blame a man for defeatism after you were defeated if scrambling down toward the riverbank with confederate soldiers shooting at you from above wasnt defeat robinson didnt want to find out what was if he thought some reb would let him give up he supposed he would throw down his springfield too hed done everything he could reasonably do to defend the fort but getting anyone in butternut to accept a black mans surrender wouldnt be easyand might not be possible if the federals couldnt quit they had to go on fighting but robinson couldnt even do that not now no confederate soldiers were within bayonet reach and he had no cartridges for the rifle musket hed picked up he wondered if any of the union soldiers going down toward the riverbank carried more than a handful of ammunition but no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than a white man below him yelled you need to shoot back at the stinkin rebs get over here we got us crates and crates of cartridges major bradford he done thought o somethin anyways sandy cole said i reckon robinson said reckon that make once too was he bitter just because everything bradford tried turned out to be wrong for a moment he tried to deny it even to himself he wondered why when it was so plainly true only one thing occurred to him that as a black man he had no right to criticize what a white man did hell i dont he muttered what that white man did was altogether too likely to get him killed was a damn fool any less a damn fool because he was white whites seemed to think so or at least to believe a damn fool was more a damn fool if he happened to be black there were black damn fools robinson had known enough of them to have no doubts about that but there were white damn fools too and if one of them wore oak leaves on his shoulders he could be a damn fool on a scale most negroes only dreamt of robinson awkwardly made his way down toward the crates of cartridges if he had to go on fighting he would make the best fight he could he was clumsy loading the springfield too most of his training was as an artilleryman not a foot soldier hed just finished setting a percussion cap on the nipple when a burst of fire came from farther south along the riverbank panic swept through him if the rebs were shooting at the garrison from there as well as from the top of the bluff the surviving federals wouldnt last long but not many minnies tore into the negroes and whites in blue uniforms instead bullets clattered off the gunboats iron sides they sounded like hail on a tin roof for a moment robinson wondered what good they would do the rebs ironclads were supposed to be proof against cannonballs let alone mini balls but then a white soldier standing not far away said fuck me if id want to raise the gunports with the rebs putting that much lead in the air you do youll catch a bullet with your teeth they dont open them ports they cant shoot robinson exclaimed they cant shoot they dont do us no good you noticed that did you the white trooper said nothin gets by you does it boy normally that boy would have infuriated robinson the more so since he outranked the white now he was too appalled to call the other man on it if major bradford was wrong about this we all die the colored sergeant thought numbly up on top of the bluff a cannon boomed it hadnt fired for some time but now the rebs had got it loaded again a ball splashed into the water not far from the gunboat that wasnt great shooting but it didnt need to be if the amateur gunners up therethey couldnt be anything elsekept on sooner or later they might hit how well armored was the gunboat against fire from above ben robinson had no idea maybe the gunboats captain didnt either and maybe he didnt want to find out black smoke poured out of the stack the gunboat began to movenot toward the riverbank to blast the confederates and rescue fort pillows embattled garrison but north up the mississippi away from danger you yellowbellied son of a bitch bastard the white man howled robinson nodded helplessly the gunboat paid no attention to either one of them away she steamed faster and faster x when bill bradford watched the new era steam up the mississippi he felt like he didnt know what he felt like like a man whose intended bride jilted him at the altar something like that maybe but a jilted bridegroom didnt die at the altar he just wished he could the men defending fort pillow on the other hand captain james marshall the commanding officer aboard the new era must have decided his gunboat couldnt stand the fire from the riverbank and the cannonballs from the artillery captured up on the bluff he saw to the safety of his own men he saw to their safety yesbut he left the garrison to its fate a panicked trooper from the thirteenth tennessee cavalry clutched at bradfords sleeve and shouted what the hell do we do now sir an equally panicked colored artilleryman all but screamed the same question at him boys save your lives bradford said numbly i dont know what else to tell you he didnt know how to tell them to save their lives he didnt know how to save his own life either the terror that filled the soldiers took root in his own heart too what to do what to do from the south came the exultant whoops and jeers of the confederate cavalrymen whod forced the new era to flee yellowbellies they yelled and cowards and you stinking gutless sons of bitches hearing the enemy shout exactly what he was thinking was as humiliating an experience as major bradford had ever known save your lives it was easy to say with bedford forrests troopers already shooting down at the federals from the top of the bluff with those secesh soldiers whooping and jeering by the river it wouldnt be easy to do he wondered if the rebs would accept surrenders now part of him wished hed taken forrests offer while he had the chance forrest was known for ploys and tricks but he wasnt fooling this time bradford wished he had been yellowbellied coward bradford thought furiously stinking son of a bitch he stared across the muddy waters of the mississippi at the receding new era if he ever met captain marshall again he didnt think god himself could keep him from punching the gunboats skipper in the nose and if marshall felt inclined to resent that bradford was ready to go as much further as the navy man cared to bradford laughed a bitter laugh he knew he wasnt a particularly brave man he did his best to hide that from others and perhaps most of all from himself but he knew it all the same the prospect of a fight or even a duel with james marshall worried him not a bit he knew why too it was what he would have called a hypothetical question in the courtroom a lot of things would have to happen for him to face marshall again chief among them was his living through the combat here and the chances of that didnt look good some of the men still had fight in them they grabbed cartridges from the crates bradford had ordered brought here and fired at the closest confederates major bradford would have expected his white cavalry troopers to show more spirit than the colored artillerymen the colored soldiers were only niggers in uniform after all he would have expected that but he would have been wrong some blacks were terrified and despairing yes but so were some whites the proportions seemed about the same in men of both races what that meant was as hypothetical as punching james marshall in the nose if bradford got out of this he could worry about it later if he didnt get out of this he wouldnt worry about anything later aint gonna give up to no secesh sojers said a colored sergeant ramming a mini ball down the muzzle of his springfield even if them fuckers dont shoot me fo the fun of it reckon they sell me later aint gonna be no slave again not many of the troopers from bradfords own regiment showed anything close to that kind of spirit the white major stared at the black underofficer bradfords own opinion of negroes wasnt that far from nathan bedford forrests or any other confederates he thought they made good slaves bad freemen and worse soldiers he favored the usa because he didnt want to see the country broken in twoand because several prominent men in west tennessee with whom he didnt get along well went allout for secession hed paid them back ten times over but he was worse than indifferent toward negro rights he was downright hostile and didnt care who knew it or he hadnt cared who knew it he didnt think he would be smart to go on about niggers and coons where that grimly determined sergeant could hear him the way the blacks in fort pillow fought had surprised him the way the colored sergeant was ready to go on fighting no matter how bad things looked astonished him if we were wrong all along about what negroes can do then it doesnt matter if the confederates win this fight he thought it doesnt even matter if they win this war sooner or later their cause is doomed and it will fall to pieces it has to because it rests on lies on a cosmic level that might well be so back here in the mud by the edge of the mississippi who won and who lost mattered very much because it told who lived and who died some of the federals started south along the riverbank perhaps hoping to get past the confederate troopers whod helped drive off the new era a couple of them looked back at him as if wondering if he would try to stop them he didnt for one thing he wasnt sure they would obey him why should they when his orders had led them to their present sorry state for another he wasnt sure they were wrong what were they supposed to do wait here for bedford forrests troopers to shoot them to pieces certain disaster lay down that road maybe if they pushed hard and maybe not too every choice bill bradford made that day even keeping his mouth shut proved wrong the men in blue fired a few shotshardly enough to dignify with the name of volleyat the confederates the roar of musketry that answered sent them reeling back in dismay some bled some limped some didnt even reel but lay dead or badly wounded by the river theyre coming a white federal screamed theyre on our tails dey gwine kill all we shrieked a negro beside him the blacks terror and his thick accent made the words almost incomprehensible but no one could misunderstand the fear that made him push through the crowd of soldiers that made him throwaway his springfield to run the faster and the panic from the men whod taken that blast of musket fireand the whoops and rebel yells from the confederates who were indeed on their tailsstampeded the rest of the union troops into motion what point waiting here for the massacre they all saw ahead the new era wouldnt rescue them nowthey all saw that too and so more a mob a herd than anything resembling soldiery they pelted north toward where coal creek ran into the mississippi one more spooked steer bill bradford ran along with the rest a few of the men in colonel barteaus regiment along coal creek fired at the federal gunboat as it steamed away from the fight no goddammit dont waste your ammunition corporal jack jenkins roared along with other underofficers and officers jesus christ he went on you cant hit the son of a bitch at this range and even if you could so what shes ironplated for cryin out loud have a heart corporal a trooper said damn boats been shootin at us all day long least we can do is pay her back a little blow em a kiss wave byebye jenkins suited action to word bastards gone thats all weve got to worry about now reload your damn piece and dont go shooting at anything till you got somethin to shoot at the private scowled he muttered but not only did jenkins have two stripes on his sleeve he was also taller and wider through the shoulders and without a doubt meaner if the soldier tried to give trouble hed end up getting it instead he might be a grumbler but he wasnt a fool he could see that for himself and he did need to reload regardless of whether he needed somebody to tell him to do it he went right on muttering but he followed jenkinss order and jenkins was happy enough to leave it right there getting troopers to do what you told them was a neverending pain in the neck they always thought they had a better idea and they were bound and determined to go ahead with it no matter what he wondered if he was such a pest before he got promoted a reminiscent smile stole over his face he was not a chance anyone ever set over him would say anything different he wondered how sergeants and officers ever put up with him but the answer to that wasnt hard to find no matter how big a nuisance hed been without even trying he could think of a dozen men who were worse what do we do now somebody asked theres damnyankees round the bend of the bluff down by the mississippi you can hear the bastards somebody else said lets go kill em them bastards what went up into the fort theyve had all the fun jenkins felt the same way but a nearby lieutenant shook his head well just sit tight for a little while is what well do arent a whole hell of a lot of us we might bite off a bigger chaw than we can get in our cheek aw hell sir jenkins was still a pain in the neck whether he realized it or not they aint real yankee soldiers not hardly nothin but tennessee tories and niggers in blue shirts one of us has to be worth well a bunch of em anyways i said no the officer got stuffy the way officers have since the beginning of time if they get through us its liable to give them an escape route do you want to see that happen no sir jenkins allowed he knew how things worked as long as he kept saying si he could get away with saying anything else he pleased near enough but they aint gonna get through us sir no way on gods green earth they can do that you reckon niggers can fight bettern us sir if the lieutenant said yes to that hed have a fight on his hands even if he did wear two bars on each side of his collar but the lieutenant shook his head no no noof course not he said impatiently up till this combat i wouldntve reckoned niggers could fight at all fight like soldiers i mean he sounded faintly or maybe more than faintly troubled at having to admit even that much and more troubled as he went on theyve done better than anybody imagined they could im afraid well im not afraid sir to hell with em to hell with em all and with the homemade yankees too jenkins said way they were scornin us and cursin us during the truce they mustve thought they were somethin special they aint special enough by jesus and they dont fight good enough neither thats the spirit corporal the lieutenant said dont let anything bother you do you not if i can help it sir jenkins said anything in a blue uniform does bother me reckon ive got an answer too he held up his rifle musket the officer smiled good if it werent for you and soldiers like you wed never get ourselves a free confederacy well hell well manage jenkins had as much faith in that as he did in the resurrection and the second coming aint we whipping the damnyankees out of their shoes here he hoped he found a dead federal with feet his size his own shoes were falling to pieces around the bend on the mississippi river side of the bluff the gunfire suddenly picked up so did the shouts and yells jenkins had listened with much amusement to the federals cries of dismay when their precious gunboat left them in the lurch after it steamed away the coons and the homemade yankees quieted down for a while now the fighting picked up again and by the way the federals moaned and wailed things werent going any too well for them the rebel yells that also rang out said those other confederates on the far side of the enemy were having fun and the federals were heading this way the shouts were getting louder for the first time they also sounded frightened gauging things by earwhich was all he could dojenkins thought the federals had put up a pretty fair fight until now but the men heading this way didnt sound like soldiers under control they seemed like men whod had everything they could take and a litde more besides any union soldier who saw jack jenkinss smile would no doubt have called it nasty no matter how much the bluebellies had taken they were about to get some more you see boys that knowitall lieutenant sang out we didnt need to go to the fight its coming right to us yall ready to give those federals a little taste of southern hospitality well give em just what they deserve by god jenkins said and the lieutenant didnt grumble or fuss one bit he only nodded and his smile was every bit as predatory as the corporals here they come half a dozen troopers sang out at the same time as the federals rushed up to coal creek and started away from the mississippi along its southern bank they didnt find the safety they hoped for they were in no kind of order and didnt seem to be under any officers control jenkins shot the lieutenant a glance of mingled annoyance and respect maybe the men who told ordinary soldiers what to do had some uses after all maybe let em get close the lieutenant said now let em get close and then give em a good volley at my command may i face eternal damnation if we dont break those sons of bitches hold your fire till i give the order yall hear nobody said no even more to the point nobody started shooting on came the men in blue their hurrah made a poor excuse for a battle cry but they used it when they were in good spirits they werent cheering nowoh no some of them skidded to a stop when they saw a line of confederates in front of them others kept comingnot so much because they were eager to attack jenkins judged as because they didnt know what else to do only a handful of federals raised springfields to their shoulders and fired trying to clear the way of bedford forrests men one luckless confederate howled and crumpled clutching at a shattered knee at my order the lieutenant said and then fire jenkinss rifle musket bucked against his shoulder smoke and flames belched from the muzzle he took off his hat and fanned the air in front of him trying to clear it enough to see not just through his own pieces smoke but that from the rest of the rifle muskets as well the union charge such as it was shattered like crockery on a big rock only eight or ten men in blue were down but even the ones who didnt take a minnie felt the angel of death brush them with his dark wings charge the lieutenant shouted a revolver in one hand and his ceremonial saber in the other he set his own example against determined foes it would have been madness it would have been suicide but the federals had no fight left in them some turned and pelted back in the direction from which theyd come others threw down their guns and tried to surrender sometimes that worked sometimes it didnt jack jenkins saw some of his comrades send federals back toward the rearoften with a kick in the rear as they went others shot men in blue uniforms at pointblank range or bayoneted them even as they got down on their knees and begged for mercy dont shoot sweet jesus please dont shoot a federal sergeant called to jenkins he held out empty hands see i aint got no gun he also didnt have an accent like jenkinss he was no tennessean no homemade yankee he really did come from up north he seemed to pronounce every letter in every word and that likely meant you one of those fellows who tell nigger soldiers what to do jenkins barked yes thats right the sergeant answered but he got no further jenkins pulled the trigger the minnie caught the yankee right in the middle of the chest the man stared in astonished reproach for a moment as if to say what did you have to go and do that for he opened his mouth as if to ask the question his knees buckled instead he flopped and thrashed on the ground like a sunfish just pulled from a stream hold still god damn you jenkins said and used his bayonet he stabbed several times till the us sergeant finally stopped moving you turn niggers into soldiers you deserve worsen i just gave you no sooner were the words out of his mouth than a bullet cracked past his head for all he knew a colored soldier fired it he reloaded his own piece in feverish haste he felt naked if he couldnt shoot back at the enemy some yankee cavalrymen and even foot soldiers were getting repeating rifles that gave a company almost a regiments worth of firepower he thanked heaven nobody in fort pillow seemed to have guns like that the lead they put in the air would have made storming the place gruesomely maybe impossibly expensive as he stowed his ramrod in its tube under the rifle muskets barrel he wondered why the confederacy couldnt make repeating rifles for its troopers us soldiers werent any braver than their cs counterparts with his own fierce pride jenkins refused to believe they were as brave but the federals would never lose the war because they ran short on things guns ammunition uniforms railroads to take men where they needed to go gunboats the men in blue seemed to pull such things out of their back pockets along with more food than they knew what to do with as for the confederates how many of bedford forrests men were wearing captured clothing quite a few had blue trousers a standing order required shirts to be dyed butternut right away to keep the troopers from shooting at one another by mistake a lot of confederates carried captured weapons too the south simply couldnt make or bring in enough to meet its need before the war southerners sneered at yankees as nothing more than merchants and factory hands the charge was true enough but the south hadnt realized it brought strengths as well as weaknesses men fought wars but they fought them with things no matter how brave you were youd lose if you didnt have food in your belly if you didnt have bullets in your rifle musket if you didnt have gunboats to control the rivers the federals didnt have to worry about anything like that the confederates did more and more as the fight dragged on but not right here not right now forrests motto was get there first with the most men he had the most men here right where he needed them and the federals were melting away like snow in the hot sun a negro running in front of jenkins gave a despairing screech threw his hands in the air and wailed do jesus dont kill me i aint done nothin to nobody you one of those niggers yellin you wouldnt give us quarter jenkins growled oh no suh not me i aint one o them bad niggers the black man shook his head so hard his cap flew off and fell to the ground beside him he didnt seem to notice all his fearful attention was on jenkins i dont want to fight no mo i bet you dont boy jenkins said you a runaway the negro hesitated if he said no the way he talked would betray himhe sounded like someone from the deep south from south carolina or georgia or alabama or mississippi but if he said yes he was liable to seal his own fate jenkins could watch the gears meshing and turning behind his eyes in the end all he said was dont kill me suh i surrender you had your chance all of you bastards had your chance you shouldve took it when you could jenkins squeezed the trigger even he winced at what the mini ball did it tore off the bottom half of the black mans face leaving him gobbling and bleating because he could no longer make sounds resembling human speech blood poured down his front but he would not fall he would not die he slumped to his knees and imploringly stretched out his hands to jenkins his eyes were enormous in his shattered face christ that was the confederate lieutenant he shot the colored soldier in the side of his head with his revolver the negro didnt try to stop himthe poor bastards last gobble before he toppled over might have been meant thank you the lieutenant shook his head i wouldnt let a dog live with a wound like that corporal im sorry sir jenkins answered it was horrific enough to sober him which said a great deal i was gonna finish the son of a bitch i had to reload thats all he was doing it as he spoke he forgotor maybe he chose not to rememberthat hed bayoneted the white tennessean after his bullet didnt finish the man right away welllet it go the lieutenant said stinking bluebellies didnt give up when they had the chance now theyre going to pay for it oh hell yes there jack jenkins agreed with the officer one hundred percent he stowed his ramrod and went back to the fight the smoke from the new eras stacks was only a receding stain against the northern skyline nathan bedford forrest smiled a slow smile the smile of a big cat that has fed well the federals inside fort pillow had surely counted on the gunboats firepower to save their bacon for them there had to be a great wailing and gnashing of teeth among them now for theyd leaned on a reed that broke and pierced their hand gunboats were wonderfulwhere the mississippi was wide and where they could shell soldiers who couldnt answer back with rifle muskets if a gunboat came close enough to fire canister though good shots could put enough minnies through the gunports to remind them that the fight had two sides sailors didnt like being forced to remember that now the new era was gone and fort pillow was gone and nothing remained but the aftermath forrest foresaw as soon as the us commander refused to lower his flag war means fighting and fighting means killing he thought with somber satisfaction quite a few generals on both sides shied away from that simple brutal truth he didnt he never had you did what you needed to do and now his men were doing what they needed to do he was abstractly sorry they were but knew better than to try to stop them nothing so corroded an officers authority as giving orders no one heeded if he tried to stop the soldiers from paying back the federals they wouldnt listen to him and so he hung back from the fighting where usually he led the charge some of the federals were able to surrender grinning troopers herded white soldiers alongand some blacks as well when the prisoners didnt move fast enough to suit them a prod with the bayonet worked as well as spurs on a horse one of the soldiers in blue a negro waved to forrest i knows you general he called i knows you sure as anything wouldnt be surprised forrest answeredthe black man looked familiar to him though he couldnt put a name on the fellow you come through my nigger lots down in memphis yes sub i done that the black answered i done that a couple times matter of fact bedford forrest believed it a slave who was sold more than once was liable even likely to be an uppity nigger and one who was likely to run off and make trouble putting on the us uniform this one had made as much trouble as he could eyes narrowing in concentration forrest said i still dont recollect your name but the last time i sold you i got let me see twentyone hundred dollars for your worthless nigger carcass he spoke without malice he might have described a good horse as crowbait the same way thats my price all right the negros voice held a certain pride tooit was a good price a damn good price then the man did a double take and stared at bedford forrest how you remember how many niggers you done sold since i go through there six seven years ago selling niggers is my business forrest said i better remember im in trouble if i dont i wouldnt have got such a good price for you if you didnt have good teethi remember that too they still sound sure enough are suh the colored soldiers eyes got wider yet do jesus you mus be some kind o hoodoo man you call to mind a thing like that not me bedford forrests smile was half reminiscent and again half predatory like i say ive got to remember those things when i came to memphis i didnt have fifty cents in my pockets when the war started though i dont know if i was the richest man there but hell with me if i can name four who were richer and i got that way buying and selling niggers what do you do when youre not trying to murder your masters is a carpenter sub the black man said by the way he said it he was a good carpenter too someone who took pains with his work that suited forrest fine all right then he said youll know when to use oak and when to use pine when to use nails and when to cut mortises and tenons what kind of shellac to use how to match grainsall those kinds of things thats your business so sure you know well niggers are my business in spite of himself a certain sour edge touched his voice no matter how rich hed grown in memphis some people looked down their noses at him because he was a slave trader that didnt keep them from buying and selling with him oh no he was useful but he wasnt welcome in some homes no matter how much money he made hell with em he thought hed grown up on a hardscrabble farm and lost his father while he was still young hed had to be the man in his large family himself then and hed damn well done it if the men who owned slaves didnt care for the men who sold them what did that prove only that they were fools it was like despising the butcher while you ate his beefsteaks your sojers damn near kill me the negro said thats what you get for tryin to fight white men forrest retorted no suh i knows about fightin the colored artilleryman said they killin lots federals tryin to give up onliest reason i didnt get shot is trooper who catched me didnt have no bullet in his gun i was tryin to surrender honest to god i was too bad bedford forrests voice went cold and hard i told major booth i could take that stupid fort i told him hed pay the price if he didnt give up he wouldnt listen now he is paying the price and so are you he done paid it sub major booth he deadhe got kilt this mornin fo noon oh really forrest heard the surprise that got into his voice in spite of himself the negro nodded solemnly then who led the garrison there the confederate commander asked major bradford he been in charge o things ever since major booth die bradford that miserable little son of a bitch forrest growled the head of the thirteenth tennessee cavalry us was not one of his favorite people to put it mildly the colored soldier nodded again forrest aimed a scarred forefinger at him like a pistol barrel you say booths been dead since before twelve oclock twothree hours fo that suh cross my heart an hope to die the negro matched action to word when we had the truce this afternoon before my men stormed the fort every single noteevery onethe federals sent out to me had booths name on it forrest said with a shrug the black man answered i dont know nothin bout that suh is jus powerful glad to be alive and youll stay alive forrest promised you told me something i didnt knowsomething i needed to know by god i wish i wouldve known it sooner thats all he stabbed out his index finger again whats your name is hiram lumpkin suh bedford forrest laughed to hell with me if i know how i ever forgot that he raised his voice to a shout guards this here nigger this hiram lumpkinhe spoke the name with enormous relishhe just did me a favor y all make sure you treat him good i hear anything happened to him itll happen to you too only worse you got that yes sir the confederates chorused union troops didnt faze them their own fierce leader that was a different story the negro in blue saluted as if forrest were one of his own officers thank you kindly suh this here nigger he right grateful go on then forrest said and hiram lumpkin hurried off into captivity with joyful strides for his part forrest shook his head so booth was dead all along and bradford never let on how about that he could see why bradford kept the senior officers death a secret lionel booth was a real soldier and had a pretty good notion of what he was doing bradford on the other hand was nothing but a lawyer with a loud mouth had forrest known he was in charge at fort pillow he would have pushed the attack harder without a doubt the place would have fallen sooner and so bradford let him think the experienced officer still held command and it deceived him too bedford forrest slowly nodded to himself it cost the federals in the end when forrest demanded a surrender he was sure major booth would have given him one booth was no fool he could see what was what and he could see the writing on the wall bradford pinned his hopes on the new eraand got them pinned back when she sailed away would bradford try surrendering now or would he have the nerve to fight to the death forrest had never heard anything suggesting that he was particularly brave a slow smile spread over his face he could hardly wait to find out lieutenant mack leaming crouched behind a bush halfway down the bluff from fort pillow to the mississippi hed watched men in blue run back and forth along the riverbank pursued first by one band of confederate soldiers and then by another they were getting chewed to pieces down there and more confederates at the edge of the bluff only made things worse for them part of leaming wanted to go down by the river with the rest of the union troops and share their fate but he could see too clearly what that fate would be they were getting picked off from three sides at once the only direction from which nobody was shooting at them was from the mississippi itself some of them threw away their weapons and waded out into the river to try to save themselves from the unending fusillade of lead it didnt work bullets splashed into the water kicking up little fountains although some men waded out up to their necks that didnt keep them from getting hit trails of blood started appearing in the muddy river gators might have followed those trails to see what made them this far north though gators were scarce it was too early in the year too cool for them to be very lively anyhow the wounded federals were spared one torment then they werent spared much else up at the top of the bluff one confederate trooper nudged the man next to him on the firing line bet you four bits i can hit that nigger in the water there he pointed which one his pal asked i cant see which way your blamed fingers goin the ugly bald coon there behind that redhead all right i see him you wont hit the son of a bitch they were both shouting which let leaming hear them gunfire had likely stunned their ears to anything less than shouts hell i wont the first confederate drew a bead and fired he whooped did i get him or did i get him bastards headed for hell right now if he is i better go to heaven on account of i dont want to spend forever with a stinkin nigger thats half a dollar you owe me dumb luck dumb fuckin luck bet you cant hit the redheaded yankee double or nothin all right let me reload by god and ill have me a dollar of your money methodically the first trooper started doing just that he fired again there you see that damnyankee sank like a rock i gave him what he had coming and you can kindly give me a dollar here dammit the other confederate paid up this here is secesh paper the first one grumbled it aint hardly worth what its printed on i wanted a real us greenback even the rebs knew us money was better than their own the second trooper shook his head you didnt say what kind of dollar we were bettin and you wouldnt give me any better if i won a bet off you ought to be grateful youre getting any dollar at all you sure wont see a different one and thats the lords truth dont take his name in vain cyrus the first trooper said bart you tend to your own little shriveledup mule turd of a soul and ill take care of mine how does that sound mack leaming thought it sounded like good advice he also thought it was about time to give himself up if he could here and there stubborn us soldiers white and colored were still banging away at bedford forrests men they would undoubtedly wound some even kill some they had no chance at all of changing the way the battle was going without even a pistol he couldnt shoot back no matter how much he wanted to hed done what he could with a cavalry saber hed done more good for the us cause with only a cavalry saber than hed imagined he could now he had to trust to the mercy of enemies who werent showing much he watched a trooper in filthy butternut walk up to a wounded negro crawling on the ground and blowout the blacks brains there you go tyler another confederate called as the grubby trooper reloaded up on top of the bluff where the fighting was about done things would be calmer so leaming reasoned anyhow he started crawling up the steep side again if he could get someone to take his surrender all i want to do is go on living he thought is that too much to ask please jesus tell me it isnt he got to within perhaps fifteen paces of the top of the bluff before he dared to stand up when he did he looked at the saber he still held in his right hand then he looked up at the ground for which the federals had fought and which theyd lost three or four rebs were watching him intently they might have been wolves wondering when a sick deer they were chasing would stumble and fall wishing that particular comparison hadnt occurred to him lieutenant leaming tossed aside the saber he didnt want the confederates thinking he might make a mad dash up the slope and try to murder them all he spread his hands and forced a smile he didnt feel across his face i surrender he called youve licked us we cant fight any more bedford forrests troopers glanced at one another with slow thoughtful deliberation one of them raised his rifle musket to his shoulder and peered over the sights down the slope at leaming if he pulled the trigger at that range he could hardly miss and leaming realized with rising horror he was going to pull the trigger leaming tried to turn away tried to run too late too late the confederate fired the minnie caught leaming in the back just below his right shoulder blade his face hit the ground harder than he ever dreamt it could blackness covered him xi a federala white manbegged for his life on his knees in front of matt ward he had no pride he had no shame please dont shoot me he whined i dont want to die tears ran down his terrified face you one them bastards who learned niggers how to fight ward demanded for any confederate soldier that was the unpardonable crime no sir the bluebelly answered swear to god i aint my names henry clay like the big shot from way back when im company e thirteenth tennessee cavalry a lot of forrests men were tennesseans they hated the homemade yankees in the us thirteenth cavalry at least as much as they hated negro soldiers because ward was from missouri he didnt hold so much against the white soldiers in blue they were just damn yankees to him not brothers and cousins and friends gone wrong he gestured with his bayonet all right henry clay get up turn out your pockets whatever youve got in there its mine now i dont care clay said take it i got me about ten dollars in greenbacks and a couple of silver cartwheels too and you can have my spare cartridgesdont reckon ill need em no more he was pathetically eager to give ward everything he owned got me some hardtack here and some coffee beans youre a walking sutler ward said he couldnt do anything with the coffee not till he had a chance to crush or grind the beans but he broke a chunk off a hardtack cracker stuffed it in his mouth and started to chew the doublebaked dough reminded him one of his teeth wasnt as good as it should have been it twinged when he chewed his belly growled his side always seemed to be on short rations but the federals had plenty after he swallowed he gestured with his enfield again go on back to the rear theyll take care of you there thank you god bless you henry clay said more tears drizzling down his cheeks youre a christian gentleman you are go ongit keep your hands high ward said clay lurched away south along the bank of the mississippi do i feel better because i let him live ward wondered he shrugged he shook his head the federal just didnt seem worth killing it wasnt the same thing at all clay was out of the fight now that would do another blueclad soldier tried to give up ward might have taken his surrender too but a yankee minnie cracked past his head his own reaction was automatic he ducked even as he was ducking he pulled the trigger the federal screamed he thrashed on the ground like a snake with a broken back clutching his belly and crying for his mother ward felt bad about that he hadnt meant to gutshoot the man well no matter what hed meant it was done now he reloaded as fast as he could some of the colored soldiers and tennessee tories were still fighting as that bullet proved fewer and fewer us soldiers kept on shooting though a lot of them were down others went out into the mississippi mostly without their weapons doing whatever they could to get away from bedford forrests men and quite a few were trying to give up some like henry clay succeeded others like the fellow matt ward shot without even thinking about it didnt the ones who died had only their own officers to blame as far as ward was concerned general forrest told them he couldnt answer for what his own troops would do if he didnt get a surrender right then the confederates blood was up considering the men the soldiers in butternut faced that was as near inevitable as made no difference blacks as soldiers ward ground his teeth at the very ideacarefully because the hardtack had shown that that one was tender a handful of the bluebellies in the mississippi were really trying to swim or at least to float away letting the current carry them downstream past the cs lines most just waded out and stayed there everybody said ostriches stuck their heads in the sand and left the rest of themselves in plain sight the union soldiers were just the opposite only their heads stuck out of the water ward aimed at a negro who had to be unusually tall to have waded as far out into the mississippi as he had before he could fire somebody else hit the black man he shrugged he had plenty of other targets to choose from he had to swing his rifle musket only a little to the right to bring it to bear on a blond man with a long beard he fired the federal sank into the river bedford forrests troopers had already started plundering the enemy some of that was rifling pockets the same kind of thing ward did to henry clay the homemade yankees name still made him smile but much of it was more serious more essential barefoot confederates stole dead bluebellies shoes troopers in ragged shirts and trousers took what they needed from men who wouldnt be worrying about clothes any more and fine springfields lay scattered on the ground like oversized jackstraws troopers whod joined forrests force with nothing better than a squirrel gun or a shotgun got weapons as good as any their foes carried as good as any their foes here carried anyhowward silently corrected himself he longed for a repeating rifle a henry or a spencer what confederate cavalry trooper didnt but the only way to keep a rifle like that in cartridges was to capture them the confederate states werent up to making those fancy brass cases just when ward thought the fighting was over it flared up again a few federals down here by the riverbank didnt want to give up and didnt think they could get away with surrendering they seemed bound and determined to take as many confederates with them as they could ward didnt run toward the new skirmish plenty of other troopers were closer to it than he was hed already put himself in enough danger for one day and those coons wouldnt last long any which way sergeant ben robinson wondered if he would be the last soldier from fort pillow to go down fighting he could do without the honor he didnt want to go down at all sandy cole had fallen with a bullet in the right thigh and another in the arm charlie key was shot in the arm tooif that bone wasnt broken robinson had never seen one that was aaron fentis was down with bullet wounds in both legs he lay groaning somewhere not far away and somebodyd shot poor nate hunter right in the ass the little knot of federals who were still fighting had bedford forrests troopers coming at them from along the mississippi and from the direction of coal creek more confederates went on shooting down at them from the bluff by any reasonable measure the fight was hopeless no matter how hopeless it was the us soldiers kept on loading and firing loading and firing some were negroes whod seen what happened when other colored men tried to surrender robinson preferred dying with a gun in his hand to being murdered in cold blood and some were whites from the thirteenth tennessee cavalry whod avenged themselves on the confederates whenever they found the chance and now feared like vengeance would fall on them they were a band of brothers now those last couple of squads worth of struggling union soldiers race didnt matter any more neither did rank some of them were wounded those men loaded springfields and passed them to others hale enough to use them here they come somebody yelledthe rebs from the coal creek side were dashing forward the defenders fired a ragged volley of four or five shots to make them keep their distance the federals might have wounded one man robinson wasnt even sure of that it didnt matter the gunshots showed the men in blue hadnt given up that was enough to stop the confederate rush as if to make up for stopping one of forrests men shouted gonna kill you bastards gonna shoot you another secesh soldier added gonna stick you said another another confederate flavored his words with almost obscene anticipation gonna stick you sons o bitches slow and watch you die an inch at a time still others yelled more bloodthirsty endearments the white man closest to ben robinson grinned crookedly really makes you want to throw down your piece and give up dont it huh robinson said a syllable half despair half startled laughter so many men were down easiest thing to do might be to throw down your piece all right an play possum in wid all the bodies good luck the white trooper said what do you want to bet the rebs go around and bayonet everybody on the ground if you arent dead beforehand you will be by the time they get through with you huh ben said again on a different note all despair this time that struck him as much too likely some other white tennesseans must have thought their chances were better if they laid down their arms two white men walked toward the closest confederates with their hands in the air laughing bedford forrests troopers let them get closeand then shot them the federals screams were as much of betrayal as of agony though the rebs put enough minnies into them to finish them in short order you see said the trooper by robinson reckon i do the negro answered less than a minute later a minnie thudded into the white mans chest he fired one last shot at the enemy and died in grim defiant silence only a few us springfields were still firing the confederates drew closer and closer robinson was in the middle of reloading when a cs trooper shouted drop it nigger drop it right now or ill shoot you down like the mad dog you are the man had friends behind him all of them were aiming their rifle muskets at the colored sergeant a wild charge with the bayonet would just get him killed all the brave resolve leaked out of him he let the springfield fall in the mud the confederate hadnt said hed kill him if he did surrender slowly robinson raised his hands grinning and laughing forrests trooper shot him do jesus robinson screamed and fell heavily to the ground somebody might have dipped his right leg in tar and set it on fireit hurt that much thatll learn you you damn coon said the soldier in butternut just what you deserve you try takin up arms against white men you pay youd fuckin best believe you pay you hear me only a groan came from ben robinsons lips the reb didnt seem to care he walked on looking for somebody else to kill robinson lay where hed fallen writhing and thrashing hed never imagined anything could hurt so bad he clutched his thigh with both hands as tight as he could his own hot blood leaked out between his fingers it leaked yes but it didnt flood litde by litde as his stunned wits began to work again he realized it wasnt a fatal wound unless it festered ill live he thought right at the moment everything hurt so much he wasnt sure he wanted to a us physician would have dosed him with opium or laudanum or at least with a big slug of corn squeezings to ease the pain he didnt suppose a secesh doctor would give him the time of day let alone a painkiller for one thing the rebs didnt have much in the way of medical supplies for their own wounded for another he was black they were more likely to give him a bullet to bite onor one through the headthan laudanum robinson tried holding still wondering it that would ease him it didnt not even a little and even if it would have he couldnt do it he had to move and to keep moving his pain insisted on it moving of course held dangers of its own several confederate soldiers stalked past him anyone of them could have decided to finish him off but none did maybe they enjoyed seeing him wriggle and hearing him moan he wondered about that only later at the moment he just thanked heaven hey you hey nigger the shout came from far away for a while ben robinson had no idea it was meant for him plenty of other colored soldiers were still alive but then the cry came again hey nigger yeah you down by the water the one with the leg he looked toward the top of the bluff a couple of forrests troopers up there were staring down at him they might have been soaring vultures staring down at a dying donkey he waved to show he heard them he didnt want to do that but he was afraid they would start using him for target practice if he didnt one of the rebs cupped his hands in front of his face come on up here boy he yelled i cant robinson yelled back i been shot you better sambo the confederate said you dont want to get shot some more you goddamn well better they could hit him at that range with no trouble at all hed seen them hit men whod waded out into the river who were farther away than he was and exposing less of themselves i try he said could he crawl how much would the wound bleed if he let go of it but that suddenly wasnt the biggest worry on his mind how much would he bleed if they shot him again and where would they his belly his head he could get better after this wound another one might well do him in come on nigger get movin one of the troopers at the top of the bluff started to raise his weapon ben robinson crawled he was slow and awkwardeven crawling he couldnt put much weight on the injured leg dragging it along the ground hurt like a son of a bitch too he bit down on the inside of his lower lip till he tasted blood tears streamed down his face he might have been climbing one of the tall mountains out west not a riverside bluff getting to the top took more out of him than fighting all day had of course nobodyd put a hole in his leg when he was serving the twelvepounder and trying to hold the rebs out of fort pillow first with the worm and then with a springfield the confederates whod summoned him scowled fiercely one was tall and skinny the other was short and skinny and so young that pimples still splotched his dirty face the short one had breath that might have come from an outhouse when he opened his mouth to speak robinson saw that two of his front teeth were black he came straight to the point give me your money you damned nigger money robinson said i aint got no money that wasnt true but the words came out of themselves he hoped the rebs wouldnt kill him if they found out he was lying give me your money or i will blow your brains out said the soldier with the bad teeth and the horrible breath hell rafe hes just a nigger he dont have no brains the other trooper said by his loud braying laugh he wasnt long on brains himself i aint got none to give you ben robinson repeated if he changed his story now that would make them angry no angrier ought to shoot the son of a bitch anyways rafe said we shoot all the uppity niggers the restll cipher out they better not mess with us his clothes are pretty good lets take what all hes got said the other soldier the tall one he gestured with his rifle musket lay down you robinson obeyed in truth he couldnt have stayed on hands and one knee much longer anyhow the rebs pulled off his shoes they both tried them on and swore when they found out the heavy leather brogans were too big for rafe and too small for his pal whose name turned out to be willie the confederates didnt give them back after that they tossed them aside so other troopers could try them on if they wanted to skin out of your pants boy willie said do jesus robinson said what you want my pants for they got bullet holes in em an i been bleedin all over em they had his money the money hed denied owning skin out of em willie repeated blood washes out in cold water and even with holes in em theyre bettern what were wearin he wasnt wrong his own trousers were out at both knees and inexpertly patched in several other places rafes were worse one of his trouser legs simply ended halfway between knee and ankle the other was a tapestry of holes all the way up including a big one in the seat that displayed his dirty drawers sure the rebs would kill him if he disobeyed and hoping to live ben robinson undid his belt buckle and slid the pants off he hissed with pain when he tugged them down over the wound with the trousers gone he got his first good look at it somebody might have gouged a fingersized groove in the outside of his thigh getting shot was never good but it could have been a lot worse i ought to get over this he thought its only a flesh wound he wouldnt get better if they shot him again or if they used their bayonets and they could oh yes they could rafe went through his pockets he came out with a handful of greenbacks and some silver ha he said triumphantly i knew the nigger son of a bitch was lying he kicked robinson in the ribs ow robinson howled and wrapped his arms around himself he was acting acting for his life rafe could have kicked him harder if he didnt pretend to be hurt forrests trooper might decide to make sure he was hey willie said half o that moneys mine hell you say rafe told him i found it i was the one that said we ought to halloo the coon up here willie retorted try finding money in the pockets of niggers who aint here youre so damn smart ought to be mine rafe whined i aint askin for all of it i aint greedy like some folks willie said but you try and steal from me ill beat the living shit out of you and im big enough to do it too rafe reluctantly handed over some greenbacks and coins with a smug nod of thanks willie stuck the money in a pocket of his disreputable pants the rebs worried about stealing from each other neither one of them cared about stealing from a negro sergeant robinson didnt point that out the less attention forrests troopers paid to him the less likely they were to shoot him or stick him or knock him over the head confederate soldiers werent just robbing blacks they were stealing from white federals too stripping dead and wounded troopers from the thirteenth tennessee cavalry us one wounded white man who made a feeble protest got his teeth knocked out with a rifle butt rafe and willie dragged robinson toward several bodies lying close together on the ground fear rose up in a choking cloud inside himwere they going to finish him off now but the minnie or bayonet thrust didnt come they hurried off to see what other loot they could garner ben robinson lay where theyd left him as long as he stayed quiet near dead bodies maybe forrests troopers would think he was dead too and leave him alone then he noticed he was lying next to major booths corpse the dead commandant stared at him out of dull eyes robinson wanted to reach out and close them that set unwavering gaze unmanned him but he couldnt make himself touch the body he turned his back on it instead secesh soldiers had already stripped booths corpse he wore only undershirt and drawers now that robinson thought back on it hed seen a reb sporting a tunic with a lot of brass buttons on it if that sharpshooters bullet hadnt found the major robinson swore softly too late to worry about it now too late to worry about anything now exceptif god proved kinder than hed shown himself to be thus farsurviving surrender hell no you fucking son of a bitch you aint gonna surrender a confederate trooper yelled and fired at bill bradford from no more than fifty feet away the bullet cracked past the majors head bradford turned and ran while the reb swore the man whod led the defense of fort pillow didnt know whether he led a charmed life or a cursed one every secesh soldier wanted to shoot him on sight but so far none of their bullets had bitten not knowing what else to do he darted into the mississippi even though wading out into the river hadnt done his men much good the water was cold he waded and floundered and dogpaddled out some fifty yards then paused panting and treading water he could taste the mississippi mud in his mouth and prayed it wouldnt be the last thing he ever tasted there he is a reb shouted thats bradford blow his head off cried another soldier in gray an officer pointed out to him come ashore bradford if you know whats good for you will you spare me bradford asked the officer just pointed again peremptorily they would surely kill him if he stayed out in the mississippi sobbing from fear and exhaustion he made his way back toward the riverbank no sooner had he got to where the water was only waistdeep though than the confederates started shooting at him again he yelped in fright as bullets flew by and splashed into the water again though none hit the officer whod ordered him ashore and several others stood around watching the sport they didnt do a thing to stop it sobbing bradford dashed up onto the muddy land and started running up the hill he pulled a soaked handkerchief from his pocket and waved it again trying to give up more bullets cracked past him at last he almost ran into a rebel trooper coming down to the riverside the confederate leveled his rifle musket at bradfords brisket give it up you yankee bastard he yelled i surrender oh dear sweet jesus christ i surrender bradford threw his hands in the air as high as they would go he had never imagined he could be so glad to yield himself then the reb recognized him you now that forrests trooper knew the man hed caught he looked ready to end bradfords career on the instant but he didnt pull the trigger after all instead greed lighting his face he said turn out your pockets damn you ill do it bradford did without the least hesitation being robbed seemed much better than being killed here you go friend he handed the confederate more than fifty dripping dollars if he held back a double eagle well you never could tell when twenty dollars in gold might come in handy i aint no friend of yours his captor said snatching the bills and coins out of his hands a nasty smile spread across the rebs face no i aint no friend of yours but i like your money just fine take it then and welcome bradford said he could always make more money he sneezed the wind on his soaked clothes chilled him to the bone forrests trooper gestured with the muzzle of his rifle musket up the hill you go bradford id shoot you my own self but i reckon theres others who want you even worsen i dostarting with the menfolk whose women your damn traitors outraged bradford licked his lips he tasted more mud his mustache was wet but his tongue and the inside of his mouth were dry with fear i never gave orders for anything like that he got out yeah likely tell likely tell the confederate jeered now lets hear another storyone ill maybe believe before god its the truth bradford held up his right hand as if taking an oath the soldier in butternut laughed it wasnt a goodnatured mirthful laugh a cat with a human voice might have laughed like that playing with a cornered mouse the reb urged bradford up the side of the bluff again shivering bradford went it was the truth no oneno one in his right mind anyway ordered his men to abuse the women on the other side but as bradford knew and as pontius pilate must also have known long ago there was truth and then there was truth west tennessee was and always had been a rebel stronghold forrests trooper called the soldiers of the thirteenth tennessee cavalry us traitors to bradfords way of thinking the men who were trying to break the union in half were the real traitors if you stayed loyal to the united states what did you do about treason what could you do about it you could put it down that was what if somebody wanted to see the stars and stripes cut down and the stainless banner flying in their place what were you supposed to do stand by and watch while he took up arms against your countryagainst the country bradford shook his head as he climbed the steep slope he didnt think so and sometimes the game got rough it got rough on both sides plenty of men under his command had had relatives bushwhacked houses burned livestock killed or driven off if they paid the confederates back in the same coin who could blame them not bill bradford not for a minute he wanted to make it hard on the rebs to remind them they were facing a power strong enough to defend itself a power strong enough to make anyone who defied it sorry some of the things that happened didnt happen officially taking women out behind the barn and doing what you wanted with them to them fell in that category no nobody would order it but if you owed vengeance to a particular reb if you knew who he was if you knew where his kin lived wouldnt you do whatever you could to pay him back of course you would some of the soldiers who did things like that bragged about them bradford had heard them going on about what theyd done they fell silent when they noticed him but often not soon enough had he done such things he would have kept quiet about them till people shoveled dirt over his grave but he was a lawyerhe knew that talking about something often made it twice as real being a lawyer he also tended to forget that things stayed real even without testimony about them as he regained the top of the cliff he saw a negro wearing only shirt and drawers lying next to a white man whod had all his outer clothes stolen the colored soldier stirred the white man never would not till the judgment trump blew major bradford recognized lionel booth had the rebs stripped theodorick the same way bradford couldnt stand the idea he hurried toward the place where theo had fallen where do you think youre going you goddamn son of a bitch snarled the confederate whod captured him to see my brothers body he answered not slowing in the slightest wouldnt you do the same for yours the confederate didnt answer he also didnt fire bradford strode through the chaos of the sack of fort pillow rebs were busy stripping bodies and plundering sutlers huts stealing from the united states all the things their own gimcrack government couldnt give them horrible screams rose from a tent the federals had been using as a hospital for their wounded mixed in with them were shouts of hoarse drunken laughter some of forrests troopers must have got into the whiskey major booth had ordered put out to fortify the garrisons courage a couple of soldiers in butternut lurched from the tent they both carried cavalry sabers dripping blood you scalped that coon just like an injun would one of them told the other they both thought that was the funniest thing theyd ever heard they had to hold each other up or they would have fallen on their faces an officiouslooking young confederate second lieutenant rushed over to bradford where do you think youre going he demanded then recognizing the man to whom he spoke he did a classic double take you he said the same thing bradford jerked a thumb back over his shoulder at the trooper behind him i think im going to tend to my brothers body thats what and see that he gets christian burial you are a christian i hope by the way he said it he had his doubts i ought to blow your head off right here the lieutenant said scowling if he was a christian he didnt believe in turning the other cheek i have surrendered this gentleman accepted my surrender bradford pointed to the trooper again if you care to make yourself infamous before god and man pull the trigger i shall not run soaked and weary though he was he struck a pose hed pleaded for lives before but never for his own all the courtroom tricks hed used for others came back to help him now he succeeded in confusing the lieutenant anyhow dont you go nowhere the youngster squeaked i am going to find my brothers body bradford insisted i am going to see him properly buried and what i do after that is nobodys business but my own when the confederate lieutenant didnt tell him no his hopes began to rise mack leaming lay where hed fallen hed stuffed a pocket handkerchief into the hole below his shoulder blade the linen square was soggy with blood now but he did think he was losing less than he had before secesh soldiers and their federal captives scampered down the side of the bluff and trudged up it confederates plundered the dead and robbed the living they werent murdering so many as they had in the mad moments after the fort fell but they hadnt stopped either a negro dashed down to the mississippi and tried to take refuge in the river one of forrests troopers shot him just as he splashed into the water his blood mingled with the greater flow of the stream two more confederates ran over and pulled him out of the water come on you stinking shitheel one of them shouted get up and walk whatever the negro said leaming couldnt make it outit was too feeble youd better get up or youll never have another chance the second reb warned the negro managed to reach his hands and knees both confederates laughed he crawls like a dog the second one said he can die like a damned dog the first reb put a revolver to the negros head and fired once the colored soldier flopped down dead bedford forrests men walked off laughing still a soldier in ragged gray crouched down by lieutenant leaming got any greenbacks yank he asked hoarsely groaning with the effort leaming reached into his pocket and pulled out his wallet here he said biting his lip against the pain take it can i have some water please he might as well have saved his breath the reb was too busy counting his loot to pay any attention to the man the loot came from sixty eighty ninety ninetyfive a hundred a hundred an one two three the trooper said in an awed voice a hundred an three dollars goddamn im rich he let out a whoop of joy then like a fox that wanted more than one chicken from the coop he stared hungrily at leaming again all that money what else you got water leaming said again his throat felt rough as shagreen forrests trooper didnt care he frisked the union officer with ungentle hands and whooped again when he found leamings gold watch it disappeared into his pocket along with its heavy golden chain godalmightydamn he said as reverent a blasphemy as leaming had ever heard wish i had me more days like this here one since i joined up i am a made man i am if you wasnt so ugly id kiss you give me water leaming told him i dont need a kiss maybe because he was still bleeding he felt drier every minute he wondered how long he could last it seemed to matter only in an abstract way which probably wasnt a good sign he might have been a bank to the confederate soldier but he wasnt a human being the reb got to his feet i find me another federal even half as loaded as you are reckon im set for life away he went whistling the battle cry of freedom both sides used that tune in this war though they set different words to it the us chorus went the union forever hurrah boys hurrah down with the traitor up with the star while we rally round the flag boys rally once again shouting the battle cry of freedom by contrast the rebs sang our dixie forever shes never at a loss down with the eagle up with the cross well rally round the bonnie flags well rally once again shout shout the battle cry of freedom to the confederates in fort pillow freedom seemed to mean freedom to loot another secesh soldier called on leaming a few minutes after the first one left give me your money you lousy tennessee tory or youll be sorry he said then ill have to be sorry leaming answered another one of your fellows already took everything i had now tell me one ill believe the reb said and searched him with practiced ease that suggested he was either a sheriff or a bandit by trade leaming knew which way he would have bet the confederate swore when he found leaming was telling the truth well ill get something for myself anyways he said and stripped off leamings shoes they proved too small which made him swear again then he cheered up a little maybe i can swap em with somebody else whos got a bigger pair if you are a christian man please let me have some water leaming said i am a christian man and i hope to go to heaven the cs trooper replied but if we met in hell and you were on fire id give you kerosene instead of water thats what you deserve you cowardly yankee piece of shit for putting guns in niggers hands and making em think they can rise up against their masters god and bedford forrest will punish you for that he didnt say whether he trusted more in the deity or his commanding officer he did go away leamings shoes in his hand the right side of his torso one vast stabbing ache leaming lay where he had fallen he looked up at the sky the sun was sinking toward the western horizon but hadnt got there yet he wondered if he would die before it did so much had happened so fast only a few hours earlier he was parleying with nathan bedford forrest himself hed never imagined it would come to this to fort pillow lost to finding out what having a bullet hole in him was like he grimaced some kinds of knowledge were too dearly bought hed always been a bright and curious man but this once he wouldnt have minded ignorance a shadow fell across his face it wasnt a vulture circling close to see if he was dead yet although the way he felt he wouldnt have been surprised if it were not a vulture with feathers anyhow another reb seeing if he had anything worth stealing the confederate soldier gave him a rueful grin looks like im just about too late he said my pals done took all the good stuff offn you water the more leaming asked for it the more he was refused the more he craved it he asked in vain again the reb might as well not have heard him reckon i can get more use out of them trousersn you ever will he said hike your bottom up sos i can get em off you im wounded leaming got out through clenched teeth i can see thatits why i dont want your damned tunic forrests trooper said aint nothin wrong with your pants though hardly any blood on them so hike up and let me have em leamings wound mattered to him only in so far as it made thievery inconvenient the federal officer didnt couldnt hike up his tormentor stole his trousers anyway leaming begged for water one more time he might as well have talked to a deaf man the confederate went right on ignoring his pleas he thought of trying to shame the man thought of it and decided not to the trooper whod stolen his shoes had his own brand of righteousness however twisted it seemed to mack leaming this fellow might also and if he did he might decide to use bullet or bayonet to silence what he didnt want to hear and even with the anguish of his wound leaming wanted to live he aimed to die at home at a ripe age surrounded by a large and loving family this muddy bluffside in the flower of his youth this had nothing to do with what he had in mind what god had in mind for him he asked himself more and more often as the sun slid toward setting xii when the firing at fort pillow finally slowed nathan bedford forrest rode forward his men had had their fun or enough of it he knew he couldnt have stopped them even if he wanted to and he didnt want to hed warned the federals he wouldnt answer for the consequences if they didnt give up every time he used that warning up till now they either surrendered or beat back his men both of which rendered the threat moot but it wasnt moot here fort pillow did fall and so it had to take the consequences if he tried to hold his men in check after the fall and if he managed to do it which wouldnt be easy by a long shot what sort of threat could he make the next time he wanted to shift some yankees he shook his head none at all major boothno major bradfordyou are a damn fool he muttered whats that sir one of his staff officers asked nothing never mind forrest said annoyed the other man overheard him he wondered whether bradford still lived he was inclined to bet against it when the tennessee tory had so many men who wanted him dead bradfords bully boys had harried loyal confederates in west tennessee almost as savagely as colonel fielding hursts outfit well they wouldnt any moreand neither would hurst for a while forrests own men cheered him as he neared the position they had stormed they whooped and grinned and waved their slouch hats some of them showed off the shoes and trousers and weapons theyd taken from the federals forrest only grinned when they did the confederates had to make war pay for itself when they fought the richer united states one trooper waved to forrest with a fist full of greenbacks forrest grinned at him too but said for gods sake lucas stick that in your pocket you want somebody to knock you over the head and walk off with it anybody tries i reckon hell be mighty sorry mighty fast lucas answered with a pistol on one hip and a bowie knife on the other he looked ready to raise large amounts of hell put it away anyhow bedford forrest said the less temptation you stir up the better off everybody is lucas thought about telling him no then visibly thought better of it anyone who told forrest no was likely to be sorry for it and in short order too if major bradford remained alive he had to wish hed surrendered and if he didnt he would have gone on wishing it till his dying breath at the top of the bluff forrest dismounted his horse couldnt cross the trench in front of the us earthworks but several planks now spanned the ditch his troopers went back and forth as they pleased under their orders and under their guns federal prisoners were throwing dead us soldiers into the ditch bedford forrest nodded to himself why bother digging graves when they already had a big trench handy two negro prisoners picked up a body one of them turned to the closest cs soldier suh this here fella he aint dead he said i done seen his hand move thats a fac suh the other black agreed i seen it too set him down the trooper said the negroes obeyed the confederate soldier stooped for a closer look his knee joints clicked when he straightened pitch him in he told the prisoners if he aint dead hes too far gone for a sawbones to help hell be gone by the time they throw dirt on himand if he aint itll put him out of his misery go onget your lazy black asses moving the captives looked at each other then with almost identical sighs they obeyed nathan bedford forrest nodded again what would happen if they refused their bodies would lie at the bottom of the ditchand so would that of the prisoner who if he was alive wouldnt stay that way for long more prisoners these white men carried the body of a soldier in butternut to lie with his comrades a junior officer stood over the confederates bodies whats our part of the butchers bill forrest called sir weve got about twenty dead the lieutenant replied stiffening to attention when he realized whod asked the question about sixty wounded ive heard but dont hold me to that all rightthanks bedford forrest said the young officer saluted forrest returned it with a gesture more than half a wave then he crossed into fort pillow the planks that bridged the ditch groaned under his weighthe was half again as heavy as a lot of the men who served under him some yankee general said small young single men made the best cavalry troopers on the whole forrest agreed with him but he was not small himself he had a wife and the pain from his many wounds reminded him he wasnt so young any more either he jumped down from the broad parapet into the fort men in blue carried the bodies of their comrades toward the ditch forrests troopers urged them along if the soldiers in butternut urged blacks more roughly than whites well too bad bedford forrest shrugged a broadshouldered shrug he had no love for negroes trying to soldier either other confederates went on robbing dead and living federals forrest did nothing to stop them without yankee loot the confederacy would long since have folded up and died having to plunder the enemy to keep fighting him made the war harder but it went on and some of forrests troopers went on killing the men theyd overcome forrest scowled thats enough he shouted enough damn your black hearts stop it or ill make you sorry without looking over his shoulder to see who had spoken a confederate growled who the hell do you think you are to try and give an order like that bedford forrest trotted up to him and knocked him to the muddy ground then stood over him with fists clenched im your general thats who he said who the hell dyou think you are to try and disobey me he waited if the trooper wanted a fight he could have one but he quailed instead few men did anything but quail in the face of an angry nathan bedford forrest im sorry sir the man mumbled ill make you sorrier than you ever thought you could be if you go disobeying orders again forrest said you hear me miserably the soldier in butternut nodded forrest thought about stirring him with his foot but held back treating the trooper like a nigger might make him lash out with no thought for what happened next instead forrest told him get up and do what youre supposed to do then as the trooper rose a gunshot rang out not far away somebody let out a shriek a negro clutching a smashed and bleeding hand the confederate soldier whod shot him cussed a blue streak and started to reload hed been aiming for the black mans head not his hand general forrest said thats enough a captain snapped you shoot anybody else or you shoot this miserable son of a bitch again ill put you under arrest do you want a courtmartial no sir the soldier said grudgingly but i dont want some dumb fucking nigger trying to kill me neither forrest turned away so the trooper wouldnt see him smile the captain was right no doubt about it even so you could always rely on a southern soldier to speak his mind forrest started to turn back then stopped short his pale eyes narrowed the us officer crouching beside a body had gold oak leaves on his shoulder straps that made him a major with lionel booth dead he had to be bill bradford face grim as death forrest stalked toward him major william bradford had given his parole to a confederate colonel the rebs deigned to take it after they couldnt quite kill him the officer even gave him something to eat though bradford still had his soaked uniform on he didnt notice the thump of boots on damp ground till the noise was almost on top of him he looked up in surpriseand up and up for he didnt see such a tall man every day or every week either that dark chin beard that hard mouth those smoldering eyes with theo dead with fort pillow fallen he hadnt thought any worse disaster could befall him now as nathan bedford forrest scowled at him he wondered how long he could stay even as lucky as he had been his knees clicked when he straightened even on his feet he still looked up at forrest who was at least six inches taller general bradford said with such spirit as he could muster and held out his hand the confederate commander did not take it slowly bradford let it fall his face hot with shame and rage you damned fool why didnt you give up when you could forrest demanded why bradford shrugged because i thought i could hold your men out and because i feared they would act like beasts if they got in and i was right by god he pointed toward the heaped and tumbled corpses of union soldiers and toward the prisoners carrying bodies to the parapet and flinging them into the ditch that never would have happened if you surrendered forrest said so you say now major bradford answered for a moment he wondered if bedford forrest would strike him down where he stood when forrest grew angry his whole countenance changed he went red as hot iron and seemed to swell so that he looked even larger than he was are you calling me a liar major he asked softly if bradford answered yes he was a dead man he could see that i did not trust your earlier assurances sir he replied with lawyerly evasion when i say ill take prisoners i mean it forrest growled some of that furious color ebbing from his facesome but not all over at union city colonel hawkins knew as much he surrendered to my forces and he and his men are safe today this makes twice hes surrendered to you bradford said scornfully hes had practice you might say well youre a damn sight worse off now than if you did show the white flag forrest said and bradford winced he could hardly deny that the confederate commander went on i told you id let you surrender didnt i good lord i even said id let your niggers surrender and thats something ive never done before and im not likely to do again i had trouble crediting it when you did bill bradford picked his words with care not wanting to inflame forrest again too bad for you forrest waved back toward the rises outside the federal perimeter as soon as i got men on that high ground i could cut you to pieces easy as you please your soldiers couldnt stick their heads up over the earthwork without giving my sharpshooters perfect targets any man with an ounce of sense would have seen as much and thrown in the sponge one corner of his mouth twisted into a mocking smile well i reckon that leaves you out gloat all you care to bradford said wearily he pointed to theos body all i aim to do is give my brother christian burial better than chucking him into that mass grave as if he were a butchered beef to his amazement all the high color drained from bedford forrests face thats your brother major forrest asked also pointing to the bulletriddled corpse bradford nodded forrest startled him again this time by taking off his hat and holding it over his heart please accept my deepest sympathy forrest said i lost my own dear brother jeffrey down at okolona mississippi a couple of months back you may or may not have heard but i expect you will believe i have some notion of the misery you feel major bradford had heard that jeffrey forrest was killed in action it didnt mean much to him at the time just one more rebel officer dead and the wrong forrest at that but with theodorick lying there all bloody everything changed bradford managed a stiff if soggy bow i thank you sir no one who has not experienced the same thing can hope to understand it that is a fact forrest said you may give your brother the burial you like he turned and shouted for one of his aides the man came up at a trotwhen forrest said something people jumped to obey what is it sir detail a couple of captured niggers to dig a proper grave for major bradfords brother here forrest answered even an enemy can bury his dead yes sir no matter what the lieutenant said he didnt sound happy about it he looked daggers at bradford then what do we do with the god damn son of a bitch well we captured him he gave his parole bedford forrest didnt sound very happy about it either now that weve got him i suppose we have to keep him no he didnt seem happy at all i fought hard gentlemen but i fought clean bradford said shut up you lying bastard snarled the cs lieutenant what about that poor fellow who didnt like yankees and said so and got his tongue tom out on account of it major bradford gulped my men never did anything like that to his relief general forrest nodded hes right sam that wasnt his regiment it was hursts too damn bad i didnt catch him instead of running him into memphis but his gaze grew no friendlier as he went on what about the women your soldiers molested bradford the women whose menfolks chose the other side i never gave orders for any such thing general bradford said as he had before as god is my witness i didnt they would be an outrage against the laws of war but nathan bedford forrest only laughed in his face of course you didnt however big a jackass you are you arent that big that was a sardonic twist on bradfords own thoughts forrest went on but you dont have to give order when youve got your boys all set to do what they crave doing anyways you just look the other way and turn em loose and your hands stay clean you ought to know bill bradford didnt have the nerve to say it out loud but he would have taken his oath it was true did forrest order his men to slaughter the federal garrison once they got inside fort pillow up until this moment bradford had thought so now he didnt the confederate general sounded too much like a man who knew exactly what he was talking about hed how did he put it hed looked the other way and turned his troopers loose and his hands stayed clean or clean enough and the rebs did what they wanted to do anyway and if the troopers from bradfords regiment and the colored artillerymen who fought alongside them sufferedbedford forrest didnt care see to this fellow forrest told the lieutenant who saluted forrest walked off his longs strides taking him away in a hurry the lieutenant scowled at the trooper whod been watching over bradford whats your name soldier the officer asked ward sir im matt ward well all right ward you heard general forrestweve got to keep this bastard alive with forrest out of earshot he sounded downright disgusted he went on well let him stick this other son of a bitch in the ground since hes so damn hot to do it and then well take him along with us but ill tell you something else yes sir ward sounded as uninterested as a federal private would have you want to run your jaws he might have been saying say what youve got to say and leave me alone if he gets out of line if he gets even a little bit out of line you shoot him in the belly forrests staff officer said in the belly you hear he shouldnt just die let him die slow and hurt while hes doing it you hear me yes sir ward said ill take care of it sir the lieutenant scowled at bradford do you hear me you goddamned son of a bitch i hear you lieutenant bradford answered as coldly as he dared i have given colonel mcculloch my parole and do you recollect general forrest talking about the laws of war deliberately abusing a prisoner goes dead against every one of them bradford if it wasnt for colonel mcculloch and general forrest wed roast you and smoke you over a slow fire till we came up with something to really make you suffer the confederate officer said so thank the high officers and your lucky stars you arent screaming right this minute major bradford thanked nathan bedford forrest for losing his brother he couldnt imagine what hed do without theo theyd been in each others pockets their whole lives yes the confederate commander had lost a brother too but so what jeffrey forrest really was just a reb after all and bradford thanked bedford forrest for the loss of fort pillow with the fort hed lost any prayer of advancing his own military career even if he got exchanged who would give a fort to a man whod proved he couldnt hold one nobody and the thirteenth tennessee cavalry us was a ruin all the men at fort pillow were either dead or captured the rest the rest would probably elect a new commanding officer as soon as they found out what had happened here two negroes came up shovels on their shoulders like springelds forrests staff officer scowled at them damn coons got no business wearing uniforms and pretending to be soldiers he muttered they didnt pretend they fought to annoy the confederate bradford concealed his own amazement that the colored artillerymen could do any such thing one of them looked ready to go on fighting too restrained only by the presence of enemy soldiers in overwhelming numbers the other black was a beaten man but so were a lot of whites from the thirteenth tennessee cavalry i want to know what you think ill ask you the cs lieutenant snapped he turned to the negroes dig a hole and well throw the dead bradford in it you want to dig a big hole so we can throw both bradfords in thats fine by me neither black man rose to the bait the one who still looked to have fight in him said jus the two of us diggin we aint gonna be done by sundown then keep digging till you are damn you the confederate said you need em well have torches up so you can do the job right general forrest said we have to do this so we will when he spoke of forrest he might have been quoting the gospel the negroes began to dig forrests staff officer watched them for a while then seeming satisfied they wouldnt slack off when his back was turned he went away to do something else a few minutes later he showed up out of the blue to make sure they were still working hard bill bradford nodded to himself sure as hell the lieutenant was used to getting labor out of slaves as for bradford he watched the grave deepen he watched the sun sink toward the horizon and parole or no parole he watched for his chance corporal jack jenkins looked at his rifle musket with a strange mixture of pride and revulsion hed never done more killing with the weapon but it would be a bastard to clean not only was the bayonet bloody all the way to the hilt but the stock was a mess of blood and brains and hair stuck on as if with glue hed used it to beat wounded federals to death so he wouldnt have to waste more ammunition on them look he said now ive been smashing up niggers and tennessee tories he held up the rifle musket some of the strands of hair clinging to the stock were long and blond and straight others black and tightly curled thats about enough corporal said a captain he barely knew you can hear they arent shooting people up top anymore i wasnt shooting em down here anymore neither sir jenkins said reasonably i was just breaking their goddamn heads he displayed the rifle musket again to prove his point for some reason the goreclotted weapon didnt seem to please the officer he turned away muttering to himself after a moment he made himself turn back just dont kill any more union troops he said thats an order not unless they try and give me trouble sir like any soldier whod served for more than a few days jenkins knew how to get what he wanted and seem obedient at the same time oh no you dont like any man whod been an officer for more than a few days the captain knew when he was hearing disobedience in a compliant mask if one of these bastards tries to kill you you can punch his ticket for him to kill you you understand yes sir jenkins said sulkily all right otherwise you can lift their wallets and clothes but otherwise leave em be the captain said you understand that yes sir jenkins sounded even more reluctant this time he had reason to sound reluctant too the federals alive and unwounded were cringingly anxious to stay that way what odds that one of them would have the nerve to try to kill anybody they reminded jenkins of nothing so much as beaten dogs rolling over on their backs and baring their throats and whimpering to keep from getting beaten some more even robbing them wasnt much sport now almost all of them were barefoot the ones who still wore shoes didnt wear any that were worth stealing jenkins wouldnt have thought yankees could have shoes as ragged as any that belonged to one of forrests troopers but he would have been wrong the same went for their trousers the whites and negroes who still wore them were welcome to what they had on i can have fun with em jenkins thought that goddamn captain didnt say i couldnt he strode up to a white man you a homemade yankee he demanded before the federal trooper answered his eyes flicked to jenkinss fearsome rifle musket if hed thought about defiance one look changed his mind he nodded reckon i am you a dirty stinking yankee son of a bitch jenkins demanded the captive stood mute jenkins knocked him down and kicked him in the ribsprobably not hard enough to break any but you never could tell standing over him breathing hard jenkins growled you a dirty stinking yankee son of a bitch reckon i am the prisoner choked out say it out loud jenkins kicked him again harder this time say it out loud god damn you or youll be sorry ill make you sorry you hear he kicked the white man hard enough to make pain shoot up his own leg im a dirty stinking yankee son of a bitch the man bawled plainly as loud as he could it didnt fully please jenkins but it would have to do he gave the fellow one more boot to remember him by then moved on to the next closest prisoner a negro how about you rastus he asked hefting the rifle musket you heard that other fella so what do you reckon you are the black man sang out with no hesitation at all is a dirty stinkin yankee son of a bitch jenkins knocked him down too and kicked him hard enough to make what hed given the tennessee tory seem like a love pat by comparison reckon you can get off easy do you nobody gets off easy today boy what you are is youre a lousy shiteating nigger dog now let me hear you say that cuffy or else the devilll roast you even blackern you are already is a lousy shiteatin nigger dog the negro said louder jenkins kicked him again this time the negro shouted it tears running down his face he still wore blue wool trousers turn out your trousers jenkins told him i aint got nothin oof the black broke off with a grunt of pain for jenkins kicked him yet again turn em out boy you reckon you dont got to do what a white man says any more you better think twice you used to be a slave jenkins asked the colored soldier hesitated no doubt trying to decide whether a lie or the truth would do him more good answer me you fucking nigger piece of shit jenkins kicked the negro hard enough to make him groan and clutch at his ribs no the captain hadnt said a word about shoeleather answer me yes suh i was a slave do jesus dont kick me no mo well boy if you was a slave you know how youre suppose to act mongst your betters i tell you to turn out them pockets one more time by god itll be the last thing you ever hear you reckon im funnin you you can find outyou bet you can the negro decided not to take the chance which proved he wasnt so dumb after all out came a grimy handkerchief some greenbacks and a shiny gold eagle aint got nothin huh jenkins scooped up the money the way a redtail flew off with a chick wandering around the farmyard the ten dollar goldpiece went deep into his own pocket he couldnt remember the last time hed seen a gold coin even silver was in desperately short supply in the cashstrapped south federal greenbacks passed for hard money these days though even they sold at a discount against specie as for the banknotes southern banks issued they were like weevily hardtack you held your nose you closed your eyes and you went ahead and used them got any more jenkins barked so help me thats it the negro wheezed hand pressed against his ribs again last chance coon jack jenkins said im gonna search you if i find more you go straight into the goddamn river aint got nothin the colored artilleryman said jenkins patted every pocket he had felt his chest to see if he was hiding a bag around his neck even took off his socks and threw them away he didnt find anything either the negro was telling the truth or he had a devil of a good place to stash stuff corporal jenkins kicked him once more almost for good luck thats what you get for lyin to me the first time he said and went off to see if he could find another federal who hadnt been properly frisked ten dollars in gold you could buy a hell of a lot of confederate paper money for ten dollars in gold or you could buy a hell of a lot of thingsif anybody in these parts had them to sell the sun was going down mack leaming watched it sink with indifference marred by pain and bitterness the sun is setting on me he thought if he didnt get someone to help him if he had to lie on this cold wet miserable slope till morning he feared he wouldnt see the next sunrise hed done everything he knew how to do several confederates went past him skipping goatlike down the side of the bluff and slogging back up from the riverside he called out to themand they paid him no heed he even raised his arms in the three motions to shape the grand hailing sign of distress but either none of bedford forrests followers was a freemason or confederate masons were a coldblooded lot indeed their hearts hardened against their union brethren he would rather have believed the former than the latter freemasonry was supposed to transcend national allegiances but regardless of whether the truth lay in ignorance or in malice it seemed all too likely to kill him leaming must have dozedor passed outfor a little while when he returned to himself again the sun had dropped closer to the mississippi and the trees beyond it he had to look at his arms to see if they still shaped the grand hailing sign they did not that it seemed likely to matter someone in boots came down the slope leaming didnt bother to turn his head at the sound but where so many confederates passed on the other side like the priest and the levite in the book of luke this man stopped mack leaming looked up at him he wore the two bars of a first lieutenant on either side of his collar was he could he be a samaritan in this hour of need the confederate officer studied leaming as he lay there on the ground after a pause that had to last more than a minute the reb coughed a couple of times and asked are you by any chance a traveling man sir hope flowered in the wounded federal that was a question a freemason might ask a stranger to see if he too belonged to the order careless of the pain leaming nodded when he first tried to speak only a dusty croak passed his lips he tried again gathering his feeble reserves of strength i travel from west to east he got outthe east was the direction from which enlightenment came i thought so the cs lieutenant breathed a man does not shape the grand hailing sign by accident no doubt our forebears chose it for just that reason he knelt by leaming well brother i will do what i can for you where are you hit below the shoulder blade leaming answered i was shot from the top of the bluff so the minnie went down he had to gather himself again before asking could i have some water please of course the confederate said where all his comrades told leaming no or pretended not to hear him the man undid the tin canteen at his belt and held it to leamings mouth it was captured us issue with a pewter spout never had leaming tasted anything more delicious than the warm rather stale water that ran so sweetly down his throat thank you he said when the enemy officer took the canteen away he could hear how much more like himself he sounded with a wet whistle from the bottom of my heart friend thank you you are the good samaritan come again i doubt it i doubt it very much the reb said when we attacked this place i wanted to see every man jack in it lying dead at my feet youve got most of what you wanted leaming said prisoners were still carrying bodies off the slope and away from the riverside with the force we had and the positions we soon gained y all were mad to try to resist us the cs lieutenant told him bedford forrest had said the same thing when major bradford refused to surrender as things turned out the confederate general had a better notion of what was what than his federal opponent we might have held you out in spite of everything if you hadnt moved men forward while the flag of truce was flying leaming said we brought them up to warn off the steamer not to move against the fort the confederate lieutenant said sharply you could have protested at the time if you thought we were doing anything underhanded but you never said a word leaming bit his lip for that was true he wondered if the rebs anger would drive him away but it didnt the confederate went on lets get you taken care of if we can he straightened up from beside leaming and shouted two colored soldiers hurried over to him both were barefoot one wore only his drawers and undershirt what you need suh they asked together they spoke to the reb as respectfully as if to a us officer maybe they treated him like a master maybe they were just afraid he would order them killed if they got out of line even a littleand maybe they were right to be afraid that way the lieutenant pointed to leaming take him up to the top of the bluff be as gentle as you canhes got a nasty wound yes suh we do dat again the negroes spoke together one grabbed mack leamings legs the other the upper part of his body he groaned when they lifted him not because they were harsh but because he couldnt help himself up the steep slope he went he groaned whenever a negros foot came down on the ground he knew the blacks werent trying to be cruelon the contrary in fact but the slightest jolt made the long track the mini ball tore through his body cry out in torment tears ran down his cheeks he bit the inside of his lower lip till he tasted blood here you is suh we lay you down on the ground now said the black who had him by the shoulders leaming yelped like a dog hit by a wagon wheel when they did after lying still for a moment he sighed he still hurt but with a steady ache not the sudden fiery jolts hed known when they were moving him do you want some more water the confederate lieutenant asked oh please leaming said all right im going to lift your head up a little so you can drink easier leaming gasped when the reb did that but he couldnt deny it helped not nearly so much water dribbled down the side of his face and the smoothest whiskey in the world couldnt have done a better job of reviving him than that plain ordinary waterso he thought anyhow god bless you he said and held out his hand he was not surprised when the cs lieutenants grip matched his own they smiled at each other a sergeant commandeered the two negroes whod carried him up to the top of the bluff come on damn you he yelled dont stand there like lazy niggers even if you damn well are plenty of bodies to dispose of both blacks looked toward the lieutenant he just shrugged as if to say he was done with them off they went the sergeant wasnt wrong negro and white prisoners were carrying their comradesinarms corpses to the earthwork and throwing them into the ditch in front of itthe ditch that so dismally failed to keep out the confederates there is a man who is not quite dead yet said someone a white man by his voice put him down by the authority in the answer it had to come from a confederate officer if he dies in the night we can throw him in come morning and if hes still breathing at sunup well well worry about it then leaming started to say something to his fellow freemason only to discover the man no longer stood by his side he looked around where had the lieutenant gone leaming couldnt spot him was that his voice giving orders over by the sutlers stalls leaming thought so but couldnt be sure he also thought the other man might have done more for him might for instance have hunted up a surgeon to see to his wound but although still weak he no longer feared he would die right away his wound finally seemed to have stopped bleeding and he felt much better for the water the rebel lieutenant gave him hed been dry as the utah desert inside not far away a negro asked reckon this heres deep enough suh make it deeper if you please mack leaming blinked in astonishment that was major bradford sure as hell and he would have expected forrests troopers to kill bradford out of hand but the commandant went on i want to make sure the scavengers cant get at poor theo whatever you say suh the black man sounded resigned leaming heard first one spade then another bite into the ground dirt flew out and came down with wet smacking noises bill bradford still breathing leaming shook his head in amazement even though moving hurt bradford had done everything he could to make the rebs in west tennessee hate him so why was he still alive after they went on their killing rampage try as he would leaming couldnt fathom it the sun slid below the horizon dusk deepened toward darkness xiii matt ward looked at the hole in the ground in which major bradford was burying his brother by now it was deeper than the colored grave diggers were tall it looked blacker than they did too in the fading light it might have gone all the way down to china sure as hell theodorick bradford was getting the fanciest sendoff of any federal at fort pillow fancier than the confederate dead were getting too when ward glanced at theo bradfords body that thought crossed his mind again from somewhere bill bradford had come up with a cloth to wrap his brothers corpse oh the shroud was bloodstained here and there from the wounds the older man had taken but for that though he might have died of natural causes why dont you have some carpenters build him a coffin too ward asked sarcasm rolled off bradford like water off a ducks back that wont be necessary the us officer answered to the colored men roped in to help him he added i reckon youve got it deep enough i reckon we done got it deep enough a while ago now one of the negroes said both of them tossed their shovels out of the grave one black climbed out at a corner then reached into the hole to help his comrade out stick around bradford told them youll need to fill it in when im done here they looked at him they looked at the shovels and at their hands they looked at the grave theyd just dug neither of them said a word in their shoes not that they were wearing shoes ward wouldnt have either too easy to knock them over the head and toss them into the ditch outside the earthwork whatever happened to them they wouldnt get a grave like this one they wouldnt get much of a grave at all major bradford slid his brothers body into its final resting place as gently as he could then he pulled a small testament from the left breast pocket of his tunic almost everyone who carried a little bible carried it there in the hope that it would stop an almostspent mini ball once in a blue moon it did ministers preached sermons about the pocket testament that saved a life like everything that had to do with bill bradford right now the little book was soaked he opened it anyway and frowned too dark to read he said to ward would you get me a torch i aint your nigger you can go to the devil for all i care ward said indignantly you want a torch you can damn well get your own all right theni will bradford said he wouldnt have to go far to find one plenty of them burned as the confederates went on plundering fort pillow he came back a few minutes later carrying not only a torch but also a jug he set that down beside him and offered ward the torch would you be so kind as to hold it for me grudgingly ward nodded reckon i can do that much thank you kindly bradford went through the pocket testament with care muttering hope the pages arent too soggy and stuck together then he stopped and nodded here we are his voice grew solemn jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whomsoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this i believe matt ward murmured the colored soldiers said something too the words were probably as familiar to them as they were to him and to bill bradford ward thought bradford would let it go there but the federal read some other verses from the book of john i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture i am the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep i am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine as the father knoweth me even so i know the father and i lay down my life for the sheep therefore doth my father love me because i lay down my life that i might take it again no man taketh it from me but i lay it down of myself i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it again this commandment have i received of my father major bradford closed the pocket testament he looked at ward feeling something was called for the confederate trooper muttered amen one of the colored soldiers echoed him the other one said you shoulda been a preacherman major the words they jus come right on out im putting my brother in the ground bill bradford said i dont think i could talk like that for anybody else you want we should cover him over now the negro asked in a minute bradford answered theres another way to say goodbye to him too he picked up the jug it sloshed i managed to get my hands on this before anybody else did theo would have liked it this way he pulled out the cork raised the jug to his lips and took a pull ahh he handed the jug to matt ward here you go i thank you kindly ward remembered longing for whiskey early that morning had only a day gone by since then it seemed more like five years he swigged from the jug volcano juice ran down his throat whew he said when he could speak again thats strong stuff he started to give the jug back to bradford let the niggers have a knock too the federal officer suggested ward started to bristle at the idea but bradford quickly added theres plenty to go round and theyre doing the hard work well hell why not what ward had just drunk made him magnanimousor maybe too tipsy to argue he thrust the jug at the closer negro here go on much obliged suh the black man took the whiskey jug tilted it back and then passed it to his comrade mighty nice the potent stuff didnt faze him at all ward wondered if he had a castiron gullet when major bradford got the jug back from the second negro he wiped the mouth on his tunic before drinking from it again ward would have done the same thing he didnt want his mouth going where a blacks had gone before it werent federals all hot for nigger equality he wondered why bill bradford who acted like a southerner chose the other side before he could ask bradford passed him the jug ward didnt mind drinking right after another white man more tangleleg exploded in his stomach he looked at the negroes get to work now yes suh they said together they werent rash enough to ask for another pull at the whiskey jug for themselves they had to know they were lucky to get one they set to work with the shovels throwing the dirt theyd dug out back into the grave it thumped down on theodorick bradfords shrouded corpse he was a good man bill bradford said he was one of the best he nodded to matt ward you have a brother not that lived wards head spun when he shook itthat popskull was mean as the devil had one who died when we were both little i got me a couple of sisters and a big old raft of cousins he took another pull at the jug then offered it back to bradford thanks the federal officer raised it to his lips cousins are all right but theyre not the same you know what i mean he didnt seem like such a bad fellow once you talked with him for a while and once youd had enough whiskey to lubricate your brains a little like i told you i cant rightly say ward eyed bradford as well as he could by the torchlight flickering here and there now he asked his question what made you choose the wrong side anyways i dont reckon i did the tennessee tory replied stubborn even after disastrous defeat i believe in building things up not tearing them down the unions lasted eightyseven years now theres hardly a man alive who wasnt born under the stars and stripes why go and tear that to pieces on account of that damn lincoln wants to take our niggers away and tyrtyrtyrannize over us matt ward had to try three times before he could get the word out he didnt fire the first shotyou rebs did that at fort sumter and we could have made some kind of arrangement about the niggers weve had compromises before we could have found another one but jeff davis wanted to show what a big man he was and weve been shooting at each other ever since he trotted the arguments out smooth as you please ward remembered hearing he was a lawyer but he couldnt talk around one thing this here is a confederate state if you arent for the confederacy youre nothing but a dirty old traitor my loyalty is the old one ill stick to it major bradford looked down at his brothers grave if you ask me to love the cause that killed poor theo im afraid you ask too much quibble all you care to ward hefted his enfield you damn well lost and isnt that the sad and sorry truth bradford managed a mournful laugh he had no weapon but hefted the whiskey jug instead a sorrow i shall try to drown he drank you already look drowned ward told him let me have some more of that how can i say no to the victor go the spoils the federal officer surrendered the whiskey ward raised the jug and took a long pull then he took another one next thing he knew he was sitting on the ground he didnt know how hed got there the whiskey jug sat beside him though that was funny laughing he got up and drank some more bill bradford laughed too ward remembered that come on nathan bedford forrest shouted weve got to empty this place out and we dont have a whole lot of time he might have beenhe wasthe best cavalry general in the war he was proud that his men would throw themselves at the damnyankees sooner than risking his displeasure but even the mightiest man bumped up against the limits of his power forrests men had fought like fiends theyd licked the federals licked them and plundered them and slaughtered them now now they didnt want to do much more oh theyd taken the thirteenth tennessee cavalrys horses you could never have enough remounts and they would haul off the halfdozen guns theyd captured taking the enemys cannon was proof of your own triumph but bedford forrest tried again weve got all these supplies here weve got all these cartridges we need to haul em away nobody felt like listening to him his soldiers had grabbed what they wanted and what they needed as individuals right now he was the only one who seemed worried about grabbing what his ragtag army wanted and needed a lot of confederates had got into the whiskey the federals put out to nerve their men forrest was angry at himself for not laying hold of that as soon as his troops got into fort pillow he should have known better he had known better but he hung back to let his men have their way with the negroes and homemade yankees here now he was paying for it hey general somebody called his voice full of good cheer and tanglefoot look we brung you your horse they must have led the animal up the side of the bluff that surely took a lot of work and trouble if only they would put so much work and trouble into the things that really needed doing bedford forrest seethed the worst part was he had to make them think he was grateful thanks boys he said as he climbed into the saddle maybe getting up there would do some good a man on horseback was harder to ignore than a man on foot even a big loud man on foot forrest rode over a wounded black man he thought the fellow was dead but groans and a feeble effort to get away told him otherwise the horse snorted and sidestepped it was no more eager to step on a body live or otherwise than any other beast would have been down the slope toward the river a confederate who must have been talking to some vs prisoners said you damned rascals if you had not fought us so hard but had stopped when we sent in a flag of truce we would not have done anything to you we didnt reckon we could trust you came the reply probably from a negros throat how could you have done worse than you did the confederate replied kill all the niggers another confederate saidan officer by the authority in his voice a gunshot rang outa tongue of yellow fire stabbing out down there in the darkness somebody screamed no another officer shouted forrest says take them and carry them with him to wait on him and put them in jail and send them to their masters he was confused but he had the general idea forrest rode to the edge of the bluff and called yes i do say that theres been enough killing dammit a startled silence followed godalmightydamn that really is bedford forrest up there somebody said yes it is come on up and help take things out of the fort forrest said but then someone shouted for him from over near the sutlers stalls he started over there the animal hadnt taken more than three or four strides before more guns barked down by the mississippi a voice floated out of the night theres another dead nigger forrest swore softly he shook his head the men didnt want to heed him or the officers set directly over them what could you do the river had run with blood for two hundred yards when the slaughter was at its heightso someone had told him anyhow maybe that would demonstrate to the northern people that negro soldiers could not cope with southerners the horse walked over that colored artilleryman again his leg was all bloody and glistened in the flickering torchlight what is it forrest called to the lieutenant waving to him from the stalls sir i caught this man pilfering goods the young officer held a pistol on a middleaged man in civilian clothes well what do you need me for forrest said deal with him like he deserves i was not pilfering by god the man said i am hardy revelle he struck a pose that suggested bedford forrest was supposed to know who he was and what that meant forrest stared back stonily the civilian deflated somewhat i am a drygoods clerk for harris and company whose establishment this is and so forrest growled come to the point and make it snappy or youll be sorry after what ive seen today the murders in cold blood i am already sorry hardy revelle said but i am not pilfering for one thing this is my principals property so i have more right to it than he was likely going to say something like you thieving rebs but he thought better of it which was wise than you do he finished for another thing one of your captains already made me give him a pair of boots and then after i did that there captain took me to general mcculloughs headquarters hes colonel mcculloch forrest bore down hard on the last syllable of mccullochs name whoever he is thats where i went hardy revelle didnt care about the correction he went on his surgeon made me show him where the goods were and a lieutenant with him made off with a bridle and saddle and some bits and wait forrest interrupted again holding up a hand what is the name of colonel mccullochs surgeon hardy revelle frowned durrell no thats not right durrett he nodded there now i have it and the lieutenant was a big gawky fellow called hay bedford forrest nodded too for he was convinced f r durrett was the second missouri cavalrys regimental surgeon while j s hay was colonel mccullochs ordnance officer that left only one thing unexplained all right mr revelleyou got these things for the officers like you say i sure did hardy revelle might have been the very picture of righteousness well fine forrest sounded mildtill he suddenly pounced so what in blazes are you doing here all by your lonesome looks like pilfering to me by god no sir no sirree not me now the drygoods clerk shook his head i was just keeping things safe like sure you were forrest laughed tell me another one what do you want me to do with him sir the confederate lieutenant asked shall i give him what he deserves like you said he made as if to pull the pistols trigger hardy revelle quailed but forrest said no let him go for now these really are his goods to keep an eye on but if you catch him with his hands full later on bring him to me again and well see if i change my mind of course revelle was pilfering from his bosss stall but he did it with enough style to amuse the confederate general instead of angering him thank you kindly sir revelle said good to see an honest man can still make his way it is indeed when you find one let me know forrest told him hardy revelle scratched his head forrest laughed some more here came that damned horse again ben robinson couldnt do anything to get out of its way he had to lie there while bedford forrest rode over him for the thirdor was it the fourthtime forrest was telling somebody how he got rich trading niggers in memphis which wasnt exactly what the wounded black sergeant wanted to hear dont step on me he thought please dont the horse didnt it had missed him every single time if it got him wouldnt that be what they called adding insult to injury hed heard the phrase before but never understood it till now getting stepped on by a horse was insulting sure as hell and he was already injured if he had to get shot to grasp a subtlety of the english language he would just as soon have stayed ignorant the wound to his leg hurt worse than anything that had ever happened to him before it had finally stopped bleeding or at least slowed down but he didnt want to do a whole lot of moving around he was sure that would start it again of course with a gouge bitten out of his thigh he damn well couldnt do a whole lot of moving around and at that he was luckier than most he could have been screaming for his mother the way some horribly wounded soldier down by the mississippi was or he could have been dead the way so much of the federal garrison was every so often a new body would thud into the ditch beyond the rampart that hadnt helped he must have dozed off because he almost jumped out of his skin when somebody said heres another one of these goddamn nigger sons of bitches well you take his feet and ill take his head and well fling him in the ditch another reb said the buzzards and the pigs can squabble over who gets more meat off him and just what he deserves too please dont throw me in dat ditch robinson said i aint deadim only shot hell one of the confederates said at the same time as the other was going aw shit the first one added we can kill the bastard pretty damn quick he aint dead but hes sure shot it aint like he can fight back ben robinson got ready to try how he could fight when he couldnt even walk was beyond him but he aimed to give it his best shot maybe he could pull one of them down and then and then what he wondered then they shoot me or stick me thats what but he couldnt just let them murder him general forrest says weve killed enough of em for now the second reb said ben had never thought he would bless bedford forrests name but he did then the first trooper said something unflattering to his commanding officer but he said it in a low voice as if he didnt want forrest to have any chance of hearing it robinson wouldnt have wanted forrest to hear anything like that either the reb went on well what the devil shall we do with him then theres that hut over yonder not too far his friend answered we can tote him over there leave him for the night and kill him in the mornin nobodyll give a damn about it then chances are sounds like a pretty good scheme the first trooper said an opinion robinson didnt share lets do it they half carried half dragged him to the hut he bit his lip against the pain but didnt cry out he was damned if he wanted to show weakness in front of these white men his wound did start bleeding again he felt the warm blood trickling down his leg but there didnt seem to be that much of it if he could lie still for a bit he thought it would stop when the rebs got him inside they dropped him like a sack of potatoes he did groan thenhe couldnt help it so long nigger one of the troopers said they vanished into the night in spite of the torment from his wound ben robinson started to laugh whites reckoned blacks were stupid as often as not that meant whites thought they could talk around blacks as freely as if they were by themselves and thinking they could talk so freely made whites as stupid in truth as they thought blacks were we can put him in the hut well come back tomorrow and kill him did forrests troopers really imagine hed stick around once he heard that if they did they were dumb as rocks maybe they figured he was too badly hurt to move any which way theyd be mighty disappointed when morning came and they found their blackbird had flown the coop robinson still couldnt walk that didnt mean he couldnt move he wouldnt stick around here for anything not if he had to crawl on his belly like a reptile to get away and he damn near did he hitched himself along on his elbows and one knee theyd be raw and bloody before he got very far he didnt care hed be a lot bloodier if he didnt get out while the getting was good which way he wondered once he made it out of the hut up on top of the bluff the rebs were still doing whatever they wanted things seemed quieter down by the mississippi and if rescue ever came it would come by way of the river down then mosquitoes buzzed around him they came out at dusk theyd be worse a little further into spring but they were bad enough now he didnt care confederates with guns were worse than mosquitoes with pointy beaks when he went down the side of the bluff he went slowlyslowly even for a crawling man he could have rolled down the steep slope in nothing flat but he didnt know what hed fetch up against on the way to the bottom he wasnt in a hurry every minute farther away from the hut and those rebs felt as if it added another year to his life here and there wounded men groaned in the darkness once ben heard someone say oh shut the hell up you goddamn nigger son of a bitch bastard the noise that followed might have been a rock falling on a pumpkin from a tall roof it might have been but it wasnt it came again and again and again then the white man gruntedthe sort of animal noise he might have made as he spent himself inside a womanand said he aint makin any more noise another confederates voice floated out of the dusk you heard what lieutenant pennell said about killing people jack yeah i heard it so what jack answered thats pennell you gonna tell me a nigger in a yankee uniforms a person my ass a nigger in a yankee uniform is a snake is what he is an i kill snakes every chance i get and snakesll bite you too ben robinson thought he knew damn well hed killed and wounded his share more than his share of bedford forrests troopers both with the twelvepounder and in the melee after the rebs swarmed into fort pillow he knew plenty of other colored soldiers had too yes theyd lost but his fellow negroes hadnt fought any worse than the whites who battled alongside them the garrison was badly outnumbered and commanded by a major who wasnt fit to carry general forrests boots of course theyd lost if he lived if his leg healed up ben robinson was ready to take on the rebs again he hated the trooper whod just beaten a helpless black man to death he hated him yes but he understood him too if he got the chance hed bite the confederate states even harder next time ragged wisps of cloud scudded past the moon now hiding it now letting it shine down on fort pillow nearing first quarter it rode high in the sky a little west of south its pale light would have been better suited to a happier scene but bill bradford couldnt do anything about that his head spun he wasnt so steady on his feet as he wished he were hed had to drink a good deal of the vile whiskey he took from the sutlers stall hed had to drink a good deal yes but he drank a lot less than he pretended to he might be tiddly but he wasnt smashed the reb who was supposed to be keeping an eye on him on the other hand bradford eyed the young cavalry trooper the confederate was still on his feet all by itself that said he was a man of impressive capacity with so much redeye in him bradford knew he would have curled up asleep somewhere like a cat in front of a fire asleep the reb was not he was singing susannaloudly and out of tune in a voice most of an octave deeper than the one he used for ordinary speech if hed really had a banjo on his knee bradford would have plucked it off and broken it over his head then the trooper stopped he looked at bradford youre not singing he said as if hed noticed only now he probably had hed been caterwauling away himself for quite a while i just put my brother in the ground bradford said i dont feel like singing youre a lousy homemade yankee the reb said i bet you dont know how to shinguh sing i sing in the church choir bradford retorted that was true even if he hadnt done much of it lately well ladeda said the rebhis name was ward bradford remembered if you sing there you can sing here he wasnt too drunk to remember where his rifle musket lay you can sing or i can blow your fucking head off whod miss you bill bradford fought the fear that welled up in him your officers told you to keep me safe ward only laughed if i tell em you tried to run off nobodyll give a damn hell and breakfast theyll likely promote me you stupid son of a bitch dont you understand that everybody in this whole state wants you dead everybody in this whole state wants you dead bradford knew it was an exaggeration tennessee did have its share of union sympathizersnot enough to keep it from seceding but enough to make trouble for the confederate authorities even so the thirteenth tennessee cavalry us and other outfits like it were a long way from popular with their neighbors ward might be exaggerating but he wasnt lying i cant singit wouldnt be right bradford insisted you can if you drink some more in his own way the young reb was a practical man now he picked up the whiskey jug and thrust it at bradford here drink you lousy stinking bastard bradford dranksome then he put his tongue over the opening and pretended to swallow more that done he gave the jug back now you what you reckon i want to drink with a goddamn tennessee tory ward scowled at him then he seemed to scowl at himself but i drank with you already didnt i and i sure do want to drink by the way his adams apple worked he wasnt pretending to pour the rotgut down ahh he said and wiped his mouth on his sleeve thats the stuff all right bradford hoped he would forget why they were drinking but he didnt on a day full of defeats here was one more ward scowled again sing god damn you and so standing by his brothers grave william bradford sang susanna with a drunken confederate cavalry trooper who would sooner have shot him tears streamed down his face ward never noticed by god youll pay for thisyou and bedford forest and jeff davis too when the song was finally over ward looked at bradford well you can sing who wouldve thunk it you may be a lousy stinking bastard but you arent a lousy stinking lying bastard anyways im so glad you approve bradford murmured no doubt luckily for him that went right over the rebs head he gestured at the jug have another knock why dont you i will if you will ward said youve got to sing some more too youre pretty goddamn good all right he picked up the jug and swigged from it then passed it to bradford damn things almost dry and youre still on your feet goddammit i thought youd pass out on me right away do you have a hollow leg aloud bradford said i found that one i expect i can come up with another one if i need to he also drankagain less than he pretended to pretty soon the reb would have to fall asleep wouldnt he not yet sing he told bradford and launched into camptown ladies wincing nearly sobbing the federal officer joined in the tune was cheerful even joyous his mood was anything but another confederate soldier wandered over and joined in not too surprisingly he had a jug of his own he was a friendly sort and willing to share after a healthy snort ward sat down on the ground how come youre shtill shtanding he demanded of bradford his voice thick and slurred ive always had a good head on my shoulders bill bradford wondered why ward was still breathing let alone talking and making some sense the amount hed put away hed pay for it in the morning but bradford wanted him to pay sooner than that ward blinked now his eyes shining in the moonlight and shook his head you had a good head on your shoulders you wouldnt be a homemade yankee youd be on the right shide inshtead he yawned shook his head again as if annoyed at himself and then wagged a finger at bradford dont you go nowhere he warned but that was the end he slowly slumped to the ground and slept about time bill bradford breathed now he had a chance you there jenkins that sharp astringent voice could only belong to second lieutenant newsom pennell yes sir corporal jenkins fought to sound properly respectful it wasnt easy he didnt like pennell and it cut both ways jenkins belonged to company a and pennell to company f but the junior officer went out of his way to find things for him to do and came down on him hard when he didnt do them well enough to suit pennells persnickety tastes that was how it seemed to jack jenkins anyhow he never stopped to wonder how it seemed to the lieutenant pennell came up to him there by the riverbank the officer was almost too skinny to cast a shadow he had a narrow disapproving face and wore a little hairline mustache that made him look like a french fop jenkins was used to beards that were beards and mustaches that were mustaches not one that looked as if it were drawn on with a burnt match we need a better perimeter around the fort pennell declared how come sir jenkins asked in honest surprise we done took the place yes yes lieutenant pennell said impatiently we took it and now we have to make sure no one gets out of it i thought we took care of that pretty good jenkins said we shot most of the bastards in there the ones that aint dead aint goin anywhere quick he hefted his rifle musket even the moonlight was enough to show the grisly stains on the stock but lieutenant pennell ignored them as he ignored jenkinss comment i am going to send you out to the original line of defense around this place the one that general pillow laid out he said a certain somber glee in his voice you and your fellow pickets will stand watch through the night allowing no one to pass through unless a confederate soldier or provided with proper authorization is that clear whyd you pick on me jenkins didnt add you son of a bitch not where newsom pennell could hear it but he thought it very loudly when i saw you there i thought how useful an underofficer might be among the pickets pennell answered when you saw me standing here you reckoned youd land me with a crappy duty thats what it is jenkins thought thanks a hell of a lot sir he said youre welcome pennell either didnt notice the sarcasm jenkinss guess or refused to admit that he did now go take your place god only knows how many federals are trying to sneak away even as we speak god knows it aint very many but short of bashing in pennells brains with the gory rifle musket jenkins was stuck and he knew it with a martyred sigh he said yes sir he didnt salute as he stomped away from pennell if the lieutenant wanted to call him on it fine pennell said not a word even finding fort pillows outer works by moonlight wasnt easy he might never have done it had he not heard several other disgruntled pickets grousing with one another they gave the two stripes on his sleeve suspicious looksthey had to wonder if he was coming to make them act like proper soldiers but when he started discussing newsom pennells unsavory ancestry and inflammable destination they knew him for a fellow sufferer and relaxed one of them had a jug he was willing to share it leastways you brought a little something out of the fort another picket said mournfully me i didnt get no loot atall this shouldve been our chance another man said he drew on his pipe the glowing red coal in the bowl lit up the top of his face from beneath a strange almost hellish glow now were stuck out here and the othersre getting all the goodies jenkins already had some greenbacks and new shoes and now a knock of whiskey he didnt know what else he could expect to get but he joined in the grumbling anyway when the jug came around again he took another good swig thus fortified he found a place on the outer line that wasnt too close to anybody elses out in the darkness beyond a whippoorwill said its name jenkins said lieutenant pennells name loudly and foully nothing was going to happen out here this was all a waste of time here he was stuck ill pay you back for this pennell see if i dont he muttered xiv wherever the rebel officer who was a freemason had gone it didnt look as if he was coming back mack leaming lay where the two negroes who carried him up to the top of the bluff had left him he was chilly the gunshot wound pained him and gnawed at his vitality but he believed he would live maybe the water the reb gave him helped that much maybe his bleeding had stopped or maybe he was just tougher than he thought after first getting hit every so often a confederate would walk by and look him over seeing him barefoot and without his trousers each reb in turn would realize hed already been picked clean and go away a couple of them thought he was dead they wanted to put him on the pile of bodies not far away im still here leaming said when one of forrests troopers bent to take hold of his ankles the man jerked back in surpriseand if leaming was any judge in fear as well goddarnn he exclaimed for a second there i reckoned you was a dead man talkin to me not quite leaming answered im only a wounded prisoner he wanted to remind the reb that bedford forrest had taken prisoners just because he wasnt dead now that didnt mean the trooper couldnt kill him in a hurry gave me quite a turn the enemy soldier said do you have a canteen could i have some water please leaming asked perhaps because of the blood hed lost hed stayed thirsty even after the confederate freemasons kindness sorry i drank it dry myself during the fight unlike a lot of his comrades this rebel didnt sound actively hostile that encouraged leaming to say could you get me some water please would you be so good he watched forrests trooper think it over no i dont believe i would the reb said at last youre a homemade yankee a tennessee tory a damned renegade if you was standing here and i was laying there would you get me water i hope i would leaming said but he might as well have kept quiet for the other man went on i dont think so i expect youd give me a sermon instead and tell me how wonderful it was to lick abe lincolns boots and kiss a niggers ass i dont care to murder a helpless man but you get no help from me neither he walked off if i die because i get no water wont you have murdered me leaming thought but he did doubt he would die now he was alive and suffering and likely to go on suffering for quite a while the whitehot agony hed known after he first got shot was duller now but taking a mini ball still hurt much worse than anything else that had ever happened to himand hed had a toothache that kept him sleepless for two days and nights before a dentist finally did his bloody work a couple of white federalsprisoners of coursepaused to look at him isnt that lieutenant leaming one of them asked sure looks like him poor devil the other said so he got it too eh leaming opened and closed his right hand im not dead he said both men from the thirteenth tennessee cavalry us started as violently as the confederate trooper did a few minutes before jesus christ one exploded his laugh was shaky you gave us a hell of a jolt there lieutenant thats a fact the other agreed youre bill ryder leaming said to him the federal nodded leaming had to think about the other mans name and elmer haynes he got it at last what have the rebs done to you we been totin bodies haynes answered hell of a lot of em ryder added they took all the money i had too only good thing about that is i didnt have much im sorry they robbed me too leaming wished he hadnt had much money it was gone now into that thieving rebs pocket and his gold watch too he asked is there any place where theyre taking care of wounded federals the two troopers looked at each other slowly haynes said theyve got some of em down in the barracks we tried to burn this morning theyve got em there yeah bill ryder seemed content to comment on what haynes said theyve got em but i dont know what theyre doing for em dont know that theyre doing anything for em tell you the truth could you men carry me there leaming asked lying on a floor lying under a roof has to be better than this ryder and haynes looked at each other again they both sighed they both shrugged reckon we could haynes said resignedly one more toting jobwhat the hell you want the head end or the feet end elmer ryder said i had the head last time haynes said your turn for that be careful when you lift me mack leaming said as ryder stooped by him beaii he bit down hard but couldnt stifle the yip of anguish as the captured trooper picked him up where are you men going with that body a confederate officer demanded just throw it in the damn ditch not a body sirhes alive haynes spoke as respectfully to the reb as he would have to one of his own superiors leaming didnt like that but he was in no position to criticize haynes went on we were taking him down to the barracks to put him with the other wounded down there hes not so dumb leaming thought by reminding the confederate that other injured federals were in the barracks building haynes made this transfer seem routine sure enough the officer nodded all right go ahead but dont dawdle around still plenty of dead ones to get rid of we wont sir bill ryder sounded respectful too under that respect though leaming heard an old soldier talking ryder didnt intend to move one lick faster than he had to the confederate officer turned away ryder and haynes carried lieutenant leaming across a plank bridge over the ditch and then down the front of the bluff leaming shook his head in wonder though the motion made him hurt even more than he already did on account of the jolting journey was it only this afternoon that he walked down the same slope to parley with nathan bedford forrest it was even if it seemed a million years away just this afternoon i was spry as a bighorn he thought that didnt seem possible either he couldnt stand now if his life depended on it he wondered if he would ever be hale again he hoped so but had no notion of how bad his wound was he couldnt see it all he could do was suffer and he was doing plenty of that i do believe id sell my soul for a few drops of laudanum he said we aint got any lieutenant elmer haynes said ryder nodded haynes added maybe one of the rebs surgeons can fix you up maybe leaming didnt believe it for one thing the confederates were always desperately short of everything except guns and ammunition and powder they never ran low on those damn them for another forrests men with the exception of that one freemason seemed unwilling to help federals in any way surgeons were supposed to treat men from both sides but leaming wondered whether a physician who served this set of rebs would meet the obligation it turned out not to matter when the two prisoners set him down on the floor in one of the barracks halls there was no sign of any surgeon union or confederate the building was full of wounded men some badly hurt others less so good luck lieutenant for once bill ryder spoke first he and haynes vanished into the dusk a couple of candles illuminated what looked like an engraving of one of the lower circles of hell in the divine comedy soldiers writhed and thrashed and groaned one man had lost an arm two others were missing legs they needed laudanum much worse than mack leaming did and they had none nobody had anything no water no food no medicine no surgeons no attendants all they had were one another and their shared torment leaming wondered if he would have been better off where he was it was quieter up on top of the bluff even if it was colder and wetter he might have had a better chance of falling asleep mother sobbed one of the men whod lost a leg mother help me mother no doubt she would have if she could but she was somewhere far away and all she could have done might not have been enough for her maimed son water someone else called no one heeded that prayer either if the wounded federals won longer lives for themselves they would have to do it each man on his own as ben robinson lay by the mississippi he wondered how big a fool hed been to come back down to the river confederates prowled the riverbank looking for federals who were still alive any live men they found quickly died robinson heard only a couple of shots those drew irate yells from secesh officers who were trying to bring their troops back under control most of the prowlers used knife or bayonet or rifle butt which made less noise a couple of rebs walked past ben one of them said will you look at that dead nigger eb son of a bitch was a sergeanta nigger sergeant you ever imagine there was such a thing in all the history of the world before reckon not eb said solemnly like any nigger can tell somebody else what to do well this bastard got what he deserved youd best believe it the other trooper said we taught the whole world a lesson here today we did bet your ass eb said the damnyankees reckoned niggers and a bunch of goddamn tennessee renegades could whip real white men honest abe damn well better do himself some more reckoning by god honest abe he spat in vast contempt they wont never lick us not if we have to fight em the next hundred years his friend said aint nobody never gonna tell me no niggers as good as i am just on account of abe lincoln looks like an ape himself thats how come he loves them black gorillas so much expect youre right eb spat again they walked on ben robinson didnt breathe more than tiny little sips of air till he could hear their footfalls no more he already knew how southern whites felt about negroes if they didnt feel that way would they have bought and sold him and the more whites in the csa swore at abraham lincoln the more they convinced blacks he was the answer to their prayers lincoln wasnt even on the ballot in most southern states but if robinson could have voted me vote the more he thought about the idea the better he liked it if he was a free man shouldnt he be able to do everything free men did he didnt have his letters but so what plenty of white men didnt have their letters either but that didnt stop them from voting and maybe he could learn free men could go to school after all teaching them to read and write wasnt a crime the way it was with slaves in south carolina then another cloud passed in front of the moon darkness poured down on the riverside new fears filled ben robinsonnew and at the same time ancient far more ancient than the simple fear of having bedford forrests troopers smash in his head darkness was the time of witches and ghosts and hants and he lay here helpless unable to get away white men talked about believing in hants and all the other terrible things that prowled the darkness white men talked about it but they didnt really do it not down deep not where it really mattered ben did he believed in his belly in his balls something just out of sight always lay in wait in the dark ready to reach out and grab to terrify to possess to frighten to death how many people died all of a sudden without a mark on them without a sign of sickness too many far too many if a conjure woman didnt spell them into the grave if a hant didnt drag them down into it why werent they still alive who could answer a question like that nobody something buzzed past bens ear maybe it was only a mosquito yes maybe but did a mosquito really sound just like that robinson didnt think so it might be a hant waiting for him to fall asleep or just to let his attention lapse go way go way bad thing those quietly desperate words didnt spring from bens throat but from that of some other negro not far away he wasnt the only black man with night terrors then oddly the other mans fear helped ease his he realized he wasnt alone if a hant did try to grab him somebody might come to his rescue and a lower part of his mind added if he wasnt alone out here the hant or the ghost or the witch might decide to torment somebody else the moon came out from behind a cloud pale cool light spilled across the land the moons reflection shattered and rippled a thousand thousand times by the current danced on the river moonlight was better than darkness wasnt it or did it give the things still lurking in black shadow the chance they needed to find a victim he didnt know he was only a man a frightened wounded painfilled man daybreak just past seemed much further away than the moon the things hed done since then the things hed seen the things hed lived through and the things so many of his comrades hadnt lived through would he live to see the sun rise tomorrow that seemed even more distant than the dawn that was shattered by confederate gunfire if he reached it he promised he would praise the lord a lot of people must have made a lot of promises while the fighting in fort pillow raged a lot of the people who made those promises were dead now more than a few of them shot trying to surrender what did that mean were the men whod made those fancy promises and then died hypocrites and sinners or did god listen to the confederates instead no doubt theyd been praying and promising too most of them were alive and well and enjoying the spoils of victory did that mean god was on their side but they were losing the war if they werent the federals wouldnt hold memphis the united states wouldnt have held fort pillow what did it all mean the more you looked at it the less sense it made robinson thought of himself as a good christian man how could god favor people who wanted to keep him in bondage but hed seen enough to know that forrests troopers honestly couldnt imagine god favoring someone with black skin at their expense as a good christian man he shouldnt have feared hants and ghosts and witches if he followed the lord how could they hurt him he didnt suppose they could have if his soul were stainless but he knew all the bad things hed done and knew how many of them there were maybe god would let a hant grab him to pay him back for all his sins how could you know you couldnt and so he lay shivering knowing how long this night would be major bill bradford looked down at matt ward who lay snoring and curled up like a dog beside his brothers grave ward had one protective arm flung over his rifle musket but bradford didnt think the cavalry trooper would notice if someone lifted it he didnt think ward would notice if a cannon went off beside his head the reb had finally drunk himself blind took you long enough you son of a bitch bradford muttered he wanted to kick ward in the face but didnt have the nerve the man might wake up in spite of all the rotgut hed guzzled or someone might see or bradford had no trouble finding reasons not to dare the most important one was he wanted escape even more than vengeance no one was paying any attention to him now if he couldnt seize this moment and disappear he feared he would never get another chance he feared that said it all the sport the confederates had with him after fort pillow fell the bullets lashing into the mississippi all around him he didnt trust any offer of safety from nathan bedford forrest and his officers it was as simple as that his parole better to get away now and renew the fight another time than to stay a prisoner and suffer an unfortunate accident he was sure that was how bedford forrest would mention it in his reportsif forrest bothered to mention it at all quick furtive glances to the right and left convinced bradford nobody was watching him even so he couldnt just walk away not in the soakingwet uniform of a major of the vs cavalry as casually as he could as casually as if he had every right in the world to do so bradford strolled toward the sutlers stalls the rebs were still ransacking some of them others though were dark and quiet which probably meant theyd been picked clean or theyd been picked clean of what the confederates thought of as plunder anyhow bradford smiled thinly right this minute he was easier to please than bedford forrests troopers looking around again to make sure he went unnoticed he ducked into one of the dark deserted stalls he went behind the counter and felt around there nothing he swore under his breath why couldnt this be easy why couldnt anything be easy farther back in the stall was the nasty little room where the sutler slept bradford wrinkled his nose against the stench when he went in theredidnt the man ever wash he found what he needed though civilianstyle trousers and shirt they too reeked powerfully of their former owner which might have been why no confederate lifted them bradford couldnt afford to be fussy he took off his own soggy pants and the ninebuttoned tunic that made him so proud then put on the sutlers clothes they were big and baggy on him the sutler must have been a larger man but better too big than too small if he cinched the belt up tight the trousers wouldnt fall down which was all that really mattered he started to go but then abruptly stopped himself good god he exclaimed i almost forgot about my hat it was still wet too but that wouldnt show he pulled off the feather the gold cord with the acorn finials that marked an officer and the crossedswords cavalry badge that done he set it back on his head now it would pass for an ordinary civilian slouch hat if he hadnt fixed it though it would have betrayed him as soon as the first reb got a good look at it out of the stall he went as fast as he could fort pillow always smelled as if several hundred men had been living in it for weeks and they had but the air outside seemed sweet as nectar beside what he had been breathing a confederate sergeant walked past him his heart leaped into his throat but the reb strode by without a second glance bill bradford smiled the confederates didnt necessarily recognize him then they recognized a us major if a frowzy civilian tried to leave fort pillow why should they care no reason in the world logic might tell him that was so but how far could he trust logic if anything went wrong he was dead yes and if you hang around here youre dead too he reminded himself not all confederates recognized him but some assuredly did and he was violating the parole hed given colonel mcculloch and general forrest if he was going to do that he couldnt very well do it halfway out of here then he hadnt gone more than a dozen paces toward the rampart that had proved so useless before somebody called hey you yes you in the dirty shirt where in blazes you reckon youre going ice in his belly bradford stopped and turned a young officiouslooking cs lieutenant bustled up to him waiting importantly for his answer you people already went and cleaned me out he said in surly tones staring down at his shoes so the reb wouldnt get a good look at his face aint much point to sticking around not when i got nothin left to sell youre a civilian the lieutenant asked dont look like no soldier do i bradford said technically as the lawyers side of his mind noted that wasnt a lie it also wasnt a direct answer to the question that wasnt the reason it didnt satisfy the rebel officer you werent shooting at us earlier today some of the sutlers had picked up springfields and joined fort pillows garrison much good it did them as for bradford he shook his head not me he said im a whatdoyoucallita noncombatant thats the word as soon as he spoke he started to worry an attorney would know that term but would a sutler yeah sure you are the confederate jeered but then he shook his head what else are you going to say i cant prove youre a liar so get the hell out of here thank you kindly sir bradford said the lieutenant just gestured impatiently touching one finger to the brim of his hat in what wasnt quite a salute bradford hurried away he kept looking down at the muddy ground as if to avoid stepping into a puddle or tripping over a corpse and he didnt want to do either of those things but most of all he didnt want to be recognized if the rebs should catch him now in civilian clothes violating his parole whatever happened to him after that they could claim he deserved it come on you men what are you standing around for the loud angry voice that split the night made bill bradford flinch as if the cat o nine tails had come down on his back there stood nathan bedford forrest himself not twenty feet away still trying to get work out of his men at a time when almost any victorious officer would have let them relax and savor what theyd done if he turned around and saw bradford everything came to pieces but he didnt someone said sir weve found some more crates of cartridges over here have you by god forrest sounded delighted well bring em away with us cant very well fight a war without minnies lets see what you got despite a limp his long legs ate up the ground as he strode over to look at his mens latest prize and bill bradford scurried across the plank bridge the confederates had thrown across the ditch outside the rampart how many federals white and black lay in the ditch waiting for somebody to shovel dirt over them i spared theo that fate anyhow bradford thought he wont lie in a mass grave with a nigger on top of him someone groaned bradfords blood ran cold again he thought the sound came from the ditch below him though he couldnt be sure if the rebs set prisoners to burying those bodies would they be burying some men alive he would never know his shoes stopped reverberating on the planks they thumped on the dirt beyond he blew out a great sigh of relief now that hed made it this far the rebs were much less likely to know him even if they saw him and they were much less likely to see himtorches out here were few and far between for the first time since theodorick fell he began to hope he might get away he might yet live to avenge his brother as quickly and quietly as he could he headed away from the bluff and out toward gideon pillows longabandoned first perimeter corporal jack jenkins hated everything and everybody hed always hated homemade yankees and runaway slaves who thought they were soldiers hed fed the fires of that hatred today fed them and slaked them at the same time he didnt know how many men hed killed in the fight for fort pillow he did know the number wasnt small and he knew one more man he wouldnt mind killing lieutenant newsom pennell the miserable nogood son of a bitch whod exiled him here napoleon on whatever the name of his island was couldnt have been in a more miserable more godforsaken spot did napoleon have to worry about muddy boots and owls hooting like mournful ghosts in the tall trees jenkins didnt think so he wanted to wander off and see if that other sentry had some more popskull in his canteen and he wanted to curl up right where he was and go to sleep only one thing held him back animal fear of nathan bedford forrest if he broke regulations and something bad happened and forrest found out about it he shuddered he didnt want to think about that and so he held his ground certain he was holding it needlessly who would come out of the dark from the torchlit bluff by the river his own forces had a road or at least a path they were using and it took them nowhere near him that was all right he didnt much want to see anybody as for prisoners they would have to be lunatics to try to get away theyd managed to get captured by men who would rather have killed them why would they risk that now if they had any sense they would be on their knees thanking god for every breath they took and then just when a yawn stretched and wriggled and looked around to see if it was safe to come out he heard soft quick footsteps coming his way his hands tightened on his rifle musket so somebody was trying to sneak by after all was he ill fix the bastard jenkins thought there he was in the moonlightsome skulking shitheel with his hat pulled down low halt jenkins called who goes there the footsteps stopped the man looked wildly this way and that trying to see where the voice was coming from he couldnt jenkins stood in deep shadow the corporal wondered if he would have some more shooting to do after all if that fellow started to run hed never make another mistake afterwards he must have realized the same thing because he stayed where he was my names uh virgil simms he said shakily i was a sutler at the fort they said i could go so im getting out of here before they change their mind whos they jenkins demanded one of your officersi think he was a lieutenant the sutler said i didnt ask what the devil his name was i just went well simms advance and be recognized the automatic military phrases fell naturally from jack jenkinss lips he heard virgil simmss breath catch slowly and reluctantly the other man came forward he got within about fifteen feet of jenkins before he stopped and said where are you i cant see you jenkins stepped out into the light the sutler gasped again jenkins brandished his rifle musket enjoying the way the cold pale moonbeams glittered off the bayonets polished steel by the way virgil simms gulped he didnt enjoy it one bit you can see me now by god jenkins said come on over here and let me get a look at you even when simms did jenkins couldnt see much the brim of the sutlers slouch had shadowed his face his clothes didnt fit him very well but jenkinss clothes didnt fit him very well either his nose wrinkled simms was long overdue for a bath wonder if i ought to take you back to that lieutenant jenkins said musingly whatever you want to do the sutler didnt sound very happy then again jenkins wouldnt have been happy hearing that either after a moment simms went on long way back in the dark i almost broke my neck a couple times getting this far yeah jenkins had tripped and almost fallen two or three times coming out to take his sentrys post he didnt really want to go back to fort pillow again hed just thrown out the words to see if he could rattle virgil simmss cage hell with it he muttered and then spoke louder all right pass on reckon you wont be dumb enough to go on selling shit to the goddamn federals from here on out not me simms held up his right hand as if taking an oath i have plumb learned my lesson jenkins gestured with his rifle musket get the hell out of here then the sutler touched a finger to the brim of his hat he walked out past the old perimeter to fort pillow and hadnt gone more than a few paces before a cloud passed in front of the moon darkness swooped down on the world by the time the moon came out again simms had disappeared into the woods beyond the fort jenkins ducked back into his shadow and waited to see if anyone else would come along what time is it getting to be nathan bedford forrest asked captain anderson pulled out his pocket watch sir its getting close to eight he said thanks thats about what i reckoned from the moon forrest said where in blazes is that damned major bradford then how long does he need to bury his blasted brother his brother was blasted by god black bob mcculloch said pausing to scratch at his thick dark beard the brigade commander went on captain bradford whatever the hell his name was theodorick anderson said helpfully i knew he had some kind of damnfool handle mcculloch said his brother the major had him signaling down to the new era when we broke into the fort theowhatever took three or four minnies all at once he died quick anyway and hes getting buried slow forrest growled either bill bradfords taking his own sweet time or hes gone and flown the coop on us if he has we better not catch him again mcculloch tilted back his head and slashed a thumb across his throat well we wont find out standing around gabbing about it lets go look forrest drummed the fingers of his left hand against his thigh i felt sorry for the man even if he is a tennessee tory on account of i know what hes goin through but if he went and took advantage of me after that those fingers drummed some more ominously and of me colonel robert mcculloch added im the man whos holding his parole if he ran off his big hands folded into fists come on forrest said his precious theo was laying over here somewheres he didnt need much prowling before he found a freshly dug grave next to it he found a cavalry trooper sound asleepor rather drunk and passed out for he stank of whiskey there was no sign of major william bradford forrest started to kick the trooper right where it would do the most good before he could bring his booted foot forward captain anderson said what do you want to bet bradford fed him all the tanglefoot he could hold and a little more besides forrest left the kick undelivered i bet youre right dammit hell of course you are he said angry at himself now we knew all along he was a sneaky son of a bitch we should have watched him closer easy enough for him to make one private act the fool and then take off he drank whiskey himself only rarely for medicinal purposes he knew what it did to a man who liked it too well colonel mcculloch bent down and shook the trooper come on ward wake up he said the cavalryman wardmuttered and stirred slowly his eyes came open wahsh up he asked blearily thats what we want to find out forrest said where the devils bradford ward looked around his eyes fixed on the grave for a moment but even in his fuddled state he realized the man in it was the wrong bradford theodorick wasnt missing nor would he ever be no matter how plastered ward was he took nathan bedford forrest seriously anyone who didnt made a dreadful mistake sir he wahshwasright here the young cavalryman looked around in obvious even if sozzled confusion i dont know where he couldve gone or how he couldve gone anywhere he was drinking as much as me honest to god he was he hiccuped his words puzzled forrest the nearteetotaler they didnt puzzle black bob mcculloch jesus wept the colonel burst out thats the oldest trick in the world make like youre drinking only dont swallowmore likely dont even let it get into your mouth at all oh bedford forrests voice held a grim rumble oh ward by contrast sounded horrified i reckon i messed up i reckon you did mcculloch agreed he turned to forrest what shall we do with him sir hes one of mine the blame lands on me let it go forrest answered he didnt know bradford was a snake in the grass and the reptile he pronounced it reptile went and hornswoggled him way hell feel come morning thatll make sure he remembers he got took maybe we should have had another tennessean watching bradford not a man from missouri charles anderson said anybody from this state would have had a better notion of what the man is like we all got fooled forrest said every last one of us did by god i felt sorry for bradford on account of i lost my brother too colonel mcculloch trusted him enough to accept his parole that sneaky goddamn note he sent out this afternoon should have warned the lot of us your demand does not produce the desired effect he made a horrible face anybody who could write anything like that he shows you cant trust him from the gitgo i fed the man colonel mcculloch sounded disgusted with himself i offered him a place to sleep in my own tent im lucky he didnt cut my throat in the night i reckon wouldnt be surprised bedford forrest nodded he mightve done it if he didnt get loose this way instead a reptile like i say private ward sat on the ground with his head in his hands by the way he looked he already felt bad he wouldnt need to wait till morning i didnt mean to let him get away he saidby the wonder in his voice he was talking more to himself than to the officers standing over him what you mean is one thing what happens is something else forrest said not unkindly now weve got to deal with that sure as hell bradfords got away from fort pillow whatll he do next wherell he go memphis colonel mcculloch and captain anderson said the same thing at the same time nathan bedford forrest nodded again memphis was the great federal bastion in western tennessee the united states had taken the city early in the war and hung on to it ever since any union sympathizer in these parts would head that way what are our chances of catching him how well does he know the country anderson asked in return pretty well hes from these parts forrest said unhappily he tried to look on the bright side of things still and all aint but one of him and theres lots of us now that we know hes loose weve got a chance of running him down hell be sorry when we do black bob mcculloch didnt say if bedford forrest smiled he liked men like that had william bradford seen that smile he would have run even faster than he was running well maybe he would see it before too long noforrest took his cue from mcculloch bradford would see that smile and soon and no maybes to it xv after corporal jack jenkins let the sutler pass he figured his excitement was over for the night for a couple of hours he was right the moon sank toward the mississippi jenkins yawned several times he didnt lie down he didnt even squat he didnt dozenot quite anyhow but hed ridden through the previous night and fought a battle the day before he wasnt at his brightest and most alert he didnt think he needed to be he yawned again wider than ever when the moon set darkness came down a veil of black so thick he could hardly see his hand in front of his face but he had no trouble picking out the party of horsemen who rode out from fort pillow torches in hand one of those riders was conspicuously bigger than the rest if that wasnt bedford forrest jenkins would have been surprised and if that was forrest then what then somethings gone wrong somewhere jenkins thought never imagining that whatever had gone wrong had anything to do with him the riders went along the bank of coal creek till they came to the northernmost sentry along fort pillows old outer perimeter then they started working their way south toward jenkins as they drew closer he could hear them talking with the sentries but couldnt make out what they were saying they headed his way whatever they were looking for they hadnt found it yet he showed he was awake and alert by calling halt who goes there as if he wondered a dry chuckle came from forrest im your commanding general by god advance and be recognized sir jenkins said here i am forrest and his aides slowly rode forward he held up his torch so that it shone on his face well soldier dyou recognize me uh yes sir jenkins answered hastily who are you cant quite make you out in the darkness forrest said jack jenkins sir corporal in the second tennessee cavalry colonel barteaus regiment forrest laughed again i know who that regiment belongs to youd best believe i do you were over by coal creek before ive got a question for you corporal did you let anybody anybody at all past you since you came on duty yes sir one sutler jenkins said the officers with bedford forrest all exclaimed he held up a hand for quiet as usual he got what he wanted when was this what did the fellow look like hour and a half agomaybe two hours jenkins said forrests aides exclaimed again in dismay a couple of them swore jenkins went on couldnt hardly see himhe had his hat pulled down kind of low he sure smelled bad though ill tell you that i bet he did forrest said i dont think he was a sutler at all i reckon you let a polecat get through major bradford broke his parole and hes nowhere around bradford jenkins said that was bradford god damn it to hell if i knew it was him idve got some more blood on my piece he held up the rifle musket which he still hadnt cleaned dont know for sure yet but thats the way it looks forrest eyed not the ghastly weapon but jack jenkins himself whyd you pass him through he said an officer inside fort pillow told him he could go jenkins answered uneasily if his own officers wanted to they could blame him for letting the federal get away and what theyd do to him if they did trying not to think about that he went on he just seemed like a noaccount fellow and i never reckoned a major could stink like that neither he got a laugh out of bedford forrest but only a sour one oh youd be amazed the general said he turned to the men whod ridden out with him any point to beating the bushes for the son of a bitch not till morning sir one of them answered a million places he could hide in the dark if we didnt trip over him wed never know he was there about what i figured myself forrest muttered under his breath i was hoping youd tell me i was wrong dammit jenkins listened to the mounted men with only half an ear bill bradford he muttered i had bill bradford in front of me and he slipped through my fingers shit bradford wasnt the worst thorn in the side of west tennessee confederates that dishonor went to colonel fielding hurst whod been in business longer but it wasnt for lack of effort on the majors part i couldve been a hero jenkins thought angry at himself and even angrier at bradford for fooling him killing ordinary tennessee tories and smashing in niggers heads was all very well but he would have traded the lot of them for bill bradford how many men would have pounded him on the back how many would have plied him with cigars and whiskey when word got out how many pretty women would have smiled at him to show their gratitude or maybe more than smiled shit he said again we have men down in the south said one of the officers with forrest oh yes i know the general commanding said still and all i dont much care to have to count on somebody else not when he shouldnt have got loose in the first place im sorry sir jenkins said im sorriern i know how to tell you he was nothing if not sincere had he had the faintest notion who bradford was the homemade yankees body would lie at his feet in that case bedford forrest would be congratulating him the way things were the way things were jenkins didnt want to meet forrests eye forrest muttered under his breath then sighed well corporal youre not the only man who messed things up he said bradford poured spirits into the soldier who was guarding him till the fellow passed out and he likely did fool an officer or two else he wouldnt have got out of the fort he was dressed like a sutler you say yes sir jenkins said in ordinary clothes anyway not in uniform i bet he wasnt in uniform bedford forrest said he took a dip in the mississippi trying to get away from our boys and came out soaked to the skin bastard looked like a drowned rat one of the other horsemen said hes a rat all right jenkins said hes a rat out of the trap dammit forrest said we just have to go on thats all he swung his horse back toward fort pillow his companions followed watching them go jack jenkins sighed in relief forrest hadnt pounded his head against a rock but if bill bradford got away jenkins would be pounding his own head for the rest of his life confederate troopers loaded springfield after springfield into a couple of wagons nathan bedford forrest smiled as he watched the work this is more like it he said lets get these taken care of and then lets get the hell out of here how many did we capture about sir answered captain anderson who as usual had the numbers at his fingertips he paused significantly we brought up of themthat figure is exact sirfrom alongside the mississippi well i cant tell you im very surprised forrest said half the garrison went down there did it more or less yes sir anderson gave him a quizzical look forrest looked back bland as butter he knew what his aidedecamp was thinking how could he cipher out a problem like that when hed had so little book learning forrest let charles anderson go right on chewing on it being such a precise fellow anderson would no doubt picture him doing a formal longdivision problem inside his head forrest could no more do formal long division than he could fly but that didnt mean he was foolish about numbers about federals had held fort pillow half of six was three you didnt need to be any kind of scholar to see that and was close to nothing complicated about itunless you tried to make it that way he found a different question where are the rest of the federals guns they threw some of them in the river sir captain anderson answered a few will have stopped bullets or had their stocks smashed or otherwise become unserviceable and i suspect a good many of our men have ah informally appropriated weapons that took their fancy well i suspect youre right about that forrest allowed our boys are firstrate foragersand they need to be dammit when we have our own country and we chase the damn yankees out of it well be able to make everything we need for ourselves anderson said we have the wealth and we have the toolsor we can get what we need from abroad anyhow and we have men who can use them as they need to be used bedford forrest frowned he was so much a part of the war and the war so much a part of him that he hardly thought about what might come afterwards when he did he feared the confederacy could not hope to win thered been a last bright spot in the west at the end of the past summer when braxton bragg beat rosecrans at chickamauga if the confederates could have destroyed rosecranss army if they could have retaken chattanooga but they hadnt and they never would now the yankees got their revenge at missionary ridge shattering braggs army andtoo late forcing him from his command when the spring campaigning season started which it soon would the confederates wouldnt be pushing north the federals would be driving south instead could joe johnston stop them this side of atlanta if he couldnt the war here was lost he was a good defensive fighter no man better but was he good enough forrest had his doubts and if johnston lost if robert e lee lost in virginia what was left for the csa forrest saw only one thing retreating to the mountains and the woods and the swamps and bushwhacking the damnyankees till they got sick of trying to hold down a countryside that hated them and went home that might take five years it might take ten it might take fifty forrest faced the idea without enormous enthusiasm but also without fear if that was what wanted doing the south could do it the only trouble was it left little room for captain andersons peaceful confederacy acquiring the tools it needed to get free of imported goods forrest shrugged that might come one of these days he didnt think it would come any time soon no matter what his clever aidedecamp believed he intended to fight as long as the rest of the confederate states didand longer if he had to if he had no great faith in a confederate triumph in the end what difference did that make he couldnt fight the whole war only his own little piece of it today hed done that well have we taken everything we can from this place he asked anderson i believe we have sir the other officer replied then lets clear out forrest said sure as the devil well have more yankee gunboats calling on us come morning and maybe troopships with em we havent got enough men to hold the outer line of this fort and the inner lines not worth holding i can see that by god even if major bradford couldnt were ready anderson said i expect youll want to leave some pickets behind i surely will forrest nodded theyll warn us when the federals do come around and theyll help keep the stinking scavengers away he and anderson exchanged glances filled with distaste not all men who carried guns in this debatable land fought for the confederate states or the united states quite a few fought for themselves and nobody else once the armies moved on the jackals and hyenas moved in stealing whatever got left behind and slitting throats when they came upon men they didnt care for they were impossible to put down completely most of the time they looked and acted like anybody else like farmers or tradesmen going about their lawful business but when the sun went down they picked up shotguns or rifle muskets and rode out to raid some inclined to one side some to the other some to neither the federals in memphis and nashville hated them all forrest liked them very little better himself well he said lets go matt ward poured down one cup of black coffee after another it made him feel like a wideawake drunk he was paying for letting bill bradford slip away he was paying in all kinds of ways his head pounded he knew the hangover would get worse later but it was bad enough now and he had the joy of realizing bradford had played him for a fool if i could shoot him now but however tempting that thought was he shoved it aside if he fired his enfield now he feared his brains would blowout through his ears you awake ward a second lieutenant from the second missouri cavalry cs named tom bottom sounded as if he would do something dreadful if he didnt get the answer he wanted yes sir ward sighed he knew hed let himself in for this that made him put up with it but didnt make him enjoy it youd better be bottom growled ill come round again pretty damn quick to make sure you stay that way yes sir matt ward repeated bottom was one of the handful of officers left behind with the pickets now that most of the confederate force had pulled out of fort pillow he was acting as if that made him something altogether grander than a miserable second lieutenant were things otherwise ward would have called him on it with his headache and with his even more painful knowledge of his own failure he kept quiet not everybody whod stayed behind by the fort was so constrained yeah im awake you whistleass peckerhead another trooper rasped are you whats your name bottom said furiously ill put you on report my name is stonewall jackson and you can do whatever you damn well please but you better not turn your back on your own men if you try it had bottom had more nerve he might have arrested the mocking soldier he didnt he just walked on maybe the mans threat unnerved him everybody heard stories about unpopular officers shot by the soldiers they commanded ward had no idea how many of them were trueprobably not many if tom bottom didnt want to take a chance on this one though who could blame him bottom wasnt a coward hed fought well enough in the fall of fort pillow but he wasnt a fool either as for ward he stayed on his feet and kept his rifle musket on his right shoulder the lieutenant couldnt complain as long as he went on doing that his headache got worse as the night wore along and then worse still he wished for a hair of the dog that bit him that might ease the pain but he didnt ask if any of the other pickets had a jolt in his canteen if lieutenant bottom caught him doing that the lieutenant would start roaring at him and he would deserve it and word might get back to bedford forrest forrest had gone easy on him for letting major bradford escape but if the general commanding got the notion he was a drunk he didnt know just what would happen then and he didnt want to find out either it wouldnt be pretty he was only too sure of that here and there down by the mississippi wounded federals still groaned ward couldnt tell whether they were white or colored all wounded men sounded pretty much the same some of them would be dead by the time the sun came up others if the federals sent gunboats up to fort pillow soon enough they might be able to take away the survivors gunboats ward muttered he shivered though the night was mild enough with the blood throbbing inside his sodden brain every time his heart beat he didnt want to think about cannon going off if a shell burst close by he feared his head would fall off regardless of whether any fragments struck him the moon sank toward the western horizon even its light seemed uncommonly bright which told him how badly hung over he was when the sun came up he wondered if he would bleed to death through his eyes are you still with us lieutenant bottom tried to sneak up on him matt ward thought about coming back with a smart answer the way stonewall jackson hadthe way he would have himself had he felt better but his headache wasnt the only thing that held him back he had yet to earn the right to do that again and lieutenant bottom did have the rightindeed the dutyto check up on him feeling uncommonly small ward said yes sir im still here good bottom nodded and walked on toward the next picket was it ward rubbed his throbbing temples which didnt help much if he felt this bad now how much worse would he be come morning he tried not to think about that but a long miserable night loomed ahead a horse a horse my kingdom for a horse bill bradford remembered some ranting fool of a shakespearean actor bellowing out the line when a traveling company put on richard iii in memphis the actor would have done best on a horse that usually pulled brewery wagons for he was built like a beer barrel himself but the cry the anguished cry bradford felt the truth of that felt it in his very marrow as he splashed and squelched south through the hatchie bottoms heading toward memphis once again he was still wearing his shoes the mud hadnt pulled them off yet though it had certainly tried at least half a dozen times his feet were soaked in the darkness under the trees or even out in the open when the moon went behind a cloud he couldnt see puddles before he stepped in them half the time he couldnt see his hand in front of his face pretty soon the moon would set he wanted to curl up under the nearest broadspreading oak and sleep till morning he wanted to but he didnt dare bedford forrests men would be looking for his trail sure as hounds went after a raccoon hed broken his parole so he had to make good his escape the sport they had with him before they finally let him surrender gave a taste of what theyd do if they caught him now if he never saw another confederate soldier if he never heard the rebel yell again that wouldnt break his heart so he thought for a moment anyhow but then he shook his head theodorick lay in the cold wet ground a shroud the only thing that kept the dirt out of his mouth and nose the rebs thought they were getting their revenge for what the thirteenth tennessee cavalry had done to them did they well he aimed to show them they were nothing but amateurs when it came to revenge maybeno probablygeneral hurlbut wouldnt give him any sizable command not after hed lost fort pillow but if he could have oh a companys worth of men who hated the confederate states and everything they stood for and most especially hated all the people who followed the stainless banner just as much as he did if he could have a company of men like that what a vengeance he would wreak i know where they live he muttered and then swore when a hanging vine hit him in the face and he did he knew who the leading confederate sympathizers were from paducah kentucky all the way down to pocahontas tennessee he knew where their brothers lived and their sonsyes and their sisters and daughters too he hadnt ordered any outrages against their womenfolk he hadnt and he wouldnt but if some happened anyway he wouldnt shed a tear first though he had to get to memphis remember that bill he told himself sternly one thing at a time if he made a mistake on the road south all his hopes for vengeance would go glimmering he kept hoping he would run across some homestead out in the middle of nowhere some place where a farmer scratched out a living with a few crops and whatever he could shoot or trap in the swamps if the bumpkin had any kind of nag but he didnt come across any farmhouses or even trappers huts no one seemed to live in these swamps he knew people did but one of the reasons they lived in a place like this was that they didnt want anybody from the outside world bothering them they didnt come out much and the outside world didnt come in bill bradford suddenly understood why it didnt it couldnt find anybody here something slithered over one of his shoes copperhead cottonmouth rattler only a garter snake a figment of his overheated imagination it could have been anything whatever it was it didnt bite and he didnt yell his head off though he couldnt say why he didnt he shuddered and pressed on sooner or later i have to come out the bottoms dont i he thought when he did he would surely find a farmhouse and then depending on whether the farmer backed the usa or the csa he would borrow a horse or talk his way into using one or simply steal one whichever looked like the best idea and then memphis once he got there bedford forrests friends would find out they werent the only ones who could strike by surprise at dawn oh yes major bradford muttered theyll find out all right when the distant thunder of guns woke mack leaming his first reaction was astonishment that hed been able to sleep at all hed thought the pain from his wound would keep him up all night his second reaction was a groan as that pain of which hed been blissfully unaware since whenever he dozed off flooded back into his consciousness did it hurt any less than it had before he fell asleep maybe a little he decided but maybe not too it was still plenty bad all around him other wounded union soldiers were coming back to themselves with almost identical groans no one had done anything for any of them all through the night the only mercy the rebels showed was not bursting into this miserable hut and murdering them while they slept the guns sounded again closer this time what the hells going on somebody said whos shooting at what have men marched up from memphis to chase the rebs away someone else asked why couldnt they show up yesterday god darnn their rotten souls to hell another wounded soldier said its not men marchingits a gunboat dog my cats if it aint another man said as soon as leaming heard that he knew it had to be so i love gunboat sailors he said bitterly they sail away when we need em the most but then they come back again after the fightings done theyre heroes all right every darnn one of em that touched off some vigorous and profane swearing from his fellow sufferers the guns on the river boomed again yes they were definitely closer this time you reckon thats the new era comin back somebody asked even though i got me a hole in my leg theres a few things id like to say to the high and mighty skipper who sailed off and left us in the lurch more obscenities fouled the early morning air by all the signs quite a few men had some things they wanted to tell captain marshall if they ever made his acquaintance lieutenant leaming had several thoughts of his own he wanted to share with the new eras commanding officer but another man said this here boat sounds like its coming up from memphis the new era steamed north off toward cairolike anyone from those parts he pronounced it kayro and places like that a rifle musket near the mississippi banged and then another one a minute later the gunboats cannon responded cant be yesterdays gunboat a soldier said theyre shooting at it and its got the gumption to shoot back several wounded men swore again mack leaming was not behindhandfar from it some of the shells the gunboat fired burst not far from the hut i hope they blow the damn rebs to hell and gone leaming said as if in response a confederate outside yelled come on boys dont just stand there if we have to pull back to hell with me if i want the damnyankees to be able to get their hands on one single thing they can use burn these buildings by god well fix this place the way the lord fixed sodom and gomorrah that roused the men inside the hut hold on they shouted hold on theres wounded in here let us come out before you fire this place devil take your wounded the reb answered we have to get rid of this here place right now lou daniel come on get moving somebody with a torch applied it to the corner of the hut mack leaming watched and listened with fearful fascination he could hear flames crackle and then he could see them terror sent ice along his spine but ice was not what he would feel getting shot was bad enough getting roasted in the flames had to be ten a hundred a thousand times worse men who could limp or crawl made for the doorway as fast as they could gowhich mostly wasnt very fast the more badly wounded men cried out take me with you dont leave me here to cook leaming added his voice to the chorus he shouted as loud as he could and wished he were louder here you go sir ill give you a hand a wounded federal said he had one hand to give for his wound was in the left arm he grabbed leaming by the collar of his tunic and yanked hard leaming groanedany motion tore at the track the bullet had drilled through him sorry the other soldier said its all right leaming got out through clenched teeth it wasnt all right or anything close to all right but it was infinitely better than lying there while those vicious orange flames crept closer and closer anything anything at all was better than that the other wounded man dragged him about ten feet out of the barracks hut then let go of him here you are sir he panted god bless you leaming said the right side of his back was in torment but it would ease the fire would have given him no relief no mercy the man with the injured arm went back into the hut and brought out another wounded soldier who could not move on his own the hut was burning hard by then but leaming didnt think anyone got left behind in it several confederate soldiers and one officer stood around watching the federals but none of them did anything to help the sun beat down on leamings head it would be a warmer day than the one before some of the confederates had canteens on their belts or slung over their shoulders he didnt bother asking them for water thoughhe knew how poor his chances of getting any were a wounded negro lay not far away he must have spent the night in the open as far as leaming knew all the men in the hut had been white one of forrests troopers walked over to him and said what the hell are you doing here suh i wants to get on the gunboat if she stop the colored man answered reckon they got a surgeon on bod kin cut this minnie out o me he pointed to his crudely bandaged calf you want to fight us again do you the secesh soldier said damn you ill teach you he brought up his rifle musket and shot the negro in the chest from a range of no more than a couple of feet the black man groaned and died inside of a minute or two another black manhe didnt seem badly hurtstood not far away were mack leaming in his shoes not that he was wearing any he would have got out of there as fast as he could the confederates were still shooting wounded negroesand the occasional wounded white too maybe this colored artilleryman didnt think they would do anything like that while the gunboatit was number twentyeight the silver clouddrew near if he didnt he made a dreadful mistake the reb whod shot the negro on the ground by leaming reloaded his rifle musket with a veterans practiced haste he hardly even needed to watch what he was doing his hands knew with no help from his eyes only after the man set a percussion cap on the nipple did the colored soldier seem to awaken to his danger by then it was too late for the black to run off forrests trooper would have had no trouble hitting him before he got out of range instead of running he begged for his life please dont shoot me suh i aint done nothin to you honest to god i aint you were up in the damn fort werent you the confederate replied taking deliberate aim at the black mans head you were shooting one of them goddamn cannon werent you no suh not me do jesus not me the negro said voice high and shrill his eyes showing white all around the iris i never had nothin to do with no cannon never you lying sack of shit the reb said hell even if you didnt you still had a gun in your hands for all i know one of my pals is dead on account of you so you can go to hell along with this other coon here he pulled the trigger the hammer fellwith a loud click and nothing more the colored artilleryman whod seemed on the point of fainting from terror let out a joyous cry you see you see god dont mean fo you to take my life god dont want you to take my life fuck you boy forrests trooper said he thumbed up the hammer and reseated the cap on the nipple didnt have it quite square there he raised the rifle musket again now i reckon well find out what god wants and what he dont he fired again the mini ball hit the negro just above the left eye the man couldnt even scream the only good thing was he didnt suffer not with the back of his head blown out he hardly even twitched after he fell the confederate spat dont look like god cared much about one worthless nigger after all does it leaming had seen too many horrors over the past day he was numb to them if not to the pain of his own wound fear of retaliation wasnt what kept him from saying anything to forrests trooper what were two more killings among so many and the officer who stood there and watched his man shoot a pair of wounded defenseless men he said not a word either bedford forrest hadnt ridden far from fort pillow after despoiling the place the fall hed taken left him stiff and sore he camped about five miles from the fort and passed an uncomfortable restless night when he woke before sunup the next morning he pulled up his shirt and got a good look at himself by the light of a guttering lamp by god he muttered im all over black and blue lucky i didnt break anythingmighty lucky as long as he was up he didnt see any reason why his aides shouldnt be up as well he limped over to captain andersons tent and shook him awake what the anderson said and then recognizing forrest oh good morning sir ive got a job for you captain forrest said at your service yawning anderson emerged from the blanket in which hed wrapped himself like a grayuniformed butterfly coming out of its cocoon he started pulling on his boots like forrest hed slept in the rest of his uniform what can i do for you i want you to ride back to fort pillow forrest said chances are therell be yankee gunboats nosing around show a flag of truce and tell em theyre welcome to take on all the wounded federals they can hold he chuckled long as theyre doing it we dont have to i understand sir captain anderson took a hardtack from his haversack and started gnawing on it if he went back to the fort he wouldnt have much chance for any better breakfast with his mouth full he asked do you want me to go by my lonesome or shall i bring a couple of other officers along oh fetch your sideboys by all means forrest said indulgently dont want the federals to reckon we cant afford to send but the one man will you do one more thing for me whatever you need general charles anderson knew the only right answer an aidedecamp could give to that question general chalmers is camped a couplethree miles in back of us would you be kind enough to stop at his tent and tell him i reckon he did a might fine job yesterday nathan bedford forrest sighed if he was going to bury the hatchet with his division commander he had to show he appreciated chalmerss work he wouldnt lie to do it but fortunately he didnt have to here id be happy to sir charles anderson said isnt captain young back at general chalmerss encampment who for a moment the name meant nothing to forrest who was thinking of his own officers then he remembered the parley of the day before oh the federal from missouri who knew me yes i do believe he is you want to take him along to fort pillow with you if you dont mind sir he seemed to be a pretty sharp fellow and having somebody like that along may help me dicker with the yankees in the gunboat its all right by me captain if he gives his parole not to fight us till hes exchanged you can let him go too i reckon hell keep his wordnot like that bradford son of a bitch forrests mouth twisted the way the enemy officer had escaped left him steaming ill see to it then anderson stuffed the rest of the hardtack into his mouth and left his tent chewing with determination having a little more time on his own hands forrest breakfasted on skillygallee hardtack pounded to crumbs softened in water and fried in bacon grease washed down with coffee brewed from beans captured at fort pillow it made a tolerable meal his belly was in no doubt that hed eaten something anyhow inside of fifteen minutes captain anderson and three junior officers rode off toward the northwest not long after that forrest heard the distant thud of a cannons discharge he nodded to himself might have known he said as usual the first word came out mought of course the federals would be shelling fort pillow it was too late to do them any good but not too late to salve their pride he shrugged they could have all the pride they wanted hed taken the fort the thirteenth tennessee cavalry us wouldnt harry west tennessee any more it would be a while before the sixth tennessee cavalry us stuck its head out of memphis too as usual hed done what needed doing xvi sergeant ben robinson lay on the ground watching the gunboat steam up the mississippi toward fort pillow every so often the gunboats cannon would boom and a shell would come down somewhere near the confederates posted in and near the fort some of the rebs fired back at the ship it ignored them and kept on thundering away robinsons mouth twisted with a pain that had nothing to do with his wounded leg if only the new era showed that kind of spirit the day before of course far fewer confederate soldiers were firing at this ship than had aimed at the new era that made a difference but the new era really could have done the garrison in fort pillow some good this gunboat could cannonade from now till doomsday without retaking the place too late for that now too late for most of the garrison too not sated by the slaughter the afternoon before the confederate pickets were still killing wounded federals mostly negroes whenever rebs came close robinson played dead and prayed as hard as he could he didnt know which worked better but they hadnt murdered him yet the bombardment and the occasional return fire from the river bank had gone on for a couple of hours when one of the confederates said here comes an officer with a flag of truce hearing that robinson turned his head sure enough a confederate officer waving a white flag rode toward the mississippi at a trot ben didnt believe he was one of the rebs whod parleyed the day before with him came three other cs officersand captain young the provost marshal at fort pillow ahoy the gunboat the confederate shouted reining in not far from where ben robinson lay the reb cupped his hands to his mouth to make his voice carry farther ahoy the silver cloud that was how robinson learned the ships name hed seen it painted on her but seeing letters wasnt the same as reading them as he knew too well will you parley the officer yelled after a couple of minutes the answer came back thin over the water what have you got to say reb i am captain anderson general forrests assistant adjutant general the confederate shouted i offer you a truce to take off the wounded i tried to do the same with the new era yesterday afternoon but captain marshall would not hear me he sailed away one more reason to damn captain marshall to the hottest pits in hell ben robinson thought savagely what was marshall afraid of that the rebs would swarm onto his ship while he was loading casualties that was a cowards way of thinking nothing else but again captain anderson had to wait a little while for a response this time the men on the silver cloud said ill come to you in a boat that way we dont have to keep screaming our heads off at each other anderson bowed in the saddle i am at your service sir he bawled politely four sailors rowed an officer toward the shore the officer was a young man and wore two gold stripes near the cuff of each sleeve i am acting master william ferguson captain he said im skipper of the silver cloud what do you propose you came yourself anderson said here i am ferguson replied well good for you as i told you captain marshall showed me only his heels yesterday the confederate officer said we will give you a truce until say five this afternoon general forrest desires to place the wounded white or black aboard your boat we have few men still close by but they will give you what help they may acting master ferguson frowned white or black you say we heard tell you went and killed every nigger you could we killed a lot of em anderson said matteroffactly but some are left alive take a look at this here buck he pointed to ben robinson oh yeah ferguson eyed ben in surprise the colored artilleryman swore at himself when he played possum he fooled the officer on his own side but not the reb much good that would have done him you really alive ferguson asked what would he do if i said no suh is dead robinson wondered but the whimsy died stillborn this was not the time or place yes suh is here robinson answered i got shot but is here well all right ferguson said he turned back to anderson fair enough captain you can have your truceon one condition whats that the confederate asked keep your armed men out of gunshot range of my ship for as long as the truce lasts ferguson said they were taking potshots at us and i dont want any damn fool keeping it up while were in no fit state to defend ourselves suppose i say that no armed men come within the outermost perimeter of fort pillow captain anderson suggested thats about half a mile theres not a chance in church anyone could hit you from farther off even if some hothead should try it and i will issue orders against any such thing seems acceptable said ferguson nodding and you would want this truce to last till five oclock you said oh yes just for the day that should be plenty i agree ferguson walked over to anderson who hadnt dismounted and held out his hand anderson clasped it the two white men got along well enough ben robinson tried to imagine the reb agreeing to a truce with a colored officer the picture would not form how many wounded are we talking about acting master ferguson inquired i dont know not exactly but it isnt a small number anderson replied perhaps captain young here can give you a better notion im afraid not young answered i dont know what happened in the fort after i managed to surrender and the victors blood was still running hot at the time he didnt want to come out and say the confederates slaughtered the garrison but he didnt want to lie either ben robinson granted him reluctant respect i see ferguson could add two and two he went on well we have a steamer coming right behind us in the hope she would be usefulthe platte valley i will order her to land alongside us and well do what we can for these poor devils he looked up and down the riverbank a lot of bodies had been carried up to the ditch and thrown in but quite a few still remained if you will excuse me captain ferguson went back to the boat the sailors whod waited in it rowed him out to the silver cloud smoke poured from the gunboats stacks as she neared the shore signal flags and then shouts ordered the platte valley up alongside her captain anderson looked at ben robinson again what did you do to earn those three chevrons boy made myself the best soldier i could i reckon robinson answered emboldened by the truce he answered i sure blew some of your sojers to hell and gone while we was fightin you lost anderson said yes suh but we put up the best fight we could with what we had robinson said the confederate officer plucked at his beard a pity we didnt kill more of you me i reckon its a shame we didnt kill more of yall robinson wouldnt have been so bold if the reb hadnt tweaked him he also wouldnt have been so bold if the federal gunboat werent lying right offshore he didnt think the confederate officer would murder him in cold blood with men from the us navy watching when the confederates hand dropped to his revolver ben wondered if hed just made his last mistake but captain anderson let it fall to his side yeah talk big now nigger god help you if we ever catch you again though i aint afraid ben robinson intended that for nothing more than a snappy comeback but he felt the truth and the power in the words and repeated them throwing them in andersons face by god i aint afraid sailors started taking wounded federals aboard the silver cloud and the platte valley the men who came for robinson didnt have a stretchernothing but a plank that they carried between them they set it on the riverbank by the wounded man climb aboard one of them said well get you back to the gunboat thank you kindly robinson said as he gingerly flattened himself on the plank i is much obliged to you gentlemen doin our job the white man answered and paused to spit a stream of tobacco juice then he said you ready zeke well lift him on three one two three they lifted together both of them grunted zeke said you sure never missed no meals did you pal that reminded ben how ravenously hungry he was i aint had nothin atall for a whole day he said you got a hardtack you can spare you want one of those damn things you must be hungry zeke said wait till we get you in the boat the other bearer added dont want to have to put you down and then pick you up again robinson couldnt complain about that it made too much sense as soon as they carried him to the rowboat the sailors each gave him a hardtack the square crackers tasted like cardboard and weevils the way they always did he didnt care they seemed wonderful more wounded federals filled the rowboat he was the only negro in it many more whites than colored men seemed to be left alive the confederates hadnt murdered so many whites trying to surrender or after they were already wounded oh theyd killed some but fewer the wounded whites were also delighted to gnaw on hardtack when the boat was full sweating sailors rowed the short distance out to the silver cloud more men there hauled the soldiers from fort pillow up onto the gunboats deck the ships surgeon took a look at robinsons wound well youre not too bad he said and went on to the white corporal next to him ben wasnt offended in fact he found himself nodding as long as he was on a us navy vessel as long as bedford forrests troopers couldnt kill him for the fun of it any more he wasnt bad at all the sun was up bright and cheerful promising a day much warmer than the one just past bill bradford wished it would have stopped in the sky before it ever rose but he was no joshua to turn his wish into a command he would have to make the best of thingsif he could he still had no horse he hadnt found a chance to steal one he hadnt even found a place to buy one though he would gladly have used the double eagle hed managed to keep in his pocket staying on foot in a country patrolled by bedford forrests troopers was asking for trouble if i can get past covington but hed already had to duck off the road three times to keep mounted confederates from spotting him if he was careless even once and things could go wrong even if he wasnt even slightly careless bradford found that out the hard way early in the morning when a shout rang out behind him hey you yeah you in the scruffy clothes hold up there he whirled he almost jumped out of the sutlers clothes hed taken four troopers in butternut and gray came trotting toward him two carried rifle muskets or possibly carbines he wasnt drawing fine distinctions just then the other two revolvers he couldnt possibly have seen them because theyd just ridden out from in back of a stand of oaks hed passed himself only a couple of minutes before they must have turned on to the southbound road from a smaller crossroad because they hadnt been following him before what to do it boiled down to running or bluffing if he ran they would ride him down and shoot him that was only too plain for he saw no good hiding places he could reach before they caught him it would have to be bluff then he waved to the rebs and waited for them to come up mornin he said his smile didnt seem to warm their hearts who the hell are you and what are you doing here one of them demanded well my names joe peterson bradford picked something ordinary but not he hoped so ordinary that it roused suspicion im home on furlough from braxton braggs army and i was out sparking my girl last night if you want to know the truth he smiled again his expression this time half embarrassed half ingratiating all his acting talents were wasted on the hardfaced confederate on furlough from braggs army are you lets see some papers then bradford went through his pockets he found no papers of any sort even if he had he couldnt have displayed themthey would have authorized his presence at fort pillow that was the last thing he could afford to do it was he judged much worse than showing that his name wasnt peterson i seem to have left them in my other pair of pants he said sheepishly oh yeah i just fuckin bet you did the trooper said he was one of the pair who carried revolvers he aimed his at bradfords face that other pair of pantswas it gray or blue i dont know what you mean bradford got out through lips numb with fear hell you dont you lying son of a bitch said one of the confederates with a longarm he pointed his weapon at bradfords midsection sure as shit you done run off from somebodys army only question is you a deserter from our side or the yankees youve got me all wrong bradford said i shut up the reb with the pistol said flatly were rounding up deserters too damn many fairweather soldiers reckon they can disappear whenever they find somethin better to do that aint how it works not when theres a war on we got three four other sorry bastards waitin down in covington take you down there too let colonel duckworth cipher out what to do with you what to do to you the other rifletoting soldier added his voice held a certain grim anticipation bradford could have done without bradford also could have done without meeting colonel william duckworth the commander of the seventh tennessee cavalry cs was much too likely to recognize him and that wont be good bradford thought desperately no that wont be good at all youve got me all wrong he said again if the colonel says so ill believe it said the reb who did most of the talking i wouldnt believe you if you told me it was daytime roy why dont you hand me your sixshooter there that way this bastard can ride behind you without getting any smart ideas ill do it roy said but ill make damn sure hes not carrying anything either he got down from his horse handed over his revolver and then walked up to bradford stick your hands in the air whoever the hell you are numbly bradford obeyed he wasnt armed so he didnt have anything to worry about on that score roy frisked him with a skill that suggested he had practiceand with no respect for his person whatsoever the reb nodded youll do get up on my horse and slide back of the saddle you can hang on while i tend to the horse youve got no business doing this to me bradford said as he mounted im on furlough and i was just going about my business youve got no right hell we dont said the trooper who seemed to be in charge furlough my ass youre somebodys runaway nigger sure as im a christian dont know whether you ran out on abe lincoln or jeff davis but i reckon well see he nodded to roy whod seated himself in the saddle and taken hold of the reins you ready ready as ill ever be roy answered the confederates booted their horses forward they went at a walk so as not to wear down the animal carrying double they care more about the horse than they do about me bill bradford thought bitterly that wasnt quite true the secesh soldiers cared about whether he escaped and whether he could do anything to the man he rode behind they cared very much about such things but without a doubt they liked the horse better than they liked him because they rode slowly they took more than an hour to get to covington that only gave major bradford more time to worry the seat of tipton county put him in mind of a lot of other county seats in western tennessee the courthouse faced the central square the couple of blocks around it were given over to businesses they grew more cotton around covington than almost anywhere else in tennessee and several plantation owners had second houses in town almost as fine as their homes out in the countryside the troopers rode down main street toward the courthouse they tied up their horses in front of the brown brick building even the columns of the portico were faced with brick bradford thought that was excessive then wondered why he worried about such trifles when his neck was on the line he supposed it was to keep from worrying about his neckbut he did anyway sentries in front of the door called who yall got there thats what were trying to find out roy answered he gave bradford an elbow in the ribs get down you as bradford awkwardly dismounted roy went on is the colonel inside he sure is the sentry answered he eyed bradford with a frown on his face this fellow looks familiar hell with me if he dont hell with you anyway boone roy said the sentry laughed which meant they were friends roy got down from the horse reclaimed his revolver and aimed it at bradfords chest go on in you colonel duckworthll decide what to do with you as bradford walked to the door he fiddled with his hat tugging it down as low as he could that might not do him any good but it couldnt hurt the troopers herded him along toward the courtroom a confederate junior officer stood outside that door like a gatekeeper which was probably just what he was whos this fellow he asked reckon hes a deserter lieutenant witherspoon says hes with braggs army and on furlough but hes got no papers answered the other soldier with a pistolbradford thought his name was hank but wasnt sure colonel ought to have a look at him witherspoon rubbed his chin he was so young his brown beard was soft and thin after a few seconds he nodded well all right bring him in one way or the other it wont take long right said hank or whoever he was come on you when bradford hesitated another confederate trooper gave him a shove william duckworth sat behind a table as if he were a judge he didnt look like a judge though he looked like a scottish covenanter or perhaps more like a slightly deranged biblical prophet he was about forty with dark hair and a dark scraggly beard that tumbled down his chest to the third pair of buttons on his doublebreasted tunic for reasons known only to himself and possibly to god he shaved his upper lip his eyes bill bradford would have said they were the coldest and grayest hed ever seen had he not made the acquaintance of nathan bedford forrest only the day before well duckworth said and bradford had all he could do not to burst into startled laughter for the rebel colonels voice seemed much too high and thin to spring from such a stern forbidding visage whove you got here says his names peterson sir says hes on furlough from braggs army roy answered we came across him north of town says he was sparking a girl last night and thats how come he was on the road colonel duckworths left eyebrow rose which only made him look more formidable tell me another one he said roy nodded yes sir thats what we thought he done run off from somebodys army sure as hell dont know whether its ours or the damnyankees but somebodys no doubt duckworth studied bradford with those january eyes bradford looked down at his shoes as he had at fort pillow the night before while talking to the lieutenant who let him leave it didnt work this time shed the lid duckworth said sharply let me see who the devil you are a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach bradford took off the slouch hat he looked straight at colonel duckworth if the confederate officer didnt know him by sight he still had a chance but if duckworth did and he did damn him he did that eyebrow jumped again now in surprise not sarcasm his eyes widened slightly he nodded to himself as if to say that yes he really was sure then he spoke aloud youre major bradford arent you behind bradford roy and hank and the other two rebs all inhaled on the same startled note the federal stood there for a few seconds wondering if he had any chance to brazen it out he wished he thought he did deciding things would go worse for himif they could go worse for himif he tried to lie he gave a weary nod yes im afraid i am i heard fort pillow fell colonel duckworth said and bradford nodded again the reb went on so you got out alive did you i wouldnt have bet money on that and theres the lords truth we could take care of it for you real quick colonel roy said hank and the other two were quick to add loud profane agreement but duckworth shook his head cant do it now not in cold bloodthe federals would raise a stink and theyd have the right to dammit dont want them murdering our officers if they catch em thats a feudit isnt war well what shall we do with him then hank asked the commander of the seventh tennessee cavalry cs frowned considering elisha might have frowned that way while deciding whether to ask god to have the people whod mocked his baldness torn to pieces by lions or bears but colonel duckworth though he had worse than lions and bears at his disposal seemed milder than the hebrew prophet of days gone by well send him on up to brownsville thats what weve got some other prisoners going there tomorrow anyhow general chalmers can figure out what happens to him after that hell likely send him on to general forrest hell get what he deserves thenhell with me if he wont hank had what was in major bradfords biased opinion a truly wicked laugh of course bradford was less than eager to make bedford forrests acquaintance again wherell we stash him in the meantime roy asked that made duckworth frown again down the hall here theres some jail cells he said at last we better stick him in one of those meaning no disrespect majorits for your own good theres plenty of men on my side whod turn handsprings to string you up id give my parole bradford said duckworth didnt know hed already broken it once if he could slip away he might still make it to memphis but the confederate cavalry officer shook his head afraid i dont trust you that far you lied about who you were to my men here you might do some more lying to get away or maybe you already did some more and thats how you got away from fort pillow despite his wild mans beard william duckworth was nobodys fool he nodded to bradfords captors take him away lieutenant witherspoon will show you where the cells are yes sir the troopers chorused royor possibly hankstuck his revolver up against bradfords backbone get moving you out in the hallway witherspoon gaped youre major bradford well ill be a son of a bitch i wouldnt be surprised bradford thought but he held his tongue the jail cell was small and dark and dank the roof must have leaked because the mattress on the iron cot was damp nobody offered to get bradford another one he looked out through the barred window and saw the far wall experiment proved he couldnt shift the bars even if he could have the window was too small to crawl through so was the one set high in the wall he tried pushing at the doorgently so as not to make any noise no matter how hard he pushed the padlock wouldnt give hed feared it wouldnt that lock had looked stout damp or not he sat down on the cot here he was trapped like a rat tomorrow brownsville after that like it or not another meeting with nathan bedford forrest mack leaming watched federal sailors and confederate troopers work together to take the us wounded aboard the silver cloud and the platte valley which had pulled up alongside the gunboat now the rebs seemed to be on their best behavior when he croaked out yet another request for water one of them gave him some as it had before it worked wonders in making him feel better eventually his turn came two sturdy sailors lifted him when he groaned one of them said take it easy lieutenant well get you onto the steamer in jig time thanks he got out no matter what they told him to do being moved still hurt like fire he hoped the wound wouldnt start bleeding again the sailor who had hold of his feet said looks like those sorry raggedy rebs stole just about everything but your toenails if they could have got those off they would have taken them too leaming answered both sailors laughed but he wasnt joking he groaned again when they set him in the rowboat and again when other sailors on the platte valley took hold of him and laid him on the deck somebody gave him more water and half a hardtack then people seemed to forget about him for a spell he dozed a little only to wake with a start when someone asked where are you hit lieutenant why do you leaming stopped the man crouching by him wore a surgeons green sash he had a professional interest in leamings wound the minnie caught me below the shoulder blade and dug down it feels as though it stopped in my ah rump i see the surgeon looked up toward fort pillow were you by any chance standing on the bluff there and shot from above yes thats what happened leaming said will you cut out the bullet or leave it where it is if its where you say i doubt its doing you much harm at present the other man replied digging it out would give you another wound with all the risk of suppuration and septicemia attendant on such things so i will let that sleeping dog lie for the time being i think are you in much pain some leaming didnt want to sound like a weakling but he didnt want to be a martyr either so he added maybe a bit more than some i shouldnt wonder the surgeon took a small brown glass bottle out of the wooden chest he carried with him drawing the cork with his teeth he handed leaming the bottle saying heretake a swig of this what is it laudanum lieutenant bestquality laudanum ive had excellent results with it in memphis and it should help you too the surgeon beamed not all drugs in the pharmacopoeia work as advertisedive seen that too many times to doubt it but laudanum by thunder will shift pain leaming needed no more convincing he raised the bottle to his lips and drank from it the taste was strong and not particularly pleasant cheap brandy with a heavy infusion of poppy seeds he had to force himself to swallow it burned all the way down to his stomach it seemsstrong he had to cast about for a polite word the physician smiled i know its nasty but it will turn the trick this is no humbug ill come round again in half an hour if i have told you a falsehood call me a liar he picked up his case and went over to the next wounded man where are you hit half an hour usually that didnt seem very long half an hour walking with a pretty girl went by in the blink of an eye half an hour with a gunshot wound was a different story leaming couldnt even look at his watch to see how the time passed by that thieving confederate had lifted it he hardly noticed when his head first began to spin when he did notice he blinked in bemusement he hadnt had much brandy not very much at all but it wasnt the brandy that left him floating away from himself it was the opium dissolved in it well well he murmured and then again well well laudanum really did banish pain in the most literal sense of the word the torment didnt disappear but it went off to a distant province where it didnt seem to matter nearly so much if that wasnt a miracle it would do for one till something better came along how are you lieutenant the surgeon asked sorry to be a bit longer than i said i wouldi had to take a poor devils leg off god willing the wound wont go bad now i hope it doesnt how am i leaming felt untethered almost as if he were floating above his own body like one of the hydrogenfilled balloons the federals used in virginia to peer behind confederate lines i am much improved thank you finding words took a distinct effort im glad to hear it the surgeon smiled ill give you another dose when this one wears off another dose echoing the surgeon was easier and those two wonderful words held more promise than mack leaming had ever imagined matt ward tripped over a chunk of driftwood on the riverbank he almost dropped his end of the plank that had a wounded federal on it the bluebelly groaned the confederate trooper at the other end of the plank said watch what youre doing dammit what the hells wrong with you anyways too much rotgut yesterday ward admitted his stomach was sour his head pounded and his eyes felt as sensitive to the light as those of a man long poxed well be careful for gods sake the other trooper said thats right the wounded federal added shut up you son of a bitch ward said furiously ill take it from him hes on my side but i dont have to put up with anything from a goddamn tennessee tory you hear me id sooner tie a rock to your leg and chuck you in the mississippi than haul you to your damn boat and thats the lords truth the wounded man from the thirteenth tennessee cavalry us looked to the other confederate for support he got none there i feel the same way he does the trooper said just thank your lucky stars i know how to take orders i thank my lucky stars i aint no nigger the federal said thats what i thank my stars for otherwise i reckon id just be buzzards meat i thank my lucky stars i aint no nigger too the other confederate trooper said but we werent fussy yesterday we got rid of plenty of homemade yankees too if the wounded enemy soldier had any more clever comments after that he kept them to himself that was one of the smarter things he could have done nobody was paying a lot of attention to the troopers carrying wounded men he might have had an accident and wouldnt that have been too bad it certainly wouldfor him a couple of us soldiers brought a wounded negro to a boat waiting at the rivers edge at the same time as ward and his companion carried up the white man like most confederates they wanted nothing to do with toting colored soldiers blacks were supposed to work for whites not the other way around both parties of bearers got their men into the boat whats it like on your gunboat ward asked one of the sailors want to see for yourself the man answered in a sharp new england accent can i ward said why not theres a truce on the yankee said you and your friend know how to handle oars i do ward said the other trooper nodded and started filling his pipe well then why dont you row across theyll let you up on deck to look around i figure the sailor pointed toward the silver cloud some rebs on board already well do it ward said hed almost reached the gunboat before he realized he was doing the federal sailors work for him a good thing he didnt try to get my money or hed likely have that too he thought with a wry grin but pulling a pair of oars seemed to sweat the whiskey out of him better than carrying casualties had sailors on the silver cloud helped get the wounded men in the boat up onto the deck they gave ward and the other confederate hard looks when they started to come aboard too we dont aim to do any fighting matt said fellow back there said we could come and look around he pointed to the man on the riverbank cotton always did run his mouth too much a sailor on the gunboat said but he stood aside and let the confederates board cotton ward rubbed at his ear did he say that yankees name was cotton a couple of cs officers came out of the chamber where they steered the gunboatward had no better name for it than thatalong with a us officer with one gold band at the cuff of each sleeve ward couldnt have said what kind of rank that gave him either he knew us army emblemswho didntbut not their naval equivalents whoever this fellow was he and the confederates were having a high old time that was literally true for they were drinking together as if they belonged to the same side they talked and laughed like old friends the confederates told how the new era had sailed away the day before doesnt surprise me a bit the yankee answered captain marshall always was a little old lady in a blue uniform the confederates thought that was the funniest thing theyd ever heard one of them almost spilled his drink careful there the other one said be a shame to waste it reckon youre right the first officer in gray said had they really been shooting federals the day before all the wounded men in blue on the silver clouds deck said they had xvii corporal jack jenkins rode east through the hatchie bottom country in a perfectly foul temper the other troopers wouldnt stop ragging on him for letting bill bradford slip through his fingers jesus god one wouldbe wit said if you didnt want him yourself you shouldve given him to the rest of us he might have been talking about somebody whod thrown away a drumstick instead of putting it back on the platter with the rest of the chicken i wanted him dammit jenkins said he fooled me thats all thats all he thought bitterly that was plenty hed never live it down if he got to be an old man with a long white beard his neighbors would still think of him as the damn fool who let bill bradford get away he makes it down to memphis hell stir up all kinds of trouble another horseman said hes a serpent bradford is maybe somebody elsell catch the stinking rotten son of a bitch jenkins said it aint like he paid me to let him get away aint enough money in tennessee for bradford to pay to get away the other trooper said several men nearby nodded jack jenkins was one of them he would have paid plenty for the privilege of blowing bradfords brains out but hed had the chancehad it and fumbled it he yawned he could hardly stay on his horse he was so tired hed ridden all day and all night then fought a battle then got stuck with that damned sentry duty so he hadnt had enough sleep to spit at the past couple of days he wasnt the only man swaying in the saddle eitherfar from it at least the confederates werent going hell for leather now theyd done what they set out to do there were no federals anywhere dose by to give them a hard time they could move at their own pace wonder where old bedfordll want us to kick the damnyankees asses next somebody said wherever it is well do it jenkins said he had confidence in nathan bedford forrest and he had confidence in the men with whom he rode whether they still had confidence in him got to make sure they dont trip you when youve got your foot back to kick one of them said no damn federals ever gonna trip me again jenkins said furiously ever you hear the rest of the troopers looked at one another but none of them said anything the two stripes on jenkinss sleeve didnt hold them back they werent men who feared sassing underofficers the growl in his voice the glint in his eye the angry flush that reddened his badly shaved cheeks the hunch of his broad shoulders any soldier who sassed him now would have to back it up with fists or maybe with a gun and some things were more trouble than they were worth a great blue heron sprang into the air from the edge of the swamp a fish in its beak the birds wingspan was almost as wide as a man was tall jenkins followed it with his eyes wish i could fly like that he said who dont somebody else saidthat seemed safe enough to answer ive had dreams where i could flap my arms and go up into the air me ive had dreams where i could flap my feet another trooper put in i believe that loutheyre big enough still another man said you find a federal with shoes thatd cover those gunboats sure didtook a pair off a dead nigger lou said cryin shame when a damn niggers got better shoes than a white manthats all ive got to tell you it is his friend agreed well theyre yours now by jesus that lousy black son of a bitch dont need em no more what id like to do is id like to go up in a balloon one of these days another confederate said showmenll take em up at country fairs sometimes dont know what they charge for a ride a quartereagle maybe even a halfeagle hell with me if i wouldnt pay five dollars just so as i could say i really flew jack jenkins thought about doing that it wouldnt be badif he had a fivedollar goldpiece he figured he would plunk it down so he could see what going up in the air was like too but it wasnt what hed had in mind when he spoke it wasnt what he craved a showmans balloon was tethered to the ground even if the line should break the balloon was at the mercy of every vagrant breeze when he talked about flying when he thought about flying he meant flying the way you flew in dreams flying the way the heron flew he meant going from here to there because you were here and you wanted to get there where here and there were wouldnt matter you could just hop in the air and go nobody in all the world could do that jeff davis couldnt neither could abe lincoln neither could queen victoria and she had more money than both of them put together so what did that say about a ragged confederate cavalry corporals chances that they werent what youd call good worse luck for that matter almost anybody in the world could go from here to there on the ground and where here and there were didnt matter not me dammit jenkins thought he was going where he was going because that was where nathan bedford forrest wanted him to go the privates riding with him were much more likely to pick a fight with him than he was to pick a fight with bedford forrest riding to forrests will his backside almost as sore from the saddle as if he were stricken with boils he came into brownsville from the west had he ridden into it from the east only two days before that seemed impossible but it was true would he be able to sleep in a bed tonight or at least under a roof after all hed been through that seemed impossible too but at least he could hope pain dulled by laudanum mack leaming lay on the platte valleys deck the world would do whatever it did for the moment he couldnt do anything about it with the brandy and opium coursing through his veins he couldnt even care about it very much captain anderson walked along the steamers deck with the platte valleys skipper the civilian wore a uniform considerably gaudier than a navy mans would have been you will give me receipts for all the men you take aboard sir forrests aide said oh yes of course the skipper answered got to keep the paperwork straight well both wind up in hot water if things dont come out even anderson laughed heaven forbid he said you yanks have it worse than we do there i believe on account of youre richer than we areand you have more men to spare for dotting every i and crossing every t weve got to make do without so much in the way of spit and polish im sure you miss it said the captain of the platte valley he winked at charles andersonleaming saw in most distinctly well now and again i do to tell you the truth anderson replied i was a merchant up in cincinnati before the war and after that i worked for the nashville and chattanooga railroad i like having things just so when i can but when theres no time and not enough men even if there were time well sir all you can do is your best i suppose thats so the steamboat skipper pointed up toward the bluff atop which fort pillow layor had lain from what my men say you rebs did your best there we shouldnt have had to storm the place sir captain anderson said i gather major booth fell early in the fight and major bradford im afraid didnt have the sense god gave a goose he thought he could hold us out with tennessee tories and niggers and forced us to prove him wrong well you did that by thunder the captain of the platte valley sounded as respectfulno as admiringas if he and the confederate cavalry officer were on the same side despite the laudanum dull anger slowly filled mack leaming this plump easygoing fellow had no business getting so friendly with the enemy they were doing everything but drinking brandy together captain anderson took out a cigar case and offered the steamboat captain a stogie that worthy bit off the end stuck the cigar in his mouth and scraped a lucifer on the sole of his shoe once he had his cheroot going he gave anderson a match they smoked for a while in companionable silence what was happening over on the silver cloud was acting master fergusona real us navy officeras friendly toward the rebs as this fellow was he complimenting them in a professional way for the skill and thoroughness theyd shown in slaughtering the federals inside fort pillow leaming didntcouldntknow but he wouldnt have been surprised some federal and confederate officers were friends because theyd gone to west point together or served side by side in the old army leaming could understand that even if he didnt like it but it wouldnt be true of someone still wet behind the ears like william ferguson all the same though to leaming s way of thinking union officers too often bent over backwards to extend all the courtesies to their confederate counterparts that dull anger inside him grew sharper and hotter he was damned if he would ever give any confederate more than the minimum due him under the laws of warif he lived to fight again had the rebels given the men inside fort pillow even so much he didnt think so not far away a colored artilleryman lay groaning a bloody bandage only partly covered a huge saber cut on his head and another wrapped his hand he was in a bad way leaming didnt think he would get better what would negroes make of the fight at fort pillow wouldnt they want to swear bloody vengeance against forrests men in particular and confederate troops in general leaming had seldom tried to think like a negro but so it seemed to him in and around fort pillow the confederates methodically went on wrecking and burning anything union forces might possibly use forrests men werent going to try to hold the place against a us attack that made more sense than mack leaming wished it did the federals hadnt been able to keep the rebs from storming the fortress the confederates were unlikely to have any better luck unless they brought in enough troops to man gideon pillows outer perimeter and what was the point of that smoke from the burning swirled across the platte valley and the silver cloud it made leaming s eyes sting and burn it also made him cough which hurt in spite of the laudanum he tried to breathe in little shallow sips maybe that helped some it also made him take longer than he might have otherwise to realize he wasnt just smelling wood smoke the other odor was scorched meat his stomach did a slow lurch when he recognized it he wasnt the only one what are you rebs doing there the platte valleys ornately dressed skipper asked captain anderson burning things sir forrests aide answered matteroffactly burning things thingsthats fine the steamboat captain made a horrible face smells like youre burning people too not live ones anderson said i dont know if we got all the bodies out of some of those huts before we fired them to tell you the truth i dont much care either i am not one of those men who believe the body must be perfect to render resurrection effectual my view is that god can provide in such circumstances and that he will leaming held the same view that he agreed with the confederate officer tempted him to change his mind the skipper of the platte valley did incline to the literalist view of resurrection he and captain anderson fired scriptural texts at each other like mini balls several real gunshots interrupted them what the devils that the steamboat captain exclaimed your men arent supposed to be carrying arms inside the perimeter i dont know what it is anderson sounded strained if the truce was falling apart he might not be able to get off the platte valley they are shooting the darky soldiers someone yelled from the shore there is a truce captain the steamboat skipper said your men shouldnt ought to be doing that now i know anderson answered his voice still tight if you will let me off this vessel sir i will do my best to quell them he knew his onions even if he meant what he said once he got ashore he couldnt be made a prisoner dont let him go leaming sucked in smoky air to shout it before he could a confederate officer thundered up on horseback stop that firing he roared arrest that man a couple of more shots were fired but only a couple there went some more niggers god have mercy on their sorry souls said a wounded us officer standing not far from leaming since he was able to stay on his feet he could see farther than leaming could himself this is a bad business the skipper told captain anderson it is indeed anderson replied i do not know what provoked our soldier to commence firing why do you think anything did except that he was shooting at black men the steamboat skipper broke in if he was provoked would your officer have wanted him arrested bedford forrests assistant adjutant general didnt answer from which mack leaming concluded that he had no good answer instead he said its nothing that breaks the truce anyhow he seemed relieved as leaming would have been in his place no i suppose not the captain of the platte valley replied well be able to get back to slaughtering each other soon enough thoughhave no fear eryes said charles anderson a little later perhaps feeling hed worn out what was to mack leaming much too warm a welcome he went back ashore in the rowboat that had brought wounded federals out to the steamer ask you something leaming said as the skipper walked past him the man stopped in surprise go ahead friend ask me anything you please i figured you were too far gone to talk i hope not leaming said now that you have us aboard i was wondering where youll take us im bound for mound city as soon as the truce is up the skipper answered so is the silver cloud mound city leaming tried to make his painfrayed drugdulled wits work he had little luck ive heard the name but for the life of me i cant recall if its in tennessee or kentucky neither one mound citys in illinois just up the ohio from cairo the steamship captain said illinois leaming started to laugh even though it hurt hed been up in paducah kentucky before the thirteenth tennessee cavalry came to fort pillow but hed never once crossed the ohio river to go into illinois kentucky felt like home illinois he laughed some more yankeeland at last the click of a key in the lock on his cell door woke bill bradford from a sound sleep he was amazed hed slept at all gray predawn light was stealing into the cell through the little barred window in the wall with a screech of rusty hinges the door opened three confederates stood in the hallway two of them aimed revolvers at bradford come on you said the third one who still held the big brass key let me put my shoes on bradford said around a yawn make it snappy growled one of the men with a pistol hes a coldhearted bastard isnt he the other one said damned if i could lay there snoring my fool head off knowing bedford forrest was powerful ticked at me bradford looked up from tying his left shoe i dont snore he said with dignity the rebs gave back raucous laughter hell you dont one of them said either that or somebody went and snuck a sawmill in here when colonel duckworths back was turned all three of them thought that was the funniest thing theyd ever heard im ready now bradford got to his feet may i have something to eat before you take me to brownsville ought to feed you lead is what i ought to do one of the confederates said and fear rose in bradford like a choking cloud but another one said duckworth said to give him breakfast he got a hardtack and a tin cup of coffee that had to be mostly chicory it was no worse than what they ate themselves so he couldnt complain after that they herded him along to their encampment outside of covington got some more prisoners to take up to brownsville one of them explained dont reckon theyll try and run off though so we didnt have to jug em i wasnt going anywhere bradford protested not in a cell you wasnt the reb said but you pulled somethin funny to get away from fort pillowyou mustveso the colonel didnt trust you not to do it again i would have in a heartbeat bradford thought aloud he said thats not fair too damn bad the trooper said you made your bed now you can lay in it lie in it you ignorant oaf bill bradford knew the difference between transitive and intransitive verbs the confederate soldier standing in front of him knew something else he had a pistol and bradford damn well didnt and when the country was torn in two when tennessee was torn in two who had a gun and who didnt mattered a hell of a lot more than the difference between lie and lay the other federal soldiers there were four or five of them looked at bradford in surprise he feared he knew what kind of surprise it was youre still alive they had to be thinking yes dammit im still alive he wanted to scream it but that wouldnt do him any good he made himself seem meek and mild the less the rebs worried about him the better his chances would be he had got out of fort pillow if he watched for his moment he would get out of this too but because hed got out of fort pillow his captors here werent inclined to take him on trust they let the other prisoners mount and ride without restrictions after he climbed up on his horse though they tied his feet together under the animal and they tied his hands to the reins they tied them tight and they used plenty of rope this is cruel he said what if i do fall off the horse will trample me or drag me to death then dont fall off you son of a bitch one of the confederates said me id pay five dollars in paper or even a dollar in silver to watch that i would come onlets get going another trooper said all this jawin just wastes our time how come youre so allfired eager dud the first reb asked anybodyd reckon you got yourself a lady friend up in brownsville he leered well what if i do dud said it aint against the law or nothin an if get the chance to see her thatd be right nice see her the other soldier said wouldnt you sooner tup her he might have been talking about a ram and a ewe most soldiers came off farms he was probably more used to talking about animals than about men and women never you mind what id sooner dud said lets ride thats all they rode the rest of the us prisoners had it easy they bantered back and forth with bedford forrests troopers giving as good as they got nobody seemed to hold anything against them they were out of the war now and they were glad of it the rebs seemed willing to let bygones be bygones not with bill bradford the cs troopers snarled at him whenever he said something they didnt want to let him down off his horse to ease himself go ahead and piss your pants dud said serve you right aw let him down another soldier said al d be right ticked if his saddle got piss stains on it cant say id blame him neither and so for the saddles sake if not for his own bradford was untied and allowed to go between a tree he wasnt allowed to go alone though dud covered him with a revolver as he unbuttoned his fly you try and run and ill blow it right off you the reb sounded as if he looked forward to it after that relaxing enough to do what hed come for wasnt easy but bradford managed he gave dud no excuse to pull the trigger no matter which part of him the reb aimed at when he walked back to the horse the rebs tied him on as securely as before they rode on through the hatchie bottom country toward brownsville how had forrest got his men through this ghastly terrain ahead of the news of their coming by driving them like cattle before him bradford supposed if forrest wasnt a demon in human shape a man possessed of superhuman energy and determination bradford had never seen anyone who was boy this is fun dud said as his horse squelched through mud the other rebs laughed so did a couple of the federal prisoners bill bradford didnt he just did more marveling if the roads were bad now they would have been worse when forrest and his men came through because it was raining then these miserable narrow tracks had had a day and a half to dry out since the confederates swarmed west along them and how had the rebs ever found their way through this maze of tracks without a guide chances were they would still be wandering in the swamp that man shaw bradford thought the rebel sympathizer whod escaped from fort pillow a day or two before forrest descended it bradford couldnt prove that he didnt remember seeing shaw in the fight but it seemed all too likely he wondered if he would meet a gloating shaw in brownsville he wondered if he would meet bedford forrest there too forrest wouldnt be gloating forrest would be what an educated man bradford didnt need long to come up with the right word forrest would be vindictive that was what he would be nathan bedford forrests body felt like one big bruise he hated staying in the saddle but he was too stubborn to climb down from his horse maybe captain anderson could have persuaded him to dismount and rest but anderson was still settling affairs back at fort pillow and so forrest rode on he came into brownsville at the van of his armyand he rode out the other side a few minutes later you always were a man in a hurry j b cowan remarked you ought to know forrest told the regimental surgeon cowan was his wifes first cousin the general commanding went on getting there ahead of the other fellow counts for more than almost anything even if you wear yourself down to a nub doing it cowan asked even then especially then forrest replied if you do more than the enemy figures youve got a prayer of doing you hold him in the palm of your hand its a hard road the surgeon observed its the only road i know forrest said i started with nothing you know that dammitand i made myself a man to be reckoned with i joined the army as a private soldier and im a major general now im not so young as i used to be i havent got much time to waste i will take the hardest road i have to as long as its the quickest one he wondered whether cowan would go on arguing with him but the regimental surgeon held his tongue he knows better than to try and talk me around forrest thought with an inward smile what will you do when you get to jackson cowan asked after a while rest let the rest of the men come ini know they wont all stick up with me forrest knew that for a while he would have men scattered all across the seventy miles between fort pillow and jackson and he couldnt do much about it sooner or later theyd come in he went on once theyre all gathered ill cipher out what to do with em nextor maybe ill get orders who knows will we be able to stay up here in tennessee any which way cowan inquired after what you did at fort pillow the damnyankees will be fit to be tied that was the idea when forrest said it it sounded more like idear if it gets too hot round those parts well slide on down to mississippi thats all but if they think they can keep me out of tennessee for good or even out of memphis for good theyd better think again is all ive got to tell you out of memphis how would you get in there its fortified to a faretheewell ill get in forrest spoke with supreme confidence he didnt say how he would get into memphis because he had no idea when the time came he would come up with something the west point men against whom he fought made their plans well in advance they figured out every little thing before they went and did it and then they thought they would take you by surprise bedford forrest laughed softly once youd fought one of those fellows youd fought all of them theyd all learned the same way of fighting and they all had the same bag of tricks they never figured out that you might know ahead of time what theyd try the way they were trained they were supposed to think alike the confederacy had a lot of generals and colonels whod learned at west point too couldnt they see that the yankees could read them like a book evidently notand a lot of time both sides seemed ignorant of how predictable they were because forrest had never learned all the fancy west point rules and regulations he was as far beyond the regular officers ken as a hawk was beyond a snapping turtles things seemed very simple to him you moved faster than the man you were fighting you hit him where he wouldnt expect it where he was weak you used fear as much as you used bullets a frightened enemy was an enemy who gave up too soon or who made mistakes that let you lick him and once you got him scared and jittery you never let up that thought made forrest mutter into his chin beard instead of going allout after the beaten yankees at chickamauga braxton bragg let them retreat into chattanoogawhich meant the only victory that soursouled son of a bitch ever won turned out not to be worth spit he had his chance his single solitary glorious chance to bring the war in the west back to life to make the confederate presence in tennessee and kentucky more than a matter of cavalry raiders he had it and he dropped it and he broke it and the confederacy wasnt likely to be able to pick up the pieces ever again i should have killed him forrest said by jesus i should have who are you talking about sir j b cowan asked major bradford whats that bedford forrest blinked brought back from what might have been to what was no i wasnt thinking about bradfordnot that he doesnt rate killing now i had somebody else in mind must be colonel hurst then the regimental surgeon sounded very sure of himself thats rightfielding hurst forrest let his wifes cousin down easy why not every confederate in tennessee knew fielding hurst needed killing stories were going round that forrest had come within inches of challenging braxton bragg to a duel but most people thought they were only stories forrest didnt say anything different what point to it if the confederate generals fought among themselves who gained but the federals still and all he knew the stories were truewere if anything less than the whole truth dr cowan grinned pleased with his own cleverness bedford forrest grinned amused the other man was so easy to fool if you let people believe what they wanted to believe anyhow you could get them to do almost anything but then cowan asked what will you do with bradford if our boys catch him the question was unpleasantly sharp dont rightly know forrest said an admission he seldom made i hated the son of a bitch before he broke his parole and he gave me plenty of reasons for it too i almost hope we dont catch him that way i wont have to make up my mind almost the surgeon said forrest nodded almost word got around it always did jack jenkins hated that truth but knew it was one as he rode east toward brownsville he heard the same question over and over again how the hell did you let that bradford son of a bitch get away it was dark he said at first he said he was a sutler he was wearing a sutlers clothes and he stunk like a goddamn polecat how in gods name was i supposed to know who he was that sounded reasonableto him anyway it didnt satisfy any of the men who flung the question in his face they didnt really want an answer they wanted somebody to blame and there he was his temper always short soon started to fray before long he stopped giving a reasonable answer when people asked him how he let bradford escape instead he said things like it just happened goddammit bad shit happens all the time this time it happened to me he got no sympathy he didnt expect any he wouldnt give anybody else much sympathy for letting bradford slip through his fingers the same miserable question came at him even more often his answer changed again he looked around and growled oh shut up goddammit that did some good most of forrests troopers were leery of pushing him too far you look like a treed coon one of them said i feel like a treed coon too jenkins repliedthat was one of the few things hed heard that made sense to him got all these bastards around the tree bayin their damnfool heads off on they rode into the morning every time somebody with a fast horse came up to jenkins he heard the hateful question again and he heard it every time he caught up to somebody with a slow horse and when they werent just coming out and asking it of him they were talking about him and pointing at him theres the fellow who aw shit jenkins mumbled yes he was likely to stay the fellow who for the rest of his life some mistakes were too damn big to let anybody ever get out from under them had he made one of those he didnt think so but what he thought didnt matter here what everybody else thought did and those nudges and murmurs and pointing fingers went on and on hey corporal arent you the one who let bradford get away puck you up the cornhole jenkins roared only after the words were out of his mouth did he realized hed cussed out a captain the officer started to say something then he got a good look at jenkinss face his mouth hung foolishly open for a moment as if he were a frog catching a fly he booted his horse up to a trot and rode away i bet i had murder in my eye jenkins thought not without pride i know goddamn well i had murder in my heart for some little while nobody bothered him oh people went on pointing and went on talking behind his back but he knew he couldnt do anything about that when a newcomer tried to ask him somethingand he knew what it would besomebody softly explained to the man that that wasnt a good idea not if you want to go on breathing it isnt jenkins thought and then every trooper around was cussing a blue streak and none of it had anything to do with him he was swearing too whoever was leading them east had led them astray the path petered out in the middle of a swamp they were going to have to double back and try again god i didnt need this somebody groaned and that summed things up just fine how the hell did we bollix this jenkins demanded lord almighty it aint like were the first bunch to go back to brownsville shouldnt whoever was at the front of this bunch have known where he was going the rotten skunk whoever had been at the front of that group of soldiers didnt want to admit it in his shoes jack jenkins wouldnt have wanted to admit it either something nasty would have happened to him if he did because it had to double back the group of cavalrymen from barteaus regiment with whom he was riding didnt get to brownsville till the late afternoon by then the people in the small town had had bands of troopers of varying sizes riding in for hours some houses still had the stainless banner and the confederate battle flag and the outdated stars and bars flying or hanging on their porches but no ladies were standing in the street offering the soldiers food the way they had when the regiment rode west to attack fort pillow rein in boys a first lieutenant called we may as well spend the night here we dont need to ride in the dark today and well make it to jackson tomorrow any which way that was the first piece of good news jenkins had heard in a long time even if he couldnt get a bed for the nightwhich didnt look likelyhe could sleep on a floor or in a shed or somewhere else under a roof roughing it was fine when you did it on purpose every once in a whilewhen you were going hunting say when you had to do it day after day after day it wore thin hed just dismounted when some soldiers came up from the south yall got lost worsen we did he jeered were not lost one of them replied were up from covington with prisoners well take em on to jackson in the morning prisoners jack jenkins looked them over that some wore blue hadnt meant much to himhed just thought they hadnt had a chance to dye yankee plunder one fellow had on rattylooking civilian clothes jenkins stiffened hed seen those shabby clothes before by moonlight as casually as he could he asked need somebody else to help bring em in the shabbily dressed prisoner jerked on the horse to which he was tied he recognized jenkinss voice the confederate captain in charge of the captives nodded sure corporal you can come along jenkins smiled like christmas xviii matt ward had watched the silver cloud and the platte valley steam away late the afternoon before chugging north against the current the gunboat and the steamer she escorted werent very fast but they looked as if they would get where they were going here today fort pillow wasnt a fort any more it was nothing but a bluff next to the mississippi captain charles anderson looked around and nodded in satisfaction that about does it he said to ward and the rest of the confederates still at the battle site i reckon weve done every single thing we set out to do bedford forrests aide was bound to be right about that forrests men hadnt just taken the place theyd run off the federals horses and captured all the cannon here theyd taken more than three hundred rifle muskets the rest probably lay in the river they had as much of the rest of the movable property as they could carry away and now theyd wrecked and burned all the buildings and huts in and around the fort the federals wouldnt have anything at all to use if they tried to put men in here again another federal steamer went by maybe it would find union soldiers whod got away and were hiding along the river ward eyed the smoke pouring from its stack which mixed with the smoke still in the air from the fires of the day before we ought to have boats on the mississippi ourselves he said captain anderson still stood close enough to hear him weve got a few he said we can move things across from louisiana and arkansas now and again but we have to sneak because we cant make ironclads to fight the damn yankees why not sir ward said they can do it they can build them anywhere along the ohio or the mississippi and send them downriver anderson answered we havent got any foundries on the river to do the job he made a sour face hells bells we havent got any towns on this side of the river the damnyankees sail up and down doing as they please theyve cut us in half may they rot in hell for it thats not good ward said no it isnt captain anderson agreed kirby smith is doing everything he can over in the transmississippi but what he does and what we do dont have a whole lot to do with each other on account of all those federal gunboats in between what can we do about that sir matt ward could look across the mississippi into arkansas if he cared to he could take a rowboat and get across to the other sideto the transmississippi captain anderson called it but if you wanted to move an armys worth of soldiers from one side of the big muddy to the other how would you go about it you couldnt not unless you wanted those damn gunboats swarming around you like flies around a fried chicken in summertime what can we do about it anderson echoed keep fighting the yankees as hard as we can keep licking them keep making them sweat keep making them bleed abe lincoln is up for reelection this fall if we make the north decide the war is more expensive than its worth if we make it decide the war is more goddamn trouble than its worth theyll throw that lincoln son of a bitch out on his ear whichever democrat they put in will make peace and send the blue bellies home and well have our own country then thats what we can do by god i understand sir ward looked respectfully at the officer who wasnt that much older than he was i really do understand when i joined up i did it so i could fight the damnyankees who doesnt anderson said yes sir but that was all i thought about you know what i mean what you said i didnt think about that even a little bit how the war and politics fit together i mean and they do they truly do youd best believe they do charles anderson agreed way things are now we wont ever drive the united states off our land with guns maybe we could have once upon a time but we lost too many chances but if we can make those yankee bastards sick of fighting us theyll give up and go home and we win that way too so thats what weve got to try and do ward looked at the remains of what had been fort pillow well sir seems to me we gave them a pretty good tweak right here seems the same way to me captain anderson eyed him when you let bradford liquor you up so he could get away i reckoned you were one of those fellows who re good in a brawl but not so good at thinking if youll forgive me but you arent that way are you i hope not sir i like to find out how things tick ward answered bradford he tricked me god damn him i wonder if the son of a bitch got away sweet jesus i hope not id feel like hell if he did hell run into a minnie some other way thats all to matts relief anderson didnt seem to hate him for now weve still got our own war to fight you ready yes sir matt said its all in your mind major william bradford told himself over youre making it up to give yourself something to worry about he laughed sourly as if he didnt have enough already here he was locked up in the brownsville jail the way he had been the night before in covington some time tomorrow hed head for jackson and a new confrontation with nathan bedford forrest that wasnt anything to look forward to with joy and eager anticipation but right now it seemed the least of his troubles he couldnt shake the feeling that the corporal whod volunteered to join the guards on the way to jackson was the fellow hed cozened into letting him out past the original extended works around fort pillow had that fellow out there on sentry had two stripes on his sleeve for the life of himyes for the life of himbradford wasnt sure his voice seemed much too familiar though and the man had a devil of a nasty leer the kind of leer that said he might not have known who bill bradford was before but by christ now he did and somebody was going to pay because he knew somebody bradford muttered me what had the rebs done to that corporal when they found out hed let the enemy commander get away how much did he have to pay back and how much did he hate bradford for tricking him for taking away his pride a lot of southern men were touchy as so many greasers about their pride if you wounded it they would pay you back no matter what it cost maybe hes not the one bradford tried to make himself believe it he stretched out on the lumpy mustysmelling cot in the little cell and tried to rest itll be fine tomorrow his mind insisted youre getting yourself all worn to a frazzle over nothing but even though he closed his eyes sleep wouldnt come except it did when his eyes came open again the gray light of dawn seeped into the cell through the little barred window outside a mockingbird trilled and whistled why not the bird was free the jailer gave him bread and butter for breakfast the butter was just starting to go off he could eat it but it left a sour aftertaste on his palate that the bad coffee he drank with it couldnt erase the jailer watched him eat through the window set into the door as soon as he finished the man unlocked the door to get the cup back he had a pistol two more men with guns also covered bradford i wasnt going anywhere bradford said not while we can shoot you if you try one of the guards said at noon bradford got more bread and butter and coffee the butter was further gone by then he ate it anyhow time dragged on the cell got warm and close sweat rolled off him at last late in the afternoon the jailer unlocked the door again come on out that pistol added persuasion to the words out bradford came the jailer gestured with the gun numbly bradford walked outside the mockingbird hed heard beforeor maybe another oneflew out of a nearby oak white wing patches flashing every time it flapped the other federal prisoners waited out there they hadnt had to spend the time in jail the guards whod brought them up from covington waited there too so did the corporal whod volunteered to join them was he bradford eyed him with fearful fascination he couldnt tell it had been dark the moon still young and going in and out of the clouds get up on your horse bradford said one of the confederate soldiers get up and ill lash you aboard by the way he talked the federal officer might have been a sack of dried peas you dont need to tie mei swear it bradford said you swore you wouldnt run off from fort pillow too you lying son of a bitch that wasnt the guard who was busy binding bradfords legs beneath him it was the newly met corporal he sounded like a man who knew what he was talking about bradford bit his lip he couldnt even tell the reb he was wrong the other trooper tied his hands and tied them to the reins that ought to do it he said lets ride off they went not at any particularly fast clip by now the prisoners even major bradford were afterthoughts no need to hurry with them the battle was won sooner or later they would get to jackson when they did bedford forrest would deal with them as he got around to it had bradford not been a prisoner of war had he not been tied to the horse he rode he would have savored the glorious spring day it was perfect not too cool not too hot with the sun shining cheerily in a sky powderpuffed with scattered white clouds the grass and growing bushes were green greener greenest so were the leaves on some of the trees others not yet in leaf remained barebranched and skeletal more mockingbirds sang catbirds yowled a robin hopping around after worms chirped somewhere deeper in the woods a wild turkey gobbled once the riders got away from the town stinks of brownsville which didnt take long the very air smelled fresh and clean and pure yes it would have been a pleasant ride a more than pleasant ride if not for the ropes around bradfords wrists and anklesand if the corporal whod added himself to the guard party hadnt kept talking to the other confederate troopers in a low voice every so often he would point bill bradfords way which did nothing to improve the federal officers peace of mind are you sure one of the other soldiers asked loud enough for bradford to hear him clearly sure as my names jack jenkins the corporal answered sure as that son of a bitch his voice dropped so bradford couldnt make out what he said next whatever it was the federal didnt think he wanted it applied to him theyd come perhaps three miles perhaps five when one of the troopers said well stop here for a little bit anybody want to ease himself i do a federal said he swung down from his horse and went off to stand behind a tree one of the confederates lit a pipe the soldier in blue came back buttoning the last button on his fly he pointed to the pipe can i have a couple of puffs of that the reb passed it to him he smoked for a little while then gave it back thank you kindly how about you bradford the corporal named jack jenkins said bradford considered he didnt particularly need anything but if he said no the rebs might use it as an excuse to torment him later by refusing to pause he nodded all right youll have to let me loose the trooper with the pipe untied him after bradford dismounted he stood by the horse for a moment opening and closing his hands to work more feeling into them then he started for the woods jack jenkins and four other rebs one a lieutenant came with him dont want you wandering off now the way you did at fort pillow jenkins said i wasnt going anywhere bradford said as he had early that morning his lips were suddenly stiff with fear that was the sentry hed tricked and the man knew him for who he was please he whispered i wasnt well you damn well wont the reb gestured with his rifle musket go on terror making his legs light his knees almost unstrung bradford went the rebs urged him deeper into the woods so that trees hid the path down which theyd been riding let me do what i need to do he said at last when theyd gone about fifty yards a little to his surprise they did spreading out to all sides around the oak he chose so he couldnt get away no matter how much he wanted toand he did with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might at last after what seemed a very long time he finished he did up his trousers and stepped away from the tree look jenkins said loudly son of a bitch is getting away he swung up his rifle musket so did the other confederate soldiers no bradford cried he fell to his knees treat me as a prisoner of war please i fought you as a man and the guns spoke in a stuttering roar hot lead slammed into him from three directions at once he slumped over the ground came up and hit him one more blow in the face he tried to get up but only his left arm seemed to want to do anything his brain told it to and it wasnt enough not by itself corporal jenkins strolled up and stood over him and slowly and deliberately reloaded you shiteating bastard you got by me once but im damned if youll do it twice he said and aimed the rifle musket again no bradford moaned through blood in his mouth through nerves telegraphing torment though darkness swelling before his eyes and the rifle musket boomed once more and the darkness rose up and swallowed everything through the rising flood he heard a laugh and the words shot trying to escape and then it overflowed and he never heard or saw anything again illinois the land of liberty abe lincolns very own state a free state a state where owning a nigger was against the law ben robinson knew there were places like that but hed never imagined he would come to one it was an awful lot like getting to heaven and nearly made getting shot worthwhile nearly he lay on an ironframed military cot in ward n of the mound city general hospital a big sign said it was ward n people talked about it a dozen times a day now he knew what an n looked like benjamin robinson he had four of them in his name it wasnt much of a start for learning his letters but a start it was colored soldiers from fort pillow a couple of dozen of them crowded the ward charlie key was here and sandy cole and aaron fentis too theyd all survived their wounds same as ben had dr stewart gordon the white surgeon who ran the ward said they were all likely to get better he seemed to know what he was talking about and to know what he was doing too only one man had died since the silver cloud and the platte valley brought them up here and poor bob hall had been in a bad way a reb had hacked up his head and his hand with a saber while he lay sick down at fort pillow another soldier tom adison had lost an eye and a chunk of his nose to a mini ball he wasnt in good shape dr gordon looked worried every time he examined him the rest were going to make it every time dr gordon changed his dressing ben stared at his own wound every time he liked what he saw oh yes he would have liked not getting shot in the first place ever so much better but the edges of the gouge in his thigh were healing together the wound wasnt festering it didnt have pus dripping from it it didnt stink it washe wasgetting better one morningben thought it was ten days after the fight at fort pillow but he might have been off one either waythe surgeon came into ward n earlier than usual i want you to listen to me boys he said somethings up he was younger than a lot of the colored soldiers he was talking to but hed treated every last one of them and was plainly doing the best he could with them ben traded glances with sandy cole and charlie key but he was inclined to give the surgeon the benefit of the doubt somethings up gordon repeated were going to have men from the joint committee on the conduct of the war visit you today senator wade and congressman gooch even a colored artilleryman whod been a soldier for only a little while knew about the joint committee on the conduct of the war when something went wrong with the union war effort the members of the committee swooped down like eaglessome said like vultures to pin the blame on whoever deserved it or whoever they thought deserved it they could blight an officers career they could and they had and by all accounts they liked doing it do jesus us niggers gonna be in trouble for losing the fight robinson asked in more than a little alarm but the surgeon shook his head no no no so help me no as far as theyre concerned youre heroes for fighting as well as you did no what theyre after is making bedford forrest out to be a monster on account of the massacre they aim to use it to fire up people in the north to fight the rebs harder i got you ben said but he couldnt help adding if you was ever a slave you already got all the reason you need to fight them confederate bastards hard as you can there are no slaves up here dr gordon reminded him a lot of people up here have never set eyes on a colored man let alone owned one the men from the committee want to remind them what the war is all about theres an election coming up you know if honest abe doesnt go back to the white house the democrats will give the damn rebs whatever they want do jesus ben said again hed imagined the federals beaten he knew the confederates fought hard but hed never dreamt the united states might just give up the fight he felt better when he saw the members of the joint committee on the conduct of the war congressman daniel gooch was about forty with a round face reddish hair and beard and worried eyes behind small oval spectacle lenses senator benjamin wade was at least twenty years older and quite a bit tougher he combed his graying thinning hair straight back his eyes were narrow and shrewd his mouth a disapproving slash across his cleanshaven face he effortlessly dominated the proceedings we are going to get to the bottom of the bad faith and treachery that seem to have become the settled policy of forrest and his command wade declared in a rasping voice that brooked no argument we must convince the authorities of our government of this fact even the most skeptical must believe that it is the intention of the rebel authorities not to recognize the officers and men of our colored regiments as entitled to the treatment accorded by all civilized nations to prisoners of war and at fort pillow the brutality and cruelty of the rebels were most fearfully exhibited a secretary took down his words as he spoke them this man means it robinson realized hed always known the rebs were in grim earnest hed sometimes doubted his own side was here though here stood a man with as much iron in his spine as even nathan bedford forrest had congressman gooch started questioning the colored man closest to him elias falls of company a falls spoke of what hed seen and heard during the fight he said bedford forrest had ordered the firing stopped and that a secesh officer had threatened to arrest a soldier for shooting a negro the secretary wrote down his words just like senator wades when falls finished testifyinghe didnt take longben wade spoke again that will be about enough of that we are here to show the people of the united states what monsters the rebels are we are going to do that if you men want to testify to anything else do it before the confederate congress do you understand me after that no one talked much about officers trying to stop the shooting congressman gooch asked most of the questions senator wade chimed in now and again they worked their way through the ward coming closer and closer to the cot where ben robinson lay at last the secretary told him raise your right hand when he did the white man said do you solemnly swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help you god yes suh robinson answered impressed by the gravity of the phrases i have sworn in the witness sir the secretary said formally to daniel gooch you may proceed thank you goochs voice was a light tenor his new england accent gave ben a little trouble but he managed were you at fort pillow in the fight there gooch asked yes suh ben said the secretary scribbled taking down his words for all time the congressman took him through what had happened and how he got shot gooch asked if he had seen the confederates burn any soldiers he said no because he hadnt goochs mouth tightened a little but he went on to ask about burials and whether ben had seen anyone buried alive robinson mentioned the one negro who was still working his hand when he went into the ground were any rebel officers around when the rebels were killing our men gooch asked yes suhlots of them robinson answered did they try to keep their men from killing our men i never heard them say so ben explained how bedford forrest had ridden his horse over him three or four times daniel gooch let him finish then asked where were you from i come from south carolina robinson replied have you been a slave yes suh thank you uh sergeant gooch went on to the colored man in the next bed a private from company b named dan tyler he asked him the same sorts of questions hed asked ben he and senator wade continued through the ward till theyd heard the stories of most of the negroes there even badly wounded tom adison got to speak his piece thank you men ben wade said when they finished thank you for your bravery down south and thank you for what you told us here today we aim to make it so that everyone in the whole country will remember fort pillow for as long as this nation lives it deserves remembering and thats a fact men will go into battle crying remember fort pillow and we will pay the rebels back in their own coin never doubt it men for we will he lumbered out of the room congressman gooch and the secretary hurrying along in his wake we was part of history ben robinson said in wonder as the door closed behind them we reckoned we was just soldierin but we was part of history i be damned mea part history up till now history like freedom had been something for whites only in an odd way a completely unexpected way he felt more of a man than he ever had before mack leaming wasnt happy and the pain from his wound wasnt the only thing to make him unhappy like everyone else whod lived to come north from fort pillow he knew the officials from the joint committee on the conduct of the war were on their way west to find out what went wrong he knew when they reached mound city and he knew when they questioned the negroes whod survived bedford forrests murderous attack senator wade and congressman gooch got to the coons before they asked the white survivors a single question and if that wasnt wrong lieutenant leaming had never run into anything that was not until the following day did wade and gooch and their obsequious secretary come to ward b where leaming lay recuperating the surgeon a tall thin dolefullooking man named charles vail came early in the morning to change his dressings vail also stopped by the bed of captain john potter who lay not far away he looked at potterwhod led company b of the thirteenth tennessee cavalryand shook his head no change leaming asked im afraid not dr vail answered with a head wound like that hes in gods hands not mine and god hasnt doled out many miracles lately potters almost hopeless i wish i could tell you different but he spread his hands while leaming was digesting that the secretary whod accompanied messrs wade and gooch to mound city came into the ward he spoke with vail the surgeon led him over to leamings bed good morning lieutenant the secretary murmured his voice and clothes were prissily precise a cornholer leaming wondered wouldnt be surprised but that was neither here nor there good morning leaming said i hope you continue to improve the secretary told him hes making good progress dr vail put in his prognosis is favorable unlike poor captain potters i am glad to hear it the secretary gave his attention back to leaming the gentlemen from the joint committee are most desirousmost desirous sirof presenting the massacre at fort pillow to the people of the united states in terms as emphatic and as condemnatory of bedford forrest and his brigands as possible any assistance you can offer towards that end will be greatly appreciated do i make myself plain i think you do sir leaming answered wade and gooch wanted him to slang the rebs and they wouldnt mind if he stretched things a little to do it neither would he after everything that had happened at fort pillow he wanted to pay them back any way he could the effete secretary withdrew to return a few minutes later with the senator and the congressman he administered the oath to leaming then took out his notebook and pen while daniel gooch started the questioning with the secretarys encouragement leaming wasnt above stretching things when he talked about the truce he complained that the rebs whod come down to the riverside to meet the olive branch took advantage of the white flag to improve their position because the steamer was not a party to the ceasefire that wasnt exactly so but it felt as if it ought to be congressman gooch nodded gravely the secretarys pen slid across the paper leaming told how hed been shot and robbed and succored only by his fellow freemason when he described how hed been carried aboard the platte valley senator wade took over for gooch he wanted to know whod been drinking with the rebs leaming hesitated about putting us officers in hot water and truthfully said he hadnt seen anyone doing so wade did not look happy leaming got the idea he seldom looked happy but he looked even less so now do you know what became of major bradford wade asked he escaped unhurt as far as the battle was concerned leaming answered i was told the next morning on the boat that he had been paroled i did not see him after that night a little later congressman gooch asked what do you estimate forrests force to have been from all i could see and learn i should suppose he had from seven thousand to ten thousand men leaming answered major booth hadnt thought so but major booth was dead and the larger number better suited the union cause a few questions later leaming got the chance to trot out one more rumor i have been told that major bradford was afterwards taken out by the rebels and shot that seems to be the general impression and i presume it was so thank you lieutenant gooch and wade said together no further questions wade added after the secretary closed his notebook and put away his pen daniel gooch nodded to leaming thank you lieutenant he said that was very effective testimony i was doing my best to help your excellency leaming replied well your best is damned good son ben wade rumbled well hold bedford forrests toes to the fire with what you had to sayjust see if we dont his face darkened with anger and well put a stop to the despicable practice some of our officers have of treating white men on the other side better than they treat colored soldiers in their own uniform despicable i say and we will stamp it out er yes sir till hed seen the negro artillerymen at fort pillow fight mack leaming would have been that kind of federal officer himself fighting for the union and fighting for the negro had seemed two very different things to him they still did as a matter of factbut he had more sense than to admit it to the implacable senator from ohio if i may be permitted to say so lieutenant your testimony was exactly along the lines envisioned by the committee when it voted to send senator wade and congressman gooch west to investigate this tragic incident the secretary observed you told them what they wanted to hear leaming heard the words behind the words good he said the secretary had told him what the distinguished gentlemen wanted and he was glad to oblige this was a war of soldiers and cannons and gunboats yes but it was also a war of politics he could see november ahead just as wade and gooch could if lincoln failed then if the democrats prevailed then all the unions sacrifices would be for nothing he and his comrades had lost the battle at fort pillow they might yet win the struggle to define what happened there and winning that struggle would go some little way toward winning the war as a whole leaming shifted carefully on the cot his wound still pained him wounded or not though he might still pain nathan bedford forrest shot trying to get away was he bedford forrest said stalking through the parlor of the duke house in jackson as he had while ordering the attack on fort pillow yes sir captain anderson said stolidly so the men who were bringing major bradford and the other prisoners here report well lord knows hes no loss hes a gain by god but forrest studied his assistant adjutant general so they say eh but you dont believe em do you anderson shook his head how come you dont forrest asked well sir for one thing among the men who were supposed to be bringing him in was corporal jack jenkins anderson answered corporal oh a fortnight after the fight at fort pillow forrest needed a moment to place the name but only a moment the fellow he gave the slip to getting out of the fort the very same anderson said you reckon jenkins got his own back then sir i cant prove a thing all the men tell the same story anderson replied and it certainly is something bradford might have done when you consider that he did break his parole in leaving fort pillow uhhuh forrest wondered what to dobut again not for long well charlie i dont suppose i need to ask any more questions bradford got what was coming to him and by my lights he earned it if anybody ever kicks up a stink about itand who would kick up a stink about a skunk like thatshot trying to escape ought to quiet things down eh yes sir i suppose so captain anderson didnt sound overjoyed at his decision but he didnt sound as if he wanted to make a fuss either that suited bedford forrest fine major bradford hadnt been worth a fuss while he was alive and sure as hell he wasnt worth one dead anything else i need to know forrest asked news from memphis is that a couple of federal congressmen are nosing around trying to figure out where the blame goes for losing fort pillow anderson said are they by god forrest said his aide nodded forrest threw back his head and laughed im glad to hear it the devil fry me black as a nigger if im not i was starting to believe our side was the only one with fools in congress theyre shouting and wailing about how we massacred all the poor darkiesand the homemade yankees too anderson said they can shout and wail as much as they please bradford had the chance to surrender and he damn well didnt take it i told him i wouldnt answer for my men if he didnt so he only got what was coming to him forrest growled besides we did take prisoners we gave some of em back to the federals by the river i did that myself anderson said of course you did bedford forrest said and weve got more prisoners going on down to mississippi with the men and there are niggers in both batches am i right or wrong you dont need to ask me sir captain anderson said loyally i know damn well youre right nathan bedford forrest dropped it there hed won at fort pillow which was all that really mattered but he also knewhowever little he cared to admit ithis men had got out of hand when they took the fort going up against negroes with guns and tennessee tories it wasnt surprising hed expected it after bradford refused his surrender demand he might even have had trouble enforcing a peaceful surrender had the federal commander yielded his soldiers hated the men they were fighting it was as simple as that they say all the yankees nigger troops are taking an oath to avenge fort pillow anderson added they can say any stupid thing they want and the niggers can swear any stupid oath they want forrest said scornfully it wont amount to a hill of beans next time they bump up against our boys with an oath or without one nigger troops cant stand up against white men i should hope not sir anderson said dont worry about it charlie because they damn well cant just remember the bloodstains in the mississippi forrest remembered them himself with somber satisfaction he didnt care to remember how long the garrison in fort pillow had fought how defiant the enemy had been or how outnumbered they were since hed won he didnt need to remember any of those things get there first with the most men hed done that whenever and wherever he had to do it again he expected he could he had less faith in the confederacys other generals with the partial exception of robert e lee joe johnston was bound to be an improvement on braxton bragg forrest couldnt think of anything breathing that wouldnt be including the mangiest army mule but could johnston stand against the federals when they finally started south from chattanooga could anyone nathan bedford forrest didnt know in one way it wasnt his worry hed done what he aimed to do and he saw no reason he couldnt go on doing it for a long time but if the great confederate armies fell what difference did it make could he go on bushwhacking even after they fell if i have to i will he thought grimly if it means holding the niggers down i will he wasnt afraid what concerned him were ways and means he shrugged broad shoulders thinking about bushwhacking and defeats to other generals was also borrowing trouble the daytoday routine of war was enough to worry about and then some soon he and his staff would follow the rest of his men down to mississippi well lick em yet charlie he said of course we will sir anderson answered bedford forrest hoped he meant it historical note sergeant benjamin robinson lieutenant mack leaming major william bradford and of course major general nathan bedford forrest are historical figures private matt ward and corporal jack jenkins are fictitious the thirteenth tennessee cavalry us was also known as bradfords battalion and as the fourteenth tennessee cavalry us there was another thirteenth tennessee cavalry us that served mostly in the eastern part of the state because contemporary sources discussing the events of april call it the thirteenth i have used that name here coal creek is now more often known as cold creek again as the first name seems in more common use at the time of the fight at fort pillow i chose it here piecing together exactly what happened at fort pillow on that eventful day is anything but easy there are four principal primary sources the contemporary reports from both sides in the official records of the war of the rebellion the testimony collected by messrs wade and gooch of the us congressional joint committee on the conduct of the war immediately after the engagement and published as the fort pillow massacre the confederate rejoinder in jordan and pryors book the campaigns of general nathan bedford forest and of forrests cavalry in essence forrests own military memoir and wyeths biography the life of general nathan bedford forrest which is written from a southern point of view and is generally sympathetic to forrest and his men the problem is that reconciling events in the contemporary documentsparticularly in the fort pillow massacreand those of the two accounts inclining more toward bedford forrests viewpointis often next to impossible knowing whom to believe or whether to believe anyone gets tricky the accounts of forrests backers are unabashedly racist in them that negro troops are none too brave and that blacks are mentally inferior to whites are givens they seem to imply that the insults the colored artillerymen hurled at forrests troopers from the earthworks of fort pillow justified a massacre in and of themselves this should leave the fort pillow massacre as a more reliable source except that it is a propaganda piece in its own right designed to paint the confederates in general and bedford forrest in particular in colors as dark as possible forrests force of about men was inflated to from to the account emphasizes the slaughter of soldiers white and particularly black after the surrender of fort pillowbut there was no surrender not in any formal sense bradford acting in the dead major booths name refused to give one and the fort was taken by storm trying to find out what happened to major bradford after the fighting ended is another case in point proconfederate sources say that he was well treated was given dinner by colonel mcculloch and gave his parole not to escape so he could bury his brother theodorick who was killed when fort pillow was stormed bradford broke his parole was recaptured in civilian clothes and was shot while being taken from brownsville to jackson where forrest was jordan and pryor say p note on the way he again attempted to escape soon after which one of the men shot him mainly due to private vengeance for wellauthorized outrages committed by bradford and his band upon the defenseless families of the men of forrests cavalry while at fort pillow he was treated with the utmost consideration and civility wyeth writing a generation later p note says there is nothing in the records to show that the men who murdered major bradford were ever brought to trial for this unwarrantable act he does recognize that it should not have been done my account of bradfords last moments is based on the testimony of trader w r mclagan as reported in the official records of the war of the rebellion which shows that he was shot in cold blood rather than after an escape attempt meanwhile though what motivated bradford to break his parole an affidavit from two us lieutenants fort pillow massacre p states major william f bradford commanding our forces was fired upon after he had surrendered the garrison he never did so the rebels told him he could not surrender he ran into the river and swam out some yards they all the time firing at him but failing to hit him he was hailed by an officer and told to return to the shore he did so but as he neared the shore the riflemen discharged their pieces at him again again they missed he ran up the hillside among the enemy with a white handkerchief in his hand in token of his surrender but still they continued to fire upon him when they found they could not hit him they allowed him to give himself up as a prisoner and paroled him to the limits of the camp proconfederate sources say nothing of any of this if a tenth of it is true bradford had good reason to mistrust the rebels consideration and civility the same affidavit composed only six days after the combat at fort pillow also asserts they the confederates immediately killed all the officers who were over the negro troops excepting one who has since died from his wounds they took out from fort pillow about one hundred and some odd prisoners white and forty negroes they hung and shot the negroes as they passed along toward brownsville until they were rid of them all out of the six hundred troops convalescents included which were at the fort they have only about one hundred prisoners all whites and we have about fifty wounded who are paroled these claims are in detail demonstrably false forrests official report and jordan and pryor list by name us prisoners these include three officers set above the colored artillerymen and close to enlisted men almost all of them black from those units these in addition to the wounded taken up to cairo and mound city nor were negroes hung and shot on the way to brownsville nevertheless the union officers affidavit touches on something vitally important in the civil war as a whole and in the fight at fort pillow the matter of race anyone who doubts that slavery played the most important role in causing the war need look no further than south carolinas ordinance of secession and the confederate constitution which did its best to make the peculiar institution legally impregnable for all time to come at fort pillow both white and black union troops suffered heavy casualties at confederate hands once forrests men broke in proportionately though blacks had about twice as many killed as whites this cannot be and surely is not coincidence to quote from the lieutenants affidavit once more major anderson forrests assistant adjutant general stated that they did not consider colored men as soldiers but as property and as such being used by our people they had destroyed them but this property had just spent several hours firing cannon at the confederates and shooting rifle muskets at them are we to believe that forrests troopers disposed of them the way they might have for instance burned down a barn that sheltered white federal soldiers it seems unlikely to say the least as bruce catton and others have noted hand in hand with the belief that negroes could not fight went another almost directly opposite belief that they would fight like demons if they were ever roused forrests men seem to have been reacting to this fear and to have been trying to make sure blacks stayed intimidated by the whites who had ruled and owned them for so long they were as outraged and alarmed by negroes in arms as matadors would have been by bulls that could use swords of their own this effort at intimidation failed remember fort pillow became a rallying cry for colored soldiers in blue for the last year of the war in the civil war untrained black troops generally performed about as well as untrained white troops this despite their own superiors frequent lack of confidence in their abilities and the confederates strong motivation to oppose them as fiercely as possible that such questions do not arise today is in no small measure due to the sacrifices these men so many of them born into servitude made proconfederate sources deny that any massacre took place or blame the killings that did take place on the fury and excitement accompanying the storming of the fort the second of these may well have some validity the first does not it is plain that killings continued well after fort pillow fell that similar things happened in other places is true but does not erase the unprovoked slaughter of men trying to yield it should also be noted that while the colored artillerymen in fort pillow suffered more than their white counterparts the troopers of the thirteenth tennessee cavalry us did not have an easy time of it in tennessee as in kentucky and missouri the civil war was not country against country or state against state but neighbor against neighbor because the war was so personal it was uncommonly ferocious people knew who was on which sideknew and made foes pay jordan and pryor pp write many of bradfords men were known to be deserters from the confederate army and the rest were men of the country who entertained a malignant hatred toward confederate soldiers their families and friends bradford and his subalterns had traversed the surrounding country with detachments robbing the people besides venting upon the wives and daughters of southern soldiers the most opprobrious and obscene epithets with more than one extreme outrage upon the persons of these victims of their hate and lust col fielding hurst commanding the sixth tennessee cavalry us also operated in the same area he levied contributions on towns in western tennessee to keep them from supporting the confederates in us brigadier general edward hatch noted that hurst has already taken about out of west tennessee in blackmail when colonel of the sixth cavalry union this supports forrests assertion of march that on or about the th day of february under threats of burning the town hurst extorted from the citizens of jackson tennessee forrest also accused hursts men as noted in wyeth pp of torturing mutilating and murdering captured confederates whether this is true cannot be certainly known years after the fact but it was a hard war in those parts when the confederates had more soldiers in the neighborhood than the federals did they fight a kinder gender war to put it as mildly as possible that is hard to believe they had exactly the same sort of scores to settle as their us counterparts and just as much zeal to settle them and at fort pillow two groups of men they hated more than anyone else on earth were delivered into their hands bedford forrest had warned major bradford he could not answer for his men if they got into fort pillow and they proceeded to prove he knew what he was talking about of course forrest issued the same warning whenever he assaulted a us garrison the most compelling piece of evidence that he meant it this time was his decision to hang back from the fighting in almost every engagement where men he commanded went into action he fought at the fore true this time he was dazed and bruised after his horse fell on him when shot but that seems too small a reason for a man who ignored gunshot wounds to stay out of the fray more likely he understood what would happen if his men got into the fort understood they would get in and stayed away while the savagery was at its worst to keep from having to try to play king canute against the blooddimmed tide we remember fort pillow today because it is a microcosm of what the civil war was all about it showed that blacks could fight could be men like any others and it showed how determined white southerners were not to give them the chance it also showed that an inexperienced major was no match for the best cavalry commander on either side even with earthworks and a gunboat to help him forrest won the battle the union won the war in many ways the south won the peace for the next hundred years only in the past couple of generations have we begun to confront the issue of how to make the black man truly equal to the white we still have a long way to go looking back at what happened at fort pillow though tells us how far weve come
