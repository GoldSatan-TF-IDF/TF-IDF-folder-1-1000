charles todd legacy of the dead glasgow the two women sat huddled together in the small carriage looking around them in dismay staring at the filthy closedin street the drunken old man sprawled in one of the doorways the tall tenements ugly and bleak and perilously illkept there was no grace here only an air of despondency and gloom and poverty its a horrible place one said at last she was the elder but not by much they were both young and very frightened are you quite sure this is the street we want i cant believe her companion the reins lying in her lap let the words die in answer the passenger dug in her purse for the tattered piece of paper pulled it out and read it again her lips were trembling and she felt cold sick look for yourself oh the paper slipped from her fingers and she caught it just before it tumbled into the fetid running gutter beneath the wheel it was the street and the house they had searched over an hour to find there was silence only the rain and the whistle of a train somewhere in the distance making any sound at all the horse waited patiently youll remember wont you the older woman went on breathlessly im mrs cook and youre sarah my mother had a housekeeper called mrs cook and a sewing woman called sarah that makes it easier for me she stared at the house its a cursed place dreadful i only have to remember who you are and ive called you that all day mrs cook dont fret soyoull make yourself ill yes she smoothed the rug across her knees felt its dampness the horse blew shifting uncomfortably in the rain finally the older woman squeezed her companions hand and said we must go in sarah were expected it must be nearly time they climbed stiffly out of the carriage two respectable young women looking as out of place here as they felt the stench of bad sewers and boiled cabbage overlaid with coal smoke and dirty streets heavy in the dampness seemed to wrap itself around them a miasma of the city they made their way up to the door stepping over old newsprint and brown sacking that had been turned to the consistency of porridge by the downpour lifting the latch they could just see down a dark awful tunnel that was only a rubbishlittered hallway but seemed like the final path to hell the door they were after was the second on the left a barely discernible number three on a grimy card marking it someone shouted come to their tentative knock and they found themselves in a bare highceilinged room with a halfdozen brokendown chairs and no windows it was cold with damp smelled of cigars and stale beer and to their fastidious eyes hadnt been cleaned in years they could hear someone crying in the next room beyond a second door the older woman caught her friends hand and said fsarahim going to be sick no its only fright here sit down she quickly found the best chair and brought it forward then took another one for herself it wobbled one leg uneven a nondescript paint peeled from the walls and ceiling gave the floor a dappled look and the old brown carpet in the center seemed to be woven of all the hopelessness that had been brought here the older of the two began to tremble im not frightenedim terrified it will be all rightwait and see it was a comforting lie and they both recognized it for what it was they sat there for a time not speaking their hands gripped together their faces blanched with the thought of what must lie ahead the crying went on and on and overhead there was the sound of furniture being shifted first this way then that an endless screech that seemed half human half demon somewhere in the hallway a mans voice shouted and they both jumped watching the inner door they could feel the minutes drag into the half hour sarah found herself wishing it would open then dreading that it would theyd been here a very long timewhy had no one come out to speak to them they had been expected at two sharp if only the crying would stop suddenly the older woman stood up no i cant do it her voice was thick unnaturally loud to her own ears you must hell kill you if you dont id rather kill myself oh god i cant carry the memory of this place around with me for the rest of my life i cant it was a mistake i want to go home sarahtake me home for the love of heaven take me home her friend compassion in her eyes said youre sure its not to be done again i cant borrow the carriage again without questions being asked no just take me home she was shaking in earnest cold with dread cold with fear cold with the decision she knew she dared not make her friend put an arm around her shoulders and in the hallway she was sick leaning there for several minutes in such pain that she seemed to collapse in on herself frail and helpless weak to the point of fainting her breath a sob she pressed her forehead against the drab dirty paint grateful for its coolness they could hear voices behind the other doors barely muffledchildren crying a man swearing a woman singing something mournful and offkey a cat meowing impatiently pans banging and thumps as if somewhere someone was beating a carpet but mercifully no one came out into the hall stillthey mightat any moment can you walk as far as the carriage her companion asked softly i must try the older woman straightened herself with an effort and pressed a handkerchief to her lips i wish id never come herei wish id never heard of this place much less seen it if i died how would i have faced him with this place on my soul he would understand he would its what made him special poor man yes they linked arms for comfort and walked unsteadily back to the outside door it swung open as they reached it and a man smelling strongly of sweat and too much beer grinned knowingly at them for an instant eyes raking both of them the tenants here must be aware of what went on in number three sarah felt herself flush with embarrassment but the man held the door wide and let them pass unmolested it was all the older woman could do to climb back into the carriage once there she slumped to the side clinging to one of the braces that held the top in place her companion gently wrapped the damp blanket around her and looked pityingly at her what were they to do what were they to do she took her own seat remembered she hadnt untied the horse and climbed down again several people were coming down the street now hurrying past heads bowed their shoes splashing in the puddles three children grubbyfaced and thin stopped to stare at her knowing her for a stranger before running on a sudden gust of wind sent skirts whipping and two houses away a mans hat blew off to roll down the street like a top the rain began in earnest and she barked her shin climbing back to her seat close to tears herself she lifted the reins and spoke to the horse walk on it was a very long drive back to where theyd come from long and cold and wet and dreary she glanced at the other woman from time to time saw that she was silently crying with her eyes closed her lower lip caught between her teeth her pale face reflected misery and exhaustion i dont know how id feel sarah said to herself despairingly in her shoes bleak of heart afraid but ill think of something god help me i must think of something we cant come back here again we havent the strength it was very late when they reached their destination the town was dark and still a dog howling somewhere the wind whispering around the church tower and swooping among the gravestones of the churchyardas if confiding the latest news sarah thought turning the old horse toward his stable im so weary im imagining things she glanced for the hundredth time at the woman beside her her eyes were still closed but she wasnt asleep were home she told her friend gently trying not to startle her they were wet through hungry because theyd been reluctant to stop along the way at the rough pubs or places where decent travelers stayed they had been afraid of being seen of being recognized of someone remembering that theyd been on the road from glasgow where they werent supposed to be yes she opened her eyes saw the churchyard and shuddered the cold white stones seemed to be pointing fingers i wish i were dead too following a path through the stones with her eyes the younger woman murmured with infinite sadness so do i duncarrick the letters began to arrive in the middle of june hardly more than a few words scribbled in cheap ink on cheap paper fiona never discovered who had received the first of them or evenin the beginningwhat had caused the coldness toward her it seemed over the course of the month that one by one the women who were her neighbors found excuses not to hang out their laundry or weed their gardens when she worked in the inn yard the friendly greetings across the fence the occasional offer of flowers for the bar parlor or a treat for the child stopped soon people no longer nodded to her on the street and failed to speak in the shops custom fell off at the bar men who often came in for a pint in the long summer evenings avoided her eyes now and hurried past the inn door the coldness frightened her she didnt know how to fight it because there was no one to tell her what lay at the bottom of it she wished for the hundredth time that her aunt were still alive even alistair mckinstry the young constable shook his head in bewilderment when she asked him what she had done to offend for it must be that she told him someones taken a word wrong or i neglected to do something id promised but what ive tried and tried to think of anything he had seen the looks cast her way behind her back i dont know nothings been said in my hearing its as if im shut out as well he smiled wryly half the town must know how he felt about her it may be a small thing fiona id not take it to heart which was no comfort at all she had already taken it to heart and wondered if that was the intent to give her pain but why on the first sunday in july the old woman who invariably sat in the back of the church hissed at her as she came in with the little boy leading him to their accustomed place the single word was lost in the first hymn but she knew what it was wanton it made her flush and the woman grinned toothlessly in grim satisfaction she had meant to hurt the shunning had been supplanted by attack the sermon that morning was on ruth and mary magdalen the good faithful woman who had kept her place at her motherinlaws side and the wanton whose sins christ had forgiven the scottish minister mr elliot made no bones about which hed have favored in christs stead his harsh loud voice made it clear that good women were jewels in the sight of god humility was their shibbolethsuch women knew their place and kept their hearts clean of sin it would take christ himself to forgive a sinful womanthey were beyond redemption in his personal view youd have thought fiona told herself that mr elliot knew better than god almighty what ought to be done about sinnersstone them very likely he had a very old testament view of such matters a cold and selfrighteous man she had never been able to like him in three years she had not found an iota of generosity or compassion in him not even when her aunt was dying he had thundered at the ill woman demanding to know if all her sins had been confessed and forgiven reminding her that hell was full of horrors and demons in the end he had had no comfort to give fiona had simply shut him out she found herself wondering if mr elliot had forgiven her for doing that as he warmed to his theme now she felt eyes moving toward her surreptitiously a merest glance cast from under the brim of a hat or from under pale lashes she knew what they were thinking the point was being made publicly that in duncarrick she herself was mary magdalen a wanton because of her child that made no sense theyd all been told when she brought the boy here that she had lost her husband in the war even her aunt a stickler for propriety had held her and cried then taken her around the town to meet everyone of consequence lamenting the tragedy of a lad growing up without his father and the wicked fighting in france that had killed so many good men fiona wasnt the only young widow in the town why had she been singled out in this fashion why had people suddenlyand without explanationturned so strongly against her shed never so much as looked at another man since she had never wanted another man in place of the one lost on the following monday morning outside the butchers shop someone shook a letter in her face and demanded to know what fiona meant by walking boldly amongst decent folk putting all their souls in danger managing to reach the letter in the red waving fingers of the woman who did washing for a living she took it and smoothed it enough to read it have you taken in her washing the sheets soiled by her wickedness and the linens that have touched her foul flesh have you no care for your own soul it wasnt signed the shock turned fionas heart over in her chest she read the lines again feeling sick mrs turnbull was watching her something avidly nasty in the set of her face as if she relished the pain shed caused you dont do my laundry fiona began bewildered and then realized that it didnt matter but who could have written such a thing it was vicious she was speechless with the cruelty of it sheets soiled by her wickedness her foul flesh there were no names mentioned then how had mrs turnbull settled so quickly on fiona as the intended target of such venom she wasnt a clever woman nor one overly endowed with either imagination or vindictiveness how had she picked fiona out as the evil woman because fiona hadnt lived here all her life because her aunt was dead now and she had to run the inn alone without proper chaperoningit hadnt occurred to her that she needed any was that it the impropriety of a respectable young woman serving men in the bar since the war the inn hadnt paid well enough to keep a barmaid this is malignant nonsense where did you get it fiona demanded mrs turnbull said it was under the mat by my door and im not the first nor the last wait and see not the first nor the last there had been other such letters fiona tried to absorb that and couldnt had all the people who shunned her now received malicious unsigned messages like this one but how could they believe such things surely someone could have warned hera friend a neighbor the washerwoman snatched the letter from fionas hand and strode off selfrighteousness in every line she was a simple woman known for her stringent faith and her narrowmindedness both had given her the courage to speak out in her own anger and fear like the old woman at the back of the church mrs turnbull had found the bravado of the mob in late july there was a policeman at fionas door constable mckinstry stood on the step uncomfortable and flushed stiffly in uniform dont shut the door in my face he said placatingly ive come to ask its about the lad theres well theres been talk going around and i dont know what to make of it fiona sighed you might as well come in ive seen one of the letters myself they all say the same do they that im a fallen woman alistair said remaining where he was on the step casting a swift glance up and down the quiet street those letters nasty piece of work they are ive just been shown a number of them you dont want to hear whats in them cowardlyunsigned meant to be cruel mark my words a womans behind it a woman with nothing better to do than stir up trouble with lies but people are believing these lies alistair and i dont know how to put a stop to it theyre talking about me behind my backthey must bebut no one will speak to me about it im shut out treated as if im invisible the best thing is not to try stopping it itll wear thin in another week or two he cleared his throat no its not the letters thatve brought me here not directly fionanow its said that the boys not yours not mine she stared at him frowning if im a fallen woman how can he not be mine its the sin im accused of wantonness i told you it wasnt to do with those letters theyre no more than wicked nonsense no whats brought me here is another matter serious enough for the police to be looking into it he hesitated searching for words awkward with his discomfort theres a suspicion thaterthat you killed his motherand took the child he could see the shock in her eyes the draining of warm color from her face it cut him to the heart i dont believe you she whispered no i dont believe youits all part and parcel with the whispers fiona alistair said pleadingly mr robson sent me here i didnt want to come he said no need to make a fuss youll do it best but i dont know how to do anything of the sort mr robson was the chief constable serious indeed she became aware that they were still standing in the door where all the world could see come in theres no one about there never is anymore fiona led him down the narrow passage that connected the inn to the little wing built into the side of it a hundred years earlier shed lived there since before her aunt died and run the inn as well from the time her aunt fell ill until custom dried up in june he followed her staring at her straight back and her trim waist and felt sick removing his hat he tucked it under his arm his boots clattered heavily on the wooden floor his uniform seemed to choke him in the small room that served her as parlor she gestured to the best chair and said i havent harmed anyone its barbarous to say that i have im not liking it myself to tell you the truth he turned away to stare at the tall clock that ticked quietly in the corner he didnt feel like sitting down nor did he want to stand there and hear his own voice speak the words but it had to be done theyre saying that his throat seemed to close that what you may as well tell me the rest he flushed darkly and said that youve got no marriage lines you call yourself mrs macleod but it isnt true youve never been married it came out in an anguished rush could i please see your marriage lines it will stop the talk its all i need alistair had liked her for years shed had a suspicion that he was in love with her now she knew it must be true the cat came in twining herself about his legs leaving a blur of hairs on the dark fabric of his trousers white on blue she could hear her purring she had always been partial to alistair if he sat down she would be in his lap instantly head stretched up to rub his chin an expression of serene selfindulgence on her face dragging her thoughts back to the policeman away from the man fiona said and what difference does it make to anybody if i did have the child out of wedlock ive done no harm to anyone and i wouldnt be the first to have loved a man while i could the war has butchered them without compunctionso young that most of them cried out for their mothers tell me why its the worlds business and not my private affair it was a tacit admission alistair recognized it and felt a great sadness for her gently he said well then could you prove the boy is your own could a doctor examine you and say with certainty that youve borne a child she stared at him her face answered him before she could prevent it after a moment he went on if you havent had a child of your own then how did you come by this one thats the question fiona they think the mothers buried here in the innunder the floor most like or in the cellar that you killed her and took the child and buried her where nobody would find her in the inn she blinked disbelieving this inn i had the boy with me when i first came to duncarrick how could the mother be buried here its preposterous i told them that i told them your aunt was alive then and would never have been a party to such a thing they dont want to listen who is this they so full of accusations i have a right to know mr elliot has seen several of the letters sent to his parishioners and done nothing about them he didnt speak to me once about them i know fiona it was wrong of him he should have scolded half the town for paying any heed to them hes a man of some weight i didnt want him to scold the town i wanted him to call these things lies to tell me he didnt believe what they said to come here and sit with me as proof that i am a decent woman it would have been a comfort alistair instead hes turned his back on me too aye but listen to me fiona three days ago a letter came for him this one mailed not left on a doorstep it wasnt like the others it wasnt accusing in fact it tried to defend you it said that you couldnt beera fallen woman that youd never been wed and youd borne no children of your own the letter didnt intend to cast doubts it was meant to show the rumors and whispers were false it went on to say that it wasnt possible to produce the lads true mother to prove these claims shed died after giving birth and youd taken the lad away keeping him for yourself the writer swore she didnt know where you had buried the womans body and ended by saying your aunt had been told lies she hadnt taken any part in what was done fiona swallowed hard the lump in her throat threatening to choke her keeping her voice steady by sheer effort of will she asked was thisthis letter anonymous like the rest of them or was it signed no it claimed that the writer was fearful to speak out shed held her tongue for your aunts sake knowing ealasaid maccallum had been told lies and shes afraid she might be brought up on charges now fiona caught her breath the address where did it come from there was a glasgow postmark but thats not to say it was written by anyone living there youd only have to drop it in a post box wouldnt you the writer might live in lanarkinverness he looked down at his boots missing her expression bent to touch the cat then thought better of it straightening up again he went on earnestly mr elliot went to the chief constable the chief constable is not a man who likes anonymous letters and innuendoes he told inspector oliver to get to the bottom of it inspector oliver has sent me to have a look around mind you only to see if any works been done in the last few years to see if any of the flagstones have been taken up or the walls repaired or the cellars changed no one has done work herenot since the start of the war peter the old man who was my aunts handyman can tell you no works been done he has that inspector oliver asked him and your neighbors as well but it would have been a secret business after all youd not have told peter would you if a body was being hidden nor your aunt just as the letter said its not true and it doesnt make senseif i brought the child here with me how could i bring its dead mother to bury her here in a trunk in the back of the carriage over my shoulder she was feeling desperate frightened he winced at her bitter humor mr robson addressed that he said the mother might have recovered from the birth and wanted to keep the boy after all and you stopped her when she came here to find him ive had my orders this is my inn now i wont have anyone tearing it apart to search for a body theres no body here i must look fiona or theyll send someone else with a search warrant and an ax will you at least let me walk about and see with my own eyes that theres nothing to find no startled by her cry the cat tensed and then vanished behind the heavy draperies at the side window fiona no it took him a good half hour to convince her that he was the lesser of evils that for her own sake she must agree to lead him around the premises that he would look only where fiona allowed him to look move only what she allowed him to move when stiffly she finally gave her permission he said gently im sorry im so sorry but she ignored him with a coldness hed never felt in her before she led him through the small wing room by room even where the child was sleeping in his crib one hand tucked under his chin and then through the aged building that had been her greatuncles inn and then her aunts and now hers through the common rooms and the bars through the kitchens and the cellars and through the few bedchambers that could be taken by occasional travelers and marketgoers through the attics where old boxes and trunks littered the dusty floors amid the broken or outgrown furnishings stored there the longforgotten belongings of a family that had lived under the same roof for generations to the cellars where there was still wine on the shelves but very little beer or alenobody came to drink it and like the kitchens the pantry and barmans little cubbyhole the cellars were nearly empty no sacks of flour or potatoes or onions no tins of fruit or jars put up from the garden he looked as thoroughly as he could without insulting her he sounded walls and stamped on the floors peered into the chimneys and moved the largest chests and dressers opened the tops of trunks and sniffed at their musty contents kept his mind and his attention on his task without letting his own misery show in his face when alistair left she accompanied him to the door and shut it almost before hed thanked her properly behind its solid oak where no one could see her she leaned her forehead against the cool wood and closed her eyes and then the child rousing from his sleep began to sing offkey to himself a highland song she had taught him she made an effort to collect herself and called im coming darling but it was another minute before she could turn and ascend the stairs whatever alistair mckinstry told his superiors a fortnight passed before there were other policemen at her door demanding to inspect the premises inspector oliver sergeant young and both constable mckinstry and constable pringle in his anxiety not to offend her mckinstry had not properly examined the outbuildings she was told fiona torn between fear and disgust told them to search as and where they pleased then shut the door in their faces and kept the child out of sight it was in the stables in the inn yard that they found the bones well hidden between the back wall and the little room the liveryman had lived in inspector oliver had been the one to notice the unusual thickness of the plaster in one place he tapped it with a hammer found that there was space behind it and tapped again watching with interest as a spidersweb crack ran across it a suspicious man by nature he went into the dusty room on the other side of the wall and found that a cupboard was not as deep as it ought to have been they had the wall down then and the skull rolled out before they had even seen the rest of the bones crammed into the long narrow space as it came to a stop grinning up at them constable mckinstry smothered a curse the long hair still attached in places to the dry bone surely marked it as a womans it was not until late august that they arrested her the bones in the stables had catapulted the investigation into a dozen new directions inspector oliver with grim thoroughness had scoured fionas past had followed every lead that came his way and had succeeded in bringing new information to lightdamning information that supported the theory he found so compelling the procuratorfiscal had seen fit after speaking with the chief constable to order a trial on the charge of murder fiona found someone to care for the boy and went to jail with an aching heart she couldnt be sure who her enemy was or how he or she had tightened a noose about her neck so cleverly but she did know one very important thing about this person the planning and the execution had been quite shrewdly done someone had carefully arranged her death and left it to the law to do the deed for himor her which meant that someone hated her very deeply but who was it the only living person she might have asked was the one person she could never turn to for help even if she went to the gallows she had made a promise and she dared not break it it was the boy she wept for in the night she loved him completely and without shame what would he be told now about the woman he believed to be his mother who would care for him and keep him safe if she was not there the loneliness was nearly unbearable and the idleness she wasnt used to sitting in silence the day long with nothing neither a book nor a needle to make the time pass even as a child in her grandfathers house there had been books a basket of mending letters to be written now there was no one to write to where were the many people who had claimed to be her friends who had welcomed her first for her aunts sake and then for her own she had been visited by none of them had had no word of encouragement from them she felt abandoned and wished with all her heart that her aunt were here to comfort her and she had no faith in the lawyer who came to speak to her there was something in his narrow eyes that warned her to be very careful he was not the sort of man who trusted women charles todd legacy of the dead london he was standing on the road looking beyond the low stone wall and down into the churchyard where the slope of the land evened out there had been rain in the night the stones were drenched with it and stood out blackly in the pale morning light his heart was pounding the stones drew him like a magnet drawing iron and he found himself trying to make out the name on each searching for one he knew must be there then with an effort of will he turned to stare at the church tower still swathed in low rain clouds and at the tall windows above the door he wanted to believe it was the church in buncombecornwallbut he knew it couldnt be he told himself it was a churchyard in france but that too was a lie a flicker of movement distracted him and then he saw the girl in the shadows of the church door she was carrying flowers her arms full of blossoms and long spears of greenery and as she stepped into the light he saw that she was looking at him as if shed expected him to be standing there as if she knew he would come in the end he couldnt see her face clearly but he instantly recognized her and the grief in her eyes shamed him cutting through his defenses terrified he tried to turn away and couldnt his feet were rooted to the spot his body paralyzed by her eyes she was coming toward him now up the church walk she was saying something to him then she pointed to the side of the churchyard and the grave there only there wasnt a body lying beneath the bare brown earth he knew that at once there were tears on her face but no hatred he thought he could have borne the hatred but not the pity in her eyes he began to walk toward her not of his own volition but of hers drawn to her drawn to the drift of flowers she held drawn to the grave they were destined for she had brought enough flowers for the two of them to spread over the earth to cover its ugliness he could see it now raw without beauty or grace or the mercy of time and he couldnt face itone more step and he would read the name on the stone and that would be intolerable ian rutledge woke with a start breathing harshly from shock he was sitting upright knees raised head flung back drenched with sweat and with horror terrified of the heavy suffocating blackness that surrounded him that made him blind frantic he put his hands to his face to claw the viscous mask away and touchednot the thick mud of the trenches but his own flesh surprised confused he tried to think if he wasnt in france where was he his hands floundered found sheetsa pillow the clinic as his eyes grew accustomed to the impenetrable darkness he was able to pick out the ghostly shape of his surroundings a doora mirrora bedpost rutledge swore ive been asleepim in my bed i was dreaming but it was several minutes before the vivid dream faded enough for him to shake off the overwhelming sense of doom it had left behind in the back of his mind he could feel hamish rumbling like heavy thunderor the guns trying to tell him something he didnt want to hearover and over again fumbling for a match he lit the candle on the table by his bed then got up and switched on the light it blared down at him from the high ceiling garish and stark after the darkness but he was grateful for the reality it provided pushing back the last remnants of sleep and of his nightmare he pinched out the candle flame looked at the watch lying beside the brass candlestick and saw that the time was close to three oclock in france hed often slept with a stub of candle clenched in his hand unlitit would have been madness to light itbut a symbol of light all the same he still kept one beside his bed a talisman this was london not the trenches and there was no mud he repeated the words listening to their sanity around him were his own belongings the carved armoire by the door to the sitting room the mirror where he put on his tie every morning the chair that had been his fathers the tall posts of the bed he had slept in as a boy the dark burgundy draperies his sister had helped him hang all of them familiar and in their own way unexpectedly comforting they had been his before the war just as this flat had been and returning here had been a bulwark against the intervening hell of the trenches a promise that one day he would be the same man again ive been working too hard he thought moving between the bed and the tall chest and coming to a halt by the table set beneath the window he pushed aside the draperies outside rain clouds were hanging heavily over the city gray and depressing he turned away letting the heavy fabric fall again frances is right i need rest it will stop when i can rest his sister frances had put it in no uncertain terms you look terrible ian tired and thin and still very unlike yourself tell old bowels to give you leave youve worked as hard as ten men since you came back to the yard and the doctors told you quite clearly yes theyd told him but in work wassometimesforgetfulness hamish tireless at the back of rutledges mind said its no true you canna forget theres only emptiness sometimes ill settle for that when im weary enough to sleep theres peace was peace rutledge corrected himself from long habit he answered the voice only he could hear the voice of a dead man it was as clear as his own in the silent room with a highlanders soft accent and so real it seemed to come from just behind him as if the speaker might be standing there if rutledge turned his head but there was no one behind himalthough the dread of being wrong about that was nearly as real as the voice he tried to shove the dream back into the far reaches of despair refusing to remember any shred of it refusing to believe any part of it then realized that he was standing in the middle of the floor frowning remembering he shook himself and went back to the window to look out again hamish said behind him its no so gloomy in the highlandsthe rains clean sweet rutledge grateful for the distraction nodded what we call shell shock for lack of a better term said the doctor at the clinicfrancess friend the one whod brought him back from the edge of insanityis not fully understood i cant tell you how it will progress whether one day youll find it goneor whether it will stay with you for the rest of your life whether it will get a little better with time or a good deal worse we dont know you see a few of the men like you ive treated have managed to find a way to live with it you must do the same dont worry yourself about the medical aspects of it just get on with your life and make the best of the fact that you can reason and think and act quite normally rutledge was no longer certain what normal was he hadnt been since early his war had not ended in triumph and rejoicing by the time guns stopped firing in at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day hed been locked in such desolation that he hardly knew where he was a month later hed been found dazed and incoherent wandering the roads of northern france wearing a german greatcoat unable to give his name or even his nationality hed eventually been sent back to the british command a major in the french army had recognized him as a liaison officer hed met in the british had promptly clapped him in hospital shell shock the diagnosis was outlook uncertain and it had been nothing had brought him out of the bleak and accusing silence in which hed been found he had begun to remember who and what he wasian rutledge british officer former inspector at scotland yard he had recognized his sister frances and been allowed briefly a meeting with his fiancee it had not been a success when he reached numbly for jeans hand shed snatched it away she had been carefully coached by the doctors but her eyes had been filled with fright as she made inane conversation in a trembling voice hed seen her only a few times after that before shed broken off their engagement it had been his sister who had got him out of the hellhole that was a hospital for shellshock victims and into a private clinic and the doctor there fleming by name had mercilessly broken him rutledge had fought him every step of the way but boneweary and ill hed been no match for the tall rawboned doctor who had seen in the shambles a man worth saving and so refused to admit defeat the truth about corporal hamish macleod had come out raggedly at first and then relived so vividly that rutledge had believed he was in the trenches again afterward rutledge had nearly killed fleming a last desperate defense of an inner self so unacceptable to a conscious mind that hed hated the doctor blamed him for bringing him out of his silence and back into awareness the somme offensive of a disaster from its inception had begun in july and dragged on through the summer so many men had died that the bodies corrupted and rotted where they lay and the survivors lived with the stench weeks into the battle they were none of them quite sane but when corporal hamish macleod cracked the shock of it left rutledge and his men staring there had been no sign no warning taking over from a gutshot and dying sergeant macleod had led his men with extraordinary skill and bravery an example to them all when he abruptly refused to make another assault on the machinegun nest that was their objective there was stunned disbelief orders had come down that the gun had to be silenced before the entire line went over the top at dawn artillery fire laid down in earnest during the night had deafened them battered them until they were all on the ragged edge of despair and still the machine gunners survived because they were well dug in and no one could reach them through the hail of bullets as the weary whitefaced corporal shook his head refusing a direct order saying only i willna kill any more of our own i willna go back again its madness the eyes of the men at his back were grim disheartened rutledge didnt know how he and hamish had come through each assault unscathed he didnt know where he himself would find the strength to go back through the wire a sixth time but there was no choice one machine gun had the firepower of forty men it could take down an entire line it had to be put out of action rutledge reasoned with hamish threatened him called on his patriotism and the silent highlander had merely shaken his head but his face pleaded for understanding even as it reflected the grief and torment in rutledges in war there is no time for compassion no time for mercy to save a thousand lives one had to be sacrificed rutledge gave hamish an ultimatum be ready in an hours time for the next attempt or be shot for cowardice hardly cowardice but that was the name the army gave it when men broke under fire in the end rutledge had had to carry out his threat in the darkness before dawn a hastily drawnup firing squad had shot corporal hamish macleod and as rutledge had delivered the coup de grace to the badly wounded highlander the salient had been blasted out of existence by a german shell buried alive blinded and deaf rutledge had lived only because hamishs body had protected him a bitter irony and the machine gunners had died as well for which rutledge disbelieving had been given a medal and sent back into the fighting as a bloody example without rest or respite the war needed men as the hellish summer of dragged into agonizing stalemate for two more years rutledge had carried out his duties barely aware of anything except the incessant voice of hamish in his head he had wanted to die had tried to die and in spite of war and pestilence he had lived to come home a hero to come home a man hardly able to speak bringing a dead man with him the doctor fleming had done his work well in june rutledge had returned to the yard declared fit for duty his secret went with him not even frances knew how much it had cost rutledge to struggle back to his former skills a murderer standing in judgment of murderers nor had hamish made it easy standing constantly at his shoulder and condemning him they had worked out in time a relationship that was more a stalemate than anything else it was only that when he rutledge was most vulnerable hamish was the first to sense it as if rutledge sometimes thought the dead man had taken his revenge not even fleming with all his medical skills could wipe out memory or guilt cold comfort on a dark rainy night of bad dreams and a haunting voice from the trenches after a time rutledge made himself go back to his bed draw the sheets over his shoulders again and close his eyes but when the september dawn broke grayly over london he hadnt slept in the light of day rutledge could pin down with some certainty what had precipitated the dream it was the letter that had arrived in the previous mornings post he hadnt opened it for several hours knowing who it was from and what it demanded of him finally after it had seemed to burn a hole in his coat pocket as well as his conscience he had taken the letter out and broken the ornate seal his godfather david trevor had written from edinburgh saying youve made a dozen excuses dont make another one come to see me i miss you ian i want to see for myself that youre alive and well if that grim devil bowles wont give you leave come anyway my doctor will tell him you need a rest and for that matter so do i loneliness is the very devil but scotland was the last place rutledge intended to go the love and duty he owed his godfather were very real but so was his reluctance to go north of the border which seemed in the clear light of day an almost superstitious dread but in the dark seemed an unbearable unspeakable burden not because he hated the scots but because so many of them had been under his command in franceand hed led so many of them to their death he could name every one of them even the raw recruits hed known for less than a day and leave was the last thing he wanted tired as he was idleness was worse when a man was idle his demons marched like ghostly armies in the forefront of his mind chief superintendent bowles would have been glad to grant rutledge leave if he had asked for it the less he saw of the inspector the happier bowles was the closed door of his empty office was like a benediction when bowles passed it each day that rutledge was away from london rutledge underfoot was a constant reminder of things best forgotten clever men always disturbed bowless peace of mind and clever men with good accents men whod been to university or moved comfortably in circles where bowles for all his authority felt stiff and clumsy were intolerable bowles made it a point to rid himself of such men as fast as he could there were subtle ways to convince a clever man that it was in his best interests to ask for a transfer but rutledge damn and blast him seemed to lead a charmed life he had survived the bloodbath of the somme hed survived wounds hed survived months in hospital and if bowless informant was telling the truth rutledge had been half out of his head broken and silent hardly a promising future yet for four months now hed survived bowless concerted attempts to show him up as inept and lacking his prewar skills to bowless way of thinking england would have been better served if rutledge had died with the rest of what the writers were now calling the flower of english youth dead flowers could be swept up with the rubbish and forgotten live challengers to his ambition were fair targets bowles had climbed the ladder as far as his ability allowed buoyed by some small success hunting german spies during the great war but it appeared he was destined to retire as a chief superintendent climbing higher was out of the question for a man of his station and that knowledge was a constant goad to his anger and frustration he found himself this gloomy morning walking into rutledges office and dragging the other chair from where it was usually kept near the wall out of the way of the door sitting down heavily he slapped a file on the desk theres a spot of trouble in the north close by durham and it seems youre wanted to handle it he opened the file reached for a sheet of paper with a dozen paragraphs scrawled across it in heavy ink and scowled at it heres the long and short of it and the reports to confirm it the scottish policewith permission from their counterparts in englandhad come to a village some miles west of durham to tell a woman that it was possible her daughters remains had been discovered on a scottish mountainside in a place called glencoe lady maude gray took exception to the scottish inspectors manner and insinuations and she had her butler throw him out this didnt sit well with his chief constable who complained to the chief constable across the border neither of them could persuade her ladyship to give them so much as the time of day youre being sent to smooth troubled waters in a manner of speaking and to find out whatever you can about this missing girl the scottish police will be grateful as far as i can tell reading between the lines her ladyship is highly thought of in certain circles and shes strongminded enough to do as she pleases youll need every ounce of diplomacy you possess to get through the door much less into her presence but failure is unacceptable do you understand me rutledge understood very well if he annoyed her further lady maude could crucify all of them if he left without seeing her it would be viewed as his incompetence he took the papers bowles thrust at him and when the chief superintendent had gone read them over the facts of the case itself appeared to be simple enough the problem lay in lady maude grays refusal to discuss her daughter with anyone the local police had noted she has never reported her daughter missing but it is understood in the neighborhood that there was a rift between them that resulted in the daughter leaving early in when the young woman came into a large inheritance in the family solicitor advertised throughout the country for her to contact him directly and the girl failed to do so further discreet inquiries by the solicitor discovered that none of her acquaintance had had word of or from her either the solicitor reported his concern and asked for police help in locating her that search was inconclusive as well it may well be that the remains found in scotland are those of eleanor victoria maude grayheight and age appear to be a close match and the time of death thought to be autumn appears to be consistent with the last time anyone saw her her mother refuses all comment the scottish police were convinced that the mothers refusal had to do with the fact that the daughter had been pregnant the english police were reluctant to conclude that that was the cause of the quarrel between the two women some stiffness between the two jurisdictions had developedthe scottish police believed they had already identified eleanors murderer while the english police were unsure that the girl was in fact dead rutledge looked out the window at the rain streaking the grimy panes and the wet pigeons huddled in whatever shelter they could find hed hated the rain in the trenches it was a torment of body and spirit wet wool the stench of urine or vomit the heavy sweetness of rotting flesh the stink of dirty bodies the slick black filthy mud that weighed down boots and caked faces and hands and matted hair under the helmets the low clouds that hid the gas the drive north ought to be pleasanter than the weather here he mused and hamish a countryman at heart found that thought agreeable as well rutledge took out his watch realized that he might reach york before nightfall he stood and stretched set his current files in order then walked out of his office and closed the door behind him down the passage walking toward the stairs bowles heard the faint sound and smiled with contentment lady maude gray lived in an imposing house that could be described as palatial it sat in a vast acreage of parkland that gave it privacy and offered fine views from all its windows the village of menton which lay on the main road a mile and a quarter beyond the massive stone pillars that flanked the long drive had been moved to its present location in the eighteenth century not even its church steeple was visible from the attics of the house where the village had once stood a very fine allee of trees and grassy lawns led to a reflecting pool that mirrored a cloudless sky it had once been rutledge thought glimpsing the sunwashed house in the distance as he made his way up the drive a fortified abbey in the middle ages but later architects had created a country house in the ruins with the choir and apse of the abbey church presumably the family chapel now comprising one wing the arched buttresses flowed smoothly upward toward a pinnacled roof and the gray stone of the house fabric matched them to perfection giving a sense of great age to the entire dwelling the west front the main entrance boasted a graceful spread of steps rising from the drive a formal garden set with an ornate fountain gave human dimensions to the spectacular view across the countryside that spread out beyond it hamish regarding the view grumbled a lonely place this you can hear the wind and feel the emptiness to his calvinist soul the house itself was ostentatious and unwelcoming for a man used to the crofts of the highlands often a heap of stone in the lee of a hillside there was no room for display in the struggle for survival as rutledge climbed the steps he found himself wondering what his godfather would think of the effect achieved here david trevor felt the power of stone and mortar in his blood a man whose eye and taste were trained but whose natural response to building had made him one of the most successful architects of his day he felt a sudden surge of guilt that he hadnt replied to the invitation from his godfather but there was no way to explain why the prospect of leave was anathema the press of work would have to be his excuse hamish said its no a lie is it though yeve chosen it yoursel and id no care to come home now the knocker shaped like a pineapplethe symbol of hospitalityfell back on its plate with a heavy throm that seemed to echo through the house eventually a majestic butler opened the door staring at rutledge with cold disdain his white hair brushed to silver and his height would have done honor to the lord of the manor lord evelyn gray however had been a short stocky man with dark curling hair and an irongray beard rutledge had seen him in london on a number of occasions before the war inspector rutledge scotland yard he said briskly into the silence hamish bristled in the back of his mind an angry counterpoint to the icy regard i wish to see lady maude gray her ladyship has no business to conduct with the police the man replied preparing to close the door in rutledges face on the contrary the police wish to express regret for past misunderstandings and i have been sent from london to offer this apology in person it would be rude of her not to hear it the butler looked rutledge up and down rutledge smiled inwardly if the intent had been to intimidate it was a signal failure haughty the butler might be but it was a reflection of his mistresss importance and not his own sergeantmajor maclaren on the other hand had been a different matter a glance could quell an entire battalion no one dared question his authority it came direct from god it was said that even officers walked in fear of him and most certainly rutledge himself had deferred to the mans wisdom and experience on a number of occasions what the butler saw was a tall man with a thin face who was clothed in a wellcut suit and a firmness that matched his voice something in the dark eyes moved the butler to change his mind and say at last wait here if you please he returned after nearly ten minutes lady maude will receive you in the library he informed rutledge and stepped aside to allow him to enter rutledge walked into a columned hall that reminded him of a greek temple the floor paved in marble was smooth as cold ice and the staircasesa pairflaunted their airy grace as they rose like swans necks on either side of a niche where an exquisite roman copy of a greek apollo was subtly lit the stone face slightly turned and limned by the light reminded him all at once of cormac fitzhugh he buried the memory as swiftly as it had risen hamish said pagan this is like the mistress no doubt how had the missing eleanor gray seen it rutledge wondered had she played here as a child sliding across the shining floor peals of laughter echoing among the columns or had it seemed cold to her forbidding a long gallery led off in either direction with french carpeting busts on pedestals and dark paintings of ancestors in massive gold frames theres space enough here to hold half a regiment hamish said his voice disparaging aye and a military band to sit and play on yon stairs the library was a vast room down a passage on the first floor and was undoubtedly chosen to overawe a mere policeman its windows rose floor to ceiling and books filled glassenclosed shelves the creamandrose carpet on the floor was so old it had the sheen of antique silk and the woman waiting for him in the center of it knew that it set her off like a jewel hamish fell silent in its own way homage lady maude was a tall woman with silvergray hair and the carriage of an empress her afternoon dress was dark blue austere in contrast to the handsome double rope of pearls that fell nearly to her waist in her day she must have been quite beautiful for the vestiges of beauty were clear in the bones of her face her violet eyes and the long slender hands lightly clasped in front of her she barely acknowledged the butlers quiet murmur inspector rutledge my lady the door closed softly behind him inspector she said as he inclined his head after a moment regarding him coolly she added at least this time theyve had the sense to send me someone who is presentable i havent met inspector oliver my lady his sense of duty however is something i understand as you must yourself having been born to it i will not listen she began but he cut lightly across her words i am not defending him i assure you i am merely pointing out that for any policeman one of the most painful duties is to inform someone of a loved ones death if it was not your daughter the scottish police have found the sooner they know it the sooner they can find her true parents another mother will have to bear that grief if you were fortunate and this is not your child then spare a little pity for the woman who has lost hers she stared at him in astonishment something moving behind her remarkably expressive eyes he thought her daughter is missing then she said you came as i understood kenton to say to make an apology yes for the fact that inspector oliver did not handle this matter as well as he might have that was unfortunate ive come in his place to tell you that if you can give me assurances that this young woman discovered on a scottish mountainside is not your affair then we can move on to other names on our she is not my child my daughter is alive and well and you have heard from her within the pastersix months my relations with my daughter are not open to public scrutiny she scanned his face again noting the tiredness the thinness beneath them she realized suddenly was a will as strong as hers rutledge listened to hamish for a moment heeding the warning that patience was not lady maudes long suit a change of tactics was in order very well i accept that perhaps you can help us answer a puzzling question why has your daughter not contacted her solicitor to sign papers relating to her inheritance ive read his statement he expressed some concern that she failed to appear at the time set in in fact his last correspondence with her was in he has made a concerted effort to locate her in the past year and failed it was his anxiety that was communicated to the local police and this year when a query about a missing person was circulated by the scots it seemed prudent for them to speak to miss gray if only to reassure everyone that she could be safely struck off the list if you could provide me with her direction i have the authority to close this matter immediately his attitude was cool as if eleanor gray was of concern to him only if she was dead i might have guessed it was mr leedss vexatious passion for meddling that lay behind this business he shall hear from me anger flared in lady maudes eyes deepening the color to dark violet id no like to be in his shoes then hamish reflected he too is required by law to carry out his duties to the best of his ability indeed involving the police is an entirely unnecessary course of action i cannot believe that a young woman of your daughters rank would neglect her duty rutledge paused and then repeated it is cause for concern nonsense eleanor is young contrary she has had some ridiculous notion that she wanted to take up the study of medicine it was the war it unsettled all of us but she insisted that she was well suited to it and that her goal was to become a physician i hoped that with the armistice and an end to the dying this absurd dream would be seen in a different light my daughter is something of a romantic i must confess very like her late father rutledge still standing thought to himself well have to contact the teaching hospitals aloud he asked would she have settled for nurses training instead a nursing sister hardly that impatiently lady maude said sit down young man that chair to your left she crossed to the desk and took the chair behind it as if putting a solid barrier between them when my daughter sets her heart on something shes singleminded about it and i must tell you that she doesnt cope well with disappointment eleanor has always been rather impatient of impediments and usually finds a way around them lady maude gave rutledge a space to digest that before continuing now as for this business of climbing in scotlandor having an illegitimate childits so out of character that i am at a loss to understand how your scottish policeman arrived at such a conclusion the mans an idiot i wont allow him in this house nor the local man hes as great a fool as they come your daughter never expressed an interest in climbing not at all shes not one of these robust women with an enthusiasm for athletic pursuits she enjoys a game of tennis and shes very fond of riding before the war she spent some time at school in switzerland and never indicated then or afterward that she cared for climbing as for the other business she has far too much respect for herself and her family to find herself in trouble the words were spoken with absolute conviction women of eleanor grays class were taught from birth what was expected of them they were to be married off to the greatest advantage social and financial lovers taken after marriagewith absolute discretionwere another matter never before it the more he heard the more rutledge found himself agreeing with lady maude that the dead woman found in scotland was unlikely to be her daughter eleanor none of the facts matched stillheight and age did and possibly timing would it be possible to see a photograph of your daughter lady maude shell no allow it hamish told him but yon solicitor might have one she glared at rutledge to what end merely to give me some feeling for the person youve described i have found that faces tell me more than facts sometimes she hesitated rutledge was certain hed given her the wrong answer and had lost then she opened a drawer in the desk from it she drew a silver filigree frame and passed it across to him without looking at it he rose to take it from her hand and sat down again before turning it over the face staring back at him was smiling one hand on the horse at her side the other holding a trophy beneath the riding hat it was difficult to see her features clearly but she was an attractive young woman with her mothers bearing there was something familiar about the face all the same and he frowned as he studied it all at once he made the connection she reminded him quite strongly of one of the royal princesses as if his thought reached her at the same time lady maude extended her hand imperiously and he had no choice but to return the photograph to her hamish following his thought was scandalized his sister frances would know if anybody did but looking at the woman in front of him and remembering the photograph shed taken from him rutledge found himself wondering if eleanor victoria maude gray was possiblythe child of a liaison between lady maude and the late king edward vii the king had had an eye for beautiful women it wouldnt have been surprising if shed come to his notice small wonder with that heritage that lady maude refused to believe that her daughter had come to die on a desolate scottish mountainside or that she had borne a child out of wedlock eleanor was destined for greater things than a career in medicineif she was the daughter of a king and heir to this house and the fortune that apparently maintained it she could take her pick of wealthy and titled men but if she was as contrary as her mother wanted him to believe might she not have rebelled against this golden future and found instead some perverse pleasure in making her mothers nightmares rather than her dreams come true lady maude sat at the broad desk long after the man from london had gone staring blindly at the closed door how had he tricked her into speaking of eleanor she had told a policeman what she hadnt revealed to anyone elsethat eleanor was headstrong contrary that her daughters heritage had meant so little to her that she had walked away from it and never looked back she had chosen a common profession instead one that dealt with poverty and squalor and hideous diseases it was unspeakably cruel and headstrong she would call london straightaway and have that man broken in rank instead lady maude went on sitting where she was reviling him refusing to acknowledge pain or guilt eleanor was not dead the police were incompetent and stupid she would not allow them to trouble her again something the inspector had said came back to her another mother will have to bear that grief then find her and be satisfied and let there be an end to this sunlight cast long narrow shadows across the carpet and still she sat there she did not need the photograph in the closed drawer to see her daughters face feel the strong presence of her spirit a mother would know if anything untoward had happened they were trying to frighten her into helping them these policemen rather than doing their duty as it should be done finally she stood up took a deep breath and walked firmly to the door by the time she had reached the small room where the telephone had been put in she had made her decision rutledge turned out of the drive back onto the main road hamish reacting to the lessening of tension spoke after a long silence it wasna a verra useful interview but sufficient a formidable woman that i wouldna care to grow up in her shadow was that how eleanor gray had felt about her mother my own grandfather was her match hamish was saying he could have led the clan into battle anither time and place but he had anither side as well he could recite in a voice that kept the room silent verse and the old testament when it came to the prophets or robert burns there was none to hold a candle to him i ken many a night when i lay awake in the loft listening does this one have anither face thinking it over rutledge came to the conclusion that lady maude did if she had been mistress to queen victorias son her husband had been willingly knowingly cuckolded unlike henry viii edward had chosen his married lovers with great care to prevent gossip or scandal and his friends had known which woman to invite to which social engagement or had been quietly informed of royal wishes still it must not have been easy for edwards wife alexandra or the current favorite herself to live with such an open secret or for the favorite to return to her marriage when the princes fancy moved elsewhere the problem was a child seldom recognized a parents strength it saw only stern discipline that couldnt be easily manipulated by childish whims or caprice rebellion was naturaland sometimes dangerous wherever eleanor gray might have gone if she was determined to punish her mother for whatever it was she felt shed lost or lacked in that grand and cold house it became a police matter only if she died rutledge found himself hoping that she had not though hamish was of two minds about it retracing his route to the town where he had spent the previous night and left his luggage rutledge considered his choices if he made the journey directly back to london today it would be late when he arrived far too late to report to bowles and this was a friday it might be best to find a telephone and make his report orally so that it could be passed along inspector oliver would also be waiting to learn what had transpired there was a telephone in the hotel and rutledge put in his call to london bowles was not in his office and the sergeant answering the line said rutledge is it a moment sir i think theres a message that im to give you ah here it is youre not to return to london sir not to return rutledge asked blankly hadnt he finished his business here no sir the message reads tell rutledge to stay where he is hes to call me at nine oclock on monday morning thats all sir the chief superintendent didnt explain even for bowles it was an odd message but hamish was quick to remind rutledge that the man was vindictive and often intentionally bloodyminded rutledge asked the sergeant to repeat the message to be sure hed been given the whole of it and then said meanwhile will you put some men to finding out if an eleanor gray is enrolled in any of the teaching hospitals its likely shes chosen one in london but be as thorough as possible will you im told she had a strong interest in becoming a doctor but if shes studying anywhere its important that we find her the sergeant laboriously wrote down the particulars and promised to get someone on it right away rutledge had a feeling hed just spoiled the weekend for several unfortunate constables who were on the sergeants blacklist for some minor infraction or another but theyd be more likely to pursue their inquiries with diligence if only to see their names removed from it rutledge thanked him and hung up the receiver he sat there in the tiny smotheringly stuffy room that had been turned into a telephone closet stay where you are was bowles sending him back to the gray house because there were new developments in the scottish investigation and hed been chosen to handle it at this end or had something else come up but if that was true bowles would have left full instructions telling him where to report and what his duties would be it was also possible that bowles was being perverse making the assumption that rutledge would fail in his attempt to reach lady maude and ordering him not to retreat until hed succeeded hed brought only a small case with him hed need more shirts shoes and another suit if he was ordered to stay beyond two or three days hamish said for all you know hes sacked you and is letting you dangle in uncertainty until he tells you himself rutledge shut out the cutting voice and meanwhile he was free to spend the next two days in lincoln or york before the war hed have leapt at the chance having friends he could call on houses where he knew he was welcome but two of those friends were dead now and a third was blind in hospital struggling to learn a new profession while his wife waited for him to come home still there were hotels where he could stay at loose ends alone and with only his thoughts and hamish as company it wasnt a prospect rutledge relished he found himself preferring to be called back to london immediately with another investigation to be handled keeping him busy keeping him from remembering that he had ever had a past beyond the last week or even the day before today two days guilt stirred again he owed his godfather a visit or an explanation he was going to find it hard to do either hamish said why does he no come to london david trevor had turned the london architectural firm over to his partner in the last year of the war his sons death had taken the heart out of him and he had retired to scotland to heal he was according to frances writing a book on the history of british architectural style but it might be no more than an excuse to bury himself in the past until he could face a bleak future for him scotland offers sanctuary but not for me hamish made no reply after a moment rutledge picked up the receiver again and put in a call to david trevor his intent was to make his excuses to satisfy his conscience to explain that the press of business made a journey to scotland in the foreseeable future unlikely to put off what he could not face yet surely david would be willing to meet him in durham or somewhere else for the weekend a compromise to suit them bothon ground that held no memories for either of them as rutledge waited hamish said he willna come he will for my sake but twenty minutes later rutledge was driving north once more this time toward the border something in his godfathers voice a relief at hearing from him a need that wasnt spokena surge of warmth when he thought rutledge had called to give his time of arrivalhad made it nearly impossible to refuse or suggest any alternative it had been taken for granted as if nothing had changed better to return to the rain of london and the empty flatbetter to go to york or lincoln or carlisle rather than scotland where voices at every turn would remind him of scots hed commanded men he felt hed betrayed there was hardly a town of any size in the highlands that he didnt know by name because one or a dozen of the men under his command had lived there how many lies had he told frightened boys facing battle for the first time how many lies had he written to grieving women who had just lost a son or a husband and yet his men had trusted him hed listened to them talk about families crofts the land small victories won in short lives lonely men leaning against the wall of a trench in the dark watches wanting to remember home or lying on a stretcher trying to die bravely the scots had made good soldiers and theyd died hard not in their tens or hundreds but in their thousands rutledge felt a duty to them still and it was a burden he hadnt healed sufficiently yet to put down it wasnt easily explainedbut it was there that sense of duty to the dead he was going to scotland now there was no turning back its not as if ill be driving as far as edinburgh he argued with himself the lodge is in the country for gods sake once there i could be anywherein any part of britain it will have to be done sometime i cant hide from the pastsomehow i must do this it would be arrant cruelty to call again and say ive changed my mind but in the deep recesses of his mind he could feel hamish refusing to accept any justification rutledge might offer for rutledge this was a hurdle of the spirit for hamish it had been the unacceptable horror of dying in francehis permanent exile from the highlands he had not come home then he would not come home now the strain of traveling with that stiff solid wall of refusal began to take its toll approaching newcastle on a whim rutledge took a side turning and drove west for a time toward hexham when he stopped the motorcar in the middle of nowhere he got out and walked nearly a mile to where the great wall that hadrian had built across the top of england so many centuries before snaked still across the green land a rampart of earth and stone to keep the scottish barbarians at bay supported in its day by forts and garrisons shops and sentry posts long since crumbled and covered by time he had come here as a boy and the memory of it had stayed with him soldiers had lived and fought and died here but that was not the odd pull of this place it was the rolling green land the high bowl of skythe vast stillness there had been no peace in france men standing cheek by jowl in the trenches had had no privacy the guns even when silent could be heard in the bones that ache of thunder that dulled the brain and deafened the ears for hours afterward the aeroplanes passing overhead horses struggling through the mire the lorries moving up voices swearing and singing and talking day and night or screaming and cursing in pain after an attack and the barking of dogs searching for the living among the dead there had been no stillness in himself either with hamish rampant in his mind he was never truly alone but here it was palpablethe quiet he stood there looking up at the empty blue sky his head tilted back his arms out from his sides his fists unwittingly clenched and drank in the stillness even the wind had dropped off hamish for a mercy was silent and there was no birdsong the birds had turned south to winter in another climate the beating of his heart seemed muffled beneath his coat stillness it seemed to spread through him it seemed to wrap him about it seemed to fill him full for nearly a quarter of an hour he stood there alone and listening when he turned away to walk back to the car there were tears in his eyes but he had found the strength he needed morag gilchrist greeted rutledge at the heavy front door of the lodge almost before hed knocked she had looked after this house just south of edinburgh for nearly three generations of the trevor family and nobody seemed to know just how old she was if anyone asked he was given short shrift morags back was straight as a sergeantmajors her eyes as bright as a crows and her hands as soft and steady as a girls mr ian he thought for an instant she was going to embrace him there was such warmth in her face that it seemed to reach out to him he put his arms around her instead and she let him then pushed him away with a pshaw youll muss my gown lad give ower her black gown to the floor was nearly as stiff as she was victorian and a badge of honor like the heavy ring of keys at her waist on a silver chain david trevor came out of the room just off the passage where they stood and gripped ians hand hard with something in his face that made them both feel deeply the loss that neither spoke of trevors son had died at sea in the third year of the war ross had been as close to a brother as anyone rutledge had known it was still a raw grief he was led into the sitting room small and lowceilinged and oldfashioned with comfort apparent in every cushion and a fresh fire on the hearth the dogs after their first joyous welcome curled themselves at his feet with sighs of contentment the tick of the clock was steady peaceful a glass of good whiskey seemed to appear in his hand before hed settled in the chair opposite the one he knew his godfather favored the stiffness and fatigue of the long drive vanished he was in a sense home hamish after hours of angry turmoil seemed to find his own peace here too or was it the fact that rutledge himself had crossed a border in his mind as well as an invisible line on the landscape he thought it might be both how was your journey it was the beginning of a long and undemanding conversation that lasted until trevor heard the clock on the mantel chime the half hour well be late to our dinner and morag will scold me for keeping you here when you want to change go on its the old room under the eaves but large enough not to be claustrophobic rutledge knew it well hed stayed there on his visits boy and man since he could remember at the door trevor clapped him on the shoulder its damned good to see you i hope youll stay as long as you can then his eyes slid away toward the fire mind morag will you she hasnt been the same sincewell since the news came shes showing her years now and its a pity but she loved him you know his voice trailed off rutledge managed to say yes i know and made his way down the passage to the stairs his throat felt thick with grief ross had been clever and handsome and destined for a brilliant future in his fathers architectural firm and now he lay at the bottom of the sea with tons of metal strewing the seabed around him one more navy man with only a memorial to mark his death rutledge had received the news in france one soft spring morning that heralded another gas attack there had been no time to mourn there seldom was morag came out of the room that was his having brought him hot water and fresh towels she stood with hands clasped in front of her until he reached the top of the stairs and walked toward her her eyes were on his face a woman who had known him from childhood who had scolded him for mischiefmaking saved him cakes left from tea dressed his scrapes and mended shirts torn by tumbling out of trees he couldnt turn away and so he smiled were you hurt then in the war nothing that hasnt healed he told her lying for her sake but her eyes read more in his face than he realized aye thats what the letters said but letters arent always the whole truth are they i wanted to see for myself she paused do you dream is that it wordlessly he nodded aye i thought as much well that will pass in gods good time she followed him to his room smoothing the towels on the rack twitching the curtains moving the chintzcovered chair a quarter of an inch then she said quietly mind himself lad hes still grieving you saw the terrible change in him now rutledge hadthe hair grayer the new lines about his mouth the dark circles under his godfathers eyes trevor had agedbut not from age aye she nodded dont let him sit and remember no i wont come down to the kitchen in the morning i will that he said and she grinned at him ill have hot scones for your breakfast come sunday it was a treat a remnant of childhood she walked on down the stairs to put the finishing touches on the dinner shed made the two men sat late over their port that evening and trevor took out the book sent to him by a young architect whod joined his firm in edward harper had been killed in blown to bits with half a dozen other men when an ammunition wagon went up in their faces tell me what you think of this the way he unwrapped it and handed it to rutledge showed clearly how he himself treasured it during his months in france harper had managed to finish a collection of watercolorscameos of men of every rank and unit hed come across african chausseurs malay coolies a french dragoon a cocky australian grinning cheekily a sikh of an east indian regiment wearing a gas mask his flourishing black beard framing it like a giant ruff a range of pugareesturbanseach identifying the district indian troops had come from spahis native africans in french service who collected trophies scots in kilts and a belgian infantryman in his odd helmet these were indisputably individual portraits each vividly captured it showed a remarkable talent its wonderful rutledge said and meant it it also showed the public face of war cheerful and colorful without the casualties and the horrors safe to send home but he said nothing of that to trevor rutledge sat there turning the pages thinking of all the men hed watched die and all the skills that had died with them and for what he wished he knew ill frame them for the office trevor was saying a memorial of sorts then with intense anger draining his glass he added a waste god it was all a bloody waste and rutledge watching his face knew that he was thinking of his son the weekend was oddly enough healing for both men they walked in the early morning they sat and talked by the fire they took the dogs out to flush game by common consent leaving the guns at home there had been enough killing hamish his presence always there kept silent for the most part as if he too had taken some pleasure in trevors broad interests and quiet humor rutledge wondered if the two men would have liked each other in life or if his own precious and precarious sense of peace had held hamish at arms length but when rutledge was alone it was as it had always been a trial of the spirit when he arrived in the kitchen on sunday morning morag wasnt alone in the big room with its iron stove and oldfashioned hearth the scent of fresh scones was warm and delicious but the thin fair man who stood up from the table pink with embarrassment and determination was wearing the uniform of a policeman a scots policeman morag fetching the teapot from the stove where it had been steeping told rutledge he wont go away his names mckinstry and hes the grandson of my late sisters husbands cousin he wants to see you in scotland kith and kin cast a wide net mckinstry rutledge acknowledged taking his accustomed chair and moving his cup closer to morag as she turned to pour what brings you here inspector rutledge the young scot said with formality im not sure sir that is to say its business my own business ive come about just as well i have no jurisdiction here im on holiday aye sir ive been told that the constable glanced uneasily at morag she apparently had made it quite plain that no kin of hers would disturb himselfs guest im from near jedburgh the town where im stationed is smaller and not on the main road i doubt youve ever heard of it until now duncarrick sir hamish who had been on edge since crossing the border was already busy speculating and not liking the answers he found it was the town that inspector oliver had come from the policeman who had so enraged lady maude gray yes ive heard of it morag had set the plate of hot scones in front of him and a dish of butter he wished mckinstry to the devil but listened politely as he reached for his knife the man unwittingly was an intrusion of things rutledge had deliberately put out of his mind for these few days hamish stirring as rutledge himself felt an upsurge of tension was an undercurrent half heard the constables face brightened its not a troublesome place i know the people well enough i cant say theyre any worse than people are in the next town or the next get on with it mckinstry morag said the scones were excellent rutledge had dreamed about them at the frontthe food had been unspeakable and after a while nobody paid any heed to what he was swallowing but there were other times when a sudden memory brought back a taste so vivid it seemed to linger on the tongue he found himself thinking of ross who had always sat across from him grinning as they put away one after another until the plate was empty mckinstry cleared his throat unaware that he was standing behind rosss chair his hands touching the worn wood of the back infringing on a memory inspector oliver informed me late yesterday afternoon that there was a man coming from london to help us in the matter of lady maude grays daughter rutledge the inspector said the name was i came this morning to ask morag gilchrist if it was one and the same man she knew she said you were here on holiday but if i was brief i could ask rutledge another scone halfway to his mouth stared at the young constable a man coming from london rutledge he said the name was he turned sharply to look toward morag but she was working at the oven her back to him when hed spoken to the yard friday morning nothing had been said about continuing to duncarrick was he now expected to report his conversation with lady maude to the scots in person it would be very like bowles to throw a subordinate to the wolves if the chief superintendent saw unpleasantness ahead the man had a knack for taking cover at the right time or had some new information come to light at the teaching hospitals whatever it was rutledge had a sudden nasty feeling that he was going to be the sacrificial lamb he was aware that mckinstry was still talking and its what london may have given you that worries me added to the fact shes incarcerated awaiting trial who was incarcerated rutledge said we were speaking of eleanor gray yes sir thats true but its only circumstantial evidence at best all the same ive a feeling thats sufficient to hang her in duncarrick any jury picked will be ready to vote guilty before theyve heard a single word overturning public opinion is the hurdle and ive not got the skill to do it mckinstry told him earnestly an undercurrent of severe strain in his voice but surely theres a way ive come to ask you to keep an open mind and search for it to my way of thinking if we fail her weve failed ourselves as policemen it was a heartfelt appeal and very near to insubordination the constable stood there young and determined knowing that hed placed his job in jeopardy by questioning the decisions of his superiors in duncarrick but believing strongly enough in what he saw as duty to put his trust in a stranger there were a number of people at the yard who would have had mckinstry up on charges a constable was not allowed opinions but his appeal was wasted on rutledge who knew only the english side of the investigation i havent any idea what youre talking about he said flatly so far london hasnt told me anything i came north to speak to lady maude gray and i have had no orders to continue to duncarrick as morag set a plate of eggs before him he went on for gods sake man sit down and eat some breakfast so that i can enjoy mine mckinstry said flushing ive had mine sir if its all the same to you then sit down and drink a cup of tea and start at the beginning the constable pulled out a chair and glanced at morag she brought him a fresh cup and set it before him without a word she didnt need words to convey the message that he had overstepped his bounds he could read it clearly in her face hamish moved to comment said he believes what hes come to say mckinstry poured himself a cup of tea added milk and sugar like a condemned man determined to show courage eating his last meal and then without tasting it began rather stiffly theres a woman in my district a good womanbut shes been the subject of anonymous letters not mailed you understand just stuck in the corner of a door or left pinned to a clothesline wherever theyd be noticed first thing in the morning all right anonymous what did they say theres usually a theme not to put too fine a point on it sir they called her a whore and as word spread the rumors followed no one confronted her with the accusations thats what i find hardest to accept no one gave her a chance to explain instead they turned their backs on her it appeared shed lied to people you see and they saw it as a betrayal of trust he stopped frowning at least thats what they must have told themselves to excuse what they were doing i cant see any other explanation then to make matters worse it came to light just after the letters began that she might have murdered the mother of a child shed claimed was her own she was taken up on that charge inspector oliver will tell you the case against her and about the bones my concern is that the jury will hang her if they can because its human nature to want to believe you cant be fooled for long mckinstry recollected his tea sipped it and scalded his tongue then he said desperate to make himself understood it reminds me of the days when people believed in witches they sent innocent men and women to the stake or drowned them in a mad effort to prove that witchcraft existed a kind of hysteria that took the place of reason is that whats happening here i dont know why im not infected by it myself but he did know and couldnt bring himself to say it he was in love with fiona and saw her as a victim not a killer it was perhaps his own hysteria the thought frightened him suddenly you were one of the investigating officers then you should know how sound the case is against her rutledge answered does she have a good barrister from what youre telling me she needs one yes she doesthough i dont care for him myself ive tried again and again to get to the bottom of this business because i dont think anyone else has we may have evidence that points in her direction but is there more that points away from her and i dont know how to go about searching for that properly i dont even know where to begin we dont have much in the way of crime in duncarrick rutledge said but thats what youre trained to do whats difficult about it mckinstry ran a finger through sugar that in his nervousness hed spilled beside his teacup i can find a man wanted for robbery i can stop a man from beating his wife i can tell you whos the likely culprit when the macgregors house is broken into and i can look at the old man out in the bothy by the stream and judge if hes killed himself somebody elses fat lamb and cooked it thats work i know this isnt its whispers and gossip spread in passing and nobody knows by whom thats what sits ill with me the way it began its a word dropped here a look there a shrugand i cant find out whos behind it inspector oliver claims it doesnt matter that weve done our work and proved the fact of murder well enough for it to come to trial now but to me it seems to be important to find out how and where the whole business began the truth is it appears to be having a life of its own like a ghost running about and whispering in peoples ears thats fanciful too but i cant explain it any better fanciful or not it evoked a clear image in rutledges mind rumor rutledge agreed can be deadly especially if people are prepared to believe it but surely if there was no more to it than gossip the fiscal and the chief constable would never have allowed the matter to come to trial mckinstry shook his head mournfully ive lain awake nights asking myself that i cant see the chief constable being taken in hes not a gullible man what does he know that makes him so certain theres a case mckinstry gave the matter some thought anonymous letters are a cowards tool keep that in mind and find out who bears a secret grudge against this young woman it might not be the kind of thing you or i would think to hold against her it will be something petty personal certainly and it neednt be a sin of commission omission will do just as well the worst complainer in duncarrick is a neighbor of hers an illtempered man but hes not likely to go about writing anonymous letters hes more the sort to use his fists than hide what he feels could he have taken a fancy to herand been rebuffed it may be that he believed she was giving favors to others and refusing him there was a comical expression on mckinstrys face hugh oliphant in the role of rejected lover hes over seventy his wife watches him like a cat at a mousehole but hed choose a pint over a pretty face any day well then his wife or any other woman who might have suspected her husband of taking too great a personal interest in the accused theres molly braddock well molly sinclair that was tommy braddocks good with his hands hed done the odd job for the accused fixed a window sash when the weight rope broke and cleaned the chimney when birds nested in it last spring hes a happygolucky man the worlds his best friend but molly is possessive mckinstry shook his head i can give you names thats easy enough what i cant do is picture in my mind any of these people sitting down day after day to write such wicked nonsense hamish said hes a conscientious policeman aye and a good man who doesna ken hate rutledge agreed he buttered the last of the scones lets take another direction then he said aloud were the letters biblical in tone yes sir how did you guess it isnt uncommon for anonymous letter writers to clothe their acts in scripture its god chastising you not me his judgment of you not mine mckinstry sighed that would fit half the town were a dour lot eager to spy sin around any corner aye and find it as well you do realize rutledge said studying the young man that these letters may have had nothing to do with the crime shes accused of it may simply be that the letters drew attention to facts no one had considered until then and once the police took notice the truth came out no sir mckinstry said torn between defending his own beliefs and possibly alienating the man from london hed pinned his hopes oni cant accept that without better evidence sometimeshe hesitated glancing at moragsometimes theres such a fever pitch of belief in guilt that nobody looks for the fallacies in the evidence im saying that because of the letters duncarrick was eager to see her blamed that the letters set the stage for all that followed it was easy to shape evidence to fit a theory yes i understand rutledge answered patiently and thats the purpose of a trialto weigh the evidence openly and fairly hamish grunted as if challenging rutledges words if the jury listens mckinstry argued then it works but what if the jury doesnt want to hear anything to the contrary because theyve made up their minds thats what i fear sir because i do know my people and im ashamed to say i have no faith in a jury when the minds shut he took a deep breath and whats to become of the child theres the other worry as far as i know it has no father he looked out the window not at rutledge shes a good woman shes a good mother if she says the babe is hers i want to believe it but the police have said the contrary that she killed the mother and took it then told her aunt and the rest of the world that it was hers the child isnt the laws responsibility rutledge replied thinking of lady maude gray would she claim it if there was any possibility that the child was her daughters even though she refused to believe her daughter was dead stranger things had happened he felt morags eyes on him and turned the old woman shook her head as if denying that she hadnt cared for his answer but he knew she had been disappointed in it so had hamish his mind busy with lady maude rutledge said how did oliver connect this young woman living in duncarrick with a corpse found up in glencoe theres the problem of distance if nothing else mckinstry much more comfortable with a straightforward report than his own feelings lost some of his intensity once it was clear the boy couldnt be hers we went looking for the childs mother we sent queries as far as glasgow and edinburgh and across the border into england the lads going on three we didnt expect it to be easy it was inspector olivers belief that we ought to search where the accused had come from before coming to live in duncarrick that eventually led us to the glen human remains had been found there just last year a womans bones and they hadnt been identified he stopped looked at his teacup then met rutledges eyes the glencoe police were nearly certain that she hadnt been there in march of when theyd scoured the glen searching for an old shepherd whod gone off his head and disappeared and the locals claim it must have been late summer or early autumn as anybody moving sheep in the spring would have noticed the corbies collecting there we sent around a description adding what we suspected in duncarrick to what little the glencoe police had in their files the next thing we knew an inspector in menton contacted us for more information duncarrick has eaten up the news taking it as fact and inspector oliver was not disposed to question the connection he stopped suddenly uncomfortable rutledge didnt press after a moment mckinstry went on at any rate the three jurisdictions accepted the possibility that the missing eleanor gray was the mother of the boy in duncarrick and had died in suspicious circumstances in glencoe theres similarity in height for one thing and the timing fits if shed quarreled with her mother in the spring and then carried a child to term shed have been delivered in late summer and thats when the lad was born whats more none of the other inquiries inspector oliver received matched nearly as well he drew a deep breath even he convinced as he was that fiona was innocent saw that there was a logic about the evidence that was inescapable rutledge said even if im assigned to the case i cant see what i could accomplish that you havent and it was clear that mckinstry himself was not objective rutledge found himself wondering what his relationship washad beenwith the accused show me mckinstry pleaded how to prove shes harmed no one how to stop the whispers before this case comes to a trial id not like to think my failure has sent her to the gallows but its going to happen im helpless to prevent it when mckinstry had gone rutledge turned to morag he shouldnt have come it was wrong he could hear trevor running lightly down the stairs opening the door whistling for the dogs the weekend had given his godfather a new energy what harm did it do she reached for the frying pan alistairs an honest lad with a wish to do whats right should i have sent him away without a hearing as if i couldnt trust you to be just no but it isnt my case you see its inspector olivers and mckinstry doesnt know me i could have made trouble for him reported him for going over the head of his superior or put him in jeopardy for trying to influence my actions bowles would have done so for one another thought occurred to him could the child be his he was in france and he does know you he met you at an aid station behind the front lines hed been shot in the leg he said you were one of the bravest men hed ever met youd just brought in three men whod been gassed and left for dead near a german outpost somehow you found them and got them out alistair was glad to shake your hand trevor was striding down the passage speaking to his dogs the big kitchen suddenly seemed small close and overheated hamish alive in his mind was as loud as a voice in the room rutledge could barely remember that day at the aid station and certainly not the face of the soldier lying on a stretcher close by who had shaken his hand as the doctors cleaned a cut on his wrist hed stood there grimly unaware of pain it had happened not too long after hamishs death and rutledge had purposely taken risks wanting to die it hadnt been courage it had been desperationanything to silence the voice in his head even death morag was talking but her words failed to register trevor was greeting him and the dogs frisked noisily about his feet trevor said ian are you all right rutledge shook his head to clear it yes im fine morag was telling me about a relation of hers it brought back some memories thats all to morag he said im sorry i dont seem to place him but afterward as he walked down to a stream with trevor talking about his work he found himself thinking again about mckinstry what the young policeman had wanted from him was some semblance of hope the promise that if he took over the case hed be objective not swept up in the conclusions already drawn it didnt matter there was no reason for him to be involved hed finished his business with lady maude and the rest of the case would be in the hands of the courts he didnt want to stay in scotland on monday morning rutledge put in a telephone call to london from david trevors study bowles summoned to the telephone answered brusquely rutledge is that you yes he quickly summarized his conversation with lady maude and ended with his own view its hard to say in my opinion she doesnt know where her daughter is presently and its quite possible that shes at one of the teaching hospitals ive already had the report on that theres no eleanor gray wanting to become a doctor she might have used another name yes yes im aware of that but theres no one who matches the physical description you gave sergeant owens id say at a guess that whatever the quarrel was about it was not medicine that the young woman left home for she might not have told her mother the truth there was a pause one thing we did learn she was a suffragette independent young miss arrested a number of times for chaining herself to fences and making herself a public nuisance in whatever fashion got her the most notice a young woman likely to find herself in trouble of one kind or another id say sergeant gibson remembered her from before the war and he says she hasnt been in trouble with the police for some years now could mean shed learned her lesson or that she is dead bowles took a long breath indicating a change of subject weve had a call from lady maude youre to go to scotland and find out what you can about this corpse shes insisting that you take over the case and her familys not to be dragged into it no speculation about her daughter public or private until you are absolutely certain that the corpse is eleanor grays what the hell did you say to her by ten oclock that morning rutledge had asked directions from trevor accepted the generous packet of sandwiches that morag had put up for him and turned south and west toward jedburgh and tweedesdale it was a day of mixed sun and clouds with a brief shower or two that raised the damp smell of earth long shadows were cast across the countryside when the sun came out vanishing and reappearing like magic as the clouds shifted across the sky there always seemed to be more sky in scotland than in england a different sky vast and empty as if god werent at home he had come to scotland for a weekend owed to his godfather and now duty was keeping him here he felt misgivings his mind unsettled the peace hed found at hadrians wall worn off and hamish in his accustomed place behind the drivers shoulder was as disturbed by the turn of events as rutledge himself he could hear the voice as clearly as if there were a passenger blamingstubbornly refusing to accept the change in plans and ill no go to the glen again rutledge tried to shut him out and then fell prey to another kind of haunting awakened grief for the motorcar also carried the ghost of ross trevor rutledge had felt the dead mans presence so strongly at the lodge in france he had arrived at an acceptance of rosss death but in the house where ross had spent every summer for twentyfive years or more it seemed that he must surely be somewhere just out of sightdown the passageupstairs in his roomout riding and expected soontalking to morag in the kitchen his laughter preceding him his swift energetic footsteps approaching the door ross trevor had been a powerful presence and rutledge had found himself watching the doorways listening over the ticking of the grandfathers clock or the wind in the eaves for some sign of it it seemed impossible that such a man had vanished so completely swallowed by the sea over the last four months rutledge had begun for the first time to realize what the civilian population had endured during the long dark days when casualties mounted and there seemed to be no end to the fighting it was different from the way that soldiers saw the dying but no less terrible a time for mourning he wondered if david felt that same sense of anticipation and if he did how he lived with itand then realized that for rosss father and for morag it might be oddly comforting hamish said as if picking up the thought they never saw him dead they never closed the lid over his coffin and watched the earth shoveled down on it like me he never came home and so theyre still waiting jedburgh like its neighbors from berwick to dumfries was not the scotland of kilts and pipes and bonnie prince charlie these were the marches that ran on either side of the frontier between scotland and england the border towns of the lowlands where a different kind of war had raged for centuries raids into england for cattle and sheep and horses shaping generations of hard men the english had raided north too with equal vigor and cunning it had been a way of life until the s sometimes condoned and sometimes condemned but always profitable enough to be a main local industry union between scotland and england had finally put a stop to that and the legacy of john knox had narrowed the borderers wild soul into a primmer mold where business and righteousness walked hand in hand the sabbath was holy women knew their place and the kirk was a stronger influence in daily affairs than edinburgh much less faroff london legends had grown up around raids and raiders ballads and tales celebrated reivers named sim the laird jock of the side and kinmont willie after all this was land where the shifting sands of policy war feuds and alliances had often redrawn the border to suit the times what was mine today might be yours tomorrow and taking it back again became a popular sport rutledge drove into jedburgh through another shower and found the turning that led to duncarrick it was a small town in the green rolling country between air water and the tweed a tall hedge of houses shops and one hotel formed an irregularly shaped nineteenthcentury square with a worn monument at the top commemorating the burning of the town three times in thirty years during the early s the pillar stood at the high end of the square a lonely sentinel of the past surrounded by the towns newer image other houses some much older straggled west beyond the square and there was a modest inn among them the wooden sign over the door read the reivers barely a dozen streets bracketed the heart of duncarrick and gave it an isolated feeling as if it had been stranded in the middle of nowhere an agricultural community untouched by the woolen tweed industry that had crowded its neighbors its no a highland town hamish reflected but its no sassenach either not english and he was right there was indeed a different air here from the small english border towns no more than a hard ride away where jedburgh had once boasted walls towers a castle and an abbey duncarrick had been burned to the ground so often that little of its past remained a pele tower the tall halfhousehalfdefensivefortress of the raiding years stood in a field about a mile past the last dwelling it was little more than a tall rubble of stone and shadow now with perhaps two floors still intact and the door slanted ajar he passed it and then turned around in the next farm lane rutledge got out to stretch his legs leaving the motorcar parked on the grassy verge some one hundred yards from the pele tower and going the rest of the way on foot such towers were a part of rutledges own heritage and he found them of absorbing interestan architectural as well as a military solution to what must have been wretched years of constant danger the routledges his own ancestors had once been borderers on the english side raiding with the best of them until a widow with three young sons had moved south in search of a more peaceful climate in which to raise them shrewd and capable shed found prosperity there as well the borderer had proved to be a match for clever sophisticated tudor london in more ways than one there was a painting of her in the london house with an impeccable ruff like a halo behind her head a firm chin and lively intelligent eyes that the elizabethan painter had captured so well that they seemed to follow the viewer about the room staring directly knowingly at him wherever he stood as a small child rutledge had understandably confused her with god he tramped across the fallow field that surrounded the tower base and heard the clamor of sheep somewhere in the distance even before he smelled them on the damp air standing at the foot of the massive stone walls looking up at the broken top where birds had nested and wind whipped through the empty windows he became aware of someone moving toward him turning he saw a man in the rough clothes of a farmer his face reddened by the sun his hat jammed on his head like a fixture good morning he called as he saw rutledge turn looking for something no just interested in the stonework rutledge waited until the man was nearer and added its amazing the craftsmanship of the people who built this its stood here whatfour or five hundred years about that fine workmanship i agree desperate times calling for desperate measures if you like it belonged to my wifes family she knows the history of it better than i do he took off his hat and wiped his forehead with his sleeve god everything smells of sheep im a horse breeder by preference draft horses but the army took nearly every animal i had and ive got to start again meanwhile the sheep are tiding me over he grinned its a near thing whether ill kill them first or theyll be the death of me stupid beasts they are even the dogs find them irritating he spoke well for a farmer an educated man id have as little to do with them as possible rutledge agreed here on holiday theres some good walking in the district if you know where to look the rule is close gates you find closed and leave open gates you find open theres a nastytempered ram here and there but youll see him before he sees you thanks ill keep it in mind the man nodded and walked on whistling to his dogs who ran tongues lolling some distance ahead their ears pricked and they obeyed his signals instantly rutledge watched them clever animals hed always admired their intelligence their speed and the way they could drop to the ground nearly invisible when the command came working dogs these not pampered house pets and very good at what they did in the highlands especially sheep couldnt be run without them he had met a man once who trained these dogs an old roughedged rogue who had taken his skills and his eye for instinct to new zealand where sheep were still king rutledge went back to the motorcar and starting the engine headed into duncarrick again he drove slowly through the main square studying it before he came back to the hotel and asked directions to the police station the clerk told him but i doubt theres anyone there at this time of day and inspector oliver is away to jedburgh on business constable mckinstrys to home its his day off rutledge left his motorcar at the hotel and walked the short distance following the clerks careful instructions mckinstry lived behind the square a threestory house with a fresh coat of cream paint the buckets and ladders stood to one side in the narrow alley between it and its neighbor waiting for the sun to reappear down the same street some twelve or thirteen buildings to the left was the police station its sign affixed to the door a neat black square with white letters as the clerk had foretold no one was there rutledge turned back to mckinstrys house there was a fair amount of activity in the streetsoberly dressed men and women going about their business two carters carried on a loud conversation at the next corner then moved on as a lorry came rolling slowly past looking to make a delivery at the apothecarys shop hamish who had been observing the town with some interest commented theres enough money here to keep up appearances but no enough to be grand plain people with plain souls it was rutledge thought a fair verdict mckinstry had been rightthe police here dealt with the ordinary and even murder could fall into that category constable mckinstry concealing his surprise at finding rutledge on his doorstep welcomed him into the parlor and waited for him to explain his visit although there was a glint of hope in the bluegray eyes the paintspattered coveralls he wore were loosefitting as if hed been a stouter man before the war i understand that inspector oliver is in jedburgh rutledge began taking the chair mckinstry had pointed out lets be clear about that from the start i came to see him you were right the yard has put me in charge of a part of this case and i need to know the rest of the details as soon as possible can you tell me when hes expected back mckinstry said not until dinnertime so im told sir the inspector said he was attending to a private matter or tactfully out of sight would you like me to take you to the chief constable instead he looked down at his coveralls and grinned as soon as i change out of these no ill speak to oliver first in the meantime id like to hear something about the town and the people here youve given me a fairly comprehensive picture but now i need more i was just having my tea and id be honored to have you join me over tea and a lemon cream cake that had come from the bakers mckinstry chose his words with great care trying to see duncarrick through a strangers eyes youd call it provincial coming from london we dont have broad horizons but most people have known each other all their lives depended on each other in hard times seen each other through the worst and the best that happens to them weddings funerals he passed rutledge a wedge of the cake on a delicate china plate if i fell ill tomorrow id have the neighbors bringing me tea and soups and fresh bread my washing would be done clean sheets for the bed someone would think to bring me a few flowersa book to read and not because im the constable its our way he cut himself a slice of lemon cake savored it then said sorry i dont have any sandwiches no this is enough rutledge said carry on hamish had been listening commenting on the examples mckinstry had given agreeing with most of them in my experience it would be the lassies with the flowers hoping to be noticed but theres the other side of the coin too sir were a rigid lot when it comes to sin its black and white no gray in between we can be smallminded we know each others business thats a help to me as i told you at mr trevors house i can guess whos chasing the youngs cat or borrowing tim crosers horse when hes drunk and not likely to notice that would be bruce hall who is courting a lass between here and jedburgh and hates walking when he can ride but his pa wont give him the loan of a horse because he doesnt approve of the girl and yet you cant put your finger on the author of these letters mckinstry frowned and set down his cup and thats what i find most disturbing he said considering it why cant i go and knock on a door and see guilt written in the face answering it i walk down the street on my rounds and i look into the eyes of the people i meet i stand and talk to them for a time i watch them go about their daily business and theres nothing about them that i can put my finger on and say now thats the action of a guilty woman why are you so certain its a woman because why would a man think to warn a laundress that her soul was in danger washing a whores sheets or warn a young mother that her small daughter had a bastard for a playmate and was likely to see goingson at the inn that werent fit for an innocent childs eyes hamish was already there but rutledge set aside his plate and finished his tea before saying a man might write such things to throw you off the scent or he may recognize that its the women in duncarrick who form public opinion mckinstrys face darkened then hes a bloody coward begging your pardon sir rutledge asked for a chronology of the case and mckinstry painstakingly gave it to him this time leaving out nothing that he considered important rutledge paid close attention noting facts as well as listening for nuances when mckinstry had finished he said well done hamish silent in his head stirred uneasily rutledge found his thoughts straying for an instant then went on my guess is that whoever wrote such letters knew theyd be believed and thats the next point why would people so readily believe them why didnt the first person to find one on his doorstep march straight to the police or to the accused and make it clear that this wasnt going to continue mckinstry took a long breath you are asking me to answer you that shes guilty the accused where theres smoke theres fire they say but im not prepared to believe that id rather believe that the letterwriter chose her histargets very carefully some people relish gossip if its shocking enough will you make a list of all the people who have admitted to receiving these letters what they do for a living what reason they might have had for disliking the accused how well they might have known her yes sir ill do that today but begging your pardon sir i dont see how that will help you find out the truth about the bones said to be lady maude grays daughters he shook his head and thats another whole kettle of fish it is rutledge agreed but in my experience where coincidence dovetails so perfectly it becomes suspect first we have these letters apparently accepted as truthful and now you tell me there was another one from hereor from glasgow depending on how reliable the postmark may be only this anonymous writer stoutly defends the accused and in so doing puts her in even greater jeopardy a charge of murder not mere wantonness theres a search of the innwhere a body turned up only it isnt the boys mother now who knew enough about the history of the reivers that he or she sent inspector oliver on such a wildgoose chase but it does whet olivers appetite for the hunt and he begins to search for missing persons the upshot of that is a set of unidentified bones and a connection with a woman in england whose daughter has not been seen since now we have larger questions to answer than who wrote the letters i wonder was someone counting on just that there was confusion in mckinstrys eyes i dont follow you sir but hamish did he said is the woman in yon cell a murderera victimor a scapegoat as rutledge took his leave mckinstry said the worrisome thing in all of thisto my way of thinkingis that no one has lifted a hand for fiona no one has spoken up for her not mr elliot not mr robson not mr burnsthe fiscal not inspector oliver its as if shes been found guilty already and the trials a travesty thatll put a stamp on it for the world to see we were right in what we did a jury has said as much and the truth will be buried with her that keeps me awake at night he ticked the words off on his right hand minister chief constable procuratorfiscal policeman and what if shes innocent and they hang her walking back to his motorcar at the hotel rutledge went over again the information mckinstry had laid out for him what intrigued him was how skillfully balanced each scrap of the puzzle seemed to be like a game of chess where the player knows in advance the moves of each piece on the board in chess there were two players attack and counterattack in life there would be no certainties about the outcome before rutledge left the house the constable had taken out a copy he had made of the letter that had been addressed to mr elliot the minister he read it aloud as rutledge listened he found himself thinking that elliot would have been better advised to go directly to the woman herself and ask for some explanation instead hed chosen to involve the police indicating that he had already half believed the malicious accusations brought to him by his parishioners that would be worth exploring taking the copy from mckinstry rutledge had scanned it it was untutored apparently the work of a woman who earnestly tried to defendand instead unwittingly pointed a finger of guilt if it was a hoax it was very cleverly devised there was a ring of sincerity in the simple wording i have heard horrid gossip about a young woman in duncarrick it is sad that no one has spoken a word in her defense i will lose my place if i tell you how i met her her given name was fiona it was the late summer of she was traveling with a very young baby and had no milk for him it struck me that she could not be the mother and indeed i learned that the mother had just died and she had been given the baby to raise as her own i was distressed for her because she was unwed and had no family except for an elderly spinster aunt when i asked her if the mother had any family who could help she began to cry and wouldnt tell me how the poor creature had died or even where she had been buried she told me fiercely that she would be a good mother and would not allow anyone to take the boy from her i could see that she was very agitated she was always looking over her shoulder as if expecting to see someone there but there was no one i soon gave up trying to reason with her what struck me was her unshakable belief that she could bring up this poor orphan as her son i cannot be convinced that she would turn wanton and betray the trust that had been placed in her please do what you can on her behalf it isnt right for her to be tormented in this way i would as soon believe that fiona was a murderer as believe she has become a whore he had even read it a second time finding the wording and the sense of it more interesting than the content and you never discovered whod written this no sir though we made every effort it came from glasgow but theres no telling who had put it in the post box there it doesnt quite say that the mother of the boy was murdered you see but if the death was natural surely there would have been a doctor in attendancerelatives notified and fiona should have been able to tell us where to find such witnesses instead theres a mystery about where and how the child was born she wont say she wont tell us where the mother is buried if its true that shes dead but thats knowledge after the fact what convinced the chief constable that there ought to be some investigation into the matter merely the letter or was there more ive never been offered an answer to that mckinstry tugged at his earlobe uncertain hed never considered the question himself orders were orders rutledge had said after all it began as a moral issue whether or not the accused was what she claimed to be a decent widow with a child to raise on her own and mr elliot chose to do nothing about it an admission that he had reason to believe the first letters were telling the truth it would be damning mckinstry shook his head i cant say the chief constable summoned inspector oliver and then inspector oliver sent me to search the premises and i did there was nothing outoftheway in the living quarters or the inn the stables were a public place i couldnt see a body being buried out there even in the dead of night any work would have been noticed straightaway by the handyman but inspector oliver prides himself on being thorough and he had the place apart thats when he found the bones in the back of a cupboard that had been walled up it dumbfounded the lot of us i can tell you and he believed hed found the body of the childs mother oh yes there was long hair on the skull i was sent to summon dr murchison and he came at once then told inspector oliver hed been brought out of his surgery on a wildgoose chase the bones were not a womans they belonged to a man and they were all of a hundred years old walking back through duncarricks main square rutledge stopped and considered the shops and houses lining either side of the road these townspeople were prosperous enough as hamish had pointed out but without obvious signs of wealth surely a small inn on the outskirts of town would offer neither problem nor competition if the reivers provided extra rooms to people on market day so much the better as for competing with the only hotel rutledge doubted if it could hold a candle to the amenities offered there it would have served a simpler class of person who couldnt afford the grandness of the ballantyne and any success it had enjoyed would have been modest in comparison to this part of the town a good living for the owners yes but hardly extravagant he moved on watching people going about their daily lives women entering and leaving the shops a nursemaid with a pram carefully maneuvering it through the door of a house a woman sweeping her front step a small boy playing with a top men in dark suits coming out of offices others in work clothes carrying the tools of a trade a crocodile of schoolgirls marching in the wake of a schoolmistress wearing a thick coat and unbecoming hat ordinary people their eyes avoiding those of the stranger passing them no curiosity about his presence or his business as if once burned twice shy hamish said mckinstry was right theyre a dour lot there was one other common feature among them unsmiling faces and thin tight mouths as if life was a burden and they were used to enduring it a woman stepped out of a shop close to where he was standing and cast a surreptitious glance in his direction hamish saw her before he did commenting that she could have studied him just as clearly from the front window a tall woman pretty in a severe way with her hair in a tightly confined bun her sweater and skirt a very prim gray with only a touch of color in the silk shirtwaist a paisley of peach and gray and white she made a fuss over the potted plants that stood on either side of the shop door they were pretty a mixture of rose geraniums and something lavender and white like pansies satisfied she turned and went quickly back inside he looked at the neatly painted sign above the door a tait millinery he filed it away for future reference if she had been interested enough to inspect a stranger she might also be a gossip rutledge retrieved his car from the ballantynes yard and drove out past the church he found the reivers again and stopped across the road to look at it yes hed been right comfortable decenthardly a blot on the conscience of duncarrick neither a wild tavern nor a seedy lodging small and long no more than two stories with an attic above the inn was one of those old buildings that survived because they were in nobodys wayno one wanted to build a square here or shops or a large house duncarricks main square on the other hand had probably seen the demise of a whole street of houses to widen the space to suit nineteenthcentury builders with progress on their minds the houses on either side here and down the lane by the inns stables were neither picturesque nor ugly more a reflection of the straightforwardness of the people who lived in them only the house to ones left facing the inn was by any measure grand boasting three stories and an extension toward the rear as if it had grown over the years with the family living there the windows had been set with some eye to symmetry and style lending a faint touch of grace the inn looked rooted in its earth tidy freshly whitewashed in the past year the door to the bar hidden behind a climbing rose that had spread with age to cover the porch it had been intended to adorn it was a hardy rose to survive in this climate and the small garden at its feet showed some care for the impression the inn made on passersby the bar parlor on the side facing the narrow lane into the inn yard at the rear had a green door and crisp white curtains showed behind the windows next to it time could have turned this into a rowdy pub on the outskirts of town but the inn had managed somehow to retain a certain dignity because two women had had the care of it i canna think why theyd persecute a lass with such a dowry as the inn hamish was saying theyd be more likely to want their sons to wed her and that too was a question worth considering it all kept coming back to that why had the town united so easily against this woman on impulse rutledge shut off the engine and got out crossing the road and walking down into the inn yard where the stables and outbuildings stood they were in a fair state of repair with little work done during the war and no money after it to tackle major improvements upkeep spoke well for the management he was poking about in the stable looking for the cabinet where inspector oliver had discovered the first set of bones when a loud voice said here what do you think youre doing he turned to find a tall heavyshouldered man of middle age standing in the doorway arms akimbo staring at him with harsh dislike shadowed by the doorway his face was dark and ugly but had a strength to it as well rutledge well aware that he was trespassing replied peaceably id heard that the inn might be for sale theres no decision been made to sell or not sell the man said i see rutledge turned having found what he was looking for the part of the wall pulled down to bring a skeleton to light the cupboard deep enough to start with had been made shallower to conceal the grave behind it a careful bit of worka hundred years ago trouble had been taken to make the spot seem ordinary unsuspicious it must have been quite a shock for inspector oliver to discover that his corpse was nearly as old as the inn rutledge began to walk toward the man blocking the exit it made him uneasy to have his way closedeven in the relative spaciousness of the stable he could feel the claustrophobia it invoked the air seemed thick suffocating tell me about the owner he broke off after being buried alive in the impenetrable mud of a shell crater weighed down by hamishs body rutledge had come to hate being shut inconfined in any fashion traveling on trains sleeping in a small room seeing himself cut off from escape through a door or down a stairthe need for space was so urgent that it ignited a rising panic even here he could feel the sudden dampness of sweat on his face the difficulty breathing the awareness of hideous danger youll be wanting to speak to the police then the man told him bluntly but didnt elaborate his stance was intentionally threatening now belligerent as if he sensed rutledges sudden uneasiness rutledge felt his own muscles tensing rutledge replied a woman i understand what has she done to find herself of interest to the police none of your affair is it at last the man moved out into the sunlight and rutledge followed his breathing still uneven damn this he swore fighting the claustrophobia keep your mind on what youre doing cant you but hamish too was responding to the mans aggressive stance asking if he had believed the innuendoes and the lettersor was incensed by them rutledge thought it was difficult to tell he was a man who showed little in his face he would not be easy to interrogate does she have any family heirs none uncompromising cold then grudgingly none that i know of no mention of the boy but he would inherit nothing would he then ill be on my way walking back toward the inn rutledge could sense the mans stare boring into his back between his shoulder blades if this was any example of how the townspeople felt about the woman who owned this property it was evident that she had somehow made abiding enemies which didnt fit into the picture of her that mckinstry had so glowingly painted who was the woman in the eye of a controversy that might well end with a hanging rutledge realized suddenly that he didnt even know her full name not that it mattered he thought but it was an indication that whatever crime she had committedfrom lying to murdershe had somehow lost her identity because of it as if by refusing to call her by name duncarrick could finish what they had begun back in juneshunning her until she was without reality and finally disappeared what had this woman done to stir up such dark passions it was odd he thought crossing the quiet street to his car first the venomous letters and then the one to the ministerelliot the finding of one body that didnt match the crime and another that did persistence patienceand what else luck or persecution it smacked of the latter hamish in the back of his mind agreed rutledge stopped before turning the crank and looked back at the reivers the accused owned this inn did someone covet it she had a small child to provide for never mind whether it was rightfully hers or not did someone covet the child or want it taken away to punish the accused a twisted revenge for a real or imagined grudge and these were the more obvious reasons for wanting the woman in prison and out of the way what others might there be was there something in the inn that no one knew about which mattered to another person or was it something in the past of the accused that put another person in jeopardy hanging was a certain way of silencing her he found himself thinking of the child again torn away from its mother from the only home it had known put to live with strangers there was a cruelty in that then why hadnt she lied to protect the boy i dont have my marriage linesmy husband took them to show the army why hadnt she left the town as soon as the shunning had begun but he thought he had the answer to thatthe shunning had reduced custom at the inn to the point that she might not have had the money to go away had that been the intent of it the womans voice behind him startled him are you looking for someone rutledge turned and removed his hat hamish responding to his surprise was suddenly alert watchful she was tall and plump dressed in black but young perhaps twentyfour or five a little girl of six or seven held her hand i was admiring the inn id heard it might be for sale the woman shook her head early days to know that she turned to the door of the house in front of which hed left his car a neighbor then i understand the owner is to stand trial on some charges her face hardened she is he found himself asking do you know the name of her barrister i might speak with him armstrongs his name but he doesnt live in duncarrick jedburgh i think i was told rutledge smiled down at the little girl she smiled shyly back he wondered if shed played with the child living in the inn but couldnt ask in front of the mother and as if the thought had sprung from his mind to hers the girl said in a soft sweet voice i used to play with him the little boy at the reivers but hes gone away i miss him hush you were told never to speak of that again the woman commanded and the child turned her face into her mothers skirts flushing with shame as if she had transgressed horribly the woman opened the house door and went inside shutting it firmly behind her shutting out rutledge and his questions unwilling to gossipto speculateor to defend rutledge drove back to trevors house rather than take a room at the ballantyne unwilling to move himself into duncarrick until hed spoken with oliver it was a courtesy but often small courtesies lubricated the wheels of change the long drive gave him time to think that evening over dinner he told david trevor how he had spent his day trevor smiled once a policeman always a policeman rutledge grinned in return blame human nature curiosity is mans besetting sin the garden of eden trevor agreed eve is always blamed for offering adam the apple but its my view that he had been looking for an excuse to see how it tasted he would have bitten into it on his own in a day or two what i find interesting about the situation you described trevor went on is that i know the chief constable in that district robson a good man so is the fiscal by reputation i cant quite see robson railroading a young woman if there was no real evidence against her you know that scotland is different from england in that we dont have a coroners inquest the procuratorfiscal and the chief constable together with the officers involved discuss the evidence and come to a decision as to whether or not there should be a trial it isnt based on a coroners jury that might be prejudiced for or against the suspect and its often decided on several levelswhether for instance the woman would be better off having a jury establish her innocence for all to see have you considered that aspect of a trial ian rutledge finished his soup and set down his spoon i have but it seems to me that bringing her to trialassuming of course that shes innocent of the chargeshas hardened feelings against her in the upshot the jury might prefer to hang her trevor nodded to morag to take away his empty soup plate and said theyll work it out ian but id watch my back if i were you ive never met this inspector oliver but hes certain to resent your interferencethat is if hes still smarting from his encounter with lady maude and she could be trouble come to that theres a very complex relationship between parent and child and i have a feeling youll be damned if you doand damned if you dont prove conclusively that eleanor gray has nothing whatsoever to do with this business if women sat on the jury there would be no doubt that this young woman would be convictedand the question is will they bring such pressure to bear on their menfolk that the results are the same in his own cases rutledge made it a point to be absolutely certain that his evidence clearly presented left no room for doubt in his mind or the jurys but jurors were often contraryconvicting where there was only circumstantial evidence and acquitting where proof seemed indisputable burnsthe fiscalis too good a man to allow a prejudiced jury but was he the woman was already set for trial on purely circumstantial evidence what if rutledge thought he himself proved that the bones on the mountainside were eleanor grays and that she had borne a child before she died the assumption would be that it was the child the accused was raising a natural assumptionbut not necessarily a true one would there be justiceor a miscarriage of justice and for the childs sake it was imperative that rutledge got it right he could feel tiredness seeping into his shoulders and into the muscles of his neck are ye up to it then hamish asked rutledge let the subject drop at the end of the meal david trevor studied him for a moment then said its still on your mind isnt it that problem in duncarrick youll be leaving for good in the morning i take it there was a note of regret barely concealed in the pleasant voice im glad you came you dont know how much it has meant to me to have you here rutledge looked down at his plate i wasnt sure i could face coming back to scotland it seemed insurmountable just thinking about it trevor said yes its different isnt it with a sigh he added i suppose a time will come when i dont listen for him in the late afternoon just before tea or lie awake at night thinking ive heard his key in the lock or look for him at breakfast in the morning but rutledge hadnt been thinking of ross trevor his mind had turned to the dead scots soldiers who had not come back at all on the brink of sleep that night the nagging doubts began hamish listening to the questions that rutledge was mentally cataloging said you canna know the whole of it you havena interviewed the prisoner nor looked at where they found the victim you havena spoken to the neighbors nor even seen the child youve heard only yon constables view of the matter and hes prejudiced in the womans favor rutledge said in defense of his doubts ive investigated too many murders i know something about the way evidence comes to light the facts here dont fit awkwardly as they should do who could have known that the skeleton was in the back of the cabinet in that stable someone did ill wager because oliver came back a second time to search if he didnt know who did he turned over feeling sleep slipping away from him the inn is closed the child is taken away and the woman is sent to prison to stand for her trial he went on to himself unable to stop his mind from working with no impediment hamish countered aye but there was no way of knowing the yard would be brought into the case why did lady maude change her mind i was nearly certain when i left there that her daughter was alive and well why did she change her mind hamish said she didna strike me as frivolous or foolish and that rutledge thought finally on the verge of sleep was an extremely insightful analysis of lady maude the next morning in the rain trevor helped rutledge carry his luggage out to the car then shook his hand warmly morag a shawl over her head came to embrace him shamelessly reaching up to him rutledge found himself wishing that he neednt leave after all he had found ghosts hereand affection the ghosts he was accustomed to affection he was not the rain fell in a heavy downpour that seemed to presage winter a coldness in the air that touched the skin as he drove back to duncarrick inspector oliver wasnt at the police station the constable on duty macnab by name stood up warily as rutledge introduced himself and offered to send for oliver for hes out at a farm west of town theres been a rash of small fires that were probably set on purpose no let him finish his business ill be at the hotelthe ballantyne tell him he can find me there he left wondering to himself if constable mckinstry could put a name to the arsonist the hotel offered an oldfashioned but comfortable elegance that breathed victorian respectability the young woman behind the desk looked up as he came dripping in and smiled good morning sir in a manner of speaking he took off his hat and looked ruefully at the wet brim indeed i think i could use a drink then id like a room ill be glad to see to that for you sir she indicated the door to his left the bar parlor is through there thanks he went through the door and found the room filled with other refugees from the rain the atmosphere was muggy as if the dampness each had brought with him had settled in a cloud around them like fog the smell of wet wool mingled with wood smoke someone had lit the fire on one side of the paneled room and it struggled to assert itself adding measurably to the gloom but no one paid any heed lively conversations holding their attention instead rutledge found a table by the windows that overlooked the street he could hear the laughter from the bar rough and male workmen who had taken advantage of the rain to stop in for a pint he wondered how many of them had once patronized the reivers a man with a fierce mustache came in looked around him and saw rutledge he came striding across to the table nodded and said im oliver rutledge got to his feet and offered his hand olivers grip was strong but brief he took the other chair at the table and beckoned to one of the barmaids she came over took their orders and was gone oliver stretched his feet out looked ruefully at his wet shoes and sighed then he turned to rutledge and said i wont beat about the bush its not my way i dont like london sending someone up here to mind my business but its done ill cooperate in any way i can im afraid this is not my doing either but there we are id like to discuss the evidence with you when you have the time the barmaid brought their orders and oliver drank his ale savoring it then he said the evidence isnt the problem its the bones did you learn anything at all from that termagant in menton ive need of it if you have lady maude refused to acknowledge that shed quarreled with her daughter rutledge answered but if i were a betting man id give you good odds she did the question is where is eleanor gray now and no one seems to know lady maude swears her daughter had no interest in or enthusiasm for walking in the highlands that theres no explanation that might put eleanor in glencoe or anywhere else in scotland during yes well mothers are like that they shut their eyes to a good deal that they find it unpleasant to take notice of look at it this wayif a handsome young soldier told the daughter hed like to spend his leave walking about in the scottish hills do you think shed refuse to go war does strange things to womenput a man in uniform and they trust him with their virtue and their lives shed hardly go walking in the mountains when she was nine months pregnant or for that matter find a soldier willing to take her there oliver grunted im just saying that mothers dont always know their daughters lady maude may think what she pleases the fact is its not proof of anything why were you and the authorities prepared to arrest this local woman london gave me the outline of the case little more oliver thought it over then said it was this way the anonymous letters started in june as far as we can tell and what i found curious about the dozen or so brought to my attention is that people believed them at any rate her neighbors began to shun mrs macleod as she called herself then a few of them finally stepped forward taking the letters to the minister mr elliot but not to ask if the accusations were true or not they were more concerned about their own souls and after some thought and prayer mr elliot came to the police the letters fell on fertile ground then why was this woman not liked or accepted in duncarrick if youd asked me just a few months ago id have said she was well liked i never heard of any problemsmoral or otherwise and i hear most things the general feeling seems to be that the young woman must have lied to her aunt because ealasaid maccallum was an upright woman who would never have countenanced a falsehood told to her acquaintance shed have been the first to say my niece has gotten herself into trouble but ive brought her here to give her a chance to repent and atone its my christian duty and people would have respected that you see hamish said aye thats the way it would ha been done but without compassion rutledge responded a cold and judging second chance oliver went on mr elliot then told me privately that a number of people had spoken to him about the young woman before the letters started one man found himself tempted by her and was afraid for his soul a young woman saw in her an instrument of the devil because she had turned the head of a young man who frequented the inn another woman found her far too warm to the child saying that it was no way to bring up a lad spare the rod was the message and mr elliot had already tried to speak to miss macdonald about her attendance at services shed told him that her duties at the inn sometimes kept her up late and shed found it hard to be prompt on those sunday mornings he had thought at the time that it was not a proper excuse i see rutledge commented into the silence that expected a response but what he saw was a judgment a sense that the accused had not lived up to the high standards others had set for themselves and by extension for her oliver looked across the room at another table something else on his mind then picked up the thread of his narrative on the heels of the anonymous letters came another correspondence and that damned more than it exonerated i thought as did the chief constable that it bore looking into where there is a pattern where there was smoke and thats when i sent my constablewho knew her well enough to question her gentlyto ask for her marriage lines she as much as told him there werent any and when he asked if shed submit to an examination by a physician in regard to the birth of the child in question she adamantly refused mckinstry had no choice but to conduct a search of the premises but failed to carry it out to my satisfaction and i came back instead of a buried woman i came across a man a hundred years dead and it made me a laughingstock i can tell you dr murchison had more to say than i cared to hear on the subject aye hamish remarked it touched his pride rutledge thought that that was possible and might account for olivers unflagging determination to find answers to the questions raised about the woman i sent out a request for information on any missing persons and thats when i heard about the corpse found up the glen id just come back from viewing it when menton contacted me with the information they had on the gray woman and fool that i was i set off to england with the feeling that i was bringing the loose ends tidily together and got my head bitten off instead he regarded rutledge for several seconds as if weighing how his view of the situation had been received apparently satisfied he asked can you tell me what youre considering as the next step i dont know rutledge replied with honesty youve most certainly done all that was required of you and more what has the accused told you precious little only that shes committed no crime and shes worried for the child im not surprised she feels an attachment there women have a natural mothering instinct whether theyve borne a child of their own or not its to her credit that shes raised him to the best of her ability mr elliot has closely questioned the lad and he appears to know his bible stories the boys particularly fond of moses and the bulrushes it seems and josephs coat of many colors he smiled ealasaid maccallum the accuseds aunt made the lad a bathrobe in multicolored stripes and hes very fond of it we let him keep it and the little stuffed dog the accused made out of one of her greatuncles wool socks there was no harm in that either it seems to comfort him hes cried more than a lad going on three should but then he believes the woman to be his mother it will take some time to convince him otherwise rutledge found himself thinking of morag and the expression on her face when hed said that the child was not the concern of the law the words had been spoken in another context that of dealing with a woman charged with murder but morag had taken them to heart and let him know it shed always had a warm feeling for young things children and puppies and kittenseven an orphaned lamb that ross trevor age seven had insisted on handrearing rutledge wondered what she would have to say about olivers remarks it will take some time to convince him otherwise left unsaid was the corollary by the time shes hanged hell not be mourning for her would anyone why do you think she took on the responsibility of this child in the first place a single young woman surely it would have been simpler to carry him directly to the nearest hospital for foundlings who can say she might have known the father im told that when she wanted to represent herself as a married woman she took the name of a soldier of her acquaintance one dead on the somme easy enough to do if he cant come back and deny he wed her she might have been jealous of him and wanted the child she couldnt have by him changing the subject rutledge said is it possible for me to speak to the accused to what end warily she mightwithout realizing ithave more to tell us no one has brought up the name of eleanor gray in her hearing no oliver drained his glass its a place to start rutledge told him his voice reasonable then finish your pint ill take you there as he followed oliver out to his motorcar rutledge had an odd sense of foreboding it was something he couldnt explain either logically or emotionally just a sense offoreboding for no reason at all he remembered the dream hed had in london and felt cold hamish reacting to the tension in rutledges mind was there a fierce presence that seemed to walk at his shoulder and condemn it wasnt until the door of the cell swung open and the scent of lavender reached him that he turned his mind toward the woman he had come here to see his thoughts in a turmoil he had nearly forgotten about her as an individual its remembering that poor devil in his cell in dorset mowbray hamish offered in explanation but was it the woman in the room had risen from its single chair and turned to face them she was pale circles beneath her eyes her shoulders braced as if anticipating a blow the dress she was wearing a soft gray enhanced the paleness and made her seem almost invisible against the grayer walls even as inspector oliver made the introductions rutledge had lost the thread of everything and hamish in his mind was railing like the banshees of hell a cry of grief and torment and repudiation that rent the soul rutledge had seen her picture many times in france she was the woman corporal hamish macleod had loved and expected to marry the woman whose name hamish had cried in the last instant before the rifles fired and he fell dying in the mud fiona fiona macdonald who now called herself fiona macleod rutledge was unprepared defenseless how could he have known how could he have connected a fiona macleod of duncarrick with the face of a woman hed thought lived far from here it was a common enough name in the highlands how could he have known fiona macdonald who would in truth have been fiona macleod if he hadnt shot the man she loved the woman in the dream hed had in london she was looking at rutledgea sadness in her face hamish had told him so much about this woman during the war it was hard to imagine her now as the girl haying on a hot august day in or walking through a small highland village beside a tall man dressed as a soldier saying goodbye hamish had cried out her name over the roar of the guns as the firing squad shot him down he had wanted to diebut not to lie in france far from the ancient churchyard where his ancestors rested he had not wanted to livebut he had wanted to come back to her rutledges mind was whirling did fiona macdonald sometimes feel hamishs presence just as rutledge had felt ross trevors in the lodge outside edinburgh it was odd how some people left their stamp so vividly on a time or a place and she would know better than most how profoundly hamish had loved the highlands had she wept into her pillow because there was no marker where she could take her grief or had she walked the hills and felt closer to hamish than she could have in any churchyard this brief silent strained confrontation affected rutledges perception of fiona macdonald of the crime shed committedwas alleged to have committed of the debt he owed to hamish macleod for being the instrument of his corporals death it magnified the burden hed carried back from the war in the dark reaches of his mind he turned around and walked out of the room without a word and oliver startled was left standing in the doorway staring uncertainly at the woman rutledge had come to see rutledge breathing hard his heart pounding his mind a blank blundered into the corner of a desk and then somehow found his way to the outside door he flung it open and stepped out into the rain oblivious it was some minutes before he realized that oliver stood just behind him sheltered by the doorway saying something to him im sorry he kept his back to oliver afraid of what could be read in his face he added lamely realizing it was expected suddenly i needed air he could feel the rain wetting the shoulders of his overcoat and his hair felt heavy with it matted flat to his skull how long had he been standing therefor gods sake how long he couldnt remember he couldnt think he couldnt clear the horror out of his mind and hamish after that first cry had gone silent a black weight on his spirit like the weight of the dead rutledge forced himself to swallow the sour taste in his throat and after another minute turned to oliver im sorry he said again and then slowly taking a grip on his emotions iit must have been something i ate ive never seen a man turn so white i thought youd seen a ghost no fiona macdonald was no ghost what am i going to do he asked himself silently i must call bowles tell him i want to be relieved but that was addressing his own needs what of hers what in gods name of hers what if he failed her and she hanged hed have no choice but to kill himself he couldnt add that burden to the other guilt he carried it would be a bitter defeat after all hed striven to recover of his own past to fall prey to hamishs it wouldnt be a german pistol it would be his own oliver was asking him something about going back to the hotel a glass of water he couldnt remember no ill be fine then come in out of this rain man im getting wet through standing here the door slammed shut rutledge turned opened it again and walked back into the front room of the police station he said im all right you dont look it here sit down rutledge took the chair shoved his way and tried to sit but his muscles seemed taut and stiff and he had to force them to obey his command oliver thrust a glass of water into his hand rutledge made a pretense of swallowing it afraid hed choke making a worse fool of himself his throat too tight to get it down and slowly his wits seemed to come back to him the room took shape the four walls painted an ugly brown the desks and chairs older than he was the single lamp in the ceiling casting glaring shadows over everything olivers face expectant and watchful waited for him to make a decision rutledge took a breath all right lets return to the cell in the back of his head hamish was a thunderous roar and the ache that was swelling in its wake was nearly blinding youre sure frankly ive no wish to have you casting up accounts all over my floors rutledge came close to laughing a wild reaction to his own tension nausea was the least of his troubles i wont do that he followed oliver down the passage that led to what rutledge saw now must have been a kitchen in its day a large room with no furnishings except for a narrow cot a chair and four bare walls the chimney that once stood against one of them was closed off the iron plate that had lain on the floor before the hearth now turned up and bolted over the opening behind a screen were the chamber pot and a table for water and towels the room was cold and fiona macdonald had pulled a shawl around her shoulders her own face was white as oliver made some apology for their abrupt departure some ten minutes earlier rutledge realized that she must be expecting some news of her trial orof her child the tenseness in her shoulders betrayed her as she waited for rutledge to speak inspector rutledge has come from london to look into the identity of bones discovered up the mountainside in glencoe he has questions he wishes to put to you yes very well she said her voice soft hardly more than a whisper rutledge had no idea what he had expected to learn his mind was a blank wall of nothing he found himself looking away from her not wanting to meet her eyes but he managed to speak to her feeling his way youve been asked before miss macdonaldbut can you give us any information that might help us find the childs real mother or failing that if shes dead her family surely you must be concerned for his wellbeing and hed be far happier with a grandmother or an aunt than in a foster home will he she asked ive killed no one i expect to return to my home and to my child her voice was resolute but there was fear in her eyes if hes not your child rutledge said gently i doubt youll be allowed to keep him even if youre found not guilty a young woman having to make her own way with no husband or family of her own could be considered unfit to make a suitable home then ill marry she said with resignation ill make a home give him a father you have no claim upon the boy the law has its own views on the care of orphans he tried to keep his voice quiet without condemnation fiona bit her lip i dont believe you everything has changed you see when you first came to duncarrick you were thought to be a married woman a widow no one had any reason to question your right to the child now there is every reason no im the only mother hes known changing his approach rutledge asked did you write that letter to mr elliot the anonymous one mailed from glasgow oliver stirred behind him he hadnt thought to ask that but the shock in fiona macdonalds face answered any doubts rutledge might have had no there was passion in her voice not mere certainty why then she added as if to cover it the letter damned me you might have realized that those notes were bearing fruit you might have wanted to protect yourself then surely id have gone about it with more wisdom ii cantthis letter is something i dream about in the night it frightens me i have been shown it and cannot recognize the handwriting i have asked mr elliot if he knew who had sent it and he claims he doesnt but he tells me to throw myself on the mercy of the courts and save my immortal soul ive asked the police if theyve discovered the sender and they tell me they dont need to know who it is but surely the author matters to them as much as it matters to me do you suppose eleanor gray might have written it with the best of intentions unaware of the use to which it might be put the name failed to register why should a stranger defend me i dont know any grays certainly not an eleanor gray ask her not me he hesitated his head was aching so severely he could hardly breathe much less think clearly theres very good reason for us to believe that eleanor gray gave birth to the child you have been raising and called your son there was a flicker of something across her face gone so quickly that rutledge wasnt sure hed seen it humor no it was something else what do you want from me lies i dont know this woman perhaps you didnt know her name was her death an accident or an illnessthe result of childbirth she smiled sadly if this eleanor gray is dead how could she have written to mr elliot or anyone else touche the grays have money they are able to give the boy far more than you ever can it would be possible i think for arrangements to be made to visit him youd not lose touch entirely in a crowded asylum for orphans he wont receive the love and attention he needs surely that weighs with you it weighs with me inspector she said tiredly but not enough to lie to you i dont know eleanor gray i know nothing about when or how she might have died and i cant tell you if she gave birth to a child there is nothing i can do for her family except to tell the truth and i have there was disappointment in her tone is that what you wantedwhat brought you here the need of a comforting story to take to a grieving woman i also grieve and no one will tell me about my son whether hes well or ill whether he remembers me or has been made to forget me her face nearly crumpled but she fought for and won composure he could see the tears in her eyes hes well he answered ignoring the smothered protest behind him she had a right to know she might be a murderess the thought stopped him cold rutledge couldnt remember returning to the hotel and picking up the key to his room the woman at the desk true to her word had chosen well cream walls and white lace curtains were set off by the sea blue of the bedding the patterned carpet and the chintzcovered chairs stiff silk flowers stood in a blueandcream bowl and there was a bluetrimmed cream shade over the single lamp on the corner table he hardly noticed but there was a pair of windows looking down on the square where rainwet pavement glistened and shop lights cast gaily colored splotches across the puddles he lay on his bed staring at the ceiling and trying to remember what he had said to fiona macdonaldand how she had answered him his mind refused to give him what he wanted and in the background hamish was such a force that the voice in his head seemed to scream louder than the sounds of people or vehicles outside or the nearby church clock sounding the hours one by one the next morning when rutledge arrived at the police station constable pringle was there alone a ruddy man with sandy hair and the freckles that matched he stood and formally introduced himself as rutledge gave his name inspector oliver isnt in ive only come for five minutes oliver and i interviewed the prisoner yesterday i have a question or two that arose while i was reading over my notes i shouldnt leave my desk the constable said uncertain no thats all right i can find my own way pringle went to a cupboard and took down a ring of keys this one he handed rutledge the lot singling out a heavy one in the middle thank you with hamish ominously silent like a dark cloud foretelling a storm rutledge walked down the passage to the room where fiona macdonald was kept a plump woman in a blue uniform was scrubbing the last few feet of the passage her face red with effort she moved aside as rutledge passed and went back to her task as he set the key in the lock he found that his hands were shaking opening the door he saw that fiona had risen to meet him the wary expression on her face changing to surprise inspector she said carefully he closed the door to give them some privacy last evening he began and then dropped the pretense that he had been going over his notes he said instead ive come to clarify a point or two do you wish to have your barrister summoned im more afraid of mr armstrong than of you she answered the way he stares at me i feel unclean he despises women i think we are weak vessels in his sight better left uncreated she tried to smile and failed there was a brief silence she studied him and he wondered what she saw in his face but he didnt want to know did you ask for this case the words seemed drawn from her against her will no i was summoned to deal with the missing gray woman until i came through that door he stopped something had altered in her face a tightness as if to protect herself from hurt had she expected when he arrived with oliver the previous night and she recognized his name that he had come to help her that somehow he had learned she was charged with murder and felt a duty to look into the matter a frail strand of hope hamish must have written to her about his commanding officer and what rutledge had done in civilian life and rutledge had written to her too giving her the news of hamishs death offering empty platitudes of sympathy and concern he spoke of you often you were his bulwark and shield throughout the fighting and he would have wanted you to know how bravely he died for his country she had believed the comforting lies she had cherished them he added quickly no one told methe yard you see didnt know who you were my superior was concerned with the gray family would you have comeif youd known he didnt answer that directly he said it wouldnt have been my choiceto come or not it has to do with protocol not personal decisions i still have your letter she told him did he write before the end hamish had written a letter that last night but afterward it had been stained with his blood and with rutledges the army had not seen fit to send it someone had told rutledge as much a month or more later heavy censorship kept the people at home ignorant of the suffering and despair in france the expectation was that loved ones would offer encouragement and hope to the brave men theyd sent off to battle and bolster their courageif they didnt know the truth the men themselves wrote home what they thought their families could bear to hear it was a vicious circle of lies that was classified as military necessity good for morale in that last letter had hamish told the woman he loved so deeply the truth about his death or had he told her sweet lies that would prepare her for the news that would be brought to her a condemned man was not always circumspect he wrote what he felt and believed in in those last dark hours and hamish had been torn aparthe had wanted to die before he was forced to lead more men back into the face of certain death rutledge said our sector was heavily shelled letters and the like are hard to find in the mud afterward he didnt add that buried men disappeared in the stinking black depths as well eaten by rats used as lumber underfoot until someone could retrieve the decaying corpses rains that last autumn had brought to light a private from skye listed as missing for weeks even the dogs hadnt found him as the water sloshed thickly about the trench something had tripped up a sergeant sending him cursing and sprawling as he got dripping to his feet he reached out for what he thought was a piece of shell and realized too late that it was a shoulder blade the rest of the rotting corpse had come up bit by bit like an overdone chicken falling off the bone the smell had been unbearable but they had had to stand there in the snaking line of the trenches for another thirtysix hours before they were relieved rutledge could hardly tell fiona macdonald the truth his letter to her as hamishs commanding officerlike so many othershad been a tissue of lies devised to comfort and to heal and to offer pride of sacrifice in the place of loss a tissue of lies they had come back now to shame him he could feel hamishs anger could feel the torment he carried within himself like a second soul my son is named for you she said into the silence have they told you ian hamish macleod hamish would have liked that he spoke so warmly of youhe admired you rutledge his mind reeling heard hamish cry out the words were lost but he thought for an instant that she had surely heard the voice and recognized it the strength of it was echoing off the walls around them whats wrong she stepped forward reaching out to touch him are you ill again yesterday i thought no it was curt an effort of will without embellishment in the silence he could hear her quick breathing and the chunk of the cleaning womans brush scrubbing outside the door his heart pounded in his ears with fierce determination he got a grip on himself im sorry he said i try not to remember the war and hamish said quite clearly you remember it every hour of every day you always will its the cost of surviving and it was true i came to talk to you about the childs mother rutledge picked up the thread of what hed come to say forcing himself to shut out everything else neither fiona nor he could afford to lose track of the police inquiry again you must surely see that you are condemning yourself by refusing to give the authorities any information about her if shes dead explaining why and how she died can save your life the police said that to me how can they know what if i tell them i choked the life out of her or pushed her out a window or gave her a drink that muddled her wits and left her to die in the cold did you do these things no she cried if i had how could i have loved the child so deeply every time i look into his eyes i see his mothers face how could i hold him and remember her dying by my hand she trusted me with the most precious thing in the world to her you went to war she went on tears filling her eyes and you suffered horribly but do you ever think about what it must be like for us to love a man who will never come back never give us the children we might have borne never hold us in the night never watch our sons and our daughters marry never carry a grandchild in our arms or grow old together do you know what it is like to want someone so terribly that you ache and dream and wake up to find that its over the tears fell and she brushed them away angrily i have given this country my future too and all that was left to me another womans child youve taken as well it seemed to be an admission that the woman was dead but as he looked into the dark eyes and saw the anguish there he read something else toofear not for herself he was sure it wasnt that nor was it guilt he struggled to concentrate called on his intuition to bridge the gap between what he had seenand what it meant silence came back to him nothing but silence and then the woman he realized suddenly must still be alive the childs mother and for some reason even to save her own life fiona macdonald dared not name her locking the cell behind him rutledge strode past the woman collecting her brushes in the emptied pail and went out into the main room where constable pringle sat reading through a stack of reports he looked up as rutledge handed him the key ring all settled then he asked for the time being rutledge answered he thanked the man and went out into the street the day was fine and there were people everywhere attending to whatever business brought them out on a fair morning carts and wagons and lorries vied with motorcars for space on the roadway and he heard a vendor shouting as a passing horse snatched at an apple from the baskets piled high on a trundle rutledge felt alone hamish railed on in wild fury begging cajoling pleading for fiona obsessed with what had been done to her and helpless to change it as the warmth of the sun touched his face rutledge took a deep breath willing the tension to subside willing hamish into silence closing his mind to the harshly sharp image of the woman hed left in the comparative darkness of the small room at the back of the police station walking helped each stride seeming to keep pace with the rhythm of hamishs voice forcing it to remain just out of sight behind him what had appeared to be a search for eleanor gray had become a complex confrontation with the past and a young woman who might be clearedor damnedby what scotland yard found out about both women it was a grave responsibility it was also a professional conflict rutledge turned toward the hotel seeking sanctuary without realizing it seeking the peace and quiet to think everything hed learned here had changed its shape throwing evidence and emotion and belief into a maelstrom of doubt and then something hamish was saying caught at his attention he found himself listening now it began as a moral issue hamish told him thats what you told yon constable and who better to ask than the man who didna ken what to do about it mr elliot the minister rutledge reached the main square and went away from the hotel toward the church rising tall and dark from the pavement bare of ornament it seemed to thrust heavily toward the sky built by men who found in their faith a strong and abiding force but very little beauty there was no churchyard here but he thought it must lie behind the building hed noticed a wedge of green grass surrounded by a low wall of the same stone as the church broaching on the street behind and when he came to the corner of the church he realized he was right headstones marched in tidy rows almost to the apse he paused to read the board by the main doors and at the same time saw the small wooden sign on the victorian house just beyond the church pastor was written there in gothic lettering he walked on and knocked at the house door a woman opened it to him she was young and frail but she answered briskly enough yes sir id like to speak to mr elliot if i may is he in hes just come back from the kirk she replied step in and ill ask if hes receiving visitors just now may i give him your name rutledge thank you sir he could almost hear her mentally adding you must be the policeman from london she disappeared down a dark passage the wood paneling there and where he stood in the highceilinged hall bare of decoration but highly polished it offered a modicum of brightness in the general gloom the only portrait was a formidable man with a graying patriarchal beard wearing the garb of a churchman of two hundred years or more before the eyes were dark and very stern but the mouth was soft almost gentle a face that offered both judgment and compassion from down the passage rutledge heard a light knock and a door opened after a moment the young woman returned come this way sir if you please she led him toward the back of the house where he found himself in a large room so crowded with furnishings and shelves of books that it seemed on the brink of collapsing in upon itself the man at the cluttered desk was of medium height and build but he possessed a hatchet nose and the eyes of a fanatichot with the belief that he had answers to whatever questions confronted his flock he was stonyfaced but the eyes were alive with his righteousness hamish a calvinist to the core muttered hed burn heretics at the stake if he could and there was no praise in the words only warning elliot held out his hand to rutledge but didnt rise rutledge took the dry stiff fingers and shook them briefly what may i do for you inspector ive been sent to scotland to look into this business of the woman who called herself mrs macleod he began easily the childs true mother may have been english i see elliot frowned it could be possible yes miss macdonald i understand attended services in your church have you visited her since her arrest as her pastor only once his eyes moved around the room nor has she asked for my counsel and guidance since surely even she is worth saving rutledge spoke quietly the fierce pale blue eyes came back to rutledges face redemption is not granted it is earned she refuses to confess her sins plural sins they are many arrogance pride wantonness it was noticeable that murder was not listed among them hamish pointed that out growling he had taken an instant dislike to the minister rutledge made an effort to maintain his own objectivity but he found himself thinking that this man had used the anonymous letters to punish the recipient not the sender which seemed an odd choice for a man of god if the child is not hers how can she be accused of wanton behavior i have watched a man sink to his knees and beg gods forgiveness for the desire she had aroused in him and agonize over his souls danger he is a decent man and he cannot bear the guilt surely that is his sin to expiate not hers elliot smiled coldly women have always been temptresses adam ate the apple at eves behest he fell from grace with god and our own savior came to redeem that mortal sin redeem it on the cross with his flesh fiona macdonald is a weak vessel the spirit does not move in her such women are to be pitied from what i hear no one has accused miss macdonald of being a poor mother she loves the child she called her son he found he couldnt speak the boys name all the more reason to keep the lad from her a godfearing family will soon wipe away all memory of her and bring him up as he should be brought up she has no claim upon him after all do you believe shes guilty of the charges brought against her oh yes beyond any question elliot rubbed his chin i have seen the faces of my flock turn against her one by one it is a judgment then she will surely hang elliot looked him up and down very likely why are you convinced of her innocence startled rutledge said am i oh yes elliot said again steepling his fingers i havent been pastor of my flock these thirtytwo years without learning how to read the men and women who come to stand before me you are a guiltridden man haunted by the war and you believe you have seen the face of evil on the battlefield and learned to recognize it have you indeed you watched bodies shatter and minds breaking in france but i have watched souls destroyed rutledge unexpectedly found himself remembering cornwall and olivia marlowe it must be far worse in its fashion he agreed evenly but since i am not god i dont presume to judge my fellow human beings i want to find out the truth about fiona macdonald its my duty as a policeman to her to you to society examine your own motives first inspector and the truth will become clear wishful thinking is not the truth be careful that your own loneliness does not become a trap of error rutledge could hear hamish a rumble of hostility whether against him or against elliot it was hard to say he said in response to hamish i see her as you saw her aloud he said carefully weve wandered from the purpose of this conversation im here to ask if you can give me any information about the accused that will help me find the boys mother the boys mother is dead otherwise she would have come forward to take her child there has been widespread publicity by now she would surely have come what iffor very good reasonsshe cant step forward elliot picked up a book and put it down again signaling that the interview was over then she is an unnatural mother a tigress will defy death for her young no i am satisfied beyond a shadow of a doubt that the poor woman died at fiona macdonalds hands giving her son life may god rest her soul as the young womanthe housekeeper he thought saw him to the door rutledge paused on the threshold and asked do you know fiona macdonald she hesitated casting an eye uneasily over her shoulder and down the passage before saying yes indeed she and miss maccallumher auntwere very good to me when i was ill it wasi nearly died fiona sat beside me and held my hand through the night until i was out of danger the next morning it was on the tip of his tongue to ask what she had been ill of but the pleading look in her eyes stopped him she had taken her courage in both hands to put in a good word for the accuseda kindness for a kindness do you know herumchild oh indeed such a pretty lad and wellmannered i worry whats to become of ian now but no one will tell me hell be well cared for ill see to that the words came out of their own volition he hadnt meant to say them hamish growled something that rutledge didnt catch he let it go id like to think so such a shame that miss maccallum isnt alive shed have set this all to rights she was that sort of person it was miss maccallum who found this position for me mr elliots housekeeper had died of pleurisy rutledge would have liked to ask hamish about ealasaid maccallum but there had been no mention of her the long night that he and the condemned man had spent talking in the guttering light of a candle is mr elliot a good man to work for rutledge asked instead curious the young womans face flushed blotchily he does gods work i try to be as quiet as i can but im sometimes clumsy and in the way which no doubt meant that elliot was a demanding bastard on his own turf and made her life wretched rutledge found hamish agreeing to that hamish apparently had seen very little to approve of in the minister do you live here rutledge asked concerned for her that wouldnt be fitting mr elliot is a widower i have a room at the top of the road there above the milliners shop miss tait offered it to me she pointed with a small thin finger were you surprised when the rumors began about miss macdonald i never was told them she said naively not until much later people dont confide in me not often no this writer of poisonous letters appeared to have chosen each recipient with an eye to inflicting the most damage on fiona macdonalds reputation the thin frightened housekeeper to the minister was not likely to sway the citizens of duncarrick with her views on any subject thank youim afraid i dont know your name he left the sentence unfinished dorothea macintyre sir she told him shyly will that be all sir yes ifermr elliot should ask i wanted to know only if youd received one of the letters im grateful sir she closed the door softly behind him as he stepped out into the street the sacrificial lamb he thought too poor to be anything but dependent on the generosity of others afraid of her shadow and well aware of her duty having had a lifetime of charity to teach it to her rutledge went back the way hed come passed the ballantyne without stopping and searched out the milliners shop hed seen the day before where dorothea macintyre lived a silver bell rang genteelly as he opened the door the woman arranging hats on a stand in the back looked up then walked briskly to meet him may i help you sir she cast a swift glance over her merchandise and then waited with folded hands for him to speak it was a womans shop intimate and yet vividly decorated with almost parisian flair oddly out of tune with duncarrick orange and peach and shades of lavender with a strong pink thread drawing it all together hamish said id no like to hear what mr elliot thinks o the colors he himself seemed to be of two minds about them the shop carried lace collars gloves in kid or cotton stockings some twenty or so hats in every style from drab to elegant handkerchiefs with dainty edging shirtwaists and what rutledge took to be undergarments discreetly folded into brightly painted boxes set along one wall the woman herself tall and boldly attractive seemed the antithesis of dorothea macintyre rutledge wondered if ealasaid maccallum might have found a haven here for the girl someone who would play dragon at the gate inspector rutledge he said scotland yard i wont keep you im searching for the mother of the child fiona macdonald callshe hesitatedian macleod im asking young women who might have known her if she had at any time confided in them are you indeed her eyes were angry suddenly well if fiona had seen fit to confide in me why should i rush to tell you whatever might have been said between us its ridiculous to expect anything of the kind youre a policeman you should be able to do your duty without my help hamish said aye but then she doesnt know you does she or how well or ill you do your duty im not rutledge said gently looking for evidence to convict her only for evidence of the childs parentage so that he can be returned to his mothers family or failing that to his fathers she turned away i have better things to do with my time than provide you with local gossip i dont particularly like fiona macdonald anyone will tell you that on the other hand i think shes been wretchedly treated and im not going to be one of those throwing stones why didnt you like her i thought we might become allies we were alike in one thing at least we didnt squeeze dutifully into the rigid mold of duncarrick silly notion as it turned out she kept to herself i suppose thats understandable in light of whats happened since but at the time i feltbetrayed as if shed turned her back on me preferring instead to ingratiate herself with her aunts friends apparently she didnt succeed very well did she in the end they turned their backs on her did you receive one of those anonymous letters her laughter pealed out harsh and startling in the ambiance of the shop i am more likely to be the subject than the recipient of such things in point of fact ive sometimes wondered why they targeted fiona rather than me there are people in this town who would gladly see the back of me she gestured at the walls and the hangings that shut off the back room of the shop for privacy their flamboyance almost a defiance but im trapped here i inherited the shop and i dont have the money to walk away from duncarrick and start again elsewhere i lived in london for a time worked there before the war and for two years of the fighting learning my craft from a frenchwoman who had come from paris to design hats in london she closed her shop no one had a taste for extravagant hats no one wore them anymore the war changed that women made do with what they had or refurbished them themselves and i came here this place had stood empty for nearly three yearsit had been a haberdashery with an angry shake of the head she added why am i telling you this hamish said its the way you listen im thinking people forget youre a policemani did mysel many and many a time rutledge asked more as a shot in the dark than with the expectation of an answer in london did you by any chance know eleanor gray she shrugged i knew who she was but we moved in different circles i had no interest in becoming a suffragette i didnt find it an attractive prospect to be dragged off to prison and forcefed by beefy matrons with a taste for sadism is she still in london or has she gone elsewhere the honorable miss gray was as unlikely to confide in me as fiona macdonald is why is she a friend of yours is that why youre looking for her she studied him with interest deciding that he was a very attractive man despite the thinness and the haunted eyes men did seem to interest her more than women did it was odd she could collect them by the droves if she was in the mood to talk women bored her eleanor gray was one of those people others gossiped about what she did what she wore where she went i doubt if a quarter of it was true but it was fun to pass along but you havent answered my question rutledge smiled no ive never met her did you ever hear gossip that she was preparing to become a doctor no but i wouldnt have been surprised if i had she was a very handsome woman she had more money than she knew what to do with and her bloodlines went back to william the conqueroror alfred the great for all i know and yetthere was something that burned in her a passion i was never told what it was but she seemed to waste a good deal of energy on makeshift enthusiasms like suffragism and then the war itself she was always manning one of the canteens for soldiers always visiting the hospitals writing letters for the wounded always pushing for better care better conditions ive heard she was a superb horsewoman too and was rabid about the treatment horses received at the front you know a great deal about a woman youve never met she shrugged again i was envious if you want the absolute truth and so i listened when people talked about her if id had her money and her breeding id have married well and never set foot in this shop now i have a hat that must be finished by this afternoon is there anything else you want to know i understand that dorothea macintyre lives above your shop she does and youll leave her alone do you hear me she goes in lively terror of half the town as it is and it wont help to have the police harassing her she thinks fiona and her aunt ealasaid walk on water well thats as may be in my humble opinion ealasaid should have been taken out and shot for putting that girl into mr elliots vicious clutches in what sense vicious dorothea is a silly goose who never did any harm to anyone and all he can think of is whether she has unconfessed sin on her soul on the subject of sin hes worse than the inquisition that man and shes driven to despair thinking that nothing she does is worthy of him thats why i offered her a room herei thought it would be the ultimate cruelty for her to live under elliots roof it has been an inconvenience and a hardship but i take great satisfaction from the fact that when shes here she isnt scrubbing and hauling coal and cooking and washing up and fetching the laundry back from mrs turnbulls not to speak of the other heavy tasks he puts on her all because hes too miserly to hire another girl he took her in you see when she had no work and he never lets her forget the duty owed him for that kindness her eyes blazed he was on the point of asking if fiona macdonalds child could have been dorothea macintyres and then stopped himself mr elliots housekeeper was no guardian of secrets her own or anyone elses the bedrock of police work was the statement a record of every witness questioned scrupulously preserved in evidence rutledge walked back to the station and asked constable pringle if he might read statements taken down when inspector oliver interviewed everyone who had received one of the letters denouncing fiona macdonald pringle handed him a thick file box and said tentatively theyre in proper form sir im sure they are he smiled took the box and moved one of the chairs nearer the door giving himself a semblance of private space sitting down he untied the red string pringle went back to his own work glancing up from time to time as if hamish growled rutledge were not to be trusted ignoring that rutledge lifted out the papers inside and began going through them mrs turnbull laundress im a respectable woman i dont have anything to do with the likes of her question have you ever done her washing no i have not and i thank god for it question why then would someone send you such a letter because they know im a good christian thats why and id lose custom if it got around that i was taking in washing from whores hamish incensed swore mrs oliphant neighbor it was a warning to mind where my husband was of an evening but i didnt need it did i hadnt i seen her slipping out of the inn late at night while her aunt was still alive question did you speak of this to miss maccallum i did not she was ill dependent on fiona it seemed a cruelty question do you know where miss macdonald went when she left the inn so late im a decent woman i dont go prowling about in the dark question how often did she do this i saw her with my own eyes four or maybe even five times question what direction did she take it was always the same away from the town question how can you be so sure it was a lover miss macdonald went to meet because i went out to that pele tower the very morning i found the letter on my doorstep to see for myself if it was true i found a bed of straw where a part of the roof had tumbled down and left a dry corner behind a heap of stone and it smelled of lavenderthats her scent question but you wouldnt have thought to go to the tower if the letter hadnt suggested it oh id wondered right enough where else might a whore have some privacy hamish said bitterly can ye no see that its what they want to believe or someone had been a step ahead of mrs oliphant and set the scene she was expecting to find mrs braddock neighbor ive seen how my husband looks at her hes often offering to do work at the inn but he isnt eager to keep up his own house is he ive been after him to paint the kitchen for six months question so you believed the letter you found when it said my daughter was playing with a bastard and learning nasty things at the inn yes i did i had sometimes watched ian while miss macdonald was out and shed returned the favor hed been no trouble at my house but how was i to know what went on in hers the silence from hamish was thundering mr harris shoemaker shed come in for her shoes and was polite as you please i never guessed until the letter came id known ealasaid maccallum for fifty yearsshe was a good woman a good christian she wouldnt have allowed such things to go on its a disgrace thats what it is question had you visited the inn before the letter came aye that i had it was a respectable place for a pint of an evening there was always good company and a man could sit and talk with his friends the ballantyne now its all well and good but crowded you can hardly hear a word said to you question and while you were sitting in the reivers there was no indicationas far as you knewthat miss macdonald might be using the upstairs rooms for indecent purposes i should have guessed when fiona took over tending bar herself none of the maccallums ever had i said to mrs harris its not right mark my words no good will come of it ealasaid would never have agreed to it fiona blamed it on the war and necessity help being so hard to find but it still wasnt proper question did miss macdonald ever offer you an opportunity to visit upstairs im a married man aye hamish commented through clenched teeth and sorry for it the writer of these letters rutledge thought thumbing through a dozen more statements had been very clever indeed possibly too clever sheor hehad known duncarrick well to choose the letters recipients with such unerring accuracy the seemingly untutored handwriting and the cheap stationery were no more than carefully thoughtout trappings this could not be in his opinion the work of a jealous wife or a jilted lover driven to striking out the widow whose husband had died in the war i thought she might be more sympathetic to my suffering having lost her own husband but she wouldnt talk about corporal macleod now i doubt he ever existed the elderly woman who cleaned the church i went to mr elliot i was that upset that she should be sitting among us a twofaced harlot and mr elliot said hed prayed over her from the startshe hadnt worshiped with what he believed to be sincerity is it likely yon mr elliot has written these abominations hamish demanded he claims he sees the weaknesses of people it was something rutledge had been considering to teach fiona a lesson if so it had gotten out of hand another woman with small children young ian had lovely manners i never guessed that he was what he was but blood tells doesnt it in the end blood tells im so grateful that dear ealasaid never lived to see this day it would have been horrid she was so happy when fiona came a woman who had been close to ealasaid maccallum i cant sleep at night thinking how this would have hurt dear ealasaid ive known her since she was a girl and it would have broken her heart to find out how shed beenused in this fashion it wont surprise me at all if fiona is a murderess look how she treated her own flesh and bloodshe knows no shame hamish railed the shames hers its human nature were dealing with here rutledge answered dont you see the first stone has already been cast when the police interview the next person he or she wants to be counted among the righteous it doesnt prove anything except that people as a rule are easily led rutledge put the statements back in their original order and set them in the box it had been unpleasant reading someoneconstable mckinstry he thoughthad likened fiona macdonalds situation to the hysteria of witch hunts in the s and so it was fionas sinif there was a sin had been to keep to herself many people had held that against her and at the first test showed neither generosity nor trust in choosing so carefully the writer of the letters had been successful in destroying fiona macdonalds good name but were there other people reluctant to step forward in the face of overwhelming public opinion who privately might help rutledge went back to the square and at random stopped several women doing their days marketing the first one was redfaced with graying hair straggling out of the tight bun at the nape of her neck introducing himself he explained that he was searching for anyone who could give him information about fiona macdonalds history before coming to duncarrick the redfaced woman assured him that she had no knowledge of that person he thanked her and moved on his next choice was a middleaged woman in a neat blue coat and a hat with a modicum of style a schoolmistress he thought walking the narrow line of decorum required by her position she was flustered by his question and he wondered if she had known fiona better than she wished people to remember nono i really didnt know her well a passingacquaintance i accepted her for her aunts sake of course believing that ealasaids family must be above reproach it was a terrible shock when i heardmy first thought was oh im glad her aunt isnt alive to see her taken up by the police you knew nothing about where miss macdonald lived before coming here her aunt never spoke of her niece in your hearing wellthat is i believeermiss macdonald lived with her grandfather until his death ealasaid must have said something about that ii seem to remember that she ealasaid of coursethought very well of him a good manwellrespected in the highlands which made it all the more shocking that his granddaughter shouldwell disappoint the family so horribly she had managed to appear totally ignorant of any factsaware only of hearsay and halfremembered gossip her pale brows and lashes fluttered as she asked plaintively is there anything else inspector he shook his head and thanked her hamish was pointing out that one hasna the courage to stand alone shes too afraid of people turning their faces fra her a harried young woman with boisterous twins dragging at her heels blushed when he stopped her and turned her face away to speak to the boys they were just old enough three fourto have been playmates for fionas son i saw her sometimes on the street and for her aunts sake tried to be nice but she wasnt a woman i was likely to be friends with did your children ever play together oh wellsometimes when i called on miss maccallum that is it was not a usual thing you understand but young childrenthey dont play very much at this age do they they it was more a matter of sitting and staring at each other across the room andumsometimes passing a toy back and forth did you feel that the macdonald child was not a proper companion for your children after all his mother worked at the reivers it was a very respectable inn miss maccallum would never have allowed any impropriety there noits just that we live on opposite ends of the town it was not convenient she let the words trail off rutledge asked again do you know where miss macdonald resided before she came to stay with her aunt the woman scowled and disentangled one boys chubby hand from the edge of her coat no donald you mustnt pull at me well be walking on presently she turned back to rutledge i remember she said something about a family shed lived with how much shed cared for the children can you tell me who her friends were in duncarrick noof course i wasnt close to hershei have no idea which was another way of washing her hands entirely of the matter hamish said shes repeating what her husband has told her to say rutledge tended to agree with his assessment there was neither warmth nor anger in her responses only a determined effort to keep clear of the tangle of fiona macdonalds affairs he let her go and crossed the street outside the milliners shop he met a tall thin woman coming from the other direction she had an air of fragility as if she was recovering from an illness but she moved with grace when he removed his hat and spoke to her she stopped with courtesy and waited for him to ask his question im sorry she answered in a pleasant voice ive been unwell and find it difficult to go into society as i used to i dont believe i have met miss macdonald i can tell you miss maccallum was both respected and admired she was very active in charity work and had a reputation for honesty in all her dealings and as far as i knew miss macdonald was a very fine young woman the charge of murder against her is beyond belief hamish said aye its guid to hear the truth this womans appearance and manner indicated that she might have been educated at one of the better schools or perhaps lived for a time in england rutledge asked did youdo you know anyone by the name of eleanor gray she frowned considering his question eleanor gray no i cant say that i ever met anyone by that name i did know a sally gray where did you meet her in carlisle at a party given for my husband but that was before the war i havent seen her in years her husband was something in shipping i think a dead end he thanked her and walked on immersed in his own thoughts realizing that hed arrived at the stone monument at the top of the square rutledge stopped there for a time listening to hamish comparing this town with the scattered houses that comprised his own small village like most highlanders hamish had been used to the silences of the mountain glens and the long smooth mirrors of the lochs these had given him as a soldier a resilience and a strength of mind that had raised him from the ranks idly watching the medley of activity that gave life and color to the street rutledge considered the townspeople of duncarrick if anyone here had had close ties with fiona macdonald they were busy now burying them as deep as possible it also seemed unlikely that fiona had confided in her aunt but then it was two secrets that fiona held close that the boy was not hersand that she knew the identity of the childs mother for some reason the latter must have been the darker of the two fiona had taken the very grave risk of going to trial for murder to protect it and if the mother was still alive as mr elliot had so cleverly pointed out she hadnt stepped forward why not and where was she hamish sighed anywhere in england or scotland for starters rutledge turned toward the monument one hand reaching up to touch the surface this face was cold at this time of day waiting for the sun to reach it like the town itself in some ways waiting for enlightenment the stone was a roughhewn monolith set in the pavement links of heavy iron chain attached to four short iron posts encircled the stone marking it as a shrine of sorts on the side of the monolith that looked down the length of the square was a relief carved coarsely but tellingly into the stone houses buried nearly to their rooftops in flames jutted from the surface and around the scene reivers sat on their horses dressed in trews and leather jerkins hats jammed on their heads as they watched the town burn at the feet of the horses lay sacks of plunder and sheep milling about in fright beneath the relief three dates were incised in the stonethe three times duncarrick had gone up in flames at the hands of english raiders it was a powerful memorial and rutledge made a rough guess at the number of dead or had the inhabitants been warned in time and found sanctuary somewhere in the fields or behind the stout walls of the pele tower watching the night sky as their homes and possessions went up in black smoke filling the cold air with choking ashes small wonder the people here were a different breed from the citizens of southern english towns that had settled into quiet prosperity centuries beforewhere the tread of armies and the threat of fire and sword were a far distant memory small wonder that a stranger was welcomed for her aunts sakeand not her own small wonder that suspicion was so easily aroused and trust was snatched back so readily someone had known how to use duncarricks entrenched character to reach out and anonymously destroy fiona macdonald but to what end for what purpose hamish said when i went to france she was living with her grandfather but when he died she left the land and went to braeher last letter was fra brae it was where rutledge had sent the only letter he had written to fiona macdonald to tell her of hamishs death he said then ill have to go to brae he had come here to search for eleanor gray if oliver was right she must be somewhere in fiona macdonalds past he had to find out where their paths had crossedand if they had crossed and why something that had not even happened in duncarrickthe birth of a childshould cast such a long and deadly shadow over the lives of two women who should have had nothing in common oliver wasnt going to like scotland yard meddling as if conjured up by his thoughts down the square rutledge saw oliver coming toward him in the company of a man in a wellcut gray suit a second glance identified olivers companion as the sheep farmer rutledge had met that first day close by the pele tower they were speaking earnestly and then oliver looked up lifted a hand to hail rutledge he excused himself and leaving the farmer strode toward rutledge you look like a man in need of his lunch oliver said i feel like a man in need of a drink but what i need now is to learn more about fiona macdonalds whereabouts before her arrival in duncarrick oliver studied him i should think the logical place to begin would be with eleanor grays movements after the quarrel with her mother in logical yes rutledge replied patiently but thats a wider investigation and will take far more manpower why not narrow it by starting at this end yes i see well the best person to tell you what you need to know is constable mckinstry but ive already been to the town of brae and ive been to glencoe there cant be much left to find in either place you didnt know to ask for eleanor gray no thats true but i did ask about any other place the accused might have visited about the time the boy was born for i can tell you this mucha woman with the gray name and money would never have chosen backwaters like brae or glencoe to live in the two must have met in glasgow or edinburgh and theres your needle in the haystack again rutledge said thoughtfully if you were the daughter of lady maude gray and expecting a child out of wedlock a backwater might offer obscurity as well as seclusion the larger the town the greater the risk of being recognized oliver took a deep breath you may be right of course its possible but not likely still talk to constable mckinstry tell him to let you read my notes then echoing a remark rutledge had already heard that day he added too bad in my view that her aunt is dead or convenientwhos to say he walked on constable mckinstry was on duty at the station his chair back on two legs and a book in his hands it was on scottish law mckinstry closing the book and lowering the feet of the chair to the floor looked wretchedly at rutledge as he listened to his request fiona never confided in me ill tell you what i can sir and what inspector oliver wrote in his report he put the book on a shelf behind him and added did he send you aye i thought so wryly he confessed its my punishment to be made to talk about her the inspector hasnt forgiven me for the fiasco with the first skeleton if id been thorough it would have been my embarrassment not his i need dependable facts youre most likely the only inhabitant of duncarrick who isnt afraid to admit you knew her man or woman thats true enough mckinstry sighed considering how to begin he looked at the ceiling smudged with smoke from the stove and arranged his thoughts i was in france when fiona arrived in duncarrick i remember my mother writing that ealasaid maccallum was having trouble with her right arm shaking and had sent for her niece to come and help out at the inn later she told me that in her view mrs macleod was a respectable young widow with a baby to care for but strong and capable for all that shed lived in brae and if i should hear any news of men from there my mother would be glad to pass it on he stopped squaring the blotter and moving the ink pot to the other side of the desk then absently he moved it back again to be honest i never asked fiona about her life before she came to duncarrick i was jealous if you want the truth of her husband only he wasnt was he he sighed fiona left her grandfathers croft in the spring of i do know that she couldnt run the farm on her own its inhospitable country at best but the old man had made it pay aye hamish said unexpectedly he knew the land better than anyone i ever saw there was a wistfulness in the voice at rutledges shoulder fra him i learned how to handle a team and to find water when we needed to dig a well i took a forked willow stick skinned and dried he said i had the gifti could feel the stick stir and bend in my hands and it was sweet water i found mckinstry had gone on unaware of the interruption some cousins were willing to take it overthey were too old for the war but still ablebodied she said once that she wished the lads father could have been buried there in the glen because he loved it so at any rate fiona was glad of the position she found in brae it took her mind off the war a mrs davison was looking to hire a nanny for her children he paused braes south of glasgow just above lanark yes i have a general idea where it is go on when her aunt wrote asking fiona to come to duncarrick she was sad to leave brae but she promised to come as soon as mrs davison found a replacement for her she and the boy miss maccallum said nothing to your mother about the boyshistory her only worry was that ian was so young and might distract fiona from her duties at the reivers i thought it was a selfish view but then no one knew just how ill miss maccallum was rutledge made a note of mrs davisons name and asked what did the people in brae tell inspector oliver not much that fiona minded her own business was friendly enough and worked hard no one was aware that she was expecting a child when she left there and weve traced all the children born to residents in a woman named singleton had a child in glasgow that spring but its accounted for and the three born in brae are accounted for as well i never knew fiona to mention any particular friend therethough she spoke often of mrs davison and her children im considering driving on to brae to see if theres any connection to eleanor gray to be found there begging your pardon sir its a waste of time ive seen brae a woman like eleanor gray would stand out like a sore thumb its not the kind of place shed be hiding herself away in still we must begin somewhere rutledge answered all right is there any other name you can give me mckinstry took out a folder and opened it when rutledge had finished taking down two or three other names he closed his notebook and said id like to speak to the accused again before i leave i dont know mckinstry began doubtfully it will take less than five minutes and mckinstry capitulating took out the keys and handed them to rutledge he unlocked the door for a second time and walked into the cell fiona macdonald was sitting in the chair her hands folded in her lap but her eyes flew to his as he entered im driving to brae today he said watching her face there was a very slight tightening of the skin as if she was not happy with the news you will be seeing mrs davison please tell her she stopped and shook her head no i dont suppose shed want a message from me now her fingers folded and smoothed a pleat in her skirt i forget sometimes that a murderess has no past but if the children should ask about meplease will you tell them that im well and think of them often i will she managed a smile theyre too young to know about murder theyll be glad to be remembered and i do think about them it takes my mind off otherother things he said without stopping to think i wish you could trust me and tell me the truth it isnt a matter of trust she answered quietly its a question of love love yes she looked away i cant explain it except to say that there are many faces of love and sometimes they can be cruel my mother loved my father so deeply that she grieved herself to death for him and left me with only a grandfather and an aunt to care for me i was the child of that love but it didnt matter enough to her to want to live i never understood that i still dont i didnt want to die when hamish did i wonder sometimes if that meant i didnt love him enough her eyes searched rutledges face begging for reassurance it isnt a question of loving him enough the man i knew in france wanted with all his heart to come home to you he caught himself in time before hed destroyed the comforting lie of a heros death for king and country clearing his throat he said instead and hed have wanted you to live above all hed have wanted that for once he knew beyond question that he spoke for hamish and if you lost your own mother when you were very young you must see that its wrong to leave the boy unprotected as you have youve told me yourself that id not be allowed to keep him it was true but he said you were wrong to allow yourself to be taken up on a charge of murderwrong to allow the evidence to go on pointing to your guilt wrong to accept the fact that you will surely hang there may come a time when the boy will need you and you wont be there hamish cried out that it was wrong to use her own words to force her to surrender whatever truth she had hidden so long so well she seemed fragile and alone in this ugly cell but rutledge did not make the mistake of underestimating her strength she squared her shoulders with a courage he deeply admired and replied it must be a painful way to die ive made myself try to imagine what its like harshly caught up in his need to bring her to her senses while there was still time while they were alone in this cell and there was no one to stop him ignoring his own conscience hammering at him over the anguish of the voice at his shoulder he said ive watched men hang what happens to the body as you die is not something a woman would wish for herself she had flinched as he spoke and he instantly regretted the words cursing himself wanting to recall them but they seemed suspended like a wall of coldness in the air between them he took a single step forward then stopped short forbidden by who he wasand who she wasfrom offering any measure of comfort im sorry she said only i wont be alive to know will i but as he left the room he could see the tears filling her eyes charles todd legacy of the dead dodging a lorry then a dog sniffing the pavement with intent interest rutledge walked back to the hotel he encountered oliver just coming out the door found mckinstry did you yes thanks he was on the point of walking on and realized all at once that oliver had something he wanted to say rutledge stopped and waited oliver looked over rutledges shoulder at the square beyond as if surveying his domain ive thought a good deal about our eleanor gray and what might have brought her to scotland the father of the child might have been a scot women can be sentimental about such things as their time draws near and she might have decided the child ought to be born here or perhaps it was the fathers last wish in his last letter whos to say but theres our reason for coming north lady maudes daughter or not shes still a woman and apt to go mawkish do you agree with me so far rutledge thought of eleanor gray the suffragette chaining herself to fences and letting herself be dragged off to prison mawkish wasnt a word hed have chosen to describe her still oliver had a point to make rutledge nodded next question then what happened between crossing the border and meeting fiona macdonald as she must have called herself then did our miss gray for sake of argument leave too late and never make it to her original destination women have been known to be wrong about their time that was true but eleanor gray had wanted to be a doctor would she have got it wrong yes i can see the possibilities that she felt ill and stopped for help or that something else had gone wrong with her plans he looked down at oliver glencoe isnt necessarily where she died if she is dead oh shes dead right enough and those are her bones out there in the glen who would know better where to hide a victim than someone whod grown up in the district if i had a corpse on my hands id take it to such a godforsaken place no one was likely to stumble over it until it was clean bones and thats just what the macdonald woman did the local police didnt have any luck at all identifying the remains last year when they were discovered if we hadnt come along shed be without a name still hamish angry described olivers ancestry and future destination in some detail highlanders were as a general rule creative in their cursing a dangerous choice wouldnt you say rutledge found himself defending fiona macdonald id have taken the body miles from where i lived how far could the accused go burdened with a newborn child and a dead woman oliver said thoughtfully or turn it upside downshe might have felt a little safer with each passing year when the body didnt come to light and there was no hue and cry for a missing child knowing it was there if she ever had to devise an account of finding the mother dead but herself safely out of the picture here in duncarrick otherwise words that would come back to him laterbut rutledge said now no i dont see that why didnt she tell you those clever lies when you first became suspicious of her because she misjudged me she thought wed be satisfied tearing the inn apart and coming away emptyhanded oliver smiled she failed to see didnt she that making a fool of me was a blunder id stake my hope of promotion on that and now all thats left is to put a name to that corpse which is why you are here it was a friendly warning not to cross the lines into olivers own patch the smile faded if i were a vengeful man now id look forward to presenting the haughty lady maude with proof that her daughter is not only dead but bore a child out of wedlock to some unknown soldier first time thats happened in her family tree ive no doubt rutledge ate a hurried lunch then informed the woman at the hotel desk that he might be away for several nights but wished to keep his room morag had seen to his laundry for him but he had written a brief note to frances in london asking her to send a larger case north he handed that to the clerk to be mailed it appeared that he was going to be in scotland for some time like it or not but he was damned if hed go any farther north than the borders heading west from duncarrick and then bearing north rutledge made first for lanark there was no direct road to brae it was only a small village on the way to somewhere else the browns and golds of september already colored the landscape the open land with few of the hedgerows that the english used to set off fields had been made suitable for sheep rather than agriculture the cramped and compact towns so different from the picturesque villages farther south seemed to be locked into a harder past the people here independent and far less classconscious shared a different history from the english and it had marked them set me down on either side of the border he told himself and i would know instantly on what ground i stood english or scottish as rutledge settled into the long drive hamish turned from his annoyance at inspector olivers obtuseness to his memories of fiona macdonald before the war rutledge tried not to heed them but the words kept pushing aside his own thoughts they had known each other from childhood fiona and hamish she had been lively and intelligent even then accustomed to games with her brothers and their friends running barefoot in the summers her long dark hair and her skirts tangled with briars and straw her grandfathers favorite she had learned to read at an early age and to form her own opinions freely as she grew into a woman of humor and warmth in the summer of hamish macleod had asked her to marry him only hed marched off to war within a matter of weeks and in died in france far away from fiona and the highlands from everything he held dear small wonder shed been tempted to take a motherless child and love him as her own to bring him up as she and hamish might have brought up their brood a legacy of the dead a child with his name if not his blood in the trenches where men talked of home and a lost safer world hamish had drawn a picture of a caring woman of laughter and trust and abiding affection that a soldier had carried with him to war but rutledge had seen something else in herthrough his eyes not hamishs he had seen strength in her and the ability to look directly at the world he had seen courageand fear he had seen a fierce longing for something to come out of the ashes of her heart and now even that had been taken away she was everything he realized suddenly that jeanwhom hed wanted to marry who hed believed cared for himhad never been and for the first time since jean had broken off their engagement he was entirely free of her spell as if scales had fallen from his eyes he saw clearly how very different jeans conception of marriage had been from his she had wanted a future that was protected and secure accepted by society applauded by her friends a man in turmoil his mind shattered his future uncertain was a terrifying prospect fiona macdonald knew what love meant and what it cost and what the war had taken from her she would have loved hamish if hed come home scarred with burns without his legs or his arms she would have loved the man hed become as well as the man he was she would even have loved him shellshocked and consumed by nightmares rutledge refused to follow that line of thought but his mind brought back other images the women like jean who came to the clinics and stared with horror at the ruins of husband or loverhe had once encountered one of them running out the door face buried in her handkerchief moaning in shock and in the room behind her a man with bandages where his face had been lay mute with clenched fists unable to cry there had been others who had accepted the living shell gratefully with an intense sense of wonder that they had been among the lucky ones to have their soldier home again fiona would have been among those that was the kind of courage she possessed was she also a murderess rutledge felt the betrayal even as his mind framed the question a betrayal of hamish and of fiona macdonald he shut the war out of his mind and tried to concentrate instead on what lay ahead fiona had left her grandfathers home and moved south to brae but why brae because it was different from the glen hamish answered unexpectedly it held no memories of her grandfather of me of her brothers who had died rutledge recalled the statement mckinstry had read to him when shed been asked if fiona could have been pregnant when she left brae mrs davison had answered unequivocally no i would have known shed said i kept a strict eye on fionanot because she was likely to find herself in trouble but because she was a young girl alone and in my care come to that it wasnt hard to doshe seldom took her day off and even in the evenings when the children were in bed shed sit with me and do the mending or read aloud olivers comment on mrs davisons character was id take my oath that shes telling the truth forthright to a fault as my sergeant put it mrs davison might well have told the exact truth people often did the whole truth was another matter and how an investigating officer probed for it determined how much of it came out objectivity oliver was convinced that fiona macdonald was a murderess if she wasnt how did she come by the child that was the stumbling block and her life depended on the answer and rutledge was going to have to find it brae was south and east of glasgow on the outskirts of an area that had suffered from fast expansion and then depression in the previous century the basin of the clyde had become a forest of steelworks factories and mines but it had never been a scenic wonderland all the same what little beauty there was had been swallowed up long since lanark on the other hand was a pleasant town with associations with the scottish hero william wallace and it was there that rutledge ate a late dinner before continuing to brae but there was no place in brae to spend the night and he was forced to return to lanark it was early in the morning when he came back and even hamish could find nothing attractive in the plain houses the dull landscape or the feeling that time had dealt harshly with the little village even its few streets seemed tired mrs davison lived in a brick house that had been well kept one large enough to have been a managers home when industry had mushroomed in the region the windows were clean with pretty curtains behind them there were flowers still in bloom in the sheltered garden to one side and behind the house vegetables had been grown in long rows that were now brown and untidy except for the dark green of beets and cabbages at the far end the house stood at the edge of the village set back from the street behind a low brick wall a ball a doll with a china face and no clothes on its white kid body and a small bucket full of stones littered the walk in front of the door she answered his knock herself a woman with a kind face but very perceptive hazel eyes she looked him up and down as he introduced himself and then said yes im penelope davison ive talked to the policemen in duncarrick why should london have any interest in going over the same ground i know nothing about fiona that can help you in any way in her own fashion she reminded him of lady maude the same independent spirit and refusal to be overawed by the law all the same there are some questions i must ask she sighed and opened the door wider inviting him in to the parlor on the left side of the entry it was small with dark furniture a goodly number of greenleafed plants and very little frivolity there was a charcoal portrait of a man with fine mustaches and an air of importance framed in oak and gilt a small reproduction from a newspaper of queen victorias jubilee procession framed in dark wood and a bookcase with glass doors holding rows of calfbound volumes scuffed from much use just under the window the books had been tidily sorted by height not content but there was an air of calm and comfort in the room that impressed rutledge as he took the chair she indicated from the back of the house he could hear the high voices of children and realized suddenly that it was a saturday and they were not in school hamish said you must speak to themyou gave fiona your promise mrs davison was saying well then youve come all this way what is it you would like to know when fiona macdonald first came to live with you did she have references a letter of introduction she answered an advertisement id placed in the glasgow paper in her letter impressed me and i asked her to come for an interview i liked her immediately but im not a foolish woman and i made inquiries before taking her on her grandfather was a respected man and there were a number of people around glencoe who spoke well of her she came to me and i never had a moments regret over hiring her i cant bring myself to believe that she has killed anyone but that police inspector claims she has there is evidence pointing in that direction yes it isnt necessarily proven thats why im here did she have any friends in brae young women she might have grown to know well no she was grieving most of the time you see and she went out very little her brothers died one after the other and then in her young man there was another woman here who used to walk with her when the weather was fine but i wouldnt have described mrs cook as a friend they were morei dont knowfellow sufferers the newspapers pretended the war was going well but too many people were dying its a terrible weight when you worry day and night about someone and when the news came and fiona knew the worst it was hard for her to speak of it she didnt tell me for weeks i think most of us pressed her to cry but she wouldnt mrs cook didnt press she seemed to understand what it was like tell me about mrs cook if you will she was illher lungs as i understood it her doctor had hoped that better air would help the smoke of glasgow most certainly had not at any rate early in she took rooms in that white house you must have passed coming into brae on your left mrs kerrs sons were off to france and her husband was away building ships she didnt want to live alone and advertised for lodgers it seemed to suit both of themmrs cook was quiet and no trouble mrs kerr preferred it that way do you know anything about mrs cooks background where shed come from before glasgow i have no idea her husband was at sea and fionas young man was in france they seemed to have very little in common other than that i thought perhaps mrs cook had come from a wealthy home and had been given advantages that fiona hadnt which is not to say that fiona was common she was a most unusual girl and i found her a very pleasant companion her grandfather had reared her extraordinarily well how long was mrs cook here seven months id say then her husband was invalided home and she went to london to be with him fiona had been living here for some time before mrs cook came of course over a year and if youre asking me if they might have known each other before moving to brae i seriously doubt it fiona left only after shed had word that her aunt was taken ill and couldnt manage the inn on her own any longer she cried when she left and my children cried with her i was not above crying myself thats why i didnt ask her to work out her time not to work out her time but fiona had told her aunt that she must how long after mrs cooks departure was that three or four months id say hamish pointed out that if mrs cook had been expecting a child when she came to brae then she had had it alone and without fionas help seven months and four months added up to eleven nevertheless rutledge made a note of it he said did mrs cook leave a forwarding address do you know if she did fiona never said anything about it mary kerr found a pair of gloves in the bedroom after her lodger had gonetheyd fallen under the bed mary wanted to send them along to her but didnt have her direction forgive me but why do you think a woman of mrs cooks apparent position should wish to spend over half a year in brae mrs davison smoothed the white tatted cover on the arm of her chair i wondered about that myself brae left her to herself and i think thats what she needed most i wondered once or twice if she might be a married woman whod had an affair and the man died time to heal you see away from everyone who didnt know and couldnt understand she shrugged perhaps thats an overly romantic view of her there could be any number of other reasons fiona gave no sign of missing her other than the occasional remark that anyone might make when the cat had kittens she said something like mrs cook told me once that shed never had a cat or a dog of her own its too bad she couldnt have one of these hamish said i canna see a child romping with a dog in lady maudes house it was true rutledge said do you recall her first name her husbands name i dont think i ever heard her speak of him by name it was usually my husband but her name was maude i thought it was rather pretty a coincidence it was a common english name did you say anything to inspector oliver about mrs cook i saw no reason to i told you it wasnt actually a friendship it was simple loneliness i dont suppose theyd have spoken a dozen words to each other ordinarily but the young women here in brae had gone away to do war work and the ones with children like me spent a rather dreary war fiona and mrs cook the outsiders naturally were drawn together ive been trying to locate an eleanor gray in the hope that she might throw some light on miss macdonalds situation has she visited brae mrs davison shook her head we arent a crossroads here though it may seem as if we are there was never an eleanor gray here id have known if there was with mrs davisons permission rutledge sat at the rough kitchen table with the three children fiona had cared for a girl and two boys the girl was shy but the boys were eager to talk the picture they drew was of a young woman who could sit on the floor and play games with them who read to them in the evening if they went to bed without fuss and who knew the most fearsome tales of highland feuds and battles she spent a night once in a haunted house and there was a man there who carried his head in his hands fiona saw him plain as day the eldest boy told rutledge with great relish he was a campbell killed by a maclaren and seeking revenge he launched into the details of the feud but his mother smiling said yes thats all very well but i dont think mr rutledge has time for the whole story he spent a quarter of an hour with the children and mrs davison but came away with nothing more he needed no further reminder from hamish to pass on fionas message to the children the shy little girl smiled and said fiona in a soft voice is she coming back her mother looked over her head at rutledge and replied not for a while dear mrs kerr over sixty and showing her years told him what she knew of mrs cook but there was nothing new in what she had to say as he got up to leave rutledge asked did mrs cook and miss macdonald seem to be close not close no theyd walk in the evenings sometimes that was all where did they walk most often do you know mrs cook wasnt country bred so they didnt go far about the town mostly or in the churchyard its protected from the wind i suppose thats why i had the feeling that they both felt comfortable among the graves odd thing to say i know but there you are as if they drew strength or peace or the like from the quiet there fiona now i knew shed lost the man she was to marryshe told me once that he was buried in france mrs cooks husband was at sea but she never spoke much about herself at first i put it down to being too good for the likes of us in brae then i saw that she was not one to talk some folks arent are they its what makes the world go round differences rutledge crossed the street from mrs kerrs and walked as far as the small ugly church the early victorian brick and stone mixture had not been successful but it stood apart among great old trees planted generations before for an older church there were paths among the graves white graveled ribbons through the green hummocked grass a number of bare plots spoke of recent burials and he shivered remembering his own dream he went through the gate and spent some time moving through the wilderness of stone reading the inscription on first this one and then another not far from the rear wall one headstone caught his eye it was old the dates smudged and barely discernible but the name carved deeply into the gray face was quite legible hamish macleod not the man hed killedthe dates were much older a century or more older but rutledge found himself wondering as he stood there and looked down at it if fiona macdonald had also known about it and in some way had taken comfort from it a gravestone for a man who had none a place to sit on the weedy grass while she remembered a past that had no future it must have offered consolation as well as privacy to mourn he had the oddest feeling that he was right but what name had mrs cook found here if her husband was still alive what memories had comforted her he walked through the stones again searching there were campbells and lindsays macbrays and macdougals a long list of highland and lowland names that had no special meaning to him he found a trevor and thought of ross then moved on little and elliot davison and robson pringle and taylor henderson and one gray evelyn gray he had died as an infant it was eleanor grays fathers namethe man she had called father all her life had she been closer to him than to her mother in spite of the fact that he wasnt her natural father girls were often attached to their fathers and if evelyn gray had accepted her publicly as his daughter he would have brought her up to the best of his ability even if he had not loved her for her own sake he would have treated her well for king edwards sake the men had been close friends and he might have been the only warmth in eleanors life rutledge could not envision lady maude holding a squirming child in her lap to read it a story as fiona had done with her charges in the davison household but then he might be doing lady maude an injustice he had met her after the quarrel with eleanor her daughters refusal to acknowledge her duty to her blood and heritage had hurt deeply there might have been a very different relationship between mother and child before that otherwise why had lady maude insisted that he rutledge take charge of this question of identifying the bones she might hamish said be wanting to protect her familys honor rutledge drove toward glasgow with his mind busy hamish was making comments on the evidence as well but he tried to ignore them such small thingsthe name on a gravethe christian name of a womanthe fact that fiona had told her aunt she was working out her time at brae where had she gone for that brief unaccountedfor span of weeks and did it have anything to do with maude cook he spent sunday in glasgow asking the police there for any information they might have had on anyone by the name of cook but the halfdozen families he was sent to see were unable to help him they shook their heads when he asked them about a maude cook as one middleaged man put it its a pretty enough name maude but not one of ours nor had relations to their knowledge spent part of the war years in the village of brae its not likely is it a woman asked him so close by besides id have sent any daughter or daughterinlaw of mine to our kin not to live on the charity of strangers but as hamish pointed out if maude cooks connection with glasgow was through her own family rutledge didnt have her maiden name and would never find her in the welter of people in the city it would require a doortodoor search an enormous amount of manpower driving back to duncarrick on monday morning he reached the outskirts of lanark and stopped the car rubbing his face lanark he considered lanark for a time that it was close to brae that it was large enough that a woman using a false name might not be noticed and gossiped about especially if she was already certain there were no acquaintances living there who might see her in the street and recognize her and it would offer adequate medical care to a woman on her own rutledge continued into the heart of the town finding the local police station and then searching for a place to leave his motorcar it was a busy morning the town seemed to be full of people and lorries carts and wagons men were setting up a pavilion near the church for a fete or exhibition others were carrying potted palms from the hotel walking trees that wove their way along the pavement like great birnam wood come to dunsinane and about to attack the waiting macbeth when rutledge made his way back through the crowds some fifteen minutes later he had the information he needed the lyingin hospital was in a back street a small but wellkept building that had potted geraniums in front of its door and a woman in a dark dress at the desk in the small reception hall rutledge asked for the doctor in charge and was soon ushered into a chilly office at the back where a tired elderly man turned from the window to greet him on the desk were stacks of folders waiting to be sorted im dr wilson i was up until five this morning with a difficult delivery if youll make your call a brief one so that i can sleep ill help in any way i can what kind of cases do you take here surprised the doctor said difficult ones that cant be safely delivered at home the welltodo who want more comfort than an upstairs bedchamber and the rest are female complaints where surgery or other remedies are required i deal with a goodly number of women who are ill tumors or excessive bleeding miscarriages stillbirths i find that a number of husbands dont heed me when i tell them a wife should bear no more children i save the woman if i can i also deal with botched abortions where infection is rampant and the woman has waited too long to seek medical help i dont see how any of this is of use to the police you dont handle lung complaints not if they dont bear on a pregnancy or other reproductive problem he was impatient now can you give me the names of women who came here in i cant tell you with any certainty what the date was but the woman im seeking was delivered of a healthy son no i cant it was short and curt then can you tell me if a mrs cook was your patient in that time period mrs maude cook we are investigating a murder that might have a connection with her my patients dont commit murder the doctor said indignantly rutledge had heard many people express the same certainty it was a common reaction a natural one no one i know could do such a thing but murderers came in all shapes and sizes all denominations and races all social strata and more often than not they had friends who were appalled im sure they dont doctor in this case were speaking of a victim and of a threeyearold child who may have been orphaned we need to contact the parents of the woman or her husband a victim wilson regarded him differently i dont recall anyone by the name of maude cook but let me check my files he went to an oak cabinet against the side wall and pulled out a drawer it was stuffed with folders and papers he thumbed through some dozen of them and did it again then finally shook his head i dont find a maude cook at all are you quite sure you have the right name theres a mary cook here and she gave birth to a male child in what was the date wilson gave it to him it was a month too early still can you tell me where she lives or give me the direction of any family wilson turned back to the files she gave london as her home theres no other information the father was dead in the war she cried when i told her she had a son she said he would have been proud a good many women tell me that i have tried to grow accustomed to it and failed children need fathers too damned many of them in these last years had none to go home to he rubbed his eyes is that all you want of me did mrs cook have lung disease of any kind no she was young and healthy there was a complication however it was a difficult birth long and tiring and there was a good deal of trouble breech birth you see touch and go but i saved her and the baby infection set in she was quite lucky she was hereshed have died otherwise the fact remains shell not be able to conceive again well she has her child and i doubt shell marry again so many men died it was cold comfort but all the doctor had why did she come to scotland to have this child if she lived in london she was traveling foolishness on her part at that late stage but she was on her way to london when the bag of waters broke but wilson had no idea what had brought mary cook north from london or how long she might have lived in lanark before consulting him i dont have time to question my patients about their private lives still therere any number of cooks in the neighborhood of loch lomond she might well have been visiting one of them if maude cook was the mother of fionas child she had had the boy in a clinic not on some windswept mountainside and left there well enough to travel was she in fact eleanor gray and had she given fiona a child she did not want to keep in exchange for a sworn promise never to reveal the boys parentage it was possiblebut not very likely as for mary where had they met why had the mother so readily given up her son to a comparative stranger there was absolutely no certainty that maude cook and mary cook were the same personcook was a common name as the doctor had pointed out rutledge drove back to duncarrick feeling the long hours at the wheel of the motorcar and in no mood to confess hed found only the most tenuous threads to account for the number of miles covered or endure the constant hammering of hamishs questions the woman at the desk of the ballantyne smiled at him as he came into the lobby and then turned to a drawer where apparently she kept messages for hotel guests there was one for him but not from old bowels as hed expected it was a politely couched request for him to telephone lady maude she wanted a report of his progress and so far he had nothing to tell her her voice came clearly down the lineimperious and cold i expected you to keep me apprised of your investigation lady maude said accusingly you have disappointed me i had only mundane details to report until today tell me do you know a mrs cook maude cook and who is she lady maude parried i cant be sure he admitted im exploring every possibility and her name has come up in the course of inquiries i have no interest in a maude cook did your daughter have friends in glasgow whom she might have visited for a period of time people who would let her stay for several months certainly not i cant think of any reason why my daughter might wish to go to scotland at all its very unlike her but ive told you that before he said did your daughter know a fiona macdonald i think not it isnt a name im familiar with she paused then madefor hera difficult concession the war unsettled accepted social behavior in london eleanor must have met any number of people outside our own circle of friends i cant be expected to know all of them it was the closest she had come to admitting that for three years she had no knowledge at all of the people who might have been important in her daughters life and then behind the coldness there appeared a brief glimmer of warmth inspector i am waiting for news of my daughter something that will prove that its impossible for her to be connected in any way with this sordid business of murder the police here are still convinced that theerremains that have been found must be your daughters im not as sure for a number of reasons but it isnt something i can prove in a matter of days the woman accused of the murder has been less than helpful we are having to trace her movements over a period of three years until thats completed i cant promise you any news she considered that in silence then she said i shall expect regular reports it was as far as she could go admitting that she was worried i understand he put down the phone and considered going into the saloon bar for a drink but he thought better of it and climbed the stairs wearily to his room hamish was a dull murmur in his ear as he fell deeply and dreamlessly asleep olivers first question was did you learn anything rutledge hesitated and then decided on discretion oliver was protective of his own investigation and any evidence that might conflict with his carefully constructed case would immediately be suspect enough to convince me that if the accused met eleanor gray in brae there is no evidence to prove it it was a cool morning the kind of day that reminded people in the north that winter would be long and dark and dreary rutledge hadnt finished his breakfast when oliver strode in and joined him going directly to the point he said now well i did tell you that wed been thorough he studied rutledge for a moment rubbing the menu hed been given against his freshly shaven chin if the movements of the accused are accounted for then were left with the time it took her to travel from brae to duncarrick and the road she took it must have been there that the two women met a matter of days surely rutledge weighed the fact that fiona had not worked out her time in brae though shed told her aunt she must do so where had she gone for those few weeks back to the glen where shed been born or down to lanark to meet someone no it couldnt have been planned ahead she hadnt known she would be summoned to duncarrick by her aunt but what ifwhat if shed been aware for some time that she was to meet someone on or about a certain date and the summons from her aunt had given her the perfect opportunity to leave brae at the right moment without excuses or explanations she had loved the davison children she had cried when she left thembut leave them she did no lies told to mrs davison no lies told to her aunt just the simple fact that suddenly fiona macdonald had been given a gift of time and therein lay the mystery of eleanor gray and the child if she wouldnt tell him what she knew there might be another way of examining her past rutledge said to oliver id like to search the inn if i may can you arrange it what on earth for oliver demanded i dont know yet but its worth looking to see whetherfor the boys protection if not her ownshe left something there that might help us a connection to the childs background that might have been overlooked because at the time no one understood what it represented oliver shook his head ive been through the inn upstairs and down the public and the family quarters theres nothing but rutledge knew more about fiona macdonald than oliver didand what he wanted to find if they still existed were any letters that fiona had written to her aunt before she came to duncarrick he was given the key and constable mckinstry as an observer and allowed to inspect the inn mckinstry moved with nervous apprehension a man torn between two duties he showed rutledge the way the inn was laid out and then hovered at his shoulder like a second hamish both of them carrying on a desultory conversation with him as he moved from room to room of the private wing by the time theyd finished with the small parlor then walked into the dining room behind it and the kitchen beyond that rutledge said the boys room have you searched it thoroughly if i were hiding anything id put it in among his toys or perhaps at the bottom of a drawer filled with outgrown clothes but what would she have been hiding mckinstry asked wretchedly if shes not guilty what is there to hide rutledge turned and started toward the stairs this way right the boys proper heritage is what were after if anything had happened to miss macdonaldillnessaccidentshe had no family of her own to come for him and take him in surely shed have thought to leave some instructions for the childs protection a name or how to go about reaching a solicitor perhaps eleanor gray had a solicitor who conducted her affairs for her but was mr leeds courageous enough to take on lady maudes displeasure a second time mckinstry said weve looked but havent found anything yes i know look again for that reason mckinstry led the way up the stairs where several doorways opened onto a central passage rutledge followed him the private wing as he had noted was small and old but wellkept and comfortable it spoke well for fionas sense of duty to the inn and the child in her care hardly he thought a den of iniquity as some had imagined it a white cat came out of the room at the head of the stairs friendly and curious she was wellfed rutledge saw and not frightened someone was looking after her he went into the room and saw that it must be fionas there was a round depression on the pillow at the head of the bed and a thin carpeting of white hairs this was where the cat slept besides the bed which boasted a coverlet trimmed in eyelet there was a chest a dressing table and a desk two chairs stood beneath the windows both cushioned in a rose print he went to the desk first but left it after a cursory examination it would be the first place anyone looked oliver for instance would have gone through it with great care all that appeared to be left were bills unused stationery a penknife ink pencils envelopes a large book of accounts for the household and other ordinary items hamish was no happier about his task than mckinstry had been and reminded rutledge that he had no right to pry here police business or not ignoring hamishs irritation he went through the drawers of the chest found them neat and orderly then looked at the back of each nothing behind a curtain clothes had been hung on a wire and there was a pair of shelves for hats and shoes but nothing of interest a sweet perfume followed him as he let the curtain drop then he lifted it again remembering another time and another place he examined the shelves closely and found nothing but a floorboard had moved as he stepped deeper into the small space which was no larger than a cupboard squatting on his heels he examined the board and found that it was not loose but the baseboard behind it he thought might be he took out his pocketknife and finding a seam tried to pry out the board it didnt come it was firmly nailed in place and it had been imagination that had made it appear loose wishful thinking he moved through the room searching the dressing table next then pulled out the bed which stood against the wall that formed part of the stairs on its other side the baseboard here was indeed loose eight inches or more yielded to his questing fingers as he worked his knife into the seam he stood up quickly as he heard mckinstry come down the passage from the boys room beyond nothing sir ive looked at every possible place she might have hidden something where else should i try where did she do the inns accounts is there an office in the inn proper yes sir behind the bar it isnt an office in the true sensemore a small cubby that has a curtain across it she kept her account books there then you begin with that area ill just finish here and join you when ive satisfied myself ive looked everywhere mckinstry nodded and there was a glint in his eye as if he was glad that nothing had turned up but it should havefiona had had warning enough to hide private papers from the police but would she have risked the childs safety by destroying them when the constables footsteps had reached the bottom of the stairs rutledge waited for them to fade along the lower passage then turned back to his own find squatting on his heels again to reach into the dark and dusty hole he nearly leapt out of his skin when the cat brushed against his leg she started away in alarm then came again for petting he rubbed her ears and soft throat then gently pushed her aside from the hole he brought a box tin he thought and no more than ten by eight by six inches in size there were letters in it the deed to the inn several old envelopes of papers that seemed to go back in time to miss maccallums father and a collection of odds and ends that must have been considered family treasuresa mans pocketknife made of stags horn a pocket watch that had an elegantly engraved case bearing the name maccallum a pair of ivory crocheting hooks with a matching ivory thimble and a little medicine flask made of silver with a fine engraving of the tollbooth in edinburgh and a letter bearing rutledges own handwriting the letter he had sent from france to a grieving young woman who had just learned that the man she loved was dead he could hear hamish lamenting in his ear anguish clear in the soft highland voice it had to be written rutledge told him it was kinder than hearing from the army what had become of you and none of it would ha happened if wed no been so tired and afraid no it had to be done it was done i had no choice aye it must seem that way now in the safety of a house that was never bombarded for days at a time you chose to die rutledge reminded him but knew even as he said the words that they were a lie none of them had chosen to diethough he had tried in the months afterward to put himself in the way of a german shell or machine gunners sights they had all wanted to live and come home he took each of the other letters out of their envelopes and scanned them quickly the first came from fiona carrying the news that her grandfather had died the next was also to ealasaid maccallum with word of the death of fionas brothers after that fiona had written to tell her aunt about her position in brae describing the davison family and how different the countryside around glasgow was from the beauties of the mountains to the north i will be happier here she wrote it is not as lonely and these people are wonderfully kind to me the children are a delight but the following letter was very different it read i have sad news to tell you dear aunt ive lost hamish he died in the somme offensive like so many others i have just had word i still dont believe it it seems that if i wait long enough he will come through the door and take me in his arms again i lay awake last night praying that it was no more than a dream but this morning the letter was still beside my bed i cant cry i cant feel i dont know what to do the minister here has come to offer comfort and mrs davison has been kindness itself i ache so i want to die but i have every reason to live when hamish was home last we were wed in secret and i am now carrying his child it will be born in the autumn and it will never know its father but i will have a part of him to hold and lovea living memory of the man i married i hope you will rejoice for me and not feel that it is sad to be alone i am not alone now and i never will be again rutledge folded the page gently and put it back in its envelope without finishing it he had seen all that he needed to see she had told her aunt that she was carrying a childbut he knew for a certainty that hamish macleod had never been home that terrible year to father it and it was not until hamish was dead that she had admitted to it in ordinary circumstances this could have meant that hamish was not the father that she was trying to pass off another mans child as his but these were not ordinary circumstances the night fiona had lain awake praying the news was a dream she had also made some very important decisions one of them was to tell her aunt that a child was to be born in the autumn a cursory reading of the remaining letters satisfied him that they held no secrets only the words of a young woman describing her pregnancy as it progressed how had fiona macdonald known the feelings and the emotions and the sickness that a woman in her condition should have experienced because the real mother had told herand fiona had carefully written it all down was it from maude cook that fiona had learned such things orhad she cleverly asked mrs davison about her own confinements and what it was like to bear a child mrs davison mother of three would have talked to fiona as one woman to another prodded by questions by interest by the fact that she loved her own offspring and enjoyed sharing the giving of life but the letters offered no answers to that or to the question of why fiona had carefully told her aunt lies and led her to believe that she was with child and she hadnt been she had been very forwardthinking she had woven the tissue of lies well before her aunt had sent for her in the last letter there were the words i must work out my time here as i promised mrs davison and ian shouldnt travel just now it will be difficult for both of us but by the end of the month we shall arrive in duncarrick and i look forward to seeing you more than you know fiona macdonald hadnt come upon a woman lying by the roadside in the throes of childbirth taken advantage of an opportunity to kill her and steal her baby she had known for some time that a child would be bornshe had made sure that her aunt had known too and it meant clearly that the infant had been promised to her but by whom and if there had been no need to kill the mother in order to take the child who was the woman whose bones had been found on a mountainside more important from the point of view of lady maude what roleif anyhad eleanor gray played and where was eleanor gray now no one could say hamish spoke the thought that rutledge had already consideredand did not want to address now that the child might have been a temporary gift to fiona to keep until the mother was ready or able to reclaim him until she had done what she had intended from the start to do study to become a doctor and fiona already planning for the child wanting the child coveting the child forever might have decided that she couldnt bear to give him up hamish added pain in his voice its what theyll say its what theyll want to believe unless the mother is found alive to bear witness for her rutledge put the tin box back where hed found it for the time being and was already on his way to the stairs when a thought struck him his sister frances had found in a small cedar chest belonging to their mother the carefully preserved christening robes that the two of them had worn wrapped in tissue these were still white and soft with lacy bodices and a wide band of matching lace at the hem small caps frilled with lace and the tiniest of tucks long ribbons for bows under the chin little knitted boots with blue or pink ribbons to tie them frances who seldom cried had said in a husky voice she never held grandchildrenmine or yours it must have grieved her as if that was the ultimate wrong to the dead and in the center of each long skirt hanging down almost to a grown mans knees let alone an infants had been a large embroidered oval with entwined initials in white satin thread his had been his greatgrandfathers christening robe carefully handed down from generation to generation frances had worn their grandmothers a family tradition that had meant much to people proud of their heritage and surely even if she had abandoned her baby at birth eleanor gray would have seen to it that he was christened properly and in a long white gown not perhaps the one that had been passed down through the gray generations but most certainly one that was suitable to the occasion unless it had been borrowed rutledge turned around at the head of the stairs and walked swiftly back down the passage while fiona had had the front room there were two more at the back one empty with a neatly made bed covered with clean sheets to keep off the dust and the other a small boys realm with a toy chest a clothes chest a dresser and a crib rutledge went first to the clothes chest it was nearly empty here were only the outgrown dresses and stockings and tiny shoes kept for memorys sake a small pretty blanket for a baby that had seen much service a blue velveteen coat with a matching cap and a threadbare stuffed horse one ear chewed off and one leg missing at the bottom carefully preserved in tissue and lavender was a christening gown he took it out and unfolded it with gentle hands hamish saw it before he did an embroidered halfcircle of entwined letters this time in the bodice rutledge carried it to the window and examined it closely beautifully shaped initials with tiny forgetmenots in the spaces memc but did it stand for maude cookor mary cook or someone else by the time mckinstry had come back to report to rutledge he had already put the gown back in the bottom of the clothes chest and dropped the lid the man that rutledge had encountered in the barn was standing outside the door as the constable and inspector stepped out on the pavement mckinstry key in hand turned to greet him at the mans side stood a small untidy boy of three or four he was tall for his age and sturdy with dark hair nearly the color of rutledges and grayblue eyes that were darker in the sunlight than they might have been by candlelight ive come to feed yon cat the man announced abruptly his eyes on rutledge in condemnation so you know who i am now rutledge thought and dont like it i wonder why i didnt know you had a key mckinstry was answering surprise showing in his face aye you dont leave a house to mind itself ive had a key since ealasaid maccallum took her fathers place i dont know mckinstry said again but the man cut him short the cats to be fed are you taking her then the lad will grieve for her and hes lost his ma already mckinstry said very well then as long as you dont touch anything the man glared at him ive no touched anything of anybody elses since i was his age and didnt know better he inclined his head toward the child hamish had been saying something but rutledge had found it hard to make sense of ithe himself was silenced by the doleful stare of the child this then was ian hamish macleod rutledge felt his heart turn over a handsome child this was a small lost child rutledge dropped to one knee and the man holding the boys hand stepped forward tense and prepared to intervene but something in rutledges face stopped him he stepped back again hello ian rutledge said trying to speak through a constricted throat this might have been hamishs child if hed lived this might have been jeans if she and rutledge had married in going to see your cat are you ian nodded his eyes solemnly moved across rutledges face and then to mckinstrys mckinstry must have smiled as he said hallo ian because the child smiled and it was as if the sun had come out the eyes filled with light and with warmth and the sadness vanished is mama here has she come back he asked breathlessly no but i have seen her rutledge said shes well and she misses you he looked at the mans face and dared him to contradict him but the man didnt and although mckinstry stirred at rutledges back he too said nothing when will she come back ian insisted anxious now soon i hope rutledge answered ill do my best to bring her home the boys eyes swept his face again as if to judge how truthful he was then he nodded turned to the man holding his hand and said clarence aye well be feeding her as soon as these gentlemen have gone away goodbye the child told them his voice firm clarence is hungry clarence rutledge questioned as they walked away and left the odd pair to do their duty by the cat mckinstrys eyes crinkled well there was a litter of kittens you see and peter the old man who worked in the stables brought the boy one of them peter had named her thomasina after another cat hed once had in the stables but ian has called her clarence instead i wondered why at the time but havent thought about it since hamish finding his voice provided the answer the davison children had had a foggray cat by that name and fiona must have told ian about the litter that maude cook had never seen as they walked back toward the hotel rutledge asked mckinstry who the man was his names drummond he and his spinster sister live next to the inn and fiona chose to leave the boy with them she said hed be less frightened with people he knew and people she trusted it was worth bearing in mind when mckinstry had gone on his way back to the station rutledge retraced his steps and came to a halt outside the house where the drummonds lived it was the house he had noted before the one with the extension in the rear and the windows with unexpected symmetry his instincts told him that drummond and the child had not come back from feeding the cat he wondered if drummond allowed the boy to play with the toys in the chest or sit on his mothers bed and hold clarence when rutledge knocked at the door a woman of middle age answered her fair hair drawn back and tight curls adding a softness around her face she brushed these back as if afraid the caller on her front step might take them for a softness in her as well and said if youve come to see drummond hes not in miss drummond my name is rutledge ive been sent by scotland yard to look into the matter of the parentage of the boy you have in your keeping young ian and what interest has london got in a lad of three her voice was sharp indignant but her pale eyes were wary almost frightened as if hed come to carry the boy away if his motherthe woman he calls his motheris hanged for murder it would be best if the child went to his own kin i think youd agree with me there i agree with nothing her fear made her garrulous ian wouldnt be here if he hadnt been given to us by his mother and if drummond hadnt fought against that fool elliot to keep the lad with us untiluntil it was all decided he was all for sending him to the forsters did you know miss macdonald well hamish said she must have done else the lad would never have been entrusted to her fiona would never set a child at risk miss drummond had not invited rutledge in but kept him on the doorstep like a tradesman as to that knowing her well im thinking now that none of us did but ealasaid maccallum i knew for her sake i agreed to do what i could drummonds reasons are his own ians a likely lad and has been no trouble and i expect we can feed and clothe him better than most if it comes to that she added with some pride before the war drummond made a fair living working at mr holdens a good man with horses she added grudgingly as if she disliked admitting to better qualities in her brother theyre great beasts the shire horses but when he handled them they were meek as lambs the army took the lot of them and brought not one of them back theres only sheep to be run at holdens now and my brothers not a man who cares for sheep but drummond can turn his hand to anything asked of him and mrs holden keeps him busy enough working about the house he ought to be busy about the needs of his own i cant do it all alone hamish said she doesna approve of her brother but they live together like two peas thats most likely the root of it rutledge replied silently he thought the pair must have inherited this barn of a house together and neither had wanted to move out or sell up it could make for bad feelings over the years can you tell me anything about miss macdonalds family everyone knew her grandfather he was respected hed played the pipes for the old queen in his day when first she came up to balmoral and the maccallums have owned the reivers for fourfivegenerations weve been neighbors for nearly three the drummonds and the maccallums always honest godfearing minded their own business kept the inn in good order never any rowdiness or drunkenness allowed still all i knew about fiona was what her aunt told methat she was a hard worker and tidy and had no eye for the men not thinking to find another father for ian you understand then why rutledge asked quietly did the town of duncarrick turn their backs on her ah miss drummond said it as an exclamation and a sigh if we knew what was at the bottom of that wed be wise wouldnt we is that all youve come to ask rutledge said tell me about the boy is he bright does he mind he does i will say this for her fiona raised him proper ive told that fool elliot as much but he sees only what he wants to see im thinking its no surprise hes a widower drove his wife to an early grave if you want my opinion ealasaid gave him the benefit of the doubt but i had no patience with him the old minister who was before him he was a man of god and he preached a mighty sermon of a sunday mr hall his name was come from dunfermline and married a croser from over to hawick we went to kirk every sunday and were proud of it but this fool elliot now hes besotted with sin he doesnt care a whit about redemption only in setting blame and what goods that i ask you ive been led to believe that fiona never confided in her auntnever told her for instance that she wasnt the boys mother surely she must have told someone a woman she trusteda friend or neighboryour brother miss drummond stared at him consideringly any secrets best kept if its kept you should know that as a policeman fiona was friendly in a quiet fashion respectful to her elders nice ways about her as if shed gone to school to learn them but all ive ever heard was that shed loved her grandfather and he was a bonny piper oh and that shed been happy with her soldier before he died more than that i never asked and she never spoke of now its time you went or drummond will be home and shout at both of us he doesnt like anyone prating about fiona or the lad least said soonest mended thats his view theres only one other question before i leave rutledge said holding his ground ive been told that men were attracted to fiona macdonald was that true he was met with stony silence miss drummonds face had changed the color shifting to a mottled red as if some emotion had risen swiftly and as swiftly been stamped down anger or jealousy after a few seconds the woman before him her voice very different said tightly as if the truth had been forced out of her they say still waters run deepest i dont know fionas not by nature a talkative woman the kind youd sit and gossip comfortably with i never could tell what to make of her i never got close to her men on the other hand they saw something else i cant put a name to what it was theyd watch her and wait for her to smile and then their faces would light up ive seen my own brother staring at her mesmerized by something i couldnt feel or understand as if he thinks hes found the core of her and wants it if you ask me drummonds besotted with her and if you want the whole truth of it elliot is as well he raves on about sin like a man who knows what it means to burn with desire at night but surely the police havent fallen under her spell havent they now mckinstry would save her if he could hes in hopes of marrying her oliver used to stop by the inn of an evening before he went home sitting there like a suitor and him with a wife and what troubles the chief constable and the fiscal is that she refuses to bow her head and confess to what shes done and beg for mercy the way a woman should they see it as defiance of their authority and it unsettles their faith in their own importance im not surprised they all want her hanged dont you see its the best way to be free of her when rutledge walked into the hotel the man at the desk said theres been a telephone call for you sir from london he took the message and read it call sergeant gibson one of the best men at ferreting out information of any kind gibson had a reputation for being thorough as well rutledge went into the telephone closet set his hat on the little table there and put in his call to the yard gibson came on very shortly to say inspector rutledge sir yes im in need of good news i hope youre going to tell me you have found eleanor gray no sir that i havent but i talked to suffragettes shed marched with and was known to be friends with they havent seen her in some three years what they tell me is that she went off to winchester one weekend and never came back to london at least not as far as anyone knows most of the women thought lady maude had had enough of her daughters wild ways and sent for her are they certain she actually went to winchester she could have lied about her plans yes sir i thought of that and took the liberty to call on the people she was to stay with miss gray never got there she was set to drive down with an officer shed known in london but she changed her mind at the last minute and said the two of them would be going to scotland instead he was on sick leave and it wasnt up for another week she promised to call back when she returned to london but never did scotland did you ask the name of this officer rutledge asked that i did sir gibsons voice came strongly down the line but theyve forgotten it still it was someone shed met before not a stranger or she wouldnt have asked to bring him to winchester with her they tell me she was not one to impose on her hostess in that way well done gibson rutledge said do you have a number where i can reach these people in winchester he could hear down the line the shuffling of papers yes sir here it is a mrs humphrey atwood she was the honorable miss talbothemings went to school with miss gray for a time and stayed friends there was a pause rutledge could hear a door shut and then with a note of triumph gibson added the chief superintendent told me i wasnt to bother talking to the suffragette ladies addled all of them he said a waste of time there was another pause bit of luck wasnt it sir if he hadnt known gibson better rutledge would have imagined him grinning ear to ear it was there in the voice but gibson seldom smiled he was also seldom wrong in his findings or his conclusions he was the kind of man who took pride in himself and in his work and was bulldog tenacious when he wanted to be only his eyes warned that inside the beefy middleaged body was a brain sharp as a razor rutledge had always suspected that old bowels and gibson were enemies from years back that didnt put gibson in rutledges column at the yard but it meant that an opportunity to blacken chief superintendent bowless eye was savored by the man and often produced information that rutledge found valuable as in this case rutledge thanked him and put up the receiver standing there for all of a minute thinking here was the first tie between eleanor gray and scotland secondhand it might be but it was better than none why would a man bring a woman some months pregnant from london to scotlandunless he was the father of her child hamish said unless there wasna anyone else she could turn to and he felt sorry for her there was also that possibility rutledge acknowledged opening the door of the little room and taking a deep breath of fresher air but he thought it was more likely that the officer must have known the father if indeed he wasnt the father himself he himself would have done as much for a friend at the front he closed the door again and was on the point of asking for the number gibson had given him when he realized that he ought to go to winchester himself it would mean a long fast drive there and back but it had to be done a telephone was a device that allowed people to hide behind distance nothing said into the telephone could match the nuances of expression and tone of voice that he used so often to judge information and people hamish said its been close to three years its likely true they canna remember the officers name now on the way to his room to pack what he needed rutledge answered very likely but you never can tell what other information they still have rutledge spent the night in the midlands he had tried to persuade himself that he was good for another hour or more of driving but heavy rain caught up with him nearly blinding him when he narrowly missed an unlit wagon going in the same direction he pulled over waiting for the worst of the downpour to pass only then did he recognize just how tired he was there was an inn on the high street of the next village and rousing the owner from his bed rutledge asked for a room and was brought a tray of tea and dry sandwiches as well he was on the road again as soon as it was light by the time he arrived in winchester the stiffness in his back and legs was turning to cramp hamish had spent most of rutledges hours behind the wheel earnestly pulling apart the evidence against fiona macdonald and quarreling over the role eleanor gray might or might not have played it had been exceedingly difficult for rutledge to explain hamishs existence the reality of his voice to the doctor at the clinic he was not a ghostghosts could be exorcised nor was he a disembodied voice repeating rutledges thoughts like a parrot what was there was vividthe nuances of thought and tone demanded answers and rutledge in broken in spirit and mind and nearly in body had found it easier to answer the voice than to challenge it he had known hamish through two years of war his memory was filled with conversations that had shaped new conversationsnew thoughtsnew fears in the five months since returning to the yard rutledge had slowly found the courage to argue to refuteto take on the voice in verbal battle a painful step toward sanity he told himself again and againnot away from it but challenging it went beyond his courage still hamish was saying its those bones in glencoe that gave oliver an excuse to bring a charge of murder against fiona he wouldna care about them else its no even his jurisdiction it doesna matter to him whose they are true enough but until we know how that woman died were bound to take them into account rutledge argued as long as her shadowwhoever she may befalls over the evidence it will obscure everything else hamish still disagreed and said so rutledge shook his head eleanor grays disappearance gave the police in duncarrick a name to put to those bones identify the corpse thats the first rule of a murder inquiry and oliver is convinced that he has once thats established he has to find a clear connection between the two women if eleanor gray was pregnant and came to scotland to wait out her term then the link begins to take shape if thats not true then there has to be another explanation for her presence in glencoe and if it can be proved that the bones arent eleanor grays after all oliver is simply going to search for another identity to give them named or nameless the woman is a stumbling block aye i grant you but can you no see that named or nameless its happenstance that connects these bones with fiona in the first place what if oliver proves they belong to the gray woman what if he proves she was pregnant when she disappeared its still a giant leap to prove fiona killed her or any other woman i agree but finding eleanor gray alive will eliminate her from the list if shes dead and oliver does have her body then were back to the problem of how she died where she did murdernatural causeseven suicide whether the answer will clear fiona or damn her isnt the issue we have to look for it by the same token if it turns out that eleanor gray was murdered then we have to prove that fiona was the only person who might have had a reason and opportunity to kill her oliver may be content to jump to conclusions but the truth is lady maude wont be as easily satisfied whos to say that in the end those bones are no their own mysteryand no ours hamish countered stubbornly then youd better pray that eleanor gray left the child with fiona while she secretly went off to finish her studies its the only way to convince inspector oliver that hes got no case which brings me back to what ive been saying all along right now eleanor gray is the key to the investigation i canna say i like it it was odd rutledge found himself thinking at one point how hamish had coped with the unexpected and sudden confrontation with fiona macdonald he was vigorous in her defense and he had never questioned her innocence but far deeper than that ran the knowledge that her life now was separating from his not as jean had left him wanting to be free of what she feared but in the very fact that living had drawn fiona into new directions and new feelings and new places that hamish would never share he had not known about duncarrick he had not known about the child the silences that followed his meeting fiona again had been a painful reminder that time did not wait that there was no holding on to it that there was an emptiness in death and yet in some sense it was as if she was the one who had died for hamish mourned her loss with a heavy sorrow with yearning and despair and the burden rutledge carried grew daily heavier with it it was rutledge who struggled with the reality the fact that fiona could be found guilty of murder and hanged he was the one who dealt with the tired face and darkcircled eyes of the woman in the cell it was rutledge who bore the brunt of fear and uncertainty about his own views of the evidence and the case building so tightly uncertainty too about his personal feelings he had seen fiona through hamishs eyes for so long that until now she had seemed rather like the dresden figurines on francess bookshelfgentle and uncomplicated frozen in time and place mourning her dead soldier a woman wronged by what he rutledge had been forced to do on the battlefield the martyr as it were to his own guilt even in the dream in london she had been connected to the death of hamish with no existence all her own he had he realized suddenly seen her through hamishs memories now he had his own a fleshandblood woman somehow attractive and right or wrong displaying remarkable strength in her lonely defiance of the law mourning hamish still and giving that pentup love to a child the courage of innocenceor guilt rutledge found that she had brought out the protective streak in him and he couldnt be sure whether it was for her own sake or hamishs that he felt bound to do his best for her there was confusion and emotion in his mind fraught with his own bitterness his own loneliness it was he thought forcing him to think without the clarity and objectivity he tried to bring to every investigation assigned to him hamish god damn it was right and where was your objectivity in cornwallor dorset hamish demanded where was your clarity then those women touched you too how can you be sure it is fiona and not you whos on trial here rutledge had no answer rutledge stopped in winchester long enough to bathe and change his clothes and then found his way to atwood house it was a small manor house built of mellow stone by a sure hand in the s the architect had set it on a knoll that offered splendid views to the south and an old grove of trees to the north offering privacy and a barrier against cold winds a stream meandering through the property was lined with wild roses thick with hips now rutledge could see a pair of swans swimming regally on a pond created for the rowboat tied to a post someone had opened out the stream to fill the pond and created a lovely effect at the bottom of the western gardens a mirror of the sky that barely rippled as the swans floated above their own images the drive swept him up to the georgian front with its dressed stone and pedimented windows he got out of the car nodding to the gardener trundling a handbarrow filled with spades and hoes and trimmers across the lawn toward the drive and walked to the door a brass knocker which looked to be a more modern copy of an earlier iron one clanged mightily as he let it fall after a proper passage of time an elderly butler answered the door rutledge identified himself and asked to speak to mrs atwood the butler noting his crisp collar and the set of his suit across his shoulders said ill ask if mrs atwood is at home this afternoon he led rutledge to a coldly formal room and left him there for nearly seven minutes the walls sheathed in blue silk shimmered in the light from the long windows and the french chairs that set off the white marble of the mantel were arranged for elegance not comfortable conversation there was no carpet on the floor and on closer inspection the walls as well as the fabric covering the chairs were worn but over the mantel was a wonderful painting of the view hed seen coming up the drive it was a younger time the trees were not yet mature there were sheep grazing the smooth lawns and the house did not have the patina of age but the serenity was there unchanged the butler returned and conducted him down the passage to a sitting room that also showed wear wellworn chintz a faded carpet on which an elderly spaniel slept noisily and an air of comfortable genteel shabbiness told him that the house had suffered much use during the war and had not yet reclaimed its former elegance but the windows faced the pond and the stream framing the view and bringing in the soft light of afternoon it was peaceful mrs atwood was standing by the empty hearth as he came in a pale woman in every sense slim and willowy in pastel green pale of hair and eyes and skin as if all the color had been washed away in the long careful years of family breeding he discovered very quickly that the character had not been washed away she said with graciousness that was backed by steel i have spoken touma sergeant gibson there is nothing more i wish to say to the police thats quite possible he answered sergeant gibson was here as a duty i have come as an emissary of lady maude gray something unexpected stirred in the pale blue eyes they were the color of faded lupines hardly differentiated from the white surrounding them i have not heard from lady maude in some years her voice was neutral giving nothing away hamish silent until now in the shadows of rutledges mind said softly she doesna care for yon lady maude making a note of it rutledge answered it isnt surprising she quarreled with her daughter i cannot say she regrets that quarrel but she has come into information now that has disturbed her its very possible that eleanor gray is dead how and where she came to die we dont know i am doing what i can to find answers surprise flared in the long face dead but your sergeant said nothing about that yes i know on my instructions he let the silence fall and gave her time to digest his curt answer i dont see how i can help you i havent seen eleanor since the middle of the war i thoughthumphrey and i were quite convinced shed gone to america when she couldnt take up medicine here it would have been so like her why should she choose to go there did she have friendssomeone who might put in a word for her as a matter of fact there was someone she hesitated and then added i called alice morton after sergeant gibson left she was in school with eleanor and me but her husband is an americanhes at the embassy here his brother john is a professor at harvard hed written to eleanor once in the spring of at alices request laying out opportunities she might wish to consider over there alice told me john had never had a reply eleanor hadnt contacted him at all mrs atwood shrugged lightly she was always strongminded she might not have wished to be beholden even to a friend why did you call and ask about miss gray if you hadnt tried to find her for three years mrs atwood was disconcerted by the direct question ii dont know why not really it was justi wanted to be reassured i suppose we dont often have the police asking about an acquaintance it wasonly that hamish demanded was it after a moment rutledge asked pleasantly tell me about the last time you saw or spoke with eleanor gray he had made his hostess uneasy from reticence she had moved to explanations and now apology im sorry there isnt much to tell not really she was to come down for the weekend and bring a friend but she telephoned to say shed changed her mind the young man had more leave than shed thought and she wanted to go to scotland with him i wasnt aware that her family had a house there he deliberately misunderstood her no of course they didnt it was the pipers you see breaking off she started again eleanor was eager to do what she could for the wounded i found it ratherdepressingbeing around them but she did her best to try to cheer them brought in singers performers that sort of thing she became convinced that hearing the pipes might encourage the wounded and help them endure their pain better perhaps remind them of the courage theyd shown at the front she went to scotland to find them again he subtly twisted her words no no you dont understand she arranged for pipes and drums to visit the manor houses that had been turned into clinics or hospitals we had about twenty officers ourselves broken bones generally she invited the pipers here first to see what the response might be and it brought the men to tears they were so buoyed up it was amazing she had two young officers with her who had helped find the pipers both were scottish and both were quite taken with eleanor i thought she rather liked the dark one she was upset when he went back to the front do you recall the names of these men good gracious no not after all this time i do remember that the fairer one spent a considerable part of his day in our stables the horses were gone of course but it was the construction that interested him the stonework was eighteenth century and he admired it and the other officer the one eleanor gray seemed to like mrs atwood frowned his father was something in finance i cant tell you what it was we were so crowded and there was so much happening i tried to be polite but the truth is i barely listened please try to remember it was a command sheathed as a polite request she shook her head it was so long ago and you cant imagine what it was like the house at sixes and sevens things packed away in the attics no room to entertain though we did make an effort when we had fewer patients but she saw this man more than once perhaps having dinner with him in london as well as bringing him here for the pipers i cant be sure theyre all macthis and macthat arent they the scots and eleanor was in london i could hardly keep track of her friends yet you say she rather liked him and was upset when he went back to france she bit her lip caught in her own tangle of truth she turned and walked to one of the windows looking out with her back to him after a silence she said i think the dark one the one she liked was named for a poet how oddi had forgotten that yes im sure he was the one there was some joke about it the first time he came we asked if hed read from his worksteasing of course and he said he might after a good dinner but he never did a charming man with a charming accent i hope he survived the war so mrs atwood had seen him more than oncethere are a number of scottish poets rutledge said gently yes i know how absolutely maddening i remember the teasingi remember his smile as he answered i remember that his father was in finance it was hamish who made the leap quite unexpectedly robert burns startled rutledge repeated the name aloud yes they called him robbie she responded turning back to him her face brightening with a becoming flush he couldnt be sure whether it was relief at having the answer handed to her or chagrin that he had caught her out he had a small house in the trossachs thats in scotland im told though heaven knows where it is i remember he said he ought to have been named walter scott because he lived in the wrong place for a burns how odd that i should recall that so clearly now rutledge felt a surge of hope the trossachs lay in central scotland almost halfway between glasgow to the south and glencoe to the north there must be rutledge thought a thousand men in scotland called robert burns of every age and station and background but a young officer with a house in the trossachsthat could narrow the search enormously yes and with a father in finance financebanking or he tried to keep his voice level his words without emphasis hamish was hammering at the back of his mind almost drowning what he was saying was his father by chance a procuratorfiscal but her face was blank as if she had never heard the title before shaking her head she gestured to the chairs neither of them had taken please do sit down may i offer you tea or a glass of something buying time rutledge said yes id like a cup of tea she rang for the butler who must have been hovering nearby expecting shortly to show rutledge out and gave her instructions as rutledge sat in the nearer chair he said tell me about eleanor gray as you remember her she knew her worth but she was never condescending a dependable friend good company as a house guest independent she told me once that she had no real hope of becoming a doctorher mother would see to it that no one took her seriously i think thats why she was a suffragette it seemed frightfully vulgar to me but eleanor laughed and called it an adventure i think it made her mother furious and that pleased eleanor they never saw eye to eye why i dont know she adored her father and would have done anything he asked but he never told her what to do or not do he said she should please herself it was odd how much she loved him i thought he cared for her but i could never quite see it as love some fathers dote on their only daughters you know spoil them that sort of thing but evelyn gray was fond of her merelyfond perhaps they had little in common she let the thought trail away as the butler arrived with tea hamish warned its no like her to talk so much rutledge agreed mrs atwood thanked the butler and dismissed him settling herself to pour as she handed rutledge his cup he said why did eleanor gray want to be a doctor its an odd choice given her wealth and social position ah that was something i never fully understood humphreymy husbandrather thought it was a passing fancy with the war and all but i dont see it that way at a dinner party once eleanor said that doctors were woefully ignorant and uninterested in what caused diseases she argued with the army doctors too when she felt it was warranted she cared intensely about the patients but it wasnt sentimental in any way it was practical and realistic she would have made a good doctor in my view rutledge said and when she didnt contact you for three years you accepted the fact that she must be in america if not boston then somewhere else there she was silent so long he thought she didnt want to answer the question hamish responding to the odd tension in the air said you made the right decision coming yoursel then mrs atwood replied youve made me afraid the police you and sergeant gibson the last time i spoke to eleanor she was in londonit was a strange conversation she said somethingi thought she must be a little drunk that night and i was worried that she was contemplating driving to scotland in that condition and she said i could die and i took it to mean she was so happy she could die but what if that wasnt what she meantwhat if she truly wanted to die mrs atwood looked at him pain in her eyes was there some terrible accident is that what happened no rutledge told her it wasnt an accident its more likely that someone murdered her she turned so white he thought she was going to faint and was halfway out of his chair no she said in a strangled voice noim all right its just she tried to breathe deeply and instead her breath caught on a sob ive never known anyone who was murderedthats horriblehorrible if she was driving north with a soldier to spend his leave in scotland she must have known him well enough to go with him of course she must eleanor wasnt the sort whowho used the war as an excuse to behave as she pleased she wouldnt have gone with a stranger or a man she didnt trust there was conviction in the low voice was it burns that she went to scotland with mrs atwood i tell you i cant remember you can ask the servants they might would you have tried to stop her if she was about to do somethingsilly i she broke off caught between her own emotional dilemma and his dark eyes watching her face they seemed to see into her soul you must tell me the truth mrs atwood a lie wont serve you or me when she spoke her voice was husky with shame ii was hurt that she wasnt coming for the weekend i told myself she was happy while i was wretched there had been no letters from humphrey for weeks and id just received word that he was being listed as missing i knew what that meanthe was dead but they hadnt found his body yet i hadnt even told my motheri could hardly bear to believe it myself and to have eleanor let me down when id been counting so on her companyto go larking off with someone half drunk with champagne most likely sounding quite unlike herselfit wasi couldnt tell her about humphrey then could i i was angryangry and upset i didnt care to know i didnt want to know what she was doing i hoped shed end her week just as wretched as i was she stopped and then went on almost against her will thats why i refused to be worried when she didnt come back or call me i was still angryi told myself she wasnt a friend at all it was better if she went her own way shed gone to scotland and could stay there forever as far as i cared then i got word that humphrey was alive and safe and i didnt want to think about anything elsei didnt want to remember how badly id behaved she regarded him with hurt frightened eyes if she died that nightit was my fault in a way for letting her down for not worrying when she didnt call at the end of the week or come down or write i punished her for being happy when i wasnt and then i put it all out of my mind deliberately as he drove toward london rutledge tried to set out in logical detail what he had learned from mrs atwood and her servants hamish said theres still no name to put with the gray womans companion no but theres a connection now between eleanor gray and scotland the wrong side of scotland but its a start aye but it would ha been better if there was no connection at all if shed gone to america we have to find this man burns if we can aye but theres no proof eleanor gray went to scotland with him he may know the name of the man who did accompany her he may have introduced them he may have been a friend of both rutledge thought about it she wasnt traveling alone but she went of her own free will she was alive when she left london ye canna know that but i doshe told mrs atwood where she was going and with whom it was planned it was something she wanted to do yet her mood had been unsettled i could die from happinessor despair had this been just after eleanors quarrel with lady maude rutledge had asked mrs atwood to put a date to that conversation it was early in spring the timing fit if eleanor was pregnant she could still conceal it if her mother had refused to help her she could still make other plans a small house in the trossachs a place to hide a place to start most certainly rutledge stopped long enough in london to pack another case he didnt contact the yard but back on the road heading north again he decided it was time to report to lady maude gray lady maude received rutledge with cool disinterest as if he had come to report on the state of her drains or her roofs she again conducted the interview in the library but this time had seen to it that tea arrived shortly after he did pouring his cup she said i knew nothing would come of this ridiculous business there is nothing in your face that tells me you have been successful on the contrary there have been a number of small successes not yet a whole but enough to be going on with she smiled lighting the remarkable violet eyes from within then tell me i shall be the judge your daughter did not go to america to study medicine we have that on the authority of a professor who had been advising her it was only a patchwork of truth and fiction but he saw the small flicker of surprise in her face like mrs atwood lady maude must also have soothed her conscience with the notion that eleanor gray had gone abroad to study against her mothers wishesbut surely safely accounted for lady maude had even closed her ears to inspector oliver so certain was she and then rutledge had somehow raised niggling doubts this was news she had not expected to hear hamish who did not care for lady maude was pleased go on she said curtly she was last heard from on her way to scotland with a young officer by the name of burns he had a small house in the trossachs and enough leave to go there her voice was cold you are mistaken eleanor would not have gone anywhere with a strange man he wasnt a stranger she had known him for some time apparently and a mrs atwood believes that eleanor wasattractedto him they had worked together to arrange for pipe concerts at various hospitals to cheer the wounded i was given the impression that your daughter had spent enough time in this mans company to grow fond of him whether as a friend or more than that im not able to tell you at this stage like a mask her face remained unchanged her hands holding her cup and saucer were still quiet in her lap too wellbehaved to indicate by any movement of their own that she was unsettled but along the firm jawline there was a small nerve twitching when i requested that you be assigned to this case inspector i believed i had chosen a man of intelligence and integrity i had not expected you to be a listener to gossip and innuendo you have disappointed me he smiled for that i shall apologize but the fact is i talked to the person whom your daughter telephoned just before leaving for scotland with burns she had been promised to the atwoods for a weekend and hadquite properlycalled her hosts to explain the change in plan you had brought your daughter up well she remembered her manners even in a time of great distress he set his empty cup on the tray check and mate hamish in the ensuing silence said only well done it was rare praise rutledge had no time to savor it lady maude said if your information comes from grace talbothemingsnow mrs atwoodim sure she reported the conversation exactly as it happened she was a truthful child and has no doubt grown into a truthful young woman this is not to say that what my daughter told her is to be believed on the contrary eleanor might well have left a false trail if she had found passage to the united states and wished to be absolutely certain that no one stopped her this would also explain her great distress as you call it rutledge had to admit that it did lady maude was not easily broken she had been the mistress of a king and knew her worth she had known her daughters worth as well and lived to see eleanor turn her back on it rutledge thought eleanor died in her mothers heart in and he suddenly knew why the daughter lady maude had given up her own selfrespect to bear to a prince of wales had not been worthy in her mothers eyes of such sacrifice eleanor had neither understood nor appreciated the burden her mother carried and if anything had in her youthful rebellion mocked it for the most fleeting instant of time he wondered if lady maude might be capable of killing her only child lady maude also set her cup on the tray with firm finality you must realize inspector that yourshe hesitated delicatelysmall successes as you call them are proving to be a reflection on my daughters character that i find unacceptable you will not pursue them aye she doesna want to learn that her daughter was pregnant hamish said if it damns fiona neither do i i have no choice in the matter rutledge said i am trying now to locate this man burns he should be able to lead us to the next step where miss gray went in scotland and why lady maude rose i must thank you for your courtesy in reporting your information to me in person i expect we shall not meet again dismissal permanent dismissal hamish pointed out rutledge stood as well i shall respect your wishes would you prefer a written report to a message by telephone when ive completed my investigation their eyes locked hers a deep violet with her anger and his a mirror of his voice official and unyielding for a full twenty seconds she said nothing waiting for him to look away first then she snapped i can break you inspector no doubt he answered but it will not change the truth nor will it give you great satisfaction good day lady maude he had reached the door before her voice stopped him you will find nothing connecting my daughter to those appalling bones he turned and for a moment looked at the room enclosing them with such elegance and formality thats my hope as well it will be a great tragedy if i do for many people as the door began to close on his heels he heard her voice commanding and clear but not raised inspector he stepped back in the room nothing had changed in her face she said only it is fortunate is it not that my daughter has found a champion in you i fear that i have been hurt too often it is difficult to summon the courage to face another disappointment but i shall try he inclined his head it was in its way a salute and an apology this time she didnt stop him as he left hamish digesting the last exchange said only i canna say that walking with the great is the road to happiness no rutledge silently answered that woman has paid a dear price an hour after leaving menton rutledge found a telephone in the next town and put in a call to his godfather morag answered the telephone and went to find david trevor he said taking up the receiver ian i hope this means youre coming to dinner i wont make it to scotland in time its late and ive had three days of hard driving no its information i need sir you told me earlier that you knew the procuratorfiscal in the macdonald case well enough to tell me anything about his family there was an instant of silence then david trevor said yes i can give you what i know he married a young woman from the neighborhood of stirling if i remember her father was a lawyer and a brother was a judge i think i met her once or twice at some official gathering they had three children cathy the daughter is married to an englishman and they live in gloucester george the older son is with a london firm the youngest robert is dead did either son serve in the war george was in the navy invalided out in late robert was killed in france artillery early i think was robert married no there was a girl in edinburgh whom he was unofficially engaged to it was an understood thing but no announcement had been made then she died of appendicitis i dont know quite whenwell before robert was killed certainly in the winter of i think it was why this sudden interest in robert i dont know rutledge said truthfully could you describe him he was dark and well set up and im told he had the most wonderful wit ross had heard him offering the toasts at a wedding he had the guests bent double with laughter he said that robert could have stood for parliament if hed wanted to go in that direction but he was interested in law or banking i forget which rutledge could almost hear the smile in trevors voice have i earned a consulting fee for my knowledge of scottish social circles without doubt thank you i appreciate your help will you be coming again ian before you leave scotland there was a quiet longing in the seemingly casual question as soon as i can rutledge promised and said goodbye another night on the road saw rutledge back in duncarrick tired and out of sorts he stopped at the police station before he went to the hotel and asked to speak to fiona mckinstry was on duty and he said diffidently youve been away i think yes there was business outside of london to see to mckinstry took him back and opened the door himself smiling at fiona he said wistfully to rutledge shall i stay and take notes no no it isnt necessary he waited until mckinstry was out of earshot down the hall before going into the small cell and closing the door behind him fiona with nothing to say watched his face rutledge bade her a good morning and then asked there was a scottish officer who was well known to eleanor gray robert burns called robbie by his friends did you ever meet him she answered the only burns i know is the fiscal he isnt young enough to have been in the war he lives in jedburgh rutledge said yes well it doesnt matter he gestured for her to sit and she looked first at the cot and then at the single chair and chose the cot perching herself stiffly on the edge of it rutledge took the chair and said conversationally fiona why do the people of duncarrick dislike you do they they must they believed the scurrilous letters about you they believe now that youre capable of murder would you have picked out say the tait woman at the hat shop as a murderer or the young woman who keeps house for the minister would you find it easy to believe people who claimed they were whores and worse she flushed but people believed these things about you if i can discover why i might know who is behind the lies it will be a beginning ive told you beforei dont know why if i did i wouldnt be here locked away from the sunlight and the wind on my face i accept that have you ever met the father of the boy you call ian the sudden shift in direction made her eyes widen but her answer was swift and seemingly honest no youre quite sure of that i have never set eyes on ians father before god its the truth then he said with cold reason the trouble you are in today must come from the boys mother no shes dead i have told you that the interruption was so swift that she hadnt allowed him to finish what he had planned to say the boys mothers family she isnt dead he said gently and thats the problem i think shes afraid of you afraid that you might tell her new husband about the child she bore out of wedlock afraid that you might grow weary of caring for the child and decide one fine day to bring him to her doorstep she is afraid of you and shes here in duncarrick or close by and it is she who has poisoned the town against you fiona was standing now please leave because im too close to the truth no she said her eyes meeting his with firmness because you are so very far from it that you frighten me i thoughti thought once that you had believed me i thought you might help me you refuse to help me there were sudden tears rising in her eyes but not spilling through the thick lashes i have done nothing wrong except to love a child that is not mine if you want my help you will have to promise that nothing touches ian nothing i have kept silent for his sake i have tried to protect him not myself from what what is there that could harm him the people who might take him if they knew he existed who would want to punish him for what his mother did who would make him suffer because of what she had done what had she done she loved someone terribly deeply it was wrong but shethere were reasons why she did and there was a child of that love a woman in her position couldnt go home with an infant in her arms and say forgive me i couldnt help myself let me pick up the pieces of my life and go on as if nothing has happened why havent you told the police this the fiscal theyd demand her name to prove that i was telling the truth and i was given ian to guard and love and protect not to betray the tears spilled running like quicksilver down her cheeks i am lost she said whatever i do and it is better to hang than it is to fail at least i would die knowing knowing i had kept my promise to the end he fumbled for his handkerchief and handed it to her surely she would come forward if shes alive and spare you for the boys sake no i tell you shes dead its her family i fear not her choking back a sob she repeated i am not afraid of the dead while hamish argued fiercely in his mind rutledge said quietly i can see that you might have taken the child and given promises but what would you have told hamish macleod if hed come home from the war and found you with a child you claimed to be your own she stared at him wretched he would have loved us both he would have trusted me and loved us both and for once to rutledges shame the truth rang clearly in the little cell he went to see the procuratorfiscal late in the afternoon jedburgh was busy the heart of the town was crowded the shops doing a bustling trade along with the pubs and the hotel people spilling out into the street in the path of carts and wagons jammed with goods there had been a cattle market in the morning and farmers in for the day seemed to be making the most of it to rutledges eye the population of jedburgh had nearly doubled and no one seemed to be in any haste to go home again finding a place to leave his vehicle took nearly twenty minutes and even then he had to pay a grinning gaptoothed man for the privilege the procuratorfiscals office overlooking the center of the town was darkpaneled and furnished with mahogany and leather the books lining the shelves above the handsome old desk were a blend of law and science and literature burns was tall stooped and thin a handsome head of white hair was brushed back from his forehead and gold pincenez concealed sharp blue eyes a man used to command and discipline inspector rutledge its good of you to come may i offer you tea a sherry rutledge judging him rightly accepted the sherry and lifting the golden liquid in its slim glass he saw that the pattern etched around the base of the cup was of thistles have you made any progress in the matter of eleanor gray i know more about her now she was a wealthy young woman with a taste for rebellion and an intense desire to study medicine she worked with the wounded during the war providing entertainment for them where possible and taking an interest in their care she was invited to a house party near winchester early in and accepted but the officer she was bringing with her discovered he had more leave than hed expected she came north with him instead apparently intending to spend a few days at his house whether she got there or not no one seems to know where she may have gone after that week no one seems to know but the information i have is reliable and puts miss gray in scotland in the spring before the child was born if she had just learned that she was pregnant she could have arranged to wait for the birth of the child here where she wasnt as well known yes yes that makes sense to me who was the officer do you know there was nothing in the procurators face to show that he was in any way prepared for the shock that was to come interest and a natural curiosity were there nothing more we have reason to believe that the officer she had been friends with for some time was a scot rutledge said carefully ive been told by a reliable witness that his name was robert burns the procurator was startled enough to tip his glass of sherry he swore under his breath as a golden river trickled onto the papers in front of him and he took out his handkerchief to stanch the flow the room smelled heavily of the richness of the wine and rutledge set his own glass down untouched that is as you may know my late sons name yes but there are i should think many men called robert burns to choose from rutledge replied where was this house you spoke of im told it was in the trossachs burns dropped the wet handkerchief into the paperfilled wastebasket at the side of his desk my son had a house in the trossachs not far from callander but i have never heard that he was acquainted with eleanor gray if i had i should have said something to inspector oliver and the chief constable furthermore my son was to be married ifif he survived the fighting he was not likely to be in the company of other women in london nor was he likely to bring them to his house rutledge said soothingly if she was a friend and in need he might whether he was the father of the child or not it offered a way out the fiscal seized it he would indeed have given what help he could but i cannot believe he would allow her to use his house it was his mothers house before we were married she had left it to him robert was close to his mother he would not have dishonored her memory he looked distastefully at the remainder of the sherry in his glass as if he blamed it for spilling besides which he said rather spoiling the lofty effect of his earlier words if there had been anyone living in the house i would have heard there is a neighbor who looks in on it from time to time has a key and all that i would most certainly have heard mrs raeburn is very particular hamish said aye if the neighbor is an auld biddy who would ha relished telling his father tales i canna think robert was sae foolish indeed rutledge said aloud answering both of them then he could have found another place for her to live until she was able to return to london if it was your son did he have an interest in piping he studied the pipes as a child but he didnt continue what has that to do with eleanor gray i recall someone telling me that this same officer was helpful in finding pipers to play for the wounded you neednt play the pipes to like them or to know pipers rutledge said nothing after a moment procuratorfiscal burns said what pray has any of this to do with the young woman in duncarrick if the gray woman came north in the spring she might have gone anywhere in scotland in the weeks following thats true of course but it is a beginning and im hopeful that well eventually trace miss gray to glencoe if thats where she died rutledge paused then said almost as an afterthought i dont suppose well ever know the name of the father of the child fiona macdonald has had in her keeping its a pity really hes a fine lad and if he had been mine and id died id have hoped my family would claim him in my place burns regarded him coldly and said nothing rutledge rose and then asked would you have any objections sir if i took the prisoner to the place where the bones in question were found theres no provision in the law for that no sir im well aware that there isnt all the same i need to find the truth about eleanor gray and what the link is between the two women in a prison cell its very easy for the accused to remain silent and stubborn faced with her victims grave she might well break down and confess it would save a good deal of trouble if she did i think the case as it stands would be difficult to prove in court nonsense its a very sound case indeed is it if i were her lawyer and clever i would make it very clear to the jury that while there is living proof of a child there has been no proof of murder and the jury might well agree with me there was a startled look in the blue eyes as if burns had never considered anything but a guilty verdict leaving rutledge was reminded that drummonds sister had insisted that the fiscal had been angry with fiona for refusing to cooperate with inspector oliver hamish said he didna want to hear his son was involved yes i know well that may be true he may not be involved or the fiscal may have been very good at concealing his own suspicions still i dont think the fiscal was protecting his son when he ordered fiona held for trial it would have been the wrong moveif i hadnt come across robert burnss name someone else might have no there was more behind the decision then turn it another way whats the use of a trial no to discover the childs name or parentage but to punish fiona for killing the mother to put the blame on someone for a womans death so that when the body is found it wont point a finger at the true killer the likes of the fiscal and the chief constable and their friends would protect their own making his way back to his motorcar rutledge shook his head no it cant be that but the fiscals an intelligent man and he should have said if someone is claiming my sons involved in this business i want you to look into it and then given me a list of people who knew the son well enough to tell me the truth but he didnt and thats whats odd as he bent to turn the crank rutledge added dont you see mckinstry is absolutely right the verdict on fiona macdonald is already in the next morning rutledge received by private messenger permission to take fiona macdonald to glencoe as long as they were accompanied by a matron and a constable it was not how he had wanted to go there he had thought of it as an expiation sitting in the fiscals office he had seen it too as an excuse for getting fiona out of that small dark cell and into the light a muddle of reasons none of them wise but the sooner he went the better before someone changed his mind he arranged for sandwiches in a basket to be packed for the journey and then went out to his motorcar to drive around to the police station oliver wasnt there pringle thought he had gone out the jedburgh road to look into a theft of a lorrys contents it seems pringle ended wryly that the driver fell asleep and ran off the road when he went to find help dragging the lorry out of the ditch someone helped himself to the contents instead pringle shrugged the drivers in a rage but inspector oliver isnt likely to be swayed by that we had an incident once before where a driver sold off part of the contents and then claimed hed been robbed inspector oliver has a long memory you dont make a fool of him twice rutledge found himself thinking of the skeleton discovered in the stables at the reivers oliver had gone on from that embarrassment to find the bones in glencoe rutledge thanked pringle and decided to drive out the jedburgh road himself but he had hardly reached the outskirts of duncarrick when his engine spluttered caught and then died swearing he got out to crank it again but nothing happened taking a look at the engineand attracting two young farm lads who came to peer over his shoulder at the mysteries under the bonnethe could see nothing wrong he asked one of the young men to hold the wire while he turned the crank and checked the spark it was clearly not that there was fresh petrol in the tank filled in jedburgh just the day before and he could see no indication that anyone had meddled with the car in the end rutledge commandeered a horse and cart to tow the vehicle with accompanying humor from the old farmer who didnt hold with infernal combustion back into duncarrick where it was left to the mercy of the mechanic at the smithy he wouldnt be traveling anywhere with fiona macdonald this day or tomorrow and who will be pleased to hear that hamish asked irony heavy in his voice the fiscal burns gave permission but grudgingly rutledge went back to the hotel and searched the space by the shed where he usually parked the motorcar a precaution he walked around the space examining the ground the dust had been scuffed but no clear footprints were visible except for his own the rear of the car had been in the shadows cast by the shed standing no more than ten feet away easy to crouch unseen there in the darkness late at night and take an ax to a tire if someone wanted to disable the car but the tires hadnt been touched and as far as rutledge could tell the engine hadnt been damaged either hed just driven the car hard for four days everyone in duncarrick knew whose car sat in the hotel yard day after day no one in his right mind would touch it unless hamish pointed out youve tread on toes rutledge walked to the police station and from constable pringle borrowed the key to the reivers again the inn wasnt likely to yield more information than it had but he wanted to go there on his own and be sure clarence the cat followed rutledge softfooted from room to room a silent white ghost at his heels as he took his time in each he couldnt have said when he started what it was he wanted here such a place as the reivers he thought was not made for the morning the echoes of the night would linger still in the airlaughter and voicessomeone singing offkeyand the smell of spilled beer and ale the reek of smoke would drift down the passages there would be an emptiness a loneliness as if the inn stood waiting for the doors to swing open again and new patrons to stride through them thirsty for a pint and the companionship that went with it now there werent even the echoes of the previous night the inn had stood empty long enough that the only smells stirred by his passage were of dust and old wood and in the kitchen the ashes of fires in the great stove hamish at his back noted the smokedarkened beams and the polished wood of the bar the windows with their starched curtains and the small pewter pots on each table that must often have held flowers the pretty handmade coverlets on the beds of each upstairs guest roomhardly a temptation to whoring the tidy row of hooks that held gardening tools in the small stoneflagged room off the kitchen the cupboard that held linens smelled faintly of lavender and rose petals the pantry was empty only a few tins of food standing like sentinels on the long shelves in the kitchen dishes were stored neatly in a huge wooden dresser great iron pots hanging within reach the sink dry where vegetables ought to be lying waiting to be scrubbed and cooked i could hae lived here hamish said wistfully and been at peace with her i wouldna ache for the highlands if she was here wi me i could rest easy rutledge tried to shut out the soft voice at his shoulder and listen for other ghosts that should dwell here ealasaid maccallum for one or the sounds of a small boy as he played with his cat or ran shouting from room to room with his threelegged stuffed horse or fionas presence as she went about her daily tasks but he couldnt find them especially he could not find fionas it was as if even the floors had been scrubbed clean of the imprint of her shoe to remove the last sign of her fiona had lived hereand put down no roots that he could see she had done her duty by her aunt had kept the inn alive and busy had nurtured a child there and let no one inside her heart not even the building that she called her home after a time to break the heavy silence that seemed to pervade the very walls he turned to the cat and knelt to pet her she reared her head under his hand her eyes mere slits and began to purr what would you have to tell me if you could speak he asked softly hmmm a voice said shes naught but a dumb animal man drummond fionas neighbor and guardian now of the child stepped into the room his presence startling the cat rutledge got to his feet as she disappeared behind the bar even hamish had not heard drummond coming but she has eyes doesnt she and no reason to lie i think its time that someone told me the truth rutledge invited theres no truth to tell what brings you here again im looking into the past to see whats hidden there that frightens so many people and yet he realized now that hed spent his time at the reivers trying to find a measure of fiona macdonald looking not for evidence but for the character of a woman who was as elusive as a wraith with no substance why then hadnt she sold up and left if she had not been happy eleanor grays words came back to him i could die hummph drummond was regarding him with dislike youre a stupid man then its not in the fiber of this building the past it never was why are you so certain of that do i have to tell the police their business then because the child wasnt born here was he thats where a sensible man would look wouldnt he where the child was born if he can discover it there was a glint of challenge in his eye as if hed offered rutledge an enigma ive already been there where he was born its a very ordinary clinic with a doctor too busy with his patients to care who they are im told it was a normal birth but the mother was very ill afterward appalled drummond stared at him and how by god did you discover any such thing its more than oliver ever didor wanted to do im a policeman its my job digesting the news drummond asked suspiciously where might this clinic be found rutledge smiled interested are you london carlisle york your choice angry drummond said i wont be taunted policeman or made fun of if you found the clinic you found a name to put to that child and to the childs mother is that true yes i was given a name it isnt one i know and where might she be found now on a hillside in the highlands bare bones with the corbies for company something had changed in drummonds face a tightness of the muscles under the eyes a tension along the jaw in her grave rutledge answered suddenly wary he could feel the powerful emotion building in drummonds bulk why did drummond care so much or if it wasnt thatif he wanted the information for another reason why the intensity he added carefully if you know whats best youll leave her there in her grave why it was a growl because shes safer there and the child as well which still leaves fiona macdonald in the hands of the hangman not yet why should it matter to you rutledge asked drummond glared at him in hot fierce silence ive met no one else in duncarrick save constable mckinstry who gives a tinkers curse for what becomes of her rutledge repeated why should you silence still rutledge added is it the tilt of her head when she listens to you or the smile in her eyes when she laughs the fury erupted ill rip the tongue from your head he lunged fast for such a big man his fist grazing rutledges cheek but rutledge had already stepped aside catching drummonds wrist as he went off balance turning to twist it high behind his back forcing him hard into the edge of the bar as momentum carried him forward drummond was breathing heavily well aware of the strength he possessed as he struggled against rutledges weightand nearly turning the tables rutledges fingers bit deeper into the mans wrist and he could feel the elbow strain no you listen to me drummond if fiona macdonald is going to live it will take more than you or i or anyone else can do to save her do you hear me shes doomed and that child will grow up in an orphanage believing what they tell him about her if he remembers her at all it will be with loathing drummond roared swearing to kill rutledge then help me damn you rutledge ended through clenched teeth he let the arm go and moved out of reach as drummond swung around like an angry bear his other fist just missing its mark ill help you to your grave touch me again and ill have you taken up for assault rutledge warned him and if youre in a cell your sister will be the only one left to care for that child will she want that responsibility he watched the battle behind the big mans eyes saw the furious desire to pound his fists into rutledges face saw the driving hunger to hurt dammedup anger too long restrained long stored needing release and then saw too the swift victory of clear reason that overcame the wrath rutledge tried another strategy look im sorry but i cant trust you if you wont trust me do you see that if i tell you whatever it is i believe i know how can i be sure that it wont reach the wrong ears what wrong ears drummond was hardly coherent as he added thickly theres a score to settle between us the time will come when it will be settled he brushed past rutledge and went out the door his breathing harsh and his anger still palpable the clump of his hobnailed boots echoed through the bar hamish breathing nearly as hard said it wasna clever to make him an enemy no it wasnt clever but i think it was useful he knows something that manor is afraid he knows something and it must be damning or he would have stepped forward in the beginning he lives next doorhe might have seen what he shouldnt rutledge shook his head whatever it is he wont be made to talk he found the cat carried her to the bedroom where he had seen the indentation on the pillow and set her there she curled herself around lay down and began to spin her purr a heavy sound in the silence fiona rutledge said the name aloud the cat turned and looked toward the door of the bedchamber ears pricking but there was no one on the stairs she went back to kneading the pillow her eyes half closed suddenly claustrophobic even in the large sunlit bedroom rutledge turned and left rutledge returned the inns key to mckinstry and went back to the ballantyne there was still a quarter of an hour before luncheon was served and he went up to his room opening the door his mind on drummond he stepped inside and then stopped the hackles on the back of his neck rising in warning he closed the door quietly behind him and stood there just inside the empty room hamish said its no the same someone had been here not the maid she had come and gone while he ate his breakfast even if shed returned with fresh towels or to close the windows his mind would have recorded that without thinking about it this was different and instinct told him it was not a friendly intrusion something below the level of conscious thought had pricked down his nerves the war had taught him to heed instinct he moved around the room carefully searching with his eyes but touching nothing whoever it was had been very thorough going through his belongings with painstaking attention to where each item had been before but heor shehad made certain that rutledge would know his privacy had been invaded his shirts in the drawer of the chest his shoes on the rack in the wardrobe the way his ties were folded each had been moved each had been put back very nearly where it had been but with just enough change to catch the eye of a man looking for change because the atmosphere had changed it was alien hostile drummond rutledge hadnt survived four years in the trenches without learning the skills of the hunterand developing the sixth sense that kept the hunted alive nothing had been taken he was sure of that the intent had been to show him his own vulnerability not to steal it was in a way a gauntlet thrown down and not as a challenge more a very coldly calculated threat i can touch youbut you cannot touch me it was the first mistake that had been made in what had beento this pointa very skillful game rutledge was joined at lunch by inspector oliver he made a circuit of the dining room greeting first this person and then another once stopping to listen to a man by the window and then laughing quietly as if he appreciated the humor of what had been said hamish said theres a man wi something on his mind finally arriving at rutledges table oliver pulled out the empty chair on the other side and signaled to the middleaged woman who was serving this noon she came over smiling and said would you like the menu then inspector thanks mary he nodded as she handed it to him then turned to rutledge and said affably whats that youve ordered the roast ham yes its quite good who are the people over therethe table by the fireplace he had seen the man out by the pele tower but his interest was in the womanhe had questioned her about fiona oliver peered in their direction thats sandy holden landowner had a horse farm now trying to get by with sheep hell make it a good man and the woman his wife of course madelyn holden she looks as if she might be ill lungs at a guess good god no she nearly died from the influenza last autumn hasnt got her strength back yet the doctor says it will come with time but sandy frets about her its been almost a year and shes no better shame really she was one of the finest horsewomen ive ever seen he turned to the menu its the ham then ortheres stew they put turnips in the stew here im fond of turnips he set the menu aside and added i hear you drove to winchester on this business or another on this business we found someone who remembered eleanor gray from her schooldays and had kept in touch until that is the spring of when eleanor was expected to spend a weekend at atwood house but she called mrs atwood at the last minute and said that she and a friend were driving to scotland instead ah oliver looked keenly at rutledge friend male or female an officer shed met some time before at least we think its the same man he had enough leave left to make the journey she came with him no one has seen or heard from her since as far as i can discover are you certain about the timing eleanor gray couldnt have borne the child in the spring he shook his head this mrs atwood has got it wrong i think i could die rutledge could hear mrs atwoods light voice repeating the words no she hadnt got it wrong eleanors mood had aroused her jealousy and later her guilt but he said aloud she needed a place of refuge for the next four or five months someone may have let her have the use of a house or flat i see what youre getting at if shed stayed on in london her little secret wouldnt have been a secret very long oliver gave the matter some thought the people by the window got up to leave distracting him he said i had wondered you know how a woman like that could spend dreary months in some outoftheway scottish village made no sense well i saw the house she grew up in it was a bloody palace a flat now in edinburgh or inverness thats more likely but surely it would have been easier to find someone in london to rid her of the child she was too well known in london she was too well known in medical circles particularly there are back streets where such things can be done discreetly at a price she might have feared blackmail then why not in glasgowedinburghcarlisle shed not have given her right name or her direction easy enough if shed had a mind for it such things went on in the war she wouldnt be the firstor the last rutledge thought of the clinic and dr wilson but said perhaps she wanted the child or at the very least wanted it to live and as soon as that was accomplished she walked away from it then youre saying that the accused had no need to kill the motherthe child was hers for the asking mary came to take olivers order and he settled for the stew yes it fits the timing then why hasnt she turned up since youre off the mark eleanor gray is dead and weve found her bones oliver leaned back in his chair and scanned the room without looking at rutledge he asked whats this i hear from the fiscal that you want to take the accused to glencoe he had finally got to the subject that had brought him here she knows the terrain far better than any of us do id like to confront her with her crime and watch what happens there were other reasons he had not let himself think of them her lawyer will tell you its not on then let him come as well a bloody circus hamish put in then im telling you its not on i see no purpose to be served oliver said angrily mckinstry came through the door to the dining room and stood scanning the tables until he saw oliver he crossed quickly to olivers side bent over and said quietly youd better come sir theres a message from the police in glencoe ill be there in a quarter of an hour damn it cant you see im in the middle of my lunch yes sir mckinstry straightened and started for the door oliver threw his serviette in his plate and got up swearing under his breath rutledge was finishing his flan he started to follow but oliver motioned him back into his chair no this is my end of things rutledge acknowledged his barely veiled order and stayed where he was it never paid to argue jurisdiction with the local man even when you were in the right hamish said hes no finished what was on his chest just as well rutledge retorted for an instant he thought he had spoken the words aloud ten minutes later oliver was back his face was grim theyve found something up the glen were on our way wheres your motorcar rutledge explained oliver nodded well youd better come along then youll want to hear whats said torn between duty and dread rutledge slowly got to his feet glencoe had a long and dark history the bloody massacre there on february had left its mark in the very ground and the great bulge of mountains that overshadowed the valley below seemed to hold a long and bitter memory in their barren rock macian of glencoe had failed to take his oath to the king william of orange by january of that year it wasnt his fault he had reached fort william in time but there he had been sent on to inveraray still a punishment was held to be in order campbell soldiers were quartered on the macdonalds the campbells had lived peacefully for twelve days in macdonald homes and eaten their bread and salt then without warning on that dark cold february night the soldiers had risen from their beds and slaughtered men women and children indiscriminately those who escaped died of cold and hunger and wounds in the bleak unforgiving hills and for the handful of survivors the name of campbell was ever after anathema as olivers motorcar passed loch leven and took the road south of the river that led into the heart of the glen rutledge could feel the press of time and anguish just as he felt hamishs unspoken grief he wished fervently that he hadnt come hed planned to drive here with fiona hed seen her as his shield against the glen but he knew now beyond question that it would have been wrong then just as it was wrong now even fiona couldnt protect him from the images in his own mind not far from here hamish had been born grew to manhood and went off to war this was land he knew so well he had described nearly every inch of it to rutledge the night before he died it wasnt imagination that peopled the great empty glen with memories it was the stored knowledge of a lifetime and the lasting voice of a soldier who had spoken softly in the candlelight but tellingly the noisy darkness around the small makeshift hut they sat in notwithstanding until rutledge could have recited each and every word in his dreams as the miles rolled behind them rutledge relived that night with such ferocity that he was back again in even as he saw every turn of the road after a fashion hamish had come home it was a long drive by the time they had reached the rendezvous point where an inspector macdougal was waiting for them oliver and mckinstry had fallen into weary silence and rutledge sharing the rear seat with hamish was racked by the tension it was not by any token an easy homecoming for either man rutledge had never expected to see and recognize landmarks that stood out now with such clarity nor had he expected to find here such a barrenness that in itself was beauty to someone who had seen it every day until the death of an obscure austrian archduke had tumbled the world into war glencoe was hauntingand haunted ahead where the unpaved road entered a narrow neck of the glen they could see a motorcar pulled off to one side under the frowning slopes a man climbed down from the drivers seat as they approached he was square with flamered hair and freckles so thick he seemed to be deeply tanned grinning at them he raised a hand and called as oliver slowed down have ye brought the entire force from duncarrick then oliver pulled his vehicle off the road behind the other motorcar raising a thick cloud of dust the only traffic they had seen for miles was a flock of sheep and several carts piled with cabbages and sacks of potatoes the road in either direction snaked yellow in the sun like a dry river solitary but not empty this place was never empty if you knew its history hamish who did was silent in the face of it rutledge thought if ever there was a place for the pipes it was here keening a lament on the wind and filling the valley with human sounds to shut out those no one could quite hear he forced himself to concentrate introductions out of the way macdougal went back to his own vehicle to open the door for the passenger he had brought with him she was no more than fourteen or fifteen wrapped against the chilly wind that was blowing down from the heights in a faded plaid shawl that reached her hips her skirts whipped and snapped about her ankles her hair in a bun was a mousy brown and youth was all that made her pretty but she faced the strangers as they were introduced in their turn and seemed to be collected for someone her age and this is betty lawlor the inspector ended right shall i begin or will you inspector oliver rutledge said before oliver could speak do you know the macdonalds up the glen he dredged his memory for a name and hamish supplied it kin of duncan macdonald who died in betty gave him a sour look aye i ken who they are are you friends then not friends no did you know duncans granddaughter fiona i did not well she was older my sisters age rutledge looked around him at the great expanse of emptiness i should think that neighbors here might look out for one another betty stared at him my ain grandfather was transported to australia for sheep stealing i havena any dealings with the macdonalds it was their sheep rutledge nodded oliver impatient said abruptly what did you find up there miss lawlor he pointed to the mountainside above them a great bulge of rock that seemed topheavy i was walking up there one day and saw something shining in the sunlight i picked it up it was this she extended a workworn hand and in the palm lay a small brooch rutledge and oliver stepped forward to look at it more closely it was oval with a single stone in the center and around it a circlet of smaller stones set like the petals of a flower on the back was a simple pin to hold it closed the color of the stones was a smoky brown smoky quartz a cairngorm hamish said it before oliver did a stone found in scotland and popular for jewelry in the hilt of a skean dhu in the froth of lace at the throat in eighteenthcentury portraits adorning the necks and fingers of ladies it was a symbol in its way of the highlands the setting was gold a dainty filigree a pretty thing and had probably been treasured once rutledge said may i and took the brooch to examine it more closely the stones well polished flashed in his hand the color was striking he turned the brooch this way and that to catch the light under the pin he noted that something had been engraved time had worn whatever it was to a blur see just there initials i think he pointed these out to oliver or a name i cant quite make them out working with the light and shadow he finally said theres an m possibly an aa dsurely thats an al oliver took the brooch and turned it back and forth himself then shook his head is that an m are you certain or an n he passed the brooch on to macdougal i looked at it earlier he confessed with a glass before i telephoned you its an m right enough he paused and then said with a glass you can read the whole of it macdonald mckinstry moved denial in the abrupt shift from one foot to the other in the ensuing silence macdougal handed the brooch back to betty lawlor her fingers closed over it until the knuckles were white how far from where the body was found would you say this came to light rutledge asked macdougal possibly a hundred feet downhill but it could have washed that far in the rains and melting snow after all if you take into account the fact that it was here for several years its not surprising at all he pointed above their heads again where scree had been brought down the rough face of the peak id say the brooch must have come from above theres no other explanation people dont walk just here its too uncertain most climbers follow that line over there he shifted to show them the preferred path and there he pointed across the road to the opposite slope its not impossible someone would be walking in our direction but id say the odds were strongly against it hamish said the cairngorm wasna scratched enough to ha washed that far rutledge turned to betty lawlor standing silently as they talked her eyes moving from face to face a selfcontained child how did it happen that you were up there she shrugged i walk all over this land always have helping with the sheep i doubt theres a foot of it i havena covered at some time or another but you never came upon the body that was found higher up i mightve if the sheep had gone that far up but generally they dont just there stupid beasts they are but not foolish he looked down at her shoes as she spoke thinking of her walking day after day over such rough terraina hard life for a child her shoes were new sturdy he could see the leather toes just peeking out at the hem of her gown the gown was a handmedown the shawl the same but her shoes were new even the edges of the soles hadnt been worn yet oliver said tell me what you told inspector macdougal when you brought in the brooch she looked at him directly shading her eyes with her hand it was nearly a year ago that i found it summer anyway i saw it in the sun it was the first day it hadna stormed in a week or more i didna like to think it might belong to to whoever it was they found up there it was pretty and i wanted to keep it but im afraid my father will find it and beat me for stealing so i went to inspector macdougal to ask him to set it right she broke off then asked anxiously you arent going to take it away are you you cant be sure its hers oliver said magnanimously im afraid it must be taken in evidence but when weve finished with it ill see that you have it back again his eyes switched to rutledges face he didnt have to put into words what was in both their minds this was the first direct link between fiona and the mountain between fiona and the bones that might be eleanor grays rutledge said nothing macdougal asked betty to take them to the place where she found the brooch and she turned to spring up the hillside like one of the sheep she watched out for strong for all her thinness and agile she seemed to fly oliver puffing in her wake swore under his breath but didnt ask her to slow down mckinstry turned back to stay with the vehicles rutledge was just behind her watching the new shoes watching her almost intuitive knowledge of where there was enough stability to place a foot she had learned from the sheep macdougal keeping pace but redfaced said fra the top are fine views i used to climb here as a lad with my brothers did you know the macdonalds rutledge asked him i knew one of thembrother of the accused id guess a good man he lost his legs and bled to death before they could get him back over the wire my brother died the same day machinegun fire i was luckyshot three times but nothing that kept me from going back there was a quiet irony in his voice they had come some distance cutting diagonally across the mountains face slipping and sliding here or there and betty had begun to look around as if trying to find landmarks finally she paused and pointed to an area that was perhaps ten feet square about here id guess she told them it was a rocky slope that seemed to be no different from any of its neighbors for a hundred yards in any direction why are you so sure oliver demanded mopping his face with a large handkerchief i cant see any difference between this patch and that oneor that one over there see for yoursel i can match that spot just above us with that one across the way she pointed to the great bare face opposite and following her finger they identified a small outcropping of rock if you looked rutledge thought you could find your way easily but it was always a matter of seeing to the uninitiated this was barren ground above their heads another tumbled mass of rock stood out against the sky following his gaze macdougal said it was there we found the remains in a slight crevice where water has brought down the supporting scree and left a hollow he paused then said youd have to know it was there the hollow it isnt visible from the road in short no one would think to leave a body there who didnt have some familiarity with these mountains want to climb up macdougal asked rutledge nodded and they walked on picking their way carefully it was hot here in the sun and feet unused to this terrain found it difficult to know where to step with any certainty carrying a body hamish pointed out would not be easy and for a woman very nearly impossible unless the corpse was dragged on a rope and there was no one to see such a long laborious effort from where he stood rutledge could look down at the two motorcars oliver standing talking to betty lawlor and a ruined croft some distance away in the far distance he saw sheep but no one with them hard place for a woman to carry a dead weight macdougal said as if reading his thoughts but if that brooch belongs to the deceased it means shes not your missing woman eleanor gray and if it belonged to the murderer then we have her in custody rutledge finished for him they had reached the outcropping where three heavy rocks were lying in a heap not so large by the standards of these mountains but beyond a mans strength to tumble together so tidily and where the smaller fragments had washed out from under there was indeed a crevice put a body here in april and it might be found but put it here before the weather turns and the autumn storms begin and it would still be here in the spring what was left rutledge squatted on his heels macdougal said you wont find anything we were verra thorough i expect you were rutledge said evenly i was just thinking that this was a perfect place for bones what makes you so certain that the body was not here before condition for one thing and i talked to all the families who run sheep they were certain it wasna here in the summer a fox or dog had chewed the shoes and what bits of clothing we found werent of any use first thought was that wed found a climber people climb here who havena the sense of a beetle they canna believe on a fine day like this one that the mists can come in sae fast youre lost before you take ten steps and she was doubled up as if trying to keep warm loose stones had washed around and over her doubled how head on knees arms around them made the body smaller kept heat in the middle the bones were still in a huddle like the doctor found no injuries but thats no to say she hadna turned her ankle or twisted her knee hamish said doubled oer shed fit behind the seat of a car out of sight rutledge said if she was already dead rigor had passed aye thats right or hadna set in the birds and foxes must have stripped the body in a matter of days we couldnt find one hand or the best part of a foot other bones had been pulled apart to get at the meat the skull had rolled into her lap macdougal sighed weve had a walker or two lost in these parts but we always ken how they got into the glen theyd be seen and reported one left a bicycle another begged a lift on a crofters wagon with this one theres no way of establishing whenor howshe came to be here we dont know the question to ask do we and its possible she came over the top from the other side whats your opinion of the engraving on the brooch i have none it spells out macdonald and thats your patch is it no macdougal grinned then shrugged it could hae come from the dead womans clothing if she was murdered and dragged up here climbers dont wear much jewelry as a rule or it came from the murderers trying to drag up that corpse we do na have welldressed middleclass women promenading up this mountainside losing the odd brooch or two the center stone of the brooch isnt scratched enough to have been washing down a mountainside since yes i ken what youre suggesting still if it lodged somewhere for a time then came down in the rains betty spoke of it might not have tumbled about all that much ififif investigations were made and lost on ifs well have to take the brooch back with us oliver will give a receipt to betty its a valuable piece to her macdougal agreed im surprised she brought it to me in the first place but her fathers a devil when hes drunk if he found she had such a thing hed beat her for stealing it and use that as an excuse to take it from her she was probably counting on me to speak up for her if that happened betty spends the summer wi the sheep as far away from him as she can get ive seen her out here in all weathers a small figure with naething but a dog for companionship rutledge got to his feet and looked around this was a very beautiful valleyand very bleak wild was the word most often used to describe it he thought about the february night when the massacre had begun and how the soldiers had run through the darkness with torches searching for those who had fled driven by blood lust a nightmarish way to die is there any other hamish asked quietly rutledge shivered in the warm sun did you come here he asked hamish silently you and fiona when there was no work to be done on the farm aye we came with horses sometimes we climbed or wed find a place out of the wind and eat the bannocks wed brought wi us she liked the glen the silence but for the wind and the closeness to her kin macdougal was asking if rutledge had seen enough he nodded and they started back down slipping once or twice the lawlor girl what sort of family does she come from aside from the drunken father poor enough shes the middle girl they work hard and go hungry sometimes ive no doubt why didnt she bide her time and quietly sell the brooch for whatever it might bring even a little money would allow her to escape from the glen and her father and her poverty shes too young macdougal said simply in another year or two she might have thats why she wants it back if you take it shes locked into this life there wont be other brooches waiting for sharp eyes to pick them out joining oliver and betty lawlor they descended to the road oliver bent to brush off his trousers where the cuffs had collected a fine pattern of dust rutledge said to the girl ive been admiring your shoes there was a flare of fear in betty lawlors eyes then she said defiantly i earned the money for them it was a silent journey back to duncarrick mckinstry was wretchedly weighing the damage the brooch would do to fiona macdonalds case rutledge in the rear seat could see the fine lines around his eyes as if his head ached but he drove with skill and attention to the road wherever his mind was oliver on the other hand was a satisfied man his investigation had borne fruit and he could see the end of it now there was a smugness in his face and from time to time his head dropped to his chest relaxed into sleep rutledge remembering betty lawlors face when oliver had offered her a scrap of paper in exchange for the brooch wondered if she could read fiona macdonalds lawyer could argue that the brooch was found in a part of scotland where the macdonald clan had lived for centuries the brooch might well have belonged to any one of them but a jury could find it damning evidence the three men stopped for the night in lanark finding a small hotel where they were served a dinner of mutton soup with barley and a roast chicken oliver fidgety and eager to be back in duncarrick called it an early night mckinstry poor company at best excused himself as well when they had disappeared up the stairs rutledge went out for a walk relieved to be out of the glen relieved to be aloneexcept for hamish the night was clear though cool and the smell of wood smoke followed him out of the hotel he was restless thinking of wilson and the clinic thinking of the brooch and betty lawlors new shoes thinking of fiona the town was tranquil lights shining from windows in the houses along side streets shop fronts dark a pub noisy with singing and laughter a dog scavenging in an alley several men passed him and then a couple arm in arm intent on their soft conversation and the sound of a carriage echoed down the main street he could see the stars overhead and the first threads of clouds winding among them hamish hadnt relished the journey to the glen and it had awakened memories that rutledge had convinced himself he was beginning to forget instead scotland had revived them with a vengeance he had been right not to want to come here wishful thinking that time might healit seldom healed anything only making scars that were often tender to the touch and ugly without knowing how he got there he found himself outside the local police station he had come here the last time he was in lanark asking for information about private clinics and hospitals the constable on duty had sent him to dr wilson he stopped looking up at the lamp above the door his mind not really taking in his surroundings cook maude or mary two names a woman in brae a woman in the private clinic here separated by a matter of miles he went up the steps and through the door the sergeant on duty a bluff man growing stout with years looked up and said what might i do for you sir inspector rutledge scotland yard i need some information are you here on official business the sergeant asked warily someone was banging a metal cup against the bars of a cell the clanging echoing through the building like a berserk offkey bell the sergeant appeared not to notice the racket indirectly ive been trying to trace several families what can you tell me about anyone by the name of cook living in or around lanark in late summer at a guess theres a number of cooks mostly from loch lomondside tell me what theyve done and ill tell you what matches as far as i know theyve done nothing were searching for a missing woman she called herself mary cook or possibly even maude cook theres some indication she was in lanark in for a period of several weeks after that we seem to have lost track of her the sergeant nodded before the war i could have given you the history of nearly every family in lanark and a good bit of the countryside around it its harder now even a small town like lanark has seen its changes but i dont recall a woman by either name going missing it was you said he gave the matter some thought an inheritance involved is there possibly we wont know until we find her my guess is theres nothing here for you unless someone reported her missing wed have no record of her a constable came in from his rounds nodded to the sergeant and went through a door on the far left still if you come back in the morning ill have it nailed down i wouldnt raise my hopes too high if i were youbut ill look into it fair enough rutledge took out a card and wrote the number of the ballantyne hotel on it you can find me there tomorrow night id appreciate any help you can give me the sergeant grinned duncarrick thats inspector olivers turf good man oliver i worked with him on a case in a series of murders that were never solved took it hard he did in lanark no duncarrick five women found with their throats cut there was a scrap of paper pinned to each of the corpses right over their breasts called them whores harlots they werent of course just young pretty in a way lively workingclass women the bodies were found over a matter of months but always on the same day of the month odd business had duncarrick in a sweat i can tell you but the killer must have moved on we never caught him what was the reaction of the public to the accusations on those pieces of paper what youd expectwhere theres smoke theres bound to be fire unfair but the belief was that such things didnt happen to nice women rutledge said can you recall any other details thats the whole of it two were servant girls one was a scullery maid at the ballantyne and the other two worked on outlying farms clever bastard left no evidence behind none we could use at any rate just words on a scrap of paper and the bodies out on the western road back on the pavement outside the station rutledge listened to hamish savagely drawing conclusions of his own the five dead women had no connection with fiona macdonald she had been in glencoe in a young girl living with her grandfather all the same their deaths had paved the way for her persecution whore was a charge that the good people of duncarrick already associated with murder by the time rutledge reached duncarrick the next day there was a message waiting from sergeant bowers in lanark no one by either name shown as missing in the year in question the only mary cook living in the district is sixty there is no record of a maude cook sorry it had been a long shot but hed already taken the advice bowers had given him he hadnt raised his hopes fionas lawyer was summoned to duncarrick and the brooch was shown to him he was a dyspeptic man with lines incised deeply in a dark face even his eyebrows thick and wiry seemed to be set in a permanent frown his name was armstrong and he seemed more english than scottish hamish took an instant dislike to him and said so clearly i wouldna have him defend my dog rutledge winced oliver was inquiring after someone in jedburgh who was an acquaintance and armstrong responded with unconcealed relish not likely to last the month out id say the cancer is spreading too fast youd be advised to visit if you want to find him coherent now whats this nonsense about a brooch found on a mountainside oliver took it out of his desk drawer and passed it to armstrong the lawyer examined it with care squinting at it through spectacles he strung across his nose theres an inscription you say with the nib of his pen oliver pointed it out macdonald he rummaged in his desk drawer and came up with a large magnifying glass see for yourself armstrong studied the back of the brooch for some time macdonald is a common name in the highlands and how do we know that the name wasnt put there by someone other than my client well of course it was put there by someone else oliver was losing patience he had found exactly what he wanted and he would brook no opposition to the conclusions hed drawn from it the engraver i meant said armstrong looking up at him with a sour expression that the name could have been engraved on the back just before the brooch was put where it might be found to please the police oliver held on to his temper and said which is exactly why you are here we want to show it to the accused and ask her its history ah yes armstrong handed back the glass and took off his spectacles but he held on to the brooch i dont think i can allow that her answer might be selfincriminating i should hope it might be oliver retorted through clenched teeth thats the intention of the police to prove her guilt its no the place of a policeman to worry his head about innocence hamish said nor the church either you may show it to her armstrong answered after letting oliver stew for several minutes as he looked at the brooch with concentrated attention but i will not allow you to badger her do you understand oliver got to his feet and retrieved the key from behind his desk youd better come as well rutledge she might have something to say about the dead woman they walked back to the cell and oliver unlocked the door as it swung open fiona rose from her chair to face them she looked at the three men then her eyes swung back to rutledges he could read the silent message she had sent him what has happened armstrong went up to her and took her hand with unctuous courtesy rubbing his thumb across her knuckles theres nothing to fear my girl the police want to ask if this object belongs to you please answer that question and that question only he opened his palm and the dim light in the cell caught the brightness of the gold but left the smoky stone dark fiona stared at it its my mothers brooch not yours then no i armstrong cut her short there you are inspector it does not belong to the accused but oliver could read faces too he could see clearly that while the brooch had belonged to fionas mother at some time it had been in her possession is your mother alive he asked already knowing the answer to that she died when i was very young do you remember her no a shadowy figure someone with a sweet voice and soft hands i think i remember that then you were too young to be given the brooch she glanced at armstrong i was too young yes who took charge of it at her death my grandfather must have done there was no one else is your grandfather still living he died in and you were the only daughter of the house i was your mothers brooch would by right pass to you not to your brothers fiona nodded hamish said the conclusion is plain the brooch must have come into her possession in a year before the body was left up the glen theyve damned her now but armstrong had nothing to say in her defense there was a gleam of triumph in olivers eye ill have that brooch now mr armstrong if you please armstrong passed it over to him then rubbed his palms together as if to rid them of the feel of it fiona opened her mouth was on the verge of speaking and caught instead the swift but barely perceptible shake of rutledges head she closed her mouth and looked down at her hands clenched together now at her waist as if hed heard the unvoiced question oliver answered it this is evidence now thank you miss macdonald oliver turned on his heel and went out of the cell followed by armstrong fiona looked quickly at rutledge but he said nothing turning his back with the other men and leaving her alone but before the door closed finally she saw him look over his shoulder and smile reassuringly it was a reassurance he did not feel after armstrong had taken his leave oliver waited until he had heard the outer door close behind the lawyer and then said to rutledge sit down rutledge went back to the chair he had vacated to shake hands with the departing armstrong he knew what was coming oliver was saying look in my view we have all we need to proceed to trial this brooch is the connection we didnt have beforeit provides a link between the woman macdougal had found up the glen last year and the accused and it will see her hang theres no reason i can think of for going back to glencoe with her i think youll agree to that the thought of facing the ghosts of glencoe again even with fiona turned rutledges blood cold but he said neutrally we cant be sure weve identified the corpse theres no proof yet that she ever bore a child but theres proof that the accused never bore one if the accused didnt conceal the body there who did why was her brooch found so close to the makeshift grave not a strangers brooch mind you but one with her familys name on it rutledge said with infinite care still its circumstantialarmstrong could make the point that she had lived hard by the glen hamish said but he wont he doesna care enough in the silence oliver stood up and went to the single window its glass was dingyno one had washed it in years but he stood there with his back to rutledge apparently looking out on the street and went on what you do to satisfy lady maude is your business fiona macdonald is the only person who can tell me if the woman shes accused of killing is eleanor gray i doubt she ever will shes likely to go to her grave with that secret it was the one point they saw eye to eye on id like to talk to her now that shes seen the brooch feeling expansively generous oliver said go ahead ill give you as long as you need he turned from the window picked the key ring up from his desk and passed it to rutledge and he repeated as long as you need but there was a final ring to it now thanks rutledge took the ring and walked down the hall again hamish said oliver willna find it so easy to dismiss lady maude the yard willna either rutledge answered but lady maude doesnt want to hear the truth about her daughter she never has as far as he could tell fiona macdonald had not moved from where she had been standing when the three men had walked out of her cell a quarter of an hour earlier he closed the wooden door and stood with his back to it she said almost at once why did they take my mothers brooch youre sure it belonged to your mother yes of course im sure my grandfather let me wear it on her birthday to remember her all day i could wear it pinned to my dress and i was always very careful very proud i felt close to her he could see the small child dressed in her best clothes gingerly moving about the house so as not to tear her skirts or soil her sleeves and the grandfather still mourning his dead daughter in his own fashion instilling into fiona the feeling that her mother was nearif only for this one day each year it was in its way a very sad picture where did you keep it after you moved to duncarrick its in a small sandalwood box with the bracelet hamish gave me and the onyx studs that belonged to my father or it waswhy did they go through my things and take my mothers pin there was anguish in her face did you have the brooch with you in brae yes of course i had it in brae you can ask mrs davison and it came to duncarrick with you yes i told you it iswaskept in the tall chest in my room at the reivers in the second drawer i didnt wear it often i was afraid i might lose it working in the bar rutledge said can you think of anyone in duncarrick who might have seen you wear the brooch within the past year constable mckinstry for one she considered his question then took a deep breath i remember now the last time i wore it on my mothers birthday in june of this year yes and again in early july when i attended church will that do she read the answer in his face but it was there i swear it was there when i was arrested but you cant be sure ino i had no reason to look for it i wouldnt have brought it here no he considered how much to tell her about how and where the brooch was found then said instead how could you be so certain it was your mothers brooch it has to bemy father had it made up as his wedding gift to her there couldnt be another like it you didnt need to read the inscription on the back what inscription theres a name macdonald just under the pin she frowned are you trying to trick me why should i because theres no inscription on the brooch there never was there are six people who could tell you the name is engraved there im one of them frightened fiona said will you take me to the inn please will you let me go there and see for myself it has to be there oliver wont let you go but ill look youre sure that its kept in the sandalwood box her face answered him then ill bring the box to you he told her unopened he turned and went out the door locking it behind him and then pocketing the key oliver looked up as rutledge came down the passage he said finished no i need to fetch my notes id like to read mrs atwoods statement to miss macdonald suit yourself rutledge went out the station door and walked briskly in the direction of the hotel damn he had forgotten that his motorcar was not there he reached the reivers out of breath from the brisk pace hed set himself please god drummond is at home he has the other key rutledge knocked at the door of drummonds house and to his relief saw that his quarry was there come outside i need to speak to you what about drummond demanded not moving from the doorway come outside i tell you unless youre willing to shout to the world what this is about a clear reference to his sister reluctantly drummond obeyed look i need to go to the inn and search again i want a witness there when i do and i dont want that witness to be a policeman or someone who is unfriendly to miss macdonald will you help me will you unlock the door and come with me i wont dont be a bloody fool i need to get into that inn times short ask inspector oliver to lend you his key drummond read the answer in rutledges face and it seemed to persuade him all right then if its a trick ill kill you with my bare hands its not a trick they walked quickly to the inn and drummond took out his key unlocking the door he blocked the way tell me where upstairs in the wing the family used fionas room drummond grunted and led the way clarence came to greet them stretching and yawning broadly drummond ignored the cat and stopped on the threshold of fionas bedroom im waiting rutledge said the tall bureau go to it and open the second drawer from the top go on man this is no time to be fussy about such things drummond reluctantly crossed the room to the chest and then pulled open the second drawer from the top i wont touch her things no you shouldnt have to theres a small sandalwood box there do you see it probably the color of honey now perhaps a little darker just a small wooden box drummond grunted i dont see it look man with a rough forefinger drummond pushed at the contents of the drawer its here then take it out take it over to the bed drummond did as he was told the box was no more than six inches long four wide and perhaps not quite four deep the color of the wood was a dark amber all right open it i dont want to see the contents but tell me if you will what is inside he could hear the little silvery sound of things falling onto the coverlet of the bed trinkets drummond said name them rutledge could feel his heart beating and hear the clamor from hamish as drummond pawed among fionas jewelry theres a bracelet here are studs onyx from the look of them a small teething hoop silver at a guessits tarnished a ring or two heres a brooch and thats the lot rutledge could feel his heart stop describe it the brooch im not one to describe a womans gewgaws damn it tell me what it looks like its gold three strands twisted into three circles like loops theres a small stone in the center a pearl ive seen ealasaid wear that of a sunday and thats all he was breathing again thats the lot i told you then put it all back into the box and close the lid whats this in aid of i cant tell you if youd found what i had hoped was there it could have saved fiona from the hangman now he put the box that drummond gave him into his pocket and went to shut the drawer in the chest drummond said i wont have you taking her belongings im taking them to her ill bring them back shortly she wants to know if her mothers brooch is still there but thats ealasaids brooch yes rutledge said as he led the way down the stairs and it isnt enough twenty minutes later rutledge was back at the police station oliver wasnt there but pringle was rutledge explained what he wanted and was allowed to go alone to the cell when he was sure that the door was firmly closed behind him he reached into his pocket and pulled out the sandalwood box fiona took it with trembling fingers then smiled at him over the lid as she lifted it its so good to touch my own things again even if its for just a little while i hate wearing these dresses dreary and plain as this room they are enough to make the angels despair she went to the narrow bed and poured out the contents just as drummond had done then gently sorted through them and saw that her mothers brooch was not there she turned and stared at him unsure what to say theres a brooch in the box he said just as you told me there would be it isnt my mothers it belonged to ealasaid id forgotten it was there did you deliberately lie to me fiona or have you told me halftruths from the start her face flushed and she bit her lip i havent lied i have only refused to tell you secrets that arent mine then what has become of your mothers brooch how did it come to be found miles from duncarrick over a year ago i dont know it was here in this box i will swear to that on my grandfathers soul he wanted to believe her hamish told him to believe her can you trust drummond would he have stolen anything from youwould he have considered the brooch fair payment for the care of the child then sold it nohe wouldnt do anything of the sort does he owe loyalty to anyone else would he have taken the brooch and given it to someone else not realizing that it might be used to incriminate you no no i cant believe he would do such a thing not drummond his sister then could she take the key when he wasnt looking and use itor allow someone else to use it she hesitated no she wouldnt dare no are you very sure fiona rutledge asked the brooch is gone after all when you had told me you believed it was still in the box fiona turned away and began to gather up the things on the bed her fingers lingering over them as she felt the pull of memory im sure then someone else may have taken it can you think who that might be a cleaning woman a patron when he thought your back was turned or someone who might want a souvenir of the wicked harlot theres no one else with a key except for the police the police but rutledge standing there facing her was sure that the police had not had anything to do with the missing brooch except to retrieve it from a young girl who wanted a better life than she had had rutledge sat down in the chair watching fiona while she paced the box clasped tightly in her hands restless and uncertain she asked him several times to tell her why the brooch was important but he couldnt instead he said youd better give the box back to me i dont want oliver to see that you have it why not reluctantly fiona brought it to him and he put it in his pocket because my dear girl ive got to work with oliver and i dont need to have him furious with me for interfering in his investigation but you seem to be the key to mine she said nothing he went on do you know a mrs atwood no at least i dont remember having heard the name what about robert burns hes a poethe lived near ayr no a person you might have met she thought about it i recall someone saying that the fiscal lost his son in the war i dont remember whether his name was robert ive been searching for a woman called eleanor gray she may or may not be the person youre accused of killing the bones that were found in glencoe eleanor grays been missing since she had a quarrel with her mother overmoney and just after that she was supposed to spend a weekend near winchester with a friend mrs atwood instead she came to scotland with a man possibly a friend of this robert burns who may or may not be the fiscals son fiona smiled may or may not bepossibly a friend supposed to spend the weekend hamish said you were a clever policeman it was the first glimpse of natural humor hed seen lighting her face from within lighting her eyes yes sometimes i wonder myself he said returning the smile the odd thing about eleanor gray is that no one appears to have cared for her ann tait knew of herand envied her mrs atwood was jealous of her her mother saw to it that she couldnt pursue medicine which was eleanors passionate interest she may have died in and the only person who has tried to find her was a solicitor who wanted her to sign papers relating to her inheritance you are accused of killing herand yet you dont know her and thats true she was serious again resuming her pacing why should i choose a woman at random kill her and take her child a stranger i knew nothing about it makes sense to the police because theyre men they believe that because i wanted a child i wouldnt care who or what it was their response would be you knew eleanor gray was alone and in hiding the perfect choice there was no one to come looking for her to learn that much about her surely id have learned her name as well i dont know how people behave in france or canada in scotland we dont confide in strangers perhaps you met her as someone else using another name he paused mrs cook she went so white that her knees buckled and he sprang from his chair to catch her as she fell carrying her to the bed he laid her gently on the rough surface of the blanket fiona her eyelids fluttered then shut her voice when she spoke trembled i dont know a mrs cook yes you do he said pulling the chair closer to the bed you know precisely who she is she gave birth in lanark to the child you called ian hamish macleod ive spoken to her physician his name is wilson i know that she had a hard birth and a very difficult recovery i know too that it will be impossible for her to bear other children he stopped then added the last bit of information that sealed his certainty you told your aunt you were expected to work out your notice at mrs davisons but you didnt you explained to her why you were being sent forthat your aunt in duncarrick was illand mrs davison a compassionate woman released you immediately she cared enough about you to make it easier for you to leave her family and so there was nearly a month between the time you promised to come to duncarrick with your child and the time you arrived here you spent that time somewhere with the boy and his mother but you lied to your aunt you lied to mrs davison for all i know you have lied to mrs cook but you cant lie to me fiona i know too much she reached out and caught his hands please i dont know a mrs cook this woman youve just told me about she has nothing to do with me or with my child you mustnt there is no need to search for her because she doesnt exist her face was earnest now her eyes wide it was eleanor gray i killed i will swear to it bring my barrister to meinspector oliverthe fiscal in front of them i will tell you everything that happened i didnt mean to kill heri didnt want to kill her but she told me i could have ian and then she changed her mind i loved him id held him i wanted him and so when she said she intended to take him after all i pulled the pillows out from under her head and i held them over her face until she stopped struggling and then i dragged her to the head of the stairs and she broke off crying her tears hot against his hands oh please i killed eleanor gray please go back to london and leave me to die in peace fiona listen to me no ive listened long enough i want you to bring inspector oliver to me and mr armstrong pleasei dont want to talk about it anymore if you killed eleanor gray what did you do with her body i buried it in a field somewhere along the road it was dark and i couldnt see to dig and there was a dog barking somewhere and i was so frightened then ian began to cry and i shut my ears and kept digging until i could roll her into the hole id made someone had piled branches and tree limbs nearby ready for burning i pulled them over the raw grave and left them there it was at the edge of a field near a wall where no one would plow youre lying no im telling the truth at lastmr elliot said to me that confession would free my soul and it hasim ready to die i want to die it took rutledge nearly ten minutes to stop fionas tears and make her listen to him shaking her lightly he forced her to look at his face her eyes rimmed red from crying were the saddest hed ever seen dark pools of anguish in her white face he wanted to hold her and comfort her instead he said fiona if you confess to murder there is nothing i can do to save you do you understand that you will be hanged with joy and thanksgiving in duncarrick if i swear that i wont speak mrs cooks name again will you promise me to say nothing to oliver or armstrong nothing she said wearily im tired i want this to end i dont want to remember hamish and i dont want to think about ian and i cant bear she stopped shaking her head it will only be for a short time i have to search for eleanor gray do you understand that and if i find her you wont have to tell anyone about mrs cook will you trust me a little longer after a moment she said i dont want to trust you i dont want to see you again if you wont do it for me then for your grandfather and hamish they are dead id rather be dead with them it hurts too much to live then she pushed him away and said very well then as long as you keep your promise i shall keep mine but i havent the strength to sit here in this silence alone and afraid much longer if i am going to die i want to do it before i disgrace myself she caught her breath on a sob courage is elusive in the dark of the night he stood up she seemed very small and helpless he knew how confinement shredded the soul but he had seen her strength and he was touched by it ill send word as soon as i can through mckinstry you can trust him hes yes i trust him rutledge took a handkerchief from his pocket and held it out to her she took it gratefully he walked to the door wanting to say something to offer her courage or to tell her shed be safe but he didnt turn and fiona macdonald didnt stop him as he left leaving the cell key with pringle rutledge went to the reivers summoning drummond en route to unlock the door again rutledge took the stairs two at a time intent on restoring the sandalwood box to fionas room drummond lumbered after him far lighter on his feet than a man his size ought to be i did what you asked now you owe me an explanation he said at rutledges heels rutledge set the box in the drawer carefully arranging it among the gloves and the handkerchiefs then he turned to drummond with his answer ready the man was blocking the doorway clarence half rising from the pillow on the bed looked at both of them with wary eyes a sudden move and she would be gone out of sight something belonging to fiona macdonald has been found near the place where oliver thinks the body of the childs mother was hidden in glencoe fiona told me it was safe here at the reivers but she was wrong he let out a breath in frustration oliver has all he needs now to convict are you telling me something has been stolen from here the police at the scene think the murderer dropped it while trying to drag the womans body high up the slope on a mountainside a sheepmans daughter found it i dont know what to believe i have the only other key and it was given me by ealasaid maccallum herself fiona handed hers to oliver when they took her away are you calling me a thief drummonds voice was dangerously quiet no damn it im saying that what was found in glencoe is enough to hang fiona macdonald however it came to be there and if shes right that it was here in duncarrick in july then someone must have come in here secretly and taken it fiona doesnt lie ive never known her to lie she lied about the child drummond gestured angrily and clarence fled over the side of the bed in a single fluid movement thats not the same thing you know it isnt the same rutledge started toward the door drummond i have to leave duncarrick for a time keep an eye on the inn it wouldnt do for moreevidenceto find its way to oliver hamish warned its a thin line youre walking theres no way to know where his loyalties lie rutledge responded silently call it the biblical casting of bread upon the waters i need to find out if hes friend or foe he has custody of that child drummond let him pass as they went down the stairs rutledge said over his shoulder if i can put a name and a history to the bones in glencoe i will thats the only way to break the chains tying fiona macdonald to murder when rutledge arrived at the smithy he found that the motorcar was repaired and ready to drive the young mechanic came out of the small shed where he worked rubbing his black greasy hands on a greasier square of cloth grinning he beckoned to rutledge come look at something im not sure i want to rutledge answered following him whats wrong with my engine but the mechanic said nothing when he got to a workmans bench full of tools and parts and a jumble of odds and ends he reached for a grimy jar that was sitting behind a coil of rope holding up the jar he said to rutledge now take a look the jar was full of petrol except at the bottom where a layer of something else moved less sluggishly water rutledge said surprised there was water in my tank when all else fails the mechanic said happily expect the impossible yes indeed ordinary water stopped you as efficiently as an artillery shell and with greater accuracy i might add i drained off the lines let the jars contents settle and there you have it a mechanical marvel he put the jar back on the bench been swimming in that motorcar have you rutledge paid the inflated bill without comment as they drove out of the smithys yard hamish said this meddling with the car was no the same as searching your room and if theres anyone who will ken where to look for whoever is responsible its yon constable if it was mischief rutledge responded then the timing was remarkably opportune i dont like coincidence mckinstry was coming out of the barbershop when rutledge spotted him and offered him a lift as far as his house in response to rutledges question about malicious property damage the constable shook his head we dont see much of that too easy in a town this size to guess who the culprits are likely to be the maxwell brats now theyre a wild lot and its only a matter of time before their mischief turns to something more serious the army might make men out of them but their father never willtoo quick with his fists he added with curiosity evident in his face any particular reason for your interest i wondered about it thats all it wasnt mischief that lay behind the notes written about fiona if thats what youre getting at not at all rutledge changed the subject it wasnt until hed dropped mckinstry at his door that hamish said he didna speak of the brooch to you no rutledge answered he doesnt want to accept what it means for that matter neither do i if no one took it from the reivers he left the thought unfinished hamish told him she didna kill but the woman in the back room of the police station was not the same girl that hamish remembered haying in the summer of the sun warm on her face and laughter in her eyes the day war had begun in a small town in an obscure province of the austrian empire hamish had carried that memory with him to the trenches time stood still for him it had moved on for her in five years people can change leaving his car at the hotel this time in the open rather than in the shadows of the shed rutledge went to the shop owned by ann tait she was folding lingerie into pale lavender paper and a box stood ready at her elbow lifting the paper she laid it gently into the box and arranged it a little to make it fit snugly then she put the lid on the box and set it aside before turning to rutledge have you found your eleanor gray not yet but i shall no ive come about another matter i was speaking with a mrs cook i cant recall her first name shed stopped me on the street a few days ago now i must try to find her again can you help me ann tait looked at him consideringly as far as i know there isnt a mrs cook in duncarrick at any rate she isnt among my customers there was a woman by that name i met in london she was elderly and impossible i didnt like her well then he said helplessly who was i speaking with was this a large woman overbearing in her manner he smiled as if relieved in fact he was yes im afraid so that was mrs coldthwaite yes thats it coldthwaite im grateful orshould i be ann tait nodded sympathetically wretched woman she comes in and tries on corsets half her size then complains to me that my stock is illmade youll find her in the gabled house next but one to the bakers shop and i wish you joy of her outside on the street again hamish was roundly telling him that he had already broken his promise no i havent its no a name you can use with impunity here i have a feeling ann tait wont repeat it to anyone all the same he paid a call on mrs coldthwaite and paid the price for it once she had him in her parlor her sole intent was to pry out of him whatever tidbits of potential gossip she could pass on it was done graciously in the name of concern for dear fiona but her eyes were cold and her mouth small tight a wretched woman ann tait had called her hamish preferred vicious she did unintentionally give rutledge one piece of information he had not heard the question was should he treat it as dependable wemy husband and iwere at a lovely dinner party in jedburgh a week ago the chief constable mr robson and the fiscal mr burns were there too and i distinctly heard mr burns saying to mr robson that many of fiona macdonalds sins would never come to light we shall try her for murder and leave the other unpleasant facets of her character for god to judge and when someonemr holden i believe it wasasked mr robson what was to be done with the child once the trial was over mr robson answered mr elliot has spoken with an orphanage in glasgow that trains children in various trades he will go there if the victims family doesnt care to take responsibility for him its my understanding that theyre quite welltodo and might find the child anumembarrassment rutledge silently swore hamish called mrs coldthwaite a gossiping auld besom she watched rutledges face avidly her smile inviting him to enlighten her further on the subject of eleanor grays family rutledge replied blandly im afraid inspector oliver is your man for word on that subject ealasaid maccallum was im told a very fine woman i had wondered if shed confided to you any concerns she might have felt about the conduct of miss macdonald after her niece came to live at the inn in a thousand or more words the answer appeared to be no he had the feeling mrs coldthwaite was deeply disappointed to have to admit it after returning to the ballantyne rutledge went to the telephone room to put in a call to sergeant gibson in london he got old bowels instead rutledge is that you rutledge closed his eyes hamish was still furious with him for breaking his promise to fiona regarding the name of mrs cook the angry rumble at the back of his mind like a headache had shortened his own temper yes sir what the hell are you doing man this business should have been cleared up by now it was useless to explain the complexities involving fiona macdonald and mrs cook its difficult tracing a woman who didnt want to be found im not interested in excuses im interested in results the receiver was slammed down hamish said youve lost your skills youre wrong it was an old argument the sting of it hadnt faded with time rubbing the bridge of his nose between thumb and forefinger he tried to think gibson he called the yard again and this time reached the sergeant i need to know who might have had a brooch engraved he described the brooch in minute detail the letters on the back it could be very important where do you want me to begin edinburgh glasgow not the fashionable shops the engraved letters had seemed worn their shapes elegant but their depth shallow a middleclass shop where a cairngorm brooch wouldnt cause comment he paused considering all the possibilities its going to be the proverbial needle sergeant but i need the answer and i know for a fact that the engraving was done within the past five weeks he remembered the water in his petrol not vandalism time bought possibly within the past two or three that should help gibson sounded dubious its a tall order yes rutledge tried to think hamish wouldnt let him he said gibsontry england first will you just over the border from duncarrick i have a feeling feelings are all very well sir but they dont help very much do they this time sergeant i think they just might early the next morning rutledge pulled out of duncarrick with his luggage in the boot of the motorcar but he had kept his room at the ballantyne and made it clear to constable pringle whom he met in the hotel yard that he would be gone no more than a few days heading east he reached david trevors house in time for dinner and morag greeted him with the warmth lavished on lost sheep lost black sheep hamish corrected him trevor was also happy to see him i was looking forward to a lonely meal and only morags company he told rutledge have you finished your work in duncarrick is this visit a farewell before leaving for london no i havent found eleanor gray and ha he was about to say hamish is giving me no peace but he stopped in time and instead ended lightly and im not going to be very pleasant company in this mood nonsense youre always good company ian as they sat in the drawing room after dinner and drank whiskey that trevor had stocked before the war rutledge waited until a comfortable silence fell and then said ive come for a reason i need to talk to someone sensible who isnt connected with the investigation thats under way ill listen i might not have sensible answers listening is enough rutledge launched into the events of the past week and in the process of putting them into coherent order found himself thinking more clearly as well and thats where it stands trevor said yes i see your point there could be two separate investigations here or only one and if theres only one then fiona macdonald will be found guilty of the charges brought against her if there are two then the woman on the hillside may have nothing to do with duncarrick and you wont be able to answer that until you find out who she is its going to be nearly impossible after all this time isnt it i dont envy you the hunt but it seems to me that youve come a long way in establishing that eleanor gray reached scotland yes if i werent a damned stubborn policeman id have concluded yesterday that oliver is right its finished and gone back to london satisfied trevor looked consideringly at him you like this macdonald woman you would like to see her proven innocent youre telling me im not objective rutledge answered feeling himself flush is that a fair judgment oh i think you are objective what i see from my own vantage point not knowing any of these people well enough to be anything but objective is that you may well be in danger have you considered the possibility that from the start of this business fiona macdonald was going to be sacrificed and your questions are getting in the way of that take care that you dont threaten someone who believes heor sheis well hidden behind the scenes thats an odd warning rutledge rubbed the bridge of his nose his head still ached but hamish had fallen silent i cant find any reason for someone to hate fiona macdonald deeply enough to concoct such a mound of evidence against her ive searched yes im sure you have which leads me to believe that the girl is a scapegoat for someone else the childs mother ive considered that yes fiona wont tell me who she is if the woman is dead then surely it doesnt matter turn it another way who is that childs father is he alive if so why mustnt he be told he has a son or if hes dead his family why should it be so important to keep someone in ignorance so important in fact that miss macdonald is willing to hang and leave the child to the tender mercies of an orphanage rutledge said tiredly if the mother is alive shes sacrificing fiona and the child as well willingly and that makes no sense either then thats where the secret lies the one you have to dig out he had left mrs cook out of the story he said before i can find the father i have to find the mother and before i can be sure ive found her i must track down eleanor gray then walk carefully i dont have a good feeling about this ian walk carefully in the morning rutledge left to drive north to the trossachs sir walter scott had used the districts great beauty for the setting of his poem lady of the lake and again in the novel rob roy whether rob roy macgregor was a bandit or a scottish robin hood depended on who was telling the story but between them he and scott had made that stretch of lochs and hills famous even the wordsworths william and his sister dorothy had walked there rutledge spent most of his second day searching for a robert burns ordinarily hed have asked the fiscal for his sons direction but he wanted to avoid any interference with the neighbor mrs raeburn before he got to her he didnt distrust the fiscal he thought the man was probably honest and by his own lights dependable but when it came to family secrets even the most honest of men fiercely protected their own on the third morning he found what he was looking for driving into a ring of spectacular barren hills he reached a town called craigness it lay in a treerimmed bowl east of where two rivers joined and a bridge wide enough to take motorcars crossed them its tall slender church tower gleaming in the morning mists and its houses looking far more english georgian than scottish gave it an oddly graceful air but north of it spread out the highlands here rutledge located the law office of burns grant grant and fraser it was an old building in a line of old buildings with a firstfloor bay window that jutted into the street the brass handles and doorknob shone with polish against the dark red door with prices to match the furnishings hamish commented as rutledge opened the outer door to the smell of beeswax good leather and better cigars an aura of respectability timelessness and good taste hung in the air neither mr grant senior nor mr grant junior was in he was informed by a young clerk but mr fraser would see him rutledge walked into a paneled room filled with books floortoceiling shelves volume after volume spilling over onto chairs and tables and every other flat surface even jostling for space on the windowsills and cluttering the beautiful old carpet on the floor the man behind the desk rose to greet him offering his left hand his right arm was missing inspector rutledge im hugh fraser i hope theres a grisly murder under our noses im sick to death of wills and deeds and title disputes the fair face beamed at him but the blue eyes were sharp no such luck i understand from the local police that one of your partners was a robert burns yes robbie died in france in weve left his name on the door out of respect although i must say i would welcome his ghost as a partner to help me sort out this tangle fraser waved his left hand at the chaos no you wouldnt rutledge silently replied aloud he said do you know when he was killed in the spring of he gave rutledge the date it was the same week eleanor gray had told mrs atwood that she was going north to scotland i heard it almost at once actually from a supply sergeant i was dealing with he wasnt aware that robbie was my law partner he just said hed been told one of the trossachs men had bought it that morning and thought i might know him hell of a way to find out robbie was a good man the smile had faded we lost too many good men were you out there on the somme rutledge answered his voice cold enough to ward off friendly reminiscences fraser nodded that was the worst of a bad lot why is the yard interested in robbie is it to do with any of his personal affairs we handled everything the will was straightforward as youd expect i cant imagine that three years later it might interest the police not the will no im looking for the property that captain burns owned here a house i think his father hasnt sold it as i remember it was a family property and mr burns senior was not prepared to part with it he hasnt changed his mind has he not to my knowledge during the war did captain burnss friends use the house from time to time if burns was killed the week she came north he hadnt driven eleanor gray to scotland someone else had i have no idea i wouldnt be surprised robbie was a generous man he often did such things youll have to speak to robbies father but i can tell you how to find the house craigness is small youll have no trouble there was a young woman captain burns met in london whilst on sick leave eleanor gray did he ever speak of her to you eleanor oh yes often robbie had helped her find pipers to entertain the wounded quite an undertaking that was he sent me a witty account of it and it reached me in the middle of a push it was a bad time and the laugh did me good at any rate he and eleanor went on to spend a good deal of time together before he was sent back to france showed me her photograph in fact when we crossed paths the last time i got the feeling it was fairly serious robbie had enormous charm you know people liked him a pity he didnt make it home i tried to look up eleanor after the war but no one had any idea where she might be i wanted her to know how much he cared would it have made a difference if shed known that in aloud rutledge said have you kept any of his letters regrettably no i neednt tell you how it was in the trenches paper was the first to rot in the rain and the mudnothing lasted very long not even boots and what the weather didnt get the rats did stinking bastards it was said unemotionally the rats had become so fierce and so common that not even a heavy shelling rid the trenches of them you got used to them rutledge nodded if you can tell me how to find the house ill be on my way ill do that if youll come and have lunch with me my wifes in edinburgh for the week and im damned tired of my own company the house stood in a street of houses that had wellkept gardens and a remarkable view of the hills two nursemaids with prams passed him as he stepped out of the car deep in earnest conversation while their charges slept rutledge studied number fourteen for a time then went to the door of number fifteen but no one appeared to be at home he tried number thirteen and an elderly woman opened the door peering at him over the top of her spectacles the silver chain attached to them almost the same color as her hair yes she looked him up and down if youre here to see barbara im afraid shes out inspector rutledge scotland yard he told her can you give me a few minutes of your time im interested in the burns house at number fourteen inspector are you why should anyone in london care about the burns house it hasnt been lived in since poor robbies death yes thats what im told he died in france do you remember when in the spring of she retorted as if he had doubted her mental alertness its my legs that are giving out young man not my brain i meant no offense mrs the auld biddy hamish interjected raeburn robbie used to tease me about that burns and raeburn he said a better name for a law firm than burns grant grant and fraser she stepped back do come in i cant stand here the morning long he followed her into a sitting room cluttered with glass bells covering specimens of dead animals giant fish and heads of deer decorated the walls she caught his eye and said my late husband liked to kill things birds red deer fishnever understood it myself but there you are that chair over there if you please i can hear you better barbaramy niececalls it barbaric but i suppose ive grown used to seeing them thats a particularly fine fox you know im told several of the birds are nice as well hamish said i wonder who killed her husband catching the eye of a snarling lynx rutledge took the chair mrs raeburn indicated after a moment he said ive just come from speaking with mr fraser he tells me captain burns had given you a key before he went away to france mr fraser is wrong captain burns gave me the key in when he joined the practice i was to let in the painters and carpenters after theyd finished he told me to keep it in the event more work had to be done did he have guests often at first he did his fiancee and her family came to dinner any number of times after the war started there was less entertaining but he came home when he could and sometimes brought friends do you recall hearing the name eleanor gray he was in mourning his fiancee died unexpectedly in late there was never any other young lady the captain never said anything to me about another young lady fellow officers then rutledge amended hastily oh yes he sometimes offered them the house there was a blind officer who stayed for a month and a flier with severe burns on the face and hands better off dead if you ask me and one or two others on leave with no place of their own was there an officer herejust about the time word came that captain burns was a casualty i believe he might have brought a woman with him there was an officer about that time from london i cant tell you his name but he came alone arriving quite late thats why i remember him because he came later than expected no no he woke me out of a sound sleep all but knocking the door down it was raining and he was wet through i handed him the key then slammed the door shut against the wind but i watched from the window to see he got in all right the lock is sometimes stiff in bad weather id have known if hed had a woman with him wouldnt i id have seen her go in with him how long did he stay at the burns house he was to stay a week and left after two days did he tell you why he was leaving i didnt ask he brought back the key and thanked me but it had rained every day i suppose he found that depressing how was he wounded shoulder leg sometimes it isnt possible to tell and i never care to ask he was very brown i did ask about that hed served in palestine he said was he scots yes he told me he was english but he was scots would you recognize him if you were to see him again she shook her head i expect i wouldnt he didnt have a remarkable face she studied rutledge pushing her spectacles up on her nose you do id remember meeting you rutledge said if you still have the key would you allow me to go in and look through the house she stared at him suspiciously why should you wish to do that im sorry im not at liberty to say oh very well come along but i warn you i cant stand on my feet while you take your time about it she went off to fetch the key and led him to a gate in the middle of the low hedge between the two properties he looked at the house carefully as they made their way around back if the bedrooms were on this side mrs raeburn might well know who had come to stay here but if they were on the other side mrs raeburn unlocked the garden door and bade him wipe his feet before he came into the house he did as he was told then followed her down a short passage to the kitchen as they walked in hamish objected theres nithing to find here he was right the house would have been cleaned many times since eleanor gray had come hereif indeed shed come at all but rutledge thought now he could guess the reason why she might have wished to with news of robbie burnss death she had wanted to see the house where he lived where she might have lived as his wife but where would she have gone from here rutledge and mrs raeburn walked from room to room the dining room the parlor a small study the furnishings were comfortable with a number of lovely old pieces that burns must have inherited and a wonderful mantelpiece in the parlor upstairs there were two bedrooms one on mrs raeburns side of the house and one on the other with a sitting room in between the far bedroom appeared to be the master bedroom and rutledge studied it with particular interest it held a large spindle bed a wardrobe of carved mahogany a maple desk under the window several comfortable chairs and a tall bureau that matched the wardrobe he went to that and was about to open one of the drawers but mrs raeburn stopped him she didnt hold with police prying into peoples lives and told him so not without a warrant he turned to the bookcase law books for the most part he touched the spines of several novels a threevolume history of scotland and a collection of six works recounting travels to europe he pulled one out at random expecting to hear mrs raeburn scold him but apparently books were not as intimate as the contents of a drawer it was the volume on traveling in italy many of the pages still uncut he put that back and took out one of the law books robert edward burns was inscribed in handsome copperplate on the flyleaf the novels held nothing of interest and he moved on to the volume of travels in france these pages had been cut and from the way the spine fell open to paris the chapter had been read a number of times he flicked through the pages admiring the line drawings of cathedrals chateaux and statues found nothing of interest and was on the point of closing the book when something in the margin of one page caught his attention the chapter heading was for the north of france what had become in fact the battlefields of the war there were brief notations here in a womans handwriting he took the book to the window his back to mrs raeburn and read one after the other here he was wounded ypres had been underlined on the page here he met one of the pipers we found to play for us the name of a small village had been marked it had become an aid station rutledge remembered and finally abandoned because the smell of death had soaked the ground rutledge moved through the chapter there were a number of other notes here and there each relating to some personal event the reader had connected with a place in the guide small landmarks in the life of a dead man a retracing of his journey to death on the last page of that chapter was another note in a hand that was shaking here he died and then below that a last touching line i wish i could die too eg eleanor gray had been here rutledge closed the book with triumph she had reached scotland the question was had she ever left it mrs raeburn was becoming impatient rutledge opened the wardrobe door before she could protest but saw that it was empty he moved on to the other bedroom and then the sitting room there was no longer anything in the house of a personal nature a new occupant could move in that afternoon and never have an inkling of the previous owner his interests or tastesloves or disappointmentschildhood or death except for the books it appeared that the dead mans belongings had long since been removed for storage or a missionary barrel had eleanor gray left other small tokens of her presence here that had been swept away unnoticed in the general cleaning it wasna what she intended hamish said softly no rutledge answered silently and thats very sad he added aloud does the fiscalmr burnscome to stay often he did when he went through his sons clothes and such after i think the house holds too many memories now and business doesnt often bring him this way ive a mind to make an offer for it if my niece settles down im not as young as i used to be and it will be a comfort to have her next door but not in the same house hamish said interpreting the tone of voice id hoped she might marry the captain but then he went and got himself engaged to someone else a pity still she died of appendicitis julia did if hed come home from the war fancyfree id have tried my hand at matchmaking they went out the way theyd come in and while mrs raeburn locked the garden door rutledge walked toward the garden it was once quite lovely mrs raeburn told him following down the path among the beds now the gardener keeps it up but doesnt go out of his way but then whos to see it i ask you she turned around a broad hint that it was time for him to accompany her back through the gate he went on ignoring her it was in fact a lovely garden peaceful and secluded a high wall marked the end it was hamish who noticed the bench it had been dragged from its low stone dais by the wall and set in the midst of a bed of annuals it looked out of place here like a whale stranded on a foreign beach the dimensions were somehow wrong and the plants set in around it lacked the symmetry of other beds as if having to compensate for the awkwardness of the bench the gardeners doingor someone elses mrs raeburn complaining of her legs had stopped by the sundial rutledge called to her how long has this bench been set here it appears to belong over there by the wall how should i know i never come that farmy legs you know rutledge squatted on the grass and looked at the soil of the bed it was loose friable as if it had been dug up each spring and restocked with plants that would grow contentedly in this corner shaded by the wall there were forgetmenots and pansies and a pair of small ferns set in a halfmoon around the bench but nothing was planted under the bench you wouldnt plant under the bench he went to the shed to find a trowel and mrs raeburn called plaintively have you finished young man im sorry to be a nuisance he replied if you wish to go back through the hedge ill come across in five minutes she was mumbling something about taking advantage he could hear her voice retreating even as she did it wouldnt take considerable strength to move the bench it was heavy and cumbersome but a person could shift it if he or she knew how to walk it off the dais and into the bed and it had rained both days the feet were deep into the soil of the bed now as if the bench had stood there for several seasons rutledge used the side of the trowel to scrape away the layer of compost mulch that kept down the weeds then he put the tip deep into the ground and lifted the first clump of soil it was thick with what he took at first to be roots and then he saw that he had uncovered a piece of cloth clothing he amended looking at it closely no it was a corner of blanket no more than two inches by three blankets werent put in with compostthey didnt decay at the rate of garden clippings and hedge trimmings an old blanket went into the dustbin he dug about under the bench for some time but the ground yielded nothing more hamish said someone buried a pet here a cat or a small dog and moved the bench so that the grave wouldna be disturbed rutledge rocking back on his haunches reluctantly agreed a pet wrapped in an old blanket after all he hadnt wanted to find eleanor gray here buried in a back garden it would finish his investigation in scotland he hadnt wanted to come to scotland now he didnt want to leave there was too much still to be done rutledge kept his promise and met hugh fraser for luncheon it was a small restaurant that was popular with the noonday throng of marketgoers and fraser apologized for that but if we go to the hotel a dozen people will stop by the table their minds on business my father followed the law he found it a fascinating mistress fraser grimaced the law is all right and ive made a good living my clients come from all corners of the district from loch lomond to callander i just dont have the same taste for it i once had i never got used to watching men die france was bad enough but there we were firing back the influenza epidemic was very different there was a nurse bending over me changing the dressing on my arm and she collapsed across the bed the orderlies carried her away like a sack of onions before dawn she was dead it was like some damned medieval plague the men on either side of me died of it and seven men in another ward i remember priests coming in the night and not enough orderlies to bring us water my father saw two people drop dead in the street before they could reach home he laughed without humor youre a damned good listener did you know that a professional requirement rutledge said lightly ive never talked about it before the truth is i couldnt id survived you seeeven come to terms with losing my arm i was ready to go on living and then this nightmare came out of nowhere and i was terribly afraid of dying from it it shook my nerve rather badly im only beginning to understand that we all have our nightmares rutledge said with more feeling than hed intended even when they last into the daylight yes but most people dont wake up in a cold sweat on the verge of screaming ive done that a time or twofrightened the hell out of my wife i can tell you but his face said it had happened far more often than he cared to admit the woman serving tables came to take their order fraser leaned back sipping his wine some of the lines in his face smoothed out as he relaxed find what you were looking for at robbies house he asked with frank curiosity i may have it appearstheres no proof mind you that eleanor gray came here in shortly after she heard the news of captain burnss death and she stayed at the house for two nights fraser stared at him old raeburnim sorry shes the neighbor mrs raeburnnever told me that she didnt know eleanor came to scotland with someone whod been told which door to knock on to find the key therefore a friend of burnss or so we assume he could have been a friend of eleanors acting on her instructions mrs raeburn remembers him rutledge gave fraser a brief description of the man pieced together from what mrs raeburn had told him and a description of the friend whod come to the atwood house with robbie burns recognize him lord no after a moment he added robbie must have met him in london while he was convalescing palestine you say he shook his head afraid i never had much to do with that lot and the first time i was invalided home i came here i didnt stay in london i wonder why robbie stayed hed met eleanor yes that probably explains it their meal arrived rutledge saw that someone in the kitchen had already sliced frasers chicken for him the pieces tidily rearranged so that a lefthanded man could spear them with his fork he was in hospital for well over a month you know then spent another two getting his strength back it might be possible to discover the names of other patients there at the same time the house was somewhere in sussex saxhallsaxwoldsome such name thanks ill see what i can learn there fraser put down his fork and reached for his glass she must have cared for robbie he said to come all this way sad that they had no future he quoted lines from one of o a mannings poems we walked away from all that was warm and dear and stood frightened in cold rain where the guns fired and in the end we died in pain the black stinking mud our shroud embraced at last not by living arms but by the bones of those who before us died rutledge recognized the words but he said only manning understood better than most yes fraser sighed well when you catch up with eleanor gray if she isnt happily married to someone else by this time tell her robbie loved her too i truly think he did do you know if captain burns kept a dog a cat he didnt he traveled more than most but his fiancee was fond of king charles spaniels he smiled julia would bring them whenever she came nasty little monsters always wanting to climb into ones lap how robbie put up with them i dont know love is blind i suppose did captain burns bury one of them in his garden good god how should i know then he grinned killed it you mean robbie must have been sorely tempted a time or two rutledge drove east out of the trossachs through some of the heart of scottish history many of the soldiers in france had seldom been farther from home than twenty miles in their short lives clan battles made for lively conversation among the highlanders who had long memories for the feuds ambushes and massacres that had colored each family tree until the battle of culloden and the highland clearances had changed scotland forever the lowlanders had had a different perspective stirling a great castle on a crag overlooking the forth had been a royal residence until james vi had taken himself off to london now it was a quiet county town lost in the backwaters of the past bannockburn where the scots had won their famous victory over the english was a monument to robert the bruces determination to be free of the southern kingdom that had dominated his country for a lifetime there were scots who had only the vaguest notion now where the battle had been fought mary stuart had been born at linlithgow palace on its knoll above the loch a queen from birth shed grown up to become a thorn in the flesh of elizabeth of england john knox had thundered against mary from the pulpit and she had finally been forced to abdicate a pensioner of the english crown a rough and glorious past now no more than a footnote in time the highlands had been emptied and the lowlands had become the poor cousin forgotten by an england with its eyes on empire and left to poverty and ignorance as someone had said scotlands greatest wealth her sons had bled away to the colonies half the scots under rutledges command had had distant cousins in australia new zealand or canada at edinburgh rutledge turned west and decided after some thought and a good deal of comment by hamish to go directly to jedburgh rather than to duncarrick to report to the fiscal rather than to oliver he stopped for a quarter of an hour at melrose whose ruined abbey held only a shadow of its former beauty stretching his legs as he walked through the broken elegance of nave and chancel rutledge tried to picture it as the cistercians had built it it was an important enough house that the heart of robert the bruce had been buried there brought home from palestine and lost for a time in spain melrose had fallen victim to the border wars that had burned duncarrick and jedburgh and bled half the marches but hamish remembered only that field marshal haig commanderinchief of the british forces during the war had been born near here he did not like haig and was restless until rutledge drove on in jedburgh burns rose to meet rutledge but did not offer his hand i understand from oliver that were ready to go to trial i could wish that you had been more successful in finding what has become of the gray woman this brooch most certainly puts the accused in the glen near the bones that were found but it would have been helpful to go into court with proof of her identity clearly set out perhaps before the trial begins that will also be answered to everyones satisfaction rutledge answered pleasantly i came here to ask you about an officer who may have known your son let me describe him for you without waiting for a response he gave burns what little information he had burns listened patiently then said that could fit half the british army half the army didnt serve in palestine yes yes i take your point and youre trying to locate the man who might have driven miss gray to scotland im still not convinced that he knew my son he might have been a friend of hers have you considered that rutledge omitted any account of his visit to craigness he had a feeling it would not sit well with the fiscal instead he replied yes either way i must start with the assumption that both men visited atwood house in miss grays company which makes it seem likely that your son did meet him my hope now is that one of captain burnss other friends might remember him also most of my sons friends were from his own unit or men he met on leave burns turned and looked out the window of his office a good many of them are dead this man was interested in the structure of the atwood house stables medieval stonework in the building trade then but an officer you said or a student of medieval history a don he began to list his sons friends giving their names their ranks their prewar occupations rutledge closed his notebook when burns had finished of the seventeen men burns could name nine were dead three before two others had died of wounds none of them had served in palestine and none of them was a builder or a don although as i think about it now tom warren was interested in history his father had been attached to the embassy in turkey at one time and the family had traveled widely in the near east a slim thread hamish pointed out as rutledge took his leave it would have to do rutledge drove on to duncarrick to find a message waiting from gibson he had had no success in locating the engraver finding major thomas s warren proved to be easier than rutledge had expected a call to the foreign office had brought him the name of the father who had in fact been a diplomat and had come out of retirement during the war to serve as an authority on the turks thomas warren was a solicitor in durham nearly in lady maudes backyard as hamish put it rutledge set out with a box of sandwiches and a flask of tea courtesy of the ballantyne and arrived in durham before the hotel clerk had come on duty at the bishops arms a bath and a shave did much for his appearance but not for the fatigue that was catching up with him durham had been built by fighting bishops both castle and cathedral sitting on a welldefended bluff above the winding river wear on the other hand one of the earliest names in english literature was buried here the venerable bede before the war rutledge had had several friends in the town but they were gone now it seemed odd to drive through the familiar streets and not call on one of them the law firm was in the center of town second in a row of buildings that were victorian gothic with even a gargoyle or two leering down at passersby the street was busy and rutledge left his motorcar at the bishops arms walking the few streets to his destination an elderly clerk admitted him and asked him to be seated until mr warren was free rutledge took one of the highbacked chairs near the hearth and felt weariness wash over him hamish was much taken with the pair of grimfaced eighteenthcentury portraits that flanked the clerks desk hanging judges he decided with no a verra high opinion of human nature i canna see pity nor mercy in their eyes when rutledge looked up to study their faces he was forced to agree thomas warren was a fair man with an ugly scar across his face running from the crown of his head into the collar of his shirt it had healed but time had not yet smoothed it into a thin white line it gave him a sinister appearance but he greeted rutledge with courtesy listened to what he had to say and answered yes i knew rob he was a good man but ive never been to atwood house im afraid and i didnt serve in palestine i was in france where else would the army put a man with some knowledge of turkish rutledge laughed it was common practice im afraid taking out his notebook he read aloud the list of names that the fiscal had given him warren steepled his fingers in front of pursed lips noting each when rutledge had finished warren said thats fairly thorough offhand i cant think of anyone to add the first five you named died in france and to my certain knowledge never set foot in the near east that puts them out of the running morgan has flamered hair and wouldnt know a barrel vault from a roman arch much less anything about medieval stabling he spent most of the war at sea and the only wound he suffered was a fractured thumb he shook his head still finding it hard to believe talbot stanton and herbert are dark and arent likely to be in the running i didnt know edwards well enough to tell you where he served baldridge and fletcher were artillery as i remember and macphee was in naval intelligence whats this about why is it so urgent to find these men i cant see any of them running afoul of the yard they havent but they may have information we need were searching for a woman who is missing and may be dead eleanor gray good god warren said thunderstruck i met her once or twice you know in london she and rob were on their way to some play or other a benefit for war orphans she was trying to persuade him to sit down and rest when i walked up we had a drink together at intermission lovely girl i remember asking her if she was related to the grays over by menton and she smiled and said she was but indirectly the next time i saw her she had lunch with me and if ive ever met a girl in love it was eleanor rob deserved happiness i was glad for them and id not like to think anything has happened to her we dont know that it has weve traced her movements from london to a place called craigness a small town on the teith in the trossachs thats where rob lived yes she arrived in a rainstorm with a man they spent two days at the house and then left rutledge paused we know she was there because she wrote something in the margin of a book that belonged to burns it couldnt have been done earlier shed just learned he was dead that narrows the time you see and its possible that she herself was dead by the autumn of she hasnt been seen since warren said are you telling me you think she killed herself he shook his head not eleanor gray she loved him the last notation in the book was i wish i could die too yes yes people say that warren replied impatiently ive heard them say it but thats a source of comfort not a decision taken i wish i could die and end this sufferingi wish i could die and not have to think about it any longer then they straighten their backbones and get on with living and you didnt know eleanor gray she was incredibly vivid the kind of woman other women never learn to understand but men domen always find that zest for life fascinating as he rose to leave rutledge gave tom warren his card if you should think of anything else that might help please get in touch you can reach me in duncarrick at the ballantyne he slept for nearly ten hours roused the hotel clerk at midnight in search of food and then slept another six the morning he woke up to was gray with clouds but there was no rain in them hamish at his shoulder as rutledge turned north was arguing the question of eleanor grays feelings for robert burns it could ha been infatuation a handsome man in uniform the excitement of war a romance that wouldnt have lasted with the peace rutledge was reminded of jean who had adored his uniform then was terrified by the reality of war he couldnt imagine eleanor gray confusing war with romance and excitement she had seen too many of the wounded and infatuation is more likely to lead to suicide hamish persisted fionas mother died of a broken heart that was no the same she wasted it doesnt matter if eleanor was carrying robert burnss child she wouldnt have killed herself if she wasnt pregnantthen whos to say it doesna explain how she came to be in the glen no and thats a question we still must answer thinking about eleanor gray rutledge turned off the road north and made a detour to menton he came up the sweep of the drive as the sun broke out of clouds and bathed the house in golden light turning the windows to burnished copper the stone to warm peach it was remarkably beautiful he pulled up to the steps and then walked a little way from them to look up at the house this was what made david trevor love the sticks and stones of building the angles and shapes the use of light and shadow the grace and elegance of line we have come a long way from stone hovels and mud huts he thought in skill and in knowledge but we still kill he went up the steps and rang the bell the butler came to answer it and with perfect poise informed him that lady maude was not at home today rutledge would have wagered a years pay that it was a lie but he accepted dismissal without demur lady maude did not wish to see him was she afraid that he had brought her news she couldnt accept he had a feeling that the quarrel with eleanor had wounded the mother as well as the daughter who walked away love could be terribly hurtful he pulled into duncarrick in the early hours of evening and parked the motorcar in its usual place after lifting his luggage out of the boot rutledge walked toward the front of the hotel his mind still on eleanor gray he ran into ann tait as he turned the corner and begged her pardon recognizing the inspector she said where have you been then setting down his cases he answered ive been in durham where are you going she lifted the hatbox in her hand its flamboyant ribbon catching the light from the windows a delivery theres to be a christening tomorrow he said you werent here in duncarrick were you when those women were murdered out on the western road in i think it was good heavens inspector what women she looked alarmed it doesnt matter id been thinking that duncarrick was a quiet backwater and someone corrected me saying that there had been several murders here before the war thats a fine thing to tell me walking down these streets in the dark she was angry with him her face flushed it was an old crime and you have nothing to fear if you like ill just set these in the hotel lobby and walk with you she wasnt mollified and ruin my reputation for good theyll be whispering behind their hands tomorrow and i cant afford it he said contritely im sorry i thought the murders were common knowledge ill walk down the other side of the street and keep an eye on you ann tait shook her head no i can look after myself she turned to go and then swung around if you mention a word of this to dorothea macintyre and frighten her to death ill see that you pay dearly for it i spoke to you he said because i thought you might give me information it appears that were both in the dark but dorothea macintyre wont hear such things from me i promise you she walked away he watched her for a time the swing of her shoulders and the straight back she had confessed to envy of eleanor gray but he thought that the two women were in many ways very much alike independent willing to make a life for themselves with their own two hands hiding behind a brusque shell because it saved them from pain white lace gowns with satin sashes and broadbrimmed hats had passed with along with lawn tennis and picnics on the thames and a much simpler world there were thousands of ann taits making a living for themselves now and hundreds of eleanor grays looking for a different future five years and a colder bleaker world of war had reshaped a generation of women as well as men as rutledge stopped at the desk to pick up his key the clerk handed it to him and then reached into a drawer to find a folded sheet with his name on it in his room he unfolded it and read the brief lines written on it sergeant gibson requests that you call him at your earliest convenience rutledge took out his watch and looked at the time far too late to find gibson at the yard he began to unpack with hamish rumbling at his back it was nearly ten oclock the next morning before rutledge could reach gibson the sergeant said it wasnt a piece of cake but i found the engraver thats very good news rutledge applauded im grateful you wont be gibson retorted when you hear what i have to say the brooch had been engraved in a back street in glasgow nearly three weeks before it had been found in glencoe it was a small shop that specialized in buying and selling jewelry the owner was frequently asked to remove or change the engraving on items left for resale but he seldom had the opportunity to use his skills on a piece that had no previous markings on it he had objected when the man who brought in the cairngorm brooch insisted that the work appear older than it was but the price agreed on helped overcome any qualms he might have had could the shopkeeper give you a description of the man who brought in the brooch better than that it had to be left and picked up in three days time a name had to be put down on the card rutledge felt his spirits soar tell me what was it alistair mckinstry stunned rutledge asked gibson to repeat the name he did i asked for a physical description as well but the engraver had relied on the name he finally told me that the man was scotsmedium height medium coloring medium build he might remember more if you confronted him with mckinstry then again he might not he wasnt interested in the man only the work that he was being paid to do rutledge thanked him and slowly put down the telephone receiver he refused to believe it in the first place it made no sense mckinstry had been fiona macdonalds champion from the very beginning hamish said he had access to a key to the reivers fiona macdonald had said that mckinstry had probably seen her wearing her mothers brooch he must have known that it existed and it would take him only a short time to search fionas room for her jewelry the brooch had become the final brick in a wall of evidence against her but why it made no sense rutledge a seasoned investigator found it hard to accept hard to believe that he had misjudged a man so completely he took out his watch and made a swift decision his first stop was the police station but mckinstry wasnt there oliver was where have you been he asked jovially still hunting for straws to make bricks in a way look im going back to glencoe i want to see the place where the bones were found it was not something he wanted to do you climbed up there with macdougal there couldnt have been much to see the bones are gone the place has already been minutely examined by macdougals men a wasted trip if you ask me i know put it down to stubbornness at any rate will you give inspector macdougal a call and ask him to meet me there id be grateful if he can spare the time all right if thats what you want oliver added im surprised to see you in duncarrick again any news to give me on eleanor gray not so far ive got a list of names to sift through that can wait until i see the glen again id like to save myself all that trouble intrigued oliver said youre saying we overlooked something no im saying i might see things differently he took out his watch trying to cut the conversation short ive got another stop to make before i leave oliver let him go rutledge walked back toward the hotel and then went on to the rectory mr elliot dorothea macintyre informed him was out visiting a parishioner who was ill its just as well do you mind if i step in and leave a message she moved back from the door blushing as if she had failed in her duty because she hadnt thought to ask him for a message he smiled at her it wont take long he walked past her and she turned to a small table under the window producing a sheaf of paper from the single drawer it was church stationery rummaging she came up with a pen as well smiling in triumph as she handed it to him she was almost childlike in her pleasure rutledge scribbled on a sheet i came to call this morning but must leave town for a day if you have time when i return id like to ask you a few questions he signed his last name folding the sheet he handed it to her then he said do you know alistair mckinstry very well know him she looked frightened does he attend services at the kirk is he a kind man relieved that rutledge wanted only general information and had in no way suggested that she might be a particular friend of the constables she answered shyly yes indeed he attends regularly and i think hes kind hes always kind to me yes im sure he is he walked to the door it was time for the question that had really brought him to the rectory when you were cared for in your illness by miss maccallum and her niece do you remember a rather pretty cairngorm brooch that fiona was fond of wearing she frowned thinking i dont recall fiona wearing a brooch she never even wore her wedding ring it hung on a chain around her neck where she couldnt lose it i saw it sometimes when she bent down to settle the pillows or bathe my face but not the brooch trying hard to please him she said earnestly but miss maccallum had a lovely brooch there was a pearl in the center she let me wear itfor couragewhen i came to the rectory to be interviewed by mr elliot did it help he asked unwilling to cut short her brief burst of enthusiasm she was pretty when her face was lit from within fragile and pretty but it was the wrong question her face fell mr elliot recognized it and made me take it off he said it was unbecoming to ape ones betters hamish swore rutledge felt a strong urge to throttle elliot it was he thought an intentional cruelty did you tell miss maccallum what hed said oh no she said horrified i couldnt i was too embarrassed i said only that he was very kind as she had just told him that constable mckinstry was very kind driving out of duncarrick rutledge was trying to decide how much weight to give to what dorothea macintyre had told him about the brooch on the whole he thought she was honest and without guile confronted as when hed asked her about mckinstry and ealasaid maccallum had asked about her interview with elliot she told lies out of a deepseated fear of provoking anger the girl wanted so desperately to please it was her firstand onlyneed hamish taking up another matter said i never gave fiona a ring i couldna tie her to me going off to war the bracelet was a gift to remember me by but didna bind her rutledge had not married jean in for the same reason using the war as an excuse to put off their october wedding and in the end it had been the right decision he felt cold now thinking about living with a woman who hated himor hated what he had in her eyes become a broken stranger he wondered if eleanor gray might have regretted not marrying robbie burns when he was home on leave there was a woman sitting along the road just by the pele tower something about the droop of her shoulders told him she wasnt well he searched for a name and came up with it mrs holden her husband was the sheep farmer rutledge braked and came to a stop just beside her are you in trouble he asked can i take you somewhere she smiled ruefullythe doctor tells me to walk if i intend to regain my strength but i dont have the strength to walk then let me take you homeor to the doctor if youd prefer that he got out of the car and helped her up from the low stone shed found to sit on under his hands her shoulders felt frail lifting her into the car he settled her in the passenger seat she was white from even that simple exertion im so sorry to be such a nuisance she said breathlessly its silly of me to overdo my strength and put strangers to such trouble shutting her door he examined her face and didnt like what he saw there let me take you into duncarrick i think you ought to see your doctor after a moment her eyes closed she nodded yes i need to lie down hell be glad to let me lie down for a while rutledge backed the car around and said would you like me to find your husband and bring him to you no i thank you hes in jedburgh today dr murchison or one of my friends will see that i get home talk to me if you will and just let me listen it takes my mind off the weakness how does a policeman make pleasant conversation with a nearfainting woman he said ive admired the pele tower the way it was constructed i understand its on your property id be interested in hearing its story what role it played in the days of the border raids she smiled a little my father is the person you should have spoken to did he write a history of duncarrick it was often the retired gentleman or rector who collected the legends and tales passed down by word of mouth for generations and turned them into a chronicle of sorts he never got around to it im afraid a few sentences more and hed exhausted the subject of the tower rutledge cast about for a new topic the name of the inn were just passing the reivers i wonder who chose that did the maccallums have riders in their ancestry ridersreiversraiders he thought euphemisms for the same bloody trade of border warfare drummond was just coming out of the inn with ian macleod returning from feeding the cat the child looked up eyes shining and pointed with excitement to the car rutledge waved but didnt stop drummond was glaring after him with murder in his face the woman staring ahead with unseeing eyes bit her lip she was in no shape to answer his trivial questions hold on rutledge said gently touching her hands where they lay trembling in her lap were nearly there but he had to carry her into dr murchisons office her head against his shoulder and her body so light it was like a feather in his arms the nurse came to meet him having seen them arrive to mrs holden trying to smile as she apologized for all the trouble shed caused she was all warmth and sympathy my dear she said half scolding half crooning as though to a child have we overdone our strength again come lie down for a bit and then the doctor will take you home again she led rutledge down a passage not into the sitting room he could just glimpse through a door that stood slightly ajar opening another door she gestured to an elderly sofa that stood under the back windows while the nurse fetched a pillow rutledge settled mrs holden gently among its cushions then took the light blanket that had been folded across the high back and spread it over her feet and limbs as the nurse lifted her head and slipped the pillow beneath it mrs holden smiled a wavering smile and rueful as well im so sorry she began again rutledge took one of her hands and held it in both of his nonsense feel better he turned and walked out of the room the nurse after a word to mrs holden followed she thanked the inspector for being a good samaritan and opened the outer door for him not at all rutledge said she seems very weak is it serious the doctor feels it isnt she caught a chill this spring when she undertook the charity bazaar and was left with a cough shed had influenza last year a very serious case and was slow recovering from that dr murchison is trying to rebuild her strength and sometimes she feels well enough to come into town the influenza took the heart right out of people a shame really yes a shame he remembered hugh frasers words it was like a medieval plague turning the motorcar around again rutledge drove away from the town once more and headed in the direction of glencoe he made another brief stop in brae to speak to mrs davison she asked him for news of fiona but as he had nothing cheerful to tell her he said only i assure you were doing everything we can then if it isnt good news what does bring you back again they were in the parlor and the boys happy to see him were clinging to the arms of his chair while the little girl climbed confidingly into his lap mrs davison reached out for her but he said no let her stay i dont mind the child curled herself against his chest and began to play with the fob on his watch chain i need to ask you about some jewelry that fiona macdonald owned a brooch with a large cairngorm in the center she nodded before he could finish his description yes i remember it a lovely piece she said it was a wedding gift from her father to her mother she didnt wear it often she was afraid playing with the children that it might be pulled off or lost she also had a bracelet from her fiance which she allowed my daughter to try on when shed been especially good she smiled indulgently you can see that young as she is she has a taste for gold he looked down at the fair curls catching on his vest buttons its natural he agreed had her fiance also given fiona a ring she never said anything about it if he had detaching curls from buttons and fingers from the fob he set the child on her feet and rose youve been a great help he told mrs davison thank you once more she must have read something in his voice she rose but didnt cross the room to the door instead she asked is it important this brooch it might be he confessed im on my way to find that out then i hope it will be good news on the step he paused and said do you think that maude cook was expecting a child when she left brae maude cook mrs davison shook her head no im sure she wasnt there would have been signs not if she left in her fifth month well thats true i suppose but when she left brae it was to travel to london to be with her husband he had been invalided homewhat would he have said to find her pregnant by another man she stopped i had wondered if she had a lover no i cant believe it of her she wouldnt have been able to conceal her condition from mrs kerr and mrs kerr would have told half of brae no possible but not likely she ended firmly give fiona my love will you and tell her we are praying for her she will be grateful rutledge said and went down the walk to his car hamish scolded youve broken your promise again no i asked if mrs cook could have had a child ive put no one in danger it isna right to gie a promise and take it back when it suits it isnt right for fiona macdonald to hang rutledge retorted grimly aye but she doesna deserve to put her faith in lies rutledge reached glencoe before inspector macdougal got there and spent the time climbing back to the rocks on the heights how had a woman dragged the dead weight of a body up this slope how would he have done it people found extraordinary strength in times of grave danger it would have taken enormous effort and time at night then when darkness gave the killer a good nine hours in which to accomplish the task and if hed laid the body on a blanket and pulled what if the frayed edges of an old blanket had been cut off and hidden under the bench in the craigness garden to make a sturdier corner overhead rutledge heard an eagle scream and shading his eyes looked up he could just see it circling for altitude riding the warming air in the far distance a car was moving in his direction rutledge turned and began to walk back down the mountainside the sound of pipes came from somewhere a lonely shepherd passing the time too far for rutledge to pick out the tune a pibroch he thought very fitting here where the mountains gave it body and redoubled the drones he paused to listen something crackeda shotechoing and reechoing against the rock faces on either side of the road instinctively rutledge ducked long years of war making it a swift reflex action the stones just behind him spurted then slid in a trickling spill toward his feet he swore there was no cover hereabsolutely nonehe was a clear target easy to pick off where was the man with the rifle crouching he scanned the opposite slopes and saw no one it hadnt been his imagination he knew the sound of a rifle it was clear and definitive then at the top of the ridge across from him he caught a slight shift of light and shadow and again threw himself to one side but this time there was no shot macdougals car was just below the motors noise rising to where rutledge was crouching close enough now to hear a rifle rutledge shaded his eyes looking intently for movement but the sniper had vanished ducking over the opposite ridge invisible now it would be impossible to catch up with him furiously angry rutledge wheeled to look for the spent bullet he combed the area where he was certain he had seen the small slide of rock chips it must have struck a stone and ricocheted he searched carefullybut he never found it inspector macdougal getting out of his car as rutledge reached the road again said youre a great man for the climbing good exercise he answered thinking of mrs holden better you than me what is it youre looking for up there that you need me to act as guide ive seen all i need to see on the mountain now id like to find that young girl betty lawlor the one who discovered the brooch any particular reason youd like to speak to her macdougal looked at him speculatively never infringe on another mans turf it was a cardinal rule rutledge followed yes id like to hear how she came to have the price of a new pair of shoes as i remember she said shed earned them yes no doubt she had i should have asked her how what does that have to do with finding the brooch it might have been the price of convincing her to turn it in i find it hard to believe thinking back on it that a child as poor as that would come to you to ask if she could keep the brooch i wondered about it of course but the family is honest enough the fathers a drunken sod but the mother is proud as peacocks and shes taught her children to be honest as far as i can tell besides how in hells name would anyone know that betty lawlor had found a brooch out here in the middle of nowhere its farfetched rutledge but he shrugged and pointed down the road the croft is just before the end of the glen shall we take both cars or leave one here rutledge had no wish to find water in his petrol again or a bullet through a tire we might as well take both safe enough here macdougal said but its your choice he pulled out ahead of rutledge to lead the way hamish warned watch your back rutledge said no he wont risk firing again not with macdougal ahead of us how did anyone know i was here i told oliver anyone could have overheard olivers call to macdougal anyone could have asked oliver i saw rutledge leaving town where has he gone and who did oliver tell hamish said or i could have been followed to brae and then here but if he knew and came ahead while you were in brae he would have the time to climb i know rutledge let it go there was nothing he could do now sheep were being driven down the road filling it with white curly humps that bobbed ahead and then behind crowding against the two motorcars he could hear macdougal shouting to the man to move them on and the high whistles to the dogs moving to lower pastures before the autumn storms came pulling out of them macdougal drove on then turned off the road where an ancient stone croft squatted in the shelter of the hill it has only two rooms rutledge thought and no water that i can see betty lawlor was poor indeed hamish said therell be a rill close by enough for their needs a ragged child of about seven popped his head out the door and then went back inside calling to someone before coming to stand on the threshold his eyes were wide as he took in the two motorcars parked in front of him macdougal had gotten out and was crossing the hardpacked dirt of the yard when a man came to meet him he was of middle height but heavy across the shoulders and the filthy undershirt he wore was torn across the back his trousers were held up with string not braces the bleary eyes and fleshy nose told the rest of the story good afternoon mr lawlor ive come to have a word with betty if you please i thought you might be bringing her back wheres she got to then out with the sheep shes gone gone macdougal looked over his shoulder at rutledge gone where look i want to talk to her tell me where she is and ill be on my way the ravaged face turned puce with anger gone i telt ye and gone she is thats plain as plain no skin off my backside if shes alive or dead a worn woman in a faded dress came to stand at the door behind him macdougal took his hat off to her but she said nothing rutledge said what did you do to her mr lawlor that made her run away he had a feeling that he already knew he thought the man was on the verge of apoplexy he was so angry the woman said she wouldna tell him where she got the money for the shoes he thought he had a right to know he thought she might have more of it so he beat her until she couldnt cry and that night she left ive got every right to that money i feed and clothe these brats i keep a roof over their heads what they have is mine beat your children again lawlor and ill haul you in for drunk and disorderly and keep you in prison until you rot do you hear me macdougals voice was cold do you hear me man it willna do any good his wife said in a tired voice when hes like this he doesna remember a word lawlor swung a fist in her direction but she moved away with the ease of long practice rutledge thought of that same fist beating the thin child hed seen on the mountainside whatever betty had done she was better off out of here i want her back lawlor was saying now his voice plaintive theres nobody to tend the sheep you should have thought of that before you beat her macdougal answered roughly mrs lawlor did your daughter tell you where she earned the money for her shoes she shook her head but shes out wi the sheep noon and night whos to say whore thats what she was slut selling herself ill be bound no she hadnt sold herself lawlor she provided the police with some information they badly needed rutledge added mrs lawlor do you know if your daughter has had a piece of jewelry in her possession for some months now it was a brooch with a cairngorm center she laughed and howd she keep something like that where he didna find it in her boudoir i never saw her with anything more than the bit of dyed yarn shed twisted into a bracelet for her sister and herself if you think my betty had anything like a cairngorm brooch youre mad macdougal and rutledge exchanged glances rutledge said to her my mistake i must have misunderstood macdougal walked with rutledge back to his car the small boy had come outside now and was fingering the bonnet then running his hand over the smooth leather of the seat macdougal was saying she had the brooch whether her mother saw it or not it doesnt make a difference to your case the brooch was seen in glasgow several weeks ago in the shop of an engraver can you believe that betty lawlor was the one who took it there great god no one told me that when did oliver find out he doesnt know id rather tell him myself i just learned the news from my sergeant in london he smiled at the boy and lifted him into the drivers seat where the child instantly made motor noises and gripped the wheel like a racer but it means that most of bettys story is a lie she didnt have that brooch for a year or morenor did she find it on the hillside my belief is that the person who gave it to her and taught her a story meant to be told to the police also gave her the money to buy shoes and there was enough extra to help her escape her father and this place she would have bargained hard she carried out her part very well indeed it will be olivers headache to track her down to testify at the trial ive no doubt hed do it i dont believe it youre pulling at straws the horn blew rutledge and macdougal winced macdougal went on its no more than speculation you cant be sure its the same brooch no until theres proof to the contrary i put my faith in young betty i think theres enough proof already to put some doubt into a jurys mind rutledge waited then said will you search for her macdougal gestured to the croft and the parents still standing in the doorway and bring her back to this he took a deep breath i suppose i shall have to but it wont be easy still there arent many ways she could have gone from here even with her new walking shoes inveraray most likely where she could beg a lift in a wagon he turned away settling his hat back on his head ill let oliver know when she turns up thanks rutledge said to the boy will you sit there while i turn the crank the child nodded vigorously rutledge started the engine and then let him stay for a moment longer to feel the power of the car under him macdougal had already turned around in the yard and was heading back the way theyd come rutledge lifted the child down with a glowing face he said ill have mysel one of them im sure you will rutledge answered and then as if in payment for the special treat the boy leaned toward him standing on tiptoe there was a man with bettyi saw him even though she claimed it was only the sun playing tricks what did he look like rutledge asked quickly suddenly intent the boy backed away already regretting his confidence fair he mumbled and then ran back to the croft door slipping between his mothers skirts and his fathers legs disappearing into the house rutledge nodded to the lawlors then turned the car around he had lost his escort back through the glen but it had been worth it wary of being followed rutledge didnt stay the night in lanark as hed intended the last thing he wanted to do was lead someone to the small clinic and dr wilson instead he drove some distance beyond the town then decided to continue to duncarrick through the night with scones pork pies and tea he bought at a pub and hamish to keep him awake he let the smooth sound of the engine form a backdrop to his thoughts his headlamps picked out road signs and the dark fronts of towns and farms as he mentally went back through all his notes looking at every word with a fresh eye well reasonably fresh he told himself as he finished the last of the scones he stopped several times to stretch his legs or clear his head the night air cool on his face and the moonlight turning the landscape into stark shapes of deep shadows and brighter patches it was a far cry from france he thought where the long line of the battlefield had no natural definition the trees blasted into black fingers of ruined trunks and the gentle roll of the fields destroyed in the shelling with manmade twists of wire and humps of shelltortured earth the only landmarks a bizarre blackandgray world where only the scavengers lived except for a lorry or two a skittering of hares racing across his headlamps and once a wagon filled with crates of chickens on their way to market there was less and less traffic on the road as the hours passed hamish said any decent man is at home in his bed but rutledge was at peace with the night it was he thought a sanctuary of sorts where there was no one else to overhear the voice in his head or the long conversations that sometimes tricked him into answering aloud nor did he fear that the sniper might try again in the night even a marksman would find it impossible to shoot at a moving target a tire or a radiator to send rutledge careering into a ditch but it helped to keep him awake thinking about that as well its a foolish manor a desperate oneshooting at a policeman it was a warning rutledge answered ive come too close to something or to someone ive breached the outer defenses of a wall of silence hamish said it wasna a woman to climb that far with a rifle theres no way to be sure of that but i rather think youre right i would give much to know when the first cracks appeared in that wall rutledge smiled to himself id take great pleasure in widening them when he reached duncarrick he bathed and shaved went to bed and slept two hours then he went in search of constable mckinstry rutledge ran him to earth making his rounds coming back from the east end of town with a clutch of small boys in his wake their faces were long downcast truants by the look of them mckinstry dropped them off at the school where a stern schoolmaster had been watching for him the boys went in through the door with the air of the condemned dragging their feet future criminals mckinstry said catching sight of rutledge standing in a shop doorway but theyre not bad really they just have no taste for learning i probably didnt either at that age and theyre fatherless it doesnt help its an excuse theyll hear until they believe it still we make allowances the constable grinned ruefully the headmaster now he wont as the grin faded he added i thought youd finished with us not finished no they turned to walk along together do you remember when you came to ask morag if you could speak to me what you told me about solving crimes in duncarrick you said you knew the people and that that was often the key to finding who had stolen a horse and whywho had killed a lamb and why yes its true but in fionas case you were at a loss you couldnt draw on your knowledge of this town to find out who was persecuting her thats right i dont have the experience to put with the knowledge they crossed the square and dodged a milk dray lumbering past rutledge said im working at a disadvantage also eleanor gray is pulling me in one direction and fiona macdonald is pulling me in another i cant find the link between them in life i mean how they met why they met when and where they met he took a deep breath if fiona didnt murder eleanor gray then whose bones do we have on a mountainside in glencoe and if those bones belong to eleanor gray then how did she come to die there in a wilderness four or five months after she arrived in scotland the brooch yes rutledge stopped outside the hotel the brooch its damning but it doesnt put a name to the bones does it only to the killer mckinstry rubbed his eyes i lay awake at night and try to find an answer inspector oliver says she admitted that the thing belonged to her mother he came to me later and asked if id seen fiona wearing it after she moved here to duncarrick and i cant remember why not it was curt accusing because i want so badly to remember that i cant be sure its true she wore a green dress i remember that very well but i cant be sure if she had a scarf at her throat or that damned brooch and sometimes she wore her aunts pin it wasnt something a man would think was important and im not much with womens clothing anyway the green dress was wonderful with her eyes the rose one brought out the darkness of her hair and in the summer there was a very soft creamcolor affair with a wide collar and sprigs of some flower in a print lavender like lilacs or heliotrope i cant tell you how they were cut or what she wore with them or whether she had on that one brooch there was anguish in his face then what did you tell oliver i told him the truthi couldnt remember you might have lied for her sake yes mckinstry said with heavy sorrow i thought of that too but im trained to duty he started to walk away then turned around again would you lie to save her whatever he saw in rutledges face he continued if i have to ill change my testimony in the courtroom id hopedi thought you might have looked into it but you went away and did nothing damning as it was you did nothing oliver made it plain it was none of my business rutledge smiled wryly and ive been occupied with eleanor gray i told you yes well if the gray woman is dead shes well out of it if shes alive i wish to god shed show her face before its too late this time he turned away and kept walking rutledge looked after him hamish taunted you didna confront him with what youve learned about yon brooch passing through the lobby rutledge responded silently no it was more useful to see if hed bring up the brooch and in what context persuasive was he do you think he left it sitting at your door i wouldna call that a verra brave defense of the accused well then if he didnt put the brooch in the hands of betty lawlor he must have come close to losing his own belief in fionas innocence when he heard the story betty had to tell he didnt have much to say on the drive back from the glen and he didnt have much to say just now if hes behind yon business of the brooch then it was clever of him to make the yard an allyas you pointed out the holes in the charges he set about filling them in climbing the stairs rutledge answered then he shouldnt have given his own name to that glasgow jeweler was it mckinstry who drove eleanor gray north he was in france in rutledge stopped at the head of the stairs no he told morag that he had met me there until now ive had no reason to doubt what hed said it will have to be checked he had a verra good reason to fire at you in the glen to prevent you from talking to betty lawlor thats possible yes he opened the door to his room and threw his hat on the chair beside the bed crossing to the window he looked out at the clouds moving in from the west i dont know im a better judge of character i think than to be taken in by mckinstry he shook his head i havent finished it it may never be finished your meddling is no making someone happy rutledge turned from the window and took a deep breath if it isnt fiona who matters and it isnt the inn wheres the pawn in all of this the boy yes rutledge said slowly the legacy of the dead why is that so very important but hamish had no answer to give him rutledge ate a hurried lunch and then went to the police station requesting to see fiona macdonald pringle on duty protested i dont know that i can give you the key sir inspector oliver says youve finished with this part of the investigation i thought i was rutledge said easily i have here a list of names men who might have known eleanor gray we havent asked miss macdonald if any of them mean anything to her if oliver complains send him to me pringle reached behind the desk for the key and handed it over rutledge found fiona standing as if shed been restlessly pacing her cell little enough exercise for a woman accustomed to having her days filled with activity at the reivers prisoners often complained about thatthe sheer wasting boredom of waiting for trial he shut the door behind him and began by saying i saw the child the other day he had been feeding the cat with drummond did he look well happy she asked anxiously i wonder often if hes sleeping properly or if he has nightmares he seemed happy enough he took out his list of names and slowly read them to her watching her face but fiona shook her head i cant identify any of them im sorry closing his notebook he said fiona if you didnt kill the mother of that childif youre being persecuted for no reason that either of us can put a finger onthen im forced to ask myself what there is about that child that threatens someones peace enough to get at him through harming you how could such a small boy threaten anyone she parried surprised i dont know but the deeper i go into this mystery of yours the more certain i am that hes the key hes only a little boy who thought he belonged to me he doesnt know or care who his real mother waswho his father might have been and theres no fortune unless hes allowed to inherit the reivers when imdead but someone does care for a time i considered the possibility that it had to do with the gray fortune or protecting a familys reputation now im less convinced in my judgment the childs important because no one is sure exactly who he is and either someone wants that proofor wants to bury it with you im beginning to think that the hope was if the police investigated thoroughly enough theyd find the answer to the question of his mothers identity and save someone else the trouble of doing so or else the court will hang you and save that someone else the trouble of getting rid of you before you speak out something in her eyes told him that he was close to the truthbut not really there that he still hadnt put his finger on the crux of fionas secret as if talking to himself he murmured a child who came to light at the wrong time could cheat someone out of an inheritance or embarrass a family on the point of contracting an important marriage or bring to light a liaison that has been hidden until now he added after a moment or it might be that someone wants him rather badly but doesnt want to step forward and admit that the boy is hersor his if ian is in an orphanage he can be adopted properly without revealing any connection with you or him fiona said carefully if i told you the name of ians father youd find nothing in the knowledge to explain whats happening he was an ordinary man a very kind and a very good man but a very ordinary man if hes dead then were left with the mother why should his motherwho most certainly knew who that child isfear him in any way then why is she protecting him at the cost of your life shes dead she cant protect anyone not even herself rutledge said lets examine another possibility that the child is precisely what you say he isan ordinary child with an ordinary father threatening no one that his mother is dead what ifmind you this is pure speculation but hear me outwhat if someone thinks the boy matters and removing you from his guardianship is necessary to prevent him from ever being identified what if someone has been searching for some time for a missing child about ians age and that someone believes without a shadow of doubt that hes been found here in duncarrick you have a wonderful imagination she said smiling in spite of herself or have you convinced yourself that the mother of eleanor gray is trying to prevent ian from ruining her familys reputation imagination has often been the best and quickest way through a thicket of lies he made a swift decision and shifted direction whose wedding ring do you wear on a chain around your neck her face flamed who told you such a thing dorothea macintyre she didnt mean to betray you in the course of describing how well youd cared for her when she was ill she spoke of it she believed it was truly yours it was my grandmothers ring if i was a married woman i ought to have a ring but it was loose it didnt fit my finger so i wore it around my neck telling my aunt that i was afraid it might fall off and be lost youll find it at the inn unless someone has taken that as well i put it away when i could no longer call myself mrs macleod she looked away the memory hurt her earnestly he said wont you tell me which one of my guesses is closest to the truth because once i know i can protect you i can protect that child but you cant give him back to me when its over it was a cry of anguish youve already told me that no matter how this ends i shall never have him back again he looked at her trying to read her face is that the bargain youre making with me if i can guarantee that you shall have your child again you will finally tell me the truth she bit her lip torn between duty and love and hope he had finally found the key to fiona macdonalds silence something she wanted more than lifeeven her own life that child then to his utter astonishment she replied will you kill someone for me because if you cant promises will be useless she read his answer in his face no i didnt think you could there was infinite sorrow in her voice he waited but she said nothing more no explanation no selfdefense for even asking such a thing of him into the silence he asked do you trust constable mckinstry surprised she said yes i think i do why shouldnt i he wanted to marry me hamish said if he wed her hed have custody of the child is that what began this business her refusal why didnt you marry him rutledge asked ian would have had a proper father i didnt want to marry i didnt want to wake up in the morning and find his face on the pillow next to mine or anyone elses i dont love him i gave my heart away once i never want to do it again it hurts too much he thought of jean yes it hurt far more than it should to love fiona smoothed her hands together have you ever made a house of playing cards i used to do it for the davison children sometimes it always falls in upon itself thats my dilemma ian rutledge how to keep the cards from falling in on themselves and try as i will i dont see the way to prevent it it will be better for my son to grow up hating me or not even remembering my name and face than for the cards to fall in someone tried to kill me yesterday the admission was forced out of him he hadnt intended to say anything someone shot at me and it wasnt by accident it was a clear line of fire and he missed by very little a warning perhaps and i cant fight back because i dont know how how many lives will you put at risk for your son she winced then recovered with an effort youre a grown man you can fight back even against shadows a small boy cant her eyes filled with tears i dont want you to die any more than i want to die but its a risk that i must take god help me rutledge walked back to the hotel depression settling in like a black shroud he went to the telephone closet and began the long wearing task of tracing the house that had been a military hospital during the war saxhall or saxwold there was no listing for a saxhall but there was for saxwold in the next hour he tried to locate any staff who had served there chiefly the matron or doctor in charge he found one sister who gave him the name of three more and the last one pointed him to elizabeth andrews in another half hour he was speaking to her she had been the nurse in charge of saxwolds most seriously wounded men and was now at a hospital in cambridge her voice came over the telephone clearly forceful with the slight accent of yorkshire in it rutledge explained what he was after im looking for anyone who might have been friends with a captain robert burns who was at saxwold in he was there for nearly a month then was released to convalesce in london ah yes i do recall captain burns a very nice man i heard much later that hed returned to the front and been killed a waste indeed there was a woman eleanor gray who met him either in london or at saxwold do you recall her i thought you wanted to know who among the wounded was friendly with him i have no idea who eleanor gray is inspector i had little time to waste on visitors these were seriously wounded men in my care the problem is that i dont know with any certainty whether eleanor gray introduced captain burns to the man im seeking or if she met him through burns if she met him through burns it might be someone he knew at saxwold i understand now well since i have no knowledge of this woman i suggest we begin with the patients there were a number of critically wounded men at saxwold at the time and they seldom mixed with the other patients certainly not often enough for a friendship to be formed therefore you must be interested in the men who were more or less able to move about or have visitors if i remember correctly there were at least twenty of those of them i would say that captain burns was friendly with three or four she gave him names and told him how badly each was wounded three had lost limbs rutledge discounted them mrs raeburn had said she couldnt tell how the man at her door had been wounded the fourth had been blinded trying to begin from another end of the puzzle rutledge asked did you have patients from palestine in saxwold there was indeed one man who had served in palestine hed been an intelligence officer wounded and sent home captured by the turks apparently for he had been severely tortured we feared more for his mind than his body i must tell you that he didnt know who he was and he was by turns raving silent or alarmingly alert touch him and he was instantly back in captivity striking out quick as a snake we kept him in a room upstairs under the eaves where he didnt disturb the other patients once captain burns could move about he spent a good deal of time with the very ill writing letters and so forth the captain made an effort to include major alexander in his rounds though the stairs were difficult for a man with a serious back injury alexander do you have a first name im sorry no he told me repeatedly that he was called zander holland but the only name on his tag when he was brought in was alexander which isnt surprising weve had men with no name at all but as he began to improve the major was transferred to another hospital i was told later that he made a full recovery i was glad to hear it one of the specialists who came to look at the burn cases had seen him in another hospital hed been burned oh yes it was part of the torture you see systematic burning poor devil rutledge thought you have no record of his unit i told you once he began recovering the army saw fit to move him did alexander keep in touch with burns after he was transferred i cant answer that but i doubt it captain burns would have told me if hed had news whether they met again in london i cant say i wouldnt be at all surprised if the captain did make a point of finding him it was the sort of man he was he cheered up a good many people ill as he was it was his nature but that was all she could give rutledge on the patient named alexander he left his telephone number with her if you think of anything else that might be useful id be grateful if you got in touch i shall inspector she said and hung up the receiver rutledge spent another hour talking to people he knew in the war office but he had no luck there one official told him that he rather thought he remembered the chap rutledge was asking about and had heard that he went to france after hed been declared fit for return to duty but im not sure his name was holland and the only alexander i recall was a sergeantmajor in the fusiliers tracking your man down will be well nigh impossible without more information old boy i havent time to play hunches and we have a bloody long list of wounded at the hotel desk rutledge said to the young woman on duty could you tell me please if there is anyone in duncarrick by the name of alexander he was an officer in the war id like to look him up if hes here i dont believe theres anyone in town with that name she frowned prettily her hands toying with the pen shed been using hamish said he might not live in the town but rutledge was already asking that question im sorry perhaps you could ask constable pringle or inspector oliver theyd know or mr elliot perhaps he began with constable pringle rutledge found him still at his desk and put the question to him pringle considered theres an alexander out on the road to jedburgh but he wasnt in the war sir hes seventy if hes a day children two daughters thats all i ever heard about old maids both of them another dead end rutledge went out to walk restless and angry hamish said its no your fault cold comfort he retorted long strides eating up the distance to the reivers he passed it without looking and was well out the western road before turning and walking back to the town fiona sits in that cell waiting for trial and theres going to be a conviction all i needed was a name theyve given me one if alexander doesnt live in the neighborhood of duncarrick theres no way to find him damn the man but it was useless to damn anyone there were still other names to track down nearing the main square rutledge came across oliver he was not a happy man youve been meddling again you told me that you were wanting to see the glen instead you went to find the lawlor girl and shes gone missing he made it sound like rutledges fault i did see the glen rutledge told him and someone saw fit to shoot at me while i was there who did you tell that i was on my way to glencoe what do you mean someone shot at you he glared at rutledge i called inspector macdougal as youd asked i dont know who might have overheard the call macdougal wasnt in his office when i tried from the station so i waited until after my lunch and called again from the hotel from that stuffy telephone closet where oliver not thinking about it must have left the door ajar for air and who had been in the police station on his earlier attempt to reach glencoe mckinstry pringle where was mckinstry most of yesterday it was his day off youll have to ask him that theres no way hamish pointed out to be sure it was the telephone you could ha been seen in braeor anywhere on the roadand followed and whats this oliver went on testily about the brooch not being in bettys hands for a year or more thats nonsense i dont think it is he gave it a split seconds thought then said i can tell you the name of a jewelers shop on a side street in glasgow send mckinstry with the brooch to ask if the owner recognizes it oliver stared at him youre trying to tell me that my chief bit of evidence is a hoax no im telling you that it isnt what it seems well i wont have it weve got witnesses to what betty lawlor had to sayyourself included youll confirm in the courtroom what she said or ill have you up for perjury rutledge gave him the name of the jewelers shop anyway send mckinstry to look into this it may not be true if it isnt i shall retract any objections i have to the brooch as evidence suspiciously why mckinstry he wont like doing it but hell be thorough for the sake of the accused mollified oliver said ill do that then and he stalked off hamish said if the constable took the brooch to glasgow hell no come home and tell oliver his own names put to the engraving card no rutledge agreed it will be interesting wont it to see how he handles such a minefield if he gives oliver the right name hell be crucified before the inspector can draw breath and if he doesnt give the right name it will make him look worse when the truth does come out he walked into the lobby of the hotel the savory aroma of baked apples and cinnamon reminded him that hed had no luncheon there was a rattle of dishes and utensils coming from the dining room which meant they might be serving still his stomach growled at the thought he was halfway down the passage to find out when the clerk at the desk called inspector rutledge a telephone message just came for you youre to return the call at your convenience she reached into the drawer where messages were kept and handed one to him rutledge thanked her and walked on to the dining room opening the folded sheet as he went it was from durham the office of a law firm he knew who had called him thomas warren abandoning lunch rutledge went to the telephone closet and closed the door behind him he got through to warren straightaway and identified himself warren asked have you had any luck finding the man youre after not yet i found a nurse whod been matron at saxwold she gave me another name major alexander does it ring any bells alexander fraid it doesnt no sorry he was in palestine wounded there and was brought into saxwold while burns was a patient no perhaps youll have better luck with this one i never met the man but i have been searching for a letter id gotten from rob when he was in london convalescing it was on the occasion of my birthday and he saidthere was a rustle of paper as if warren was turning pageshere it is i found seven people to celebrate your birthday eleanor of course and a girl james had asked me to look up and edwards was there with the talbots who were rather grim the other brother howard is listed as missing and naturally they fear the worst edwards felt they needed cheering up and i also invited alex holden who lives in duncarrick for gods sake practically next door in scotland he was at loose ends feeling in the mood to celebrate anything the bone in his leg refuses to mend properly thanks to the bloody turks and hes got another round of surgery to face we drank to you and to victory and again to you but lost count after that and then ate something before we were completely drunk and forgot what was due the absent guest of honor i set a glass at your empty place well you neednt hear the rest alex holden you can add him to your list rutledge sat in the airless closet his mind racing hamish ahead of him at first then falling behind as fact after fact dropped into place alex holden of duncarrick sandy holdenof duncarrick alex or sandy short for alexander zander holland major alexander the tags on the wounded were sometimes garbled or lost he had met sandy holden for gods sake when he first came to duncarrickout by the pele tower with his sheep and seen him a number of times in the town since rutledge said aloud ill give you any odds you like that theyre the same man all this bloody time the man hed been searching for had been under his nose the fiscal himself hadnt seen fit to give rutledge that name theres no proof burns knew the two men had met hamish pointed out no probably not but youd think wouldnt you that after he came back to duncarrick holden would have spoken to the fiscala simple word of condolencei met your son once at a dinner in london i was sorry to hear he didnt make it home from france unless he had something to hide the fact that hed spent two nights in captain burnss house in craigness with eleanor gray who is now missing yesif he had anything to do with her disappearance even if hed simply provided her the money to sail to america the airlessness was making his head ache rutledge opened the door and went up the stairs to his room his mind still racing mckinstry had claimed that he couldnt put a finger on the writer of the poisonous letters even though he knew the townspeople like a book as any constable would but the local gentry would seldom cross mckinstrys path an inspector would deal with them and holden had come back from france only in the spring of mckinstry hadnt had time or opportunity in five months to put him in the tidy mental boxes where the constable kept the pulse of duncarrick youve sent him on a wildgoose chase to glasgow hamish scolded rutledge about the brooch still it was foolish for holden to use his name if holden was in palestine the army will have a record of it if holden was at saxwold elizabeth andrews will remember him if mrs raeburn can recognize him after three years we have him in craigness but theres no proof eleanor gray died there i know rutledge said but if holden took eleanor there the chances are he also took her away and he can tell us where she went after craigness mrs raeburn never saw her it was pouring rain that night eleanor could have waited in the car until the worst had passed by that time mrs raeburn had gone back to her bed and there are the notes in the books margin but no date hamish reminded him in a way there is a date it was written after captain burns died she noted that he was dead where was holden when you drove to the glen according to mrs holden he was in jedburgh that day aye but was he she couldna know for certain if the man went where he claimed he was going true enough rutledge ran his fingers through his hair all right mckinstry said that in this town he kens everyones business its no impossible for holden to do the same if he put his mind to it yes and ive seen him with oliver any number of times and oliver wouldna see anything wrong in answering questions holden might ask hes an upstanding citizen concerned for the truth all right its possible rutledge agreed but if the bones in the glen couldnt be traced to himif no one knew whose remains they werei dont understand why hed stir up the past by going after fiona the timing is wrong too well before those bones were connected with either eleanor gray or fiona someone was persecuting her was it holden if so to what end hamish didnt see it that way if he left eleanor gray in the glen dead hes been afraid for three years that someone might put a name to her one day no if hes been this clever then he wouldnt risk it rutledge stopped his pacing and swore holden lost all his horses to the war hes having to start again but if he could show that he was the father of the boy and eleanor gray was the mothertrue or not it doesnt matterian macleod would be the heir to the trust that should have come to eleanor gray if holden knew how that trust stood if eleanor had talked about it on their long drive north through the boy he could find himself in possession of a bloody fortune he began pacing again the room seeming to shrink and close in around him he swung a chair out of his way it might not matter whose bones they areor whose child ian macleod might really be what matters is what people are led to believe and if fiona macdonald is hanged for the murder of eleanor gray then the child shed been raising has to be the child of eleanor gray at least in the eyes of the law and when there is no one left alive to name the boys true father holden has a very clear run very civicminded of him to step reluctantly forward rather than let the child go to an orphanage aye he wouldna want his indiscretion to hurt his wife hamish agreed sourly thats the way half the town will see it there have always been two standards rutledge answered people called fiona a whore but theres no name for a man who has an illegitimate child it sounded plausible but the police required proof not speculations to arrest a man and rutledge had discovered in his first year at the yard that what was logical about evidence was not always the truth it was pointing to the first step is to find out all i can about sandy holden and gibson will have to do that from london starting with the army and the saxwold medical records and in the meantime i need a very good excuse to call on the fiscal again rutledge put in his call to london setting in motion the search for the past movements of one alexander holden since the end of i particularly need to know when and for what periods of time he was in england and see if you can find any trace of a major alexander also at saxwold at the right time but odds are theyre one and the same old bowels delighted to hear that rutledge had found a possible solution to the mystery of eleanor gray said expansively well done we arent ready to say that holdens guilty of anything we cant find any trace of miss gray after the spring of he may have driven her to scotland and left her anywhere from berwick to john ogroats alive and if shes the mother of the child she didnt die in the spring well bring him in and ask him what he knows theres enough evidence for that at least rutledge thought if this is a man who survived capture by the turks hell tell us what he wants to tell and nothing else the fiscal was just leaving his office when rutledge reached jedburgh they almost collided in the doorway the fiscal surprised to see him and stepping back with courtesy inspector what brings you here have you a moment sir its rather important have you made progress with the list of names i gave you burns reluctantly turned and led rutledge back to his office passing through the reception room he asked his clerk to bring them tea for i shall be missing my own no doubt taking the chair behind his desk he motioned rutledge to the one across from it rutledge sat down now then whats this about the fiscal demanded ive been trying to find the man who drove eleanor gray to scotland connecting her to fiona macdonald has not been as successful theres the brooch man i should have thought that was sufficient the brooch connects the accused to the bones found in glencoe im afraid it has done little to shed further light on whose bones these are we already have a match of height and age we have the proper timing of the death we have the fact that eleanor gray went missing in the spring of and you tell me theres the strong possibility that in that spring of she came to scotland to wait out the birth of her child i should think where her circumstances did not embarrass her friends and her family yes at present im hoping to carry matters a step further by tracing eleanor grays movements closer to the time she was delivered he paused if this child is lady maude grays grandson it will have repercussions for her and for the solicitors who represent her daughters sizable estate lady maude he hesitated lady maude is a woman of considerable influence and distinguished connections indeed the fiscals clerk brought in the tea with a plate of sandwiches and a packet of biscuits rutledge accepted the cup and the sandwich offered him burns went on ive actually given some thought to the fact that a guilty verdict at the trial will most certainly establish the boys heritage it is one of the reasons ive chosen to let him remain where he is for the time being ive been making my way through the list did your son have friends here in jedburgh i might add one or two names through them the first two names i gave you were local men as i told you at the time theyre dead and not likely to be involved did your son have friends in duncarrick robbie went to harrow and until the war the majority of his friends were either from there or in the law he visited duncarrick a time or two but i dont recall anyone in particular he might have known there better to describe them as my friends certainly id have told you if id known of any connection hamish agreed with rutledge unless the fiscal was lying that meant holden had never mentioned any meeting with rob burns in london he finished his sandwich and accepted the offer of another they were small but very good the fiscal had already eaten both of his and began to open the packet of biscuits his appetite was about to be spoiled in his mind rutledge could hear fionas voice saying the father is an ordinary man justan ordinary man hamish tried to stop him but he said aloud i must tell you i think that if eleanor gray bore a child there is a very slim chance that the father of her son might be your own it strikes me that for some leniency shown by the court at her trial fiona macdonald might be persuaded to name the man i have a strong feeling that she knows who he is that eleanor confided in her before she died the fiscal frowned ferociously at him if my son had been seriously attached to a woman of eleanor grays background there would not have been a clandestine affair robbie would have come directly to me and to lady maude and made his intentions clear he would have done the honorable thing forgive me sir for being direct you werent fighting in the trenches these were young men who did things out of need and fear that they would never have thought to do in they loved where they could and when they could knowing they were going to die if your son could have settled his affairs before returning to france ive no doubt he would have eleanor wanted very much to study medicine she may have asked him to wait preposterous nonsense the fiscal said glaring at him i will hear no more about it my son was still in mourning for his dead fiancee youve made an enemy hamish was saying its no wise another excellent reason to wait i should think rutledge said ignoring hamish and then he backed off i cant tell you that any of this is true i do know that friends of your son believed he loved eleanor gray as much as she loved him young men who served with him to whom he would never have lied about his feelings eleanor and her mother quarreled shortly before her disappearance the timing indicates it was after your son had returned to the front but before his death perhaps eleanor told lady maude that she wanted to marry a country lawyer not a title lady maude however refuses to discuss the quarrel i will not hear another word i will not believe that that child in duncarrick is my sons bastard i dont care who the mother was like so many bereaved fathers fiscal burns had kept a holy image of his dead son in his heartthe dutiful honorable young man who had died bravely for king and country reared in another age believing in other ideals he could not contemplate the possibility that love had clouded duty in his sons last days it would be a betrayal of that pure image born of the child the fiscal had watched grow up to manhood and march off to war a tennyson knight in khaki theres no dishonor here hed have married eleanor gray but he died before she could tell him she was carrying their child i cannot in good conscience believe otherwise rutledge stood as he finished saying it then thanked the fiscal for tea before adding almost as an afterthought i dont know what will become of that child in duncarrick but if he is abandoned by everyone it will be sad his bloodlines appear to be impeccable as he walked out of burnss office disregarding hamish and the heavy silence hed left behind him rutledge was well pleased with the seeds hed sown turning his car around he headed back to duncarrick he told himself hed spiked the guns of alex holden if lady maude did come to accept her grandson at the end of fionas trial shed find herself with two contenders for the boys father and there was some safety in numbers in duncarrick rutledge considered his next move if alex holden was as clever as it appeared he was it would require more than an inspector of police arriving at his door to shake his nerve on the other hand singleminded people often were victims of their own intense preoccupations it was where they were most vulnerable it was late the next afternoon before his opportunity came rutledge had lain in wait in the filthy halfdecayed stone pele tower where he could watch the drive that led to the holden farm when a motorcar came barreling down the drive and turned toward the town rutledge could see quite clearly that holden was alone behind the wheel he gingerly climbed out of the tower brushed himself off and set out on the long walk in to the farmhouse extensive and attractive gardens had been laid out around it with trees forming a screen in front of the vast stables that ranged back to the pastures beyond jacobean in style the house had a wide terrace leading to the door and handsome gables rising above the old glass in tall windows the property had been made more fashionable a hundred years earlier with lawns and beds and vistas rutledge thought but the core was much older he crossed the terrace with long strides and rapped at the door an elderly woman in a black dress came to answer his knock and looked at him with a disparaging expression he realized that there was still straw on his shoulders grinning he said ive come to see mr holden rutledge is the name mr holden isnt in im afraid we dont expect him back for another two hours ah then perhaps i might speak with mrs holden the tone of his voice was pleasant but firm this was not a request to be rejected she isnt feeling well today sir then i shant keep her long the maid invited him into the cool highceilinged hall dim after the sunlight on the road it was scottish baronial with banners hanging from the rafters and targes ringed with pistols and dirks and swords like sunbursts on the stone between the high windows the furnishings were more comfortable a long table by the door and a grouping of chairs around the cold hearth that took up half the side wall the maid asked him to wait there and rutledge walked around studying the array of weaponry it was he thought realnot victorian replicas of lost family heirlooms many of the swords were claymores the dreaded doublebladed weapon of the highland scots capable of cleaving a fighting man in two the blades were roughedged in places as if theyd met with bone battle swords not dress swords he moved on to look at the dirks they were the famous skean dhu s the black knife of the highlander worn in the cuff of the stocking he smiled looking at them not the elegant ones with cairngorms in the hilt and stags carved in the sheaththese weapons were plain and deadly with horn to fit a mans hand in the handles and blades honed to razor sharpness the scots under his command had taught him how to use thema london policeman who could wield them now with the best of mrs holdens ancestors it was he thought a commentary on war that from farmers and sheepmen and workers in the whiskey distilleries a man dedicated to preserving law and order had learned how to kill silently not a skill to be proud of he was studying a collection of flintlocks when the maid returned and led him to a back sitting room where mrs holden was lying in a chair with her feet on a low stool she smiled at him and offered her hand as the maid closed the door behind him i have to thank you again for rescuing me have you come to see how im faring yes you look much better i endured a very firm lecture from the doctor im trying to mind his instructions may i offer you something tea a sherry thank you no ive come to talk to you about your husband her face flushed with surprise and wariness im afraid i cant speak for him would you care to come another day he smiled reassuringly i shant ask anything he wouldnt feel comfortable telling me himself he was in the war i think yes nearly the entire four years it was a very long war for him something in her face told him it was very long for her as well im trying to find anyone who might have served in france with captain burns the fiscals son can you tell me if your husband knew him she seemed relieved it was a very simple question ive met the fiscal myself once or twice at the home of the chief constable but i dont believe ive ever met his son nor have i ever heard my husband speak of the captain as a friend i believe in fact that he was killed in france yes thats true i expect my informant was wrong i was told by a man in durham that captain burns had been acquainted in london with someone from duncarrick both men were recovering from their wounds and they had been out to dine on at least one occasion with friends of eleanor gray this was a name she knew ive been told that shes the woman miss macdonald is accused of killing how sad but the words didnt have the right ring to them as if they were spoken because it was expected of her not because of any deeprooted sympathy how well do you know miss macdonald he asked noti told you before i hardly knew her to nod to on the street to speak to in a shop that was all she gestured with her hand as if inviting him to look at the difference between her home and the reivers we moved in different circles a pity ive interviewed her often but i cant seem to break through the wall of silence shes erected around herself nor will anyone help me she will likely hang mrs holden smothered a cry hamish called him callous and cruel but rutledge had a message he wanted conveyed to holden and this was the only way to do it if fiona meant nothing to mrs holden it would not be a lasting hurt surely she began then stopped i wish i could tell you differently i wish i could prevent it theres no hope now shell go to trial before the year is out she cleared her throat but her voice was still husky and the child whats to become of it we thought in the beginning that the boy belonged to eleanor gray but new information has come to light ive traced the mother now she turned very white and he went swiftly to her side kneeling to take her hand let me call your maid no she raised herself a little in her chair and stared at him what do you mean youve traced the mother the urgency in her voice struck him like a blow he said slowly we have a name we have located the doctor who delivered the child we can prove beyond question that the mother survived the birth and was released from the clinic where shed been treated for rather serious complications gentle godso much im afraid so have you told the police have you told miss macdonald ive told miss macdonald she denies it but i dont need her confirmation i have my own he was no longer interested in conveying messages to anyone as hamish rumbled in his head he kept his eyes on mrs holden she had come to the end of her strength but her spirit was undaunted rutledge realized with sudden anger that this woman was not ill she had been tortured as severely as any suffering her husband had endured at the hands of the turks it was there in her voice in her face in the stiff angular agony of her body she had been made to choose her hands were shaking and she buried them in the folds of her sleeves where he couldnt reach them i dont believe you its true he said softly do you want to hear the name of the childs mother shall i tell you the name of the clinic shall i give you the initials on his christening gown memc are they yours she began to cry and fished for a handkerchief in her pocket then pressed it to her eyes im childless i feel dreadfully for this dead mother its nothing more than any woman would feel he waited she began slowly to find the steel she needed youve upset me im afraid i must apologize its the weakness ive suffered since the spring perhaps youd better leave after all i hope you wont speak of this to my husband he will only be angry with me for letting you stay when i was feeling ill he admired her courage he admired her strength but there were other lives hinging on the truth and what he had to do must be done now you are mrs cook arent you and the boy is yours are you maude cookor mary cookor both mrs kerr will recognize you and so will dr wilson no no no the child is yours he repeated but your husband believes its eleanor grays she lifted her eyes to stare at him startled eyes that were wide with shock as he watched she bit her lip a thin line of blood marking the place rutledge said and youve allowed him to think thats true her hands reached for him taking his arms just below his shoulders holding him with a fierce grip that was a measure of her need no you dont understand he knows its mine dear god he knows but he canthe hasnt found out these things youve discovered he isnt the father you see he will never have children by me im ruined i cant have more and he hates me for that he hates fiona and most of all he hates my child if i ever tell him the truth even to save fiona he will see that the boy is given to us to raise and then he will take the greatest pleasure in destroying him my husband has powerful friendsthe fiscal the chief constableinspector oliver barristers in jedburgh and edinburgh he can arrange it he will even claim that he was eleanor grays lover if he has to alex will stand there in public and lie to them all and in the end theyll let him have his way the only way that fiona and i can truly protect ian is for her to die and the child to be left to the mercy of strangers it took him a quarter of an hour to calm her down again she was shaking so badly rutledge feared for her but when he offered to summon dr murchison she refused to let him instead she asked for a sherry and he found the decanter by the window poured her a glass and held it while she sipped it a little color came back into her face the shaking stopped but she was beginning to think clearly again too rutledge asked once more about the doctor no i mustnt call him just now hell see ive been crying and demand to know why i was so upset hell tell alex and alex will question margaretour maid you must leave here and i shall say to my husband that you came to ask after my health because youd found me ill by the pele tower and were concerned will he believe you i dont know she took a deep breath yes ill make him believe me i havent any choice he has held this thing over my head for months now since he came home in the spring and i take the greatest pleasure in not breaking but sometimessometimes the strain is so great i can hardly breathe my chest hurts with it how could he have found out about the boy when i had the influenza the doctor must have told him id borne a child or when i had the chill i might have said something in my sleep i was feverish i sometimes woke crying out forfor someone alex is very clever he began to see that i hadthat there was something i hadnt told him how he connected all this with fiona i dont know wed been so very careful but once his suspicions were aroused i wouldnt put it past him to go to the inn of an evening and search the family quarters who was there to see when fiona tended bar there was a christening gown it had been my grandmothers or perhaps he saw my face when i looked at ian so i stopped making excuses to pass the reivers that still isnt strong enough yes you dont know him hes very clever i tell you it started when he began asking me where i was in when he called from london to say he was sent home to recover from wounds i wasnt here you seeand i wasnt here when he called to tell me he was being sent on to france over and over hed ask where i was what i was doing who i was withuntil my very silence answered him it was after that that he must have learned somehow that id borne a child he would bring me small giftsa blue babys shawl a small rattle for a teething child a rocking horse he said hed found in edinburgh and knew id like the servants thought it was a loving promise of children when i was better but i cant have any more children the nurse who bathed methe doctorsomeone must have told him there was a child rutledge shook his head he must have discovered something did you meet fiona was there any communication between you we met at night sometimes at the pele tower but after alex came home we stopped drummondi dont know hes very loyal to me and my family he wouldnt have told anyone what he knew drummond brought me home you see from lanark when i was well enough to travel but his sister was jealous of fiona sometimes jealous people see more clearly and alex is a master at finding out secrets he was trained to spy the persecution of fiona was a test the anonymous letters at first yes to make me tell him what he wanted to know but i wouldnt and it escalated he spread lies to mr elliot and to oliverto the fiscal and other influential people for all i knowuntil they came to believe that theyd thought of it themselves when mckinstry didnt search the stables it was alex who persuaded inspector oliver to go back he reminded him of those old murders before the war that hadnt been solved that pricked olivers pride alex knew the jacobite bones must be hidden somewherehed come across an old story about them in some of my fathers papers that was to be the end of it but by that time inspector oliver was rabid to find a body and throughout the whole ordeal alex would come home and tell me what he had been doing that day to make fionas life unbearable and watch me until i could crawl off somewhere and hide my anguish mrs holden how did your husband come to know eleanor gray im not sure that he ever did ive never heard him speak of her at all theres some evidence that he could well be the man who drove her north just after captain burns died if he did he may have been the last person to see her alive id come to believe that he was after the boy because young ian might inherit eleanors fortune once it was established that he was her child he knows ian is mineits revenge that drives him not money she cried and then pressed her fingers against her eyes as if they ached i havent the strength to worry about this gray woman too i have enough sorrows already she looked out the window i should never have given my child life i went to glasgow once did you know fiona took me to a place where abortions were done never mind how i found out about it another poor desperate woman had gone there and later confided in me but i couldnt go through with it i loved ians father you see in spite of my fear of being found out i loved his father she lay back her eyes shut i love him still hamish said somberly holden is driving her into her graveshes likely to die before fionas trial does he no ken the risk hes taking i dont think he does rutledge answered silently it would spoil his game if his wife died prematurely he wants the name of her lover and he wants his wife to see that shes caused an innocent woman to die a fearful death damn the man but contrary to what mrs holden had said rutledge believed holden had known that eleanor grays body lay in glencoe he might even have been clever enough to see how useful it could be a remarkably tidy way of punishing fiona and ridding himself of the past the problem was this was going to be bloody difficult to prove he stood up what do you want me to do mrs holden i cant bring your husband in and charge himtheres only your word against his that hes responsible for what happened to fiona macdonald people would believe him if he told them your health is frail and that your mind has been affected by it there must be a way to stop him youi cant go on like this i cant live with fionas life on my conscience and i cant buy it back without destroying my child i have come to hate alexbut hes the albatross around my neck and i cannot be freed from it will you kill someone for me he heard fionas voice quite clearly in his head tell medid you live in brae before your son was born she nodded i was desperately in love heians fatherwas in glasgow for some time and we met when we could i was happy i had closed the house herewith the horses gone and the servants leaving it was an excuse and the initials on the christening gown my maiden name i was born madelyn elizabeth marjorie coulton but i was afraid to use it in brae or the clinic because you see hed gone back to sea and not long afterward was killed she stopped let her voice steady once more he died and i had a baby on the way i stayed in brae as long as i dared hiding the pregnancy as best i could then i took a hotel room in glasgow for a time before going to the clinic there was nowhere else that i dared to have the child if alex had died of course id have claimed that ian was his but alex was alive and i couldnt risk brazening it out if i hadnt met fionaif she hadnt been willing to take the child as her owni would have killed us both the boy and myself rutledge left mrs holden with some apprehen sionconcerned for herafraid that when alexander holden walked back into his house his suspicions would be aroused by something in her face it wouldnt take him long to discover that rutledge had been there he was too intelligent not to know why mrs holden was very fragile what would he do bully heror find a new unexpected strength in her whatever he does hamish said its no possible to stop him you canna go to oliver until you hear what londons learned about holden you canna go to the fiscal without proof this is holdens ground hell ken what to do there may be a way to distract him rutledge had nearly reached his motorcar concealed well out of sight of the holden property he pulled it to the head of the drive where holden couldnt pass him then he waited with infinite patience even hamish stood the long watch in silence they had shared such watches many times in the trenchesthere was almost that same comfortable sense of companionship almostbut not quite it was nearly dusk when holden came the long shadows of the autumn day had given way to clouds and the first sprinkles of rain the lights of holdens car picked out the dark shape of his own and slowed holden called sharply whats happened rutledge replied ive come to speak to you your maid told me you were out and i waited for gods sake why didnt you wait at the house because i didnt want your wife or your servants to hear what ive got to say he gestured around them at the dark road and the dark drive we have a little privacy here the sprinkles turned to the first heavy drops holden looked for hidden ears before turning back then say what you have to and let us both get in out of this rain i traced you to craigness holden to rob burnss house i found written proof there that eleanor gray had come north with you that night in when it rained so hard she waited in the car until the worst had passed before coming in and mrs raeburn didnt see her you left with herand eleanor gray disappeared did you kill her did you drag her body on a blanket up the slopes of the mountainside in glencoe and leave her for the jackals and the ravens holden said dont be an idiot i never knew captain burns his father will tell you that and my wife it wont matter what they say youve left a trail behind you and ive uncovered it you thought trained as you were that you were skilled at deception but i can bring witnesses who remember your face and who can place you in saxwold in london in craigness and even in glencoe unimportant people you thought wed never be clever enough to find theres other proof ill have it soon its a loosely woven net at presentbut it will tighten the cars lamps were fully on rutledges face but they cast macabre black shadows on holdens there was no way to read his eyes his hands on the wheel were whiteknuckled rutledge watched them if they moved hamish said is there a weapon in his car i dont know rutledge answered silently he could feel the tensing of his body a sitting target pinned by the light holden had tried to shoot him once save your wife the disgrace of seeing you brought in by inspector olivers men tell me what happened to eleanor gray it was meant rhetorically but to his immense surprise holden did ive nothing to be ashamed of she wanted to find passage to the states there was nothing to keep her here she said i drove her as far as glasgow and then went back to london on my own i dont know what became of her after that and i didnt see any point in telling inspector oliver about it that was in the spring and they tell me she died in late summer youre a very accomplished liar but you arent dealing with turks now or with inspector oliver your name carries no weight in london the yard is handling eleanor grays death not duncarrick rutledges voice was cold holden turned his head away looking around them trying to see beyond his headlamps satisfied at last he turned back you wont believe me if i tell you the truth no one will he lifted a hand to wipe the rain from his face damn it come to the house no your wife is ill i wont put her through this tell me hereor at the duncarrick police station youre a bloody stubborn man did you know that eleanor gray spent the night in robs bed which i thought rather macabre but i couldnt have cared less i was so tired from driving that i fell asleep in the guest room almost at once heavily asleep i dont even remember closing my eyes i must have been snoring or she might have felt ill i dont know i woke with a start and in the darkness sensed rather than saw someone bending over me he turned away again the shadows on his face shifting and changing the army had taught me how to kill fast and silently my hands had found her neck before id even realized where i was or who was in the house with me by the time i was awake enough to find a light she was dead i had to clean the carpet and i was all for burying her in the garden i even moved the bench so it would cover the grave but the rain was coming down in buckets i was afraid it would wash her out before the morning so i got her into the back of the car pulled a blanket and some of my clothes over her and went through the house to find anything she might have left the next morning as soon as the neighbor was up and about i returned the key and drove off where is eleanor gray now on that damned mountain in glencoe where else or she was i never dreamed it was damned bad luck that oliver was so good at his job wasnt it hamish growled a warning as holden lifted a hand but it was only to wipe his face again rutledge said if her death was an accident why didnt you call the police straightaway or a doctor she was professionally killed man not a mark on her except where my fingers found the spot on the back of her neck her mother is one of the richest women in england do you think lady maude would have believed me shed have seen to it that i hanged id had a violent history at saxwold and the next hospital as well and the army was glad to send me off to france for cannon fodder look i nearly killed a nurse once when she came up behind me unexpectedly i had my hands on her throat before she could even scream they thought i was out of my head but i wasnt id lived too long with danger and it was a reflex to strike first like a snake they were ready to pack me off to an asylum with the shellshocked men and leave me to rot rutledge involuntarily shuddered with men like him how did you know the rocks were thereon the mountainside they arent easily seen from the road my father took me there sometimes as a boy he was obsessed with tales of betrayal and murder he pushed his rainmatted hair out of his eyes my father would have made a bloody highlander if he hadnt been born in carlisle he collected all those weapons you see in the hall buying them up all over scotland it gave him a sense of history i put them up when i married madelyn it was something from my own past the rest of the house was hers he looked at rutledge for a long while ignoring the rain the patience of the hunter waiting for the rabbit to break cover but rutledge was patient too and as skilled holden said at last you know the truth now what do you think you should do about it when rutledge didnt respond he continued i dont intend to be railroaded into a sentence of death by lady maude and her lawyers she was a distant and uncaring mother according to eleanor but shell raise heaven and earth to see me dead once shes told i killed her daughter there was cold menace in the calm voice if i were you id go back to london and let the macdonald woman go to trial and pray that shes acquitted what is she to you after all what indeed rutledge didnt know the answer to that himself he sat there feeling the rain soaking through his shirt to the skin and fought his anger dont threaten me he told holden call it a friendly warning inspector but keep in mind the fact that i could walk into the ballantyne or anywhere else you believed yourself safe and youd be dead before you heard me come through the door you can bank on that he put his car into gear again i didnt intend to kill eleanor gray and i wont hang for it the lights swung in the darkness turning the slanting rain to silver and holden smiled at rutledge before the car disappeared down the drive a black shadow against the stark brightness of its lamps all the way to the hotel hamishs voice pounded in rutledges head demanding to know how much he believed of what holden had said rutledge was wet through cold and very tired but he said the mans an accomplished liarthats what he was trained to do in the war still i have a feeling he told me the truth about killing eleanor gray thats the pityshe went north with a man she considered a friend and safe whatever eleanor did that night in craigness whether it was waking him out of a sound sleep or in some way making him angry with her she died for it and if he killed her the way he described there wouldnt have been any marks on the body that the coroner would have been able to identify two years later rutledge took a deep breath feeling his anger drain away eleanor gray was dead she couldnt contradict holdens account of how it happened he might even rally enough support to get away with it hamish agreed he said it himselfa snake quick to strike the nurse elizabeth andrews had called him that too london will give me the rest of the evidence i need to present to the fiscal but a good lawyer will twist it into whatever shape holden devises a jury will never convict him theyll believe him where they would never have believed fiona we shall have to make him betray himself he wont betray himself he didna betray himself when the turks tortured him ill find a way there was grim determination in rutledges voice the next morning rutledge awoke to lowering skies and more rain sweeping in gray sheets along the streets and rattling like stones against his windows a depressing day unable to sleep after hed turned off his light hed lain awake trying to find a solution to the dilemma he faced hamish playing devils advocate seemed to relish pointing out that most of his answers wouldnt work you couldnt frighten a man like holden you couldnt make him come to you if hed survived torture then what did he want what was it that holden valued most his wife had made that clear his revenge he wanted fiona to hang and his wife to know that shed had the power to save her rutledge lay in his bed forearm resting across his forehead and thought it out from start to finish hamish said this way willna work either he can claim he was trying to protect his wife yes he can say that oliver might believe him but its worth a try its too damned risky i can take care of myself hamish laughed in the dark theres nothing you can do you havena his experience man i crawled through no mans land that night in and took out that hidden machinegun post they never heard me coming its no the same he got up dressed and went down for breakfast they let him in to see fiona he told oliver and pringle that he was leaving duncarrick and wanted to appeal one last time to the conscience of the accused when he walked into the cell he said ive come to say goodbye but he had his finger in front of his lips signaling her to be silent before i go i must appeal to you one last time for the sake of lady maude gray and her daughter in the passage outside the door he could hear olivers footsteps receding rutledge came to fiona and took her hands i know who mrs cook is he said softly ive spoken with her no thats impossible fiona just listen to me there isnt much time i know what her husband is trying to do to her and to you youre a scapegoat tethered to a charge of murderhes going to destroy madelyn holden through you and watch her die of shame what you dont know is that he also killed eleanor gray those bones on the mountainside are hers the ones that oliver found and holden will kill again its too easy for him hell kill that child too but it wont be fast or merciful ive protected ian i know what youve done but mrs holden is being frightened to death do you understand me shes battered every day by that mans suspicions and doubts and anger when i lifted her to carry her into dr murchisons office after shed fainted she was so thin i was afraid of hurting her i thoughti was sure hed never touch her he hasnt not physically he torments her instead day after day hes sapping her courage and one day shell want to die and then she will die by her own hand dont tell me these things i cant bear it she cried you need to hear the truth all of it from start to finish he gave her all the information he had trusting her she listened in silence without asking questions nodding from time to time as she understood where he was going accepting every word trusting him in her turn when hed finished he said wait until late this afternoon after ive left for london summon inspector oliver tell him you want to speak to mr elliot and the chief constable tell them that you dont want to die that you can prove that ians mother is still alive tell them that the truth is hidden in the reivers and if fiscal burns will come in person tomorrow youll take them there and give them your proof theyll want to go straightaway no theyll have to speak to the fiscal if need be let them think youre hoping to catch a glimpse of the boy she shook her head no i wont tell them that i wont use ian you must make your story plausible fiona i want holden to be told whats happening i want him to believe it its the only way to make oliver and the rest recognize how theyve been used he added theres one last thing mrs holden didnt tell me the fathers name and i didnt press her but now i need it its the one crucial piece of information i dont have she said its not my place fiona he stopped then went on holden is extraordinarily clever and he will turn everything to his advantage finding some way to destroy that child we must get ian macleod out of duncarrick out of reach tomorrow his father is deadhe cant help you it doesnt matter even a dead mans name makes a child safer mrs holden has no family but ians father might she bit her lip finally struggling with her own conscience and fearful of his she said will you swear to me on your honorthat you wont tell anyone unless you have to he nodded he was a naval officer his name was trevor rutledge felt his heart turn over no you wanted to know i ross trevor are you very sure fiona that ian is his child she was frightened i should never have told youi knew it was wrong no itits good news im glad for him there had been nothing of ross in the childs face except for the eyes rutledge realized suddenly those changeable eyes im glad for him he said again but what about david trevor would he like the fiscal refuse to accept his sons decision to love another mans wife it was hamish who reminded rutledge that the man who mourned his son so deeply would have to grow used to this news but morag would love the child for morag mourned too you have sworn fiona was pleading confused by his sudden uncertainty ill keep my word but he must persuade mrs holden to find david trevor once alex holden went to trial youve forgotten fiona hamish railed you promised to see that the child was given back to her rutledge could read the despair in her face she also knew what she had lost not her trial but her son no mrs holden and david trevor would see that she was never alone again but hamish refused to be mollified he said how many promises will ye break rutledge leaned forward kissing her cheek fionait will be all right she didnt move her face wrung his heart she said forlornly will it i wish i could be as sure oliver bade rutledge farewell and wished him a safe drive back to london although i dont know what youre to tell lady maude gray the truth what i know about it but not the part holden had played well then she ought to be glad to learn whats become of her daughter you can tell her well see that the accused is punished for what shes done rutledge shook his hand walked back through the downpour to the hotel and notified the ballantyne staff to draw up his bill then he began to pack it was shortly after luncheon that he drove out of duncarrick he let the motorcar stand in the street in the rain for all the world to see his luggage in the back and a hamper of food on the seat next to him ann tait worried about her geraniums drowning in their pots paused to look down the street at his car then hurried back into her shop mr elliot coming back from calling on a parishioner stopped to ask if he was leaving yes rutledge replied ive finished my business here you left a message with my housekeeper that you wished to speak with me his black umbrella glistened with raindrops and the sleeves of his coat were damp i found the information elsewhere im glad i didnt disturb you i wish you godspeed then rutledge thanked the minister and went around to turn the crank drying his hand on his trouser leg before reaching for it he drove some miles out of town then found himself a quiet spot in a small copse of very wet trees where the motorcar was nearly invisible from the road it would be a long wait it might even be a useless one but he was prepared to be patient and to endure another soaking by nightfall rutledge had completed his notes setting out his entire investigationwhen and with whom he had talked what he had been told and by whomeach step in the long chain and the conclusions he had reached then he set the notebook under the dash well out of the rain he had also eaten the sandwiches and nearly finished the tea he wished for more to fight the raw chill he waited another hour then got out and cranked the engine the rain had let up a little still it took him nearly half an hour to reach the western edge of duncarrick avoiding the main streets and the more traveled roads he arrived at his destination reasonably sure he hadnt been seen few people were out on such a wretched night rutledge left the motorcar hidden deep in the shadows of the pele tower well out of sight then he walked the rest of the way his shoes heavy with water hamish restless in his head was a low rumble like thunder like the guns in france which haunted both of them still some twenty minutes later moving quietly and keeping to the shadows he reached the reivers wet and cold he stood silently in the doorway of the stables and waited to see if anyone had noticed him slipping across the yard but the windows of houses that overlooked the inn yard were either dark or had had their shades pulled rutledge had considered summoning drummond as an ally then decided it was far from certain just where drummonds loyalties lay feeling to be certain that his torch was still in his pocket he crossed quickly to the back of the inn and found a window that he was able to force open with his knife a london burglar he thought pleased couldnt have done it betteror more quietly climbing in he let himself down gingerly then reached up to refasten the sash as best he could satisfied that the window wouldnt attract attention on a night like this he bent to remove his shoes they felt heavy waterlogged something stirred in the darkness and he jerked away from it prepared to defend himself but it was only clarence her light mew of greeting lost in the frantic beating of his heart stooping he rubbed her back then let his eyes grow accustomed to the darkness before moving on he found himself in the small back room that had been used as storage for the kitchen a stack of wooden boxes stood there and he cut a strip from the top of one to reinforce his temporary patch on the window frame he also found some towels in a drawer and used them to wipe his wet face and his hair his stocking feet were reasonably dry and he was grateful for that moving slowly cautiously rutledge made his way through the inn in each room he paused his eyes alert his ears tuned to the merest sound the silence was heavy even shutting out the sound of the rain and the white blur that was clarence had already gone ahead of him disappearing around a door the kitchen the bar the inn parlor rutledge came to the stairs and after listening intently went up them softly his stocking feet close to the outer edge of the treads where there would be the least chance of a sound as his weight settled on the old wood there was no one in the room upstairs that belonged to fiona he moved around it with care checking behind the door and in every corner even lifting the curtain around her clothes before looking under the bed the floorboard his questing hands told him was still in place no one had been here he was fairly certain of that the question was would someone come in the night this night another night not at all it was a long watch his shoulders grew tired and his eyes burned from staring into the darkness his clothes began to dry from the warmth of his body his ears picking up the creaks and moans of an old building tried to place each one later moving quietly to the window he looked out into the street but there was no one about the rain heavy and growing chilly as the wind picked up had kept most people at home there was only one umbrella moving down the street shining in the light spilled out from windows if holden had come here and found the christening gown with the telltale initialsif he had come again to take away the broochsurely he would come now there was a chink from somewhere in the house the cat rutledge was very still now no longer waiting feeling instead the adrenaline surge of danger his breathing grew deeper steadying him rutledge had no illusions about holden he would kill given the need nothing no one stirred in the bar below no one came up the stairs another quarter of an hour passed suddenly he could feel the cool rush of air and smell the dampness of the rain someone had opened a door then it was closed again he waited drifting silently behind the curtain surrounding fionas clothes the faint scent of her perfume reached him evoking her image but no one came up the stairs he waited and in the end decided to go closer to the stairway where sounds from below would be magnified moving to the top of them he listened again and then in the silence a soft footfall reached his ear it was too late to go back to where hed been he moved back a very little opening the stairs to whoever was climbing them with such stealth after a few seconds he couldhe thoughtmake out the dark shape coming toward him the stairwell like a pit yawned into stygian darkness but the shape moved breathed he could hear the quick shallow breaths the carefully placed feet on the steps rutledge stood where he was letting it reach him go past him it went into the childs room out of his line of vision and was there for some minutes rutledge could hear the clothes chest open and after a time close and then it was coming toward him again something white grasped in front of it without seeing rutledge in the deep shadows it made for the head of the stairs and then rutledge acted moving from the balls of his feet taking full advantage of the element of surprise catching his quarry from behind pinning the arms hard to the sides before he realized that it wasnt a man he held in his grip but a woman dear god ill see you dead before i let you finish this her voice was husky low and breaking free while he was still absorbing the unexpected shock his grip loosened she lifted her arm he saw the flash of a knife and spun away she came after him raising it again determined he caught her wrist and the thinness told him who it was mrs holden its rutledge he spoke quietly the words no more than a hiss but she gasped and said oh no in horror he moved closer to her whispering what are you doing here he told me there was proof at the reivers he said he was coming to find it i thought he meant the christening gown but he had promised oliver and the chief constable to have a drink with them first so i came ahead to stop him she pressed something into his hands he felt the cold steel of a dagger and the warmth of the hilt where her fingers had been its sharp she warned i was going to kill him with it you must take it you must kill him for me if you wont i shall mrs holden you must go please how in the name of god did you get in here without a key but ive had a key fiona gave me one after her aunt died a precaution if anything went wrong and i needed to reach ian then give it to me and go ill see its returned tomorrow will you kill him she asked her voice trembling not if i can help it you have the dirk it was my fathers if you wont do it for me do it for fiona and then she was gone moving down the steps with the same silent care shed used coming up them his heart still racing rutledge took a long breath then he listened somewhere a door opened and closed quietly the only sign of it was the brief rush of cold damp air she was gone he went back into the bedroom something brushed past his leg and this time he knew it was the cat he bent to touch her and she wrapped herself around his calf he pushed her away then afraid that the loud rumble of her purr would mask the other sounds he was waiting to hear she went off and he heard the small plunk as her body leapt onto the bed there was a soft cry it came from the bar and he stood where he was tense and poised to move fast a decoy to draw out anyone hidden in the darkness hamish was warning him to stay where he was or had holden run into his wife in the street there was nothing rutledge could do but find out he went to the stairwell and listened but heard nothing he began to move down one step at a time swiftbut sure at the bottom he paused again the cat had come down after him and he tried to see if she had heard something he hadnt but she sat down on her haunches when he stopped her eyes were on his face he had left all the doors open behind him when he had come up the stairs now that served him well moving quietly he worked his way back to the bar and stumbled over something on the floor nearly pitching forward catching himself in time on the edge of the bar reaching down rutledge groped at his feet and touched hair a womans soft hair there was a white patch beside her the christening gown he found her throat and searched for a pulse there was none gentle god holden had killed his wife anger swept him following on the heels of shock he remembered what holden had told him in the rain the previous night that there was nowhere rutledge could consider himself safe it was true rutledge got slowly to his feet every nerve ending alive eyes sweeping the black shadows all his training in france rushing back he was herebut where rutledge could feel him like a second skin the cats sharp hiss warned him there was a blindingly bright flash a deafening report and he was already dropping not fast enough this time something spun him half around slamming into his chest he had been hit he knew the drill it had happened before shock numbness and then the pain almost in the same instant he acted instinct already guiding hand and brain throwing the dirkaiming for the place hed seen the flash of powder the scots under his command had taught him well the harsh intake of breath told him hed hit his mark something fell heavily taking a bar stool over with it the clatter was appalling and then silence rutledge moved toward it his own breathing uneven whoever it was still had a pistol he reached out felt heavy immovable flesh and instinctively flinched there was no sound except for his own breathing fumbling he turned on his torch and looked down into the dead face of alexander holden the knife protruding from his throat had severed the artery there was a great deal of blood staining the scrubbed floor rutledge stared at it black and red where the torch picked it out he realized he was no longer thinking clearly rutledge told himself fiona will have to explainor theyll find my notebooklondon knows about holden too he remembered the torch in his hand staring down at it then turning it off why did he have to kill herwhy couldnt madelyn holden have lived i wanted to save her most of all i wanted to save fiona his breathing was harsh now and his chest felt like fire im bleeding he told himself and theres nowhere to go for help he didnt want to think about fiona she belonged to hamish she always would he found a chair and half fell half slumped in it hamish had been yelling at him roaring in his ear or was it the sound of his own blood he couldnt tell from somewhere he could hear the sounds of the pipes they were faint and then stronger coming toward him rutledge knew what they were playing hed heard it too many times not to recognize it at once it was the flowers of the forest the lament for the dead he had heard it played for every dead scot under his command hed heard the pipes skirling into battle hed heard them grieve this was a dirge for the dying he was dying hamish was like a trumpet in his head you will no die do you hear me you willna die youre already dead corporal you cant stop me rutledge was finding it hard to concentrate you willna die i willna let you die the sound of the pipes had begun to fade rutledge thought the funeral is overtheyve buried hamish hamish is dead and im to blameive killed him but where had this chair come from they didnt have chairs at the front the fire in his chest was smothering him he could feel hamish taking hold of him it was what rutledge had feared for such a long time that now he was grateful for the dark so that he didnt have to look up and see the dreaded face bending over him he said to hamish its too late im dead you cant touch me now im free of you you shall not die in the lamplit drummond parlor the ticking of the mantel clock competed with the soft patter of rain beyond the lacy curtains and glass panes that shut out the night the soothing quiet was broken only by the dry rustle of the edinburgh paper drummond was reading and the regular click of his sisters ivory knitting needles it was late the child already asleep the clocks hands nearly touching half past the hour of eleven a sound heavily muffled but unmistakable brought drummond to his feet the newspaper flying in all directions a shot he waited but only for an instant the image in his mind sent him headlong out into the small hallway brushing past the mirrored hat stand he flung open the outer door and plunged into the rain running hard his sister calling his name reached the door hed left standing wide and leaned out demanding to know what he thought he was doing over his shoulder he shouted go back inside woman but at the door of the reivers drummond stopped putting out his hand cautiously to touch the latch hed seen her only that morning shed surely do nothing so rashit wouldnt save fiona the latch lifted and his heart began to thud she had the other key kicking off his shoes he swung the door open tensed for whatever stood behind it what if there were the two of them herewhat if she had shot him theyd hang her too nothing happened there was nothing in the darkness he listened intently begging the silence to talk to him to tell him if one personor twohad come here no sound except for his own breathing and the blowing of the rain against his back the wind was picking up a little he could feel it across his shoulders making his way into the entry he moved forward one step at a time softfooted in his stocking feet the hair on the back of his neck standing on end his eyes wide against the pitchblackness concentrating on the stairs just ahead of him but it wasnt dark enough here another step on his wet skin he could feel the air from the open door that led from the familys quarters into the side of the bar it had been closed beforehed closed it when he fed the white cat stretching out his hand he could feel the frame of the door moving cautiously he leaned forward to stare into the bar for an instant he thought he heard a word spoken softly a white smudge on the floor at the far end of the bar the cat then he took another step unsure where the voice had come from and in the same instant his toe nudged something blocking the threshold immovable nearly tripping him up startled drummond dropped swiftly to his knees praying hard now dont let it be herplease god his fingers found the rough fabric of a mans overcoat a sudden gust of wind and rain blew into the open doorway behind him shaking him crouched and defenseless there he flinched away even as he realized that it was only the rain his heart seemed to choke him rising in his throat like a stone he reached for the coat again found an armthe warm blood soaking a shouldera face trying hard to find a pulse he thought she has shot himnot herself but his fingers touched the blade and then the handle of a knife instead protruding grotesquely from the throat someone spoke drummond jerked to his feet and then saw in the pale square of light from a window that someone sat in a chair twenty feet away madelyn drummond called softly unconsciously using her given name as hed done when she was a child whats been done then are you hurt his voice seemed to roar through the stillness of the room the slumped figure in the chair didnt answer reading the awkward angle of the one shoulder he could see drummond hurried forward right hand outstretched as if to ward off a blow the figure didnt move drummond leaned down to touch the shoulder and the head fell back in the pale light drummond made out rutledges profile his eyes were opendark patches in a bonewhite face drummond startled fumbled for rutledges throat fingers slipping beneath the collar a pulse faint erratic his hands moved down the front of rutledges coat where the white shirt was black with wet blood shot then and barely alive theyd all but killed each other relief flooded through him so sudden and wild he felt lightheaded with it but not her she was safe he bent to snatch up the crumpled white cloth he could just make out beyond rutledges feet and too late realized that it was gripped in hands that were soft longfingered a womans drummond began to pray again raggedly and disjointedly pleas tumbling over each other in his head his hands ran over the body the shoulder the face the silken hair he sprang to his feet made his way to the lamp that was always kept on the bar found it and managed to light it on the second try its goldandblue flame leapt up so brightly he was blinded and then his gaze moved beyond the glass chimney and he saw the carnage all too clearly holden in the doorway a pistol still clutched in his right hand a skean dhu piercing his throat projecting at an odd angle from front and back cutting the great artery as cleanly as butter drummond whistled softly rutledge in the chair shot and barely alive head forward now his eyes closed and madelyn holden lying almost at the londoners feet what appeared to be a childs lacy christening gown still strained to her breast the men were soaked in their own blood there was none on her drummond went to her kneeling beside her lifting her into his arms crooning to her as a mother would croon to an ill child but the weight of her body without buoyancy and life the open eyes that didnt focus on his face told him the truth a surge of primeval pain ripped through drummond and he cried her name again pulling her against his chest bending his head over her rocking her body with his shaking with tremors that broke into deep harsh sobs and he nearly missed the words hed forgotten the man in the chair looking up he realized that rutledge must have spoken but not to him hardly words more a murmur the pipes have stopped here was the only one left alive to tell him what had been done in this dark room tears wet on his face drummond gently lowered madelyn holdens body to the floor again stumbled to his feet and went to rutledge the pulse in his throat was no more than a thread now the breath so shallow it seemed not to exist you shall not die drummond thundered in unconscious echo of hamishs voice not here not till ive finished with you he curled his arms under rutledges shoulders and then his knees grunting as he lifted the unresisting weight muscles straining drummond made his way to the door stepping uncaring over holden tommy braddock stood just outside a large black umbrella over his head the rain had subsided but a cold wind blew whipping the skirts of the coat hed thrown on over his nightclothes what the hell he exclaimed as drummond stepped out into the drizzle a mans body gripped in his arms keep the rain off him drummond ordered my house then the doctor bring him back as soons you can braddock slammed the inn door shut behind them and tilted the umbrella over the burden drummond carried recognizing the man from london and swearing in surprise under his breath but one look at drummonds face and he said nothing keeping pace as best he could drummond paid no heed concentrating on walking back the way hed come barely ten minutes before youll live do you hear me he said once to rutledge ahead they could see the house door wide open and drummonds sister leaning out into the wet night a lamp in her hand the flame danced and shifted then burned stark and straight he saw it a beacon his grief so heavy that the flame seemed to flicker through his tears if holden had killed madelyn drummond promised himself that he would come back to the reivers this same night and cut out the bastards heart you shall not die drummond silently repeated the words in cadence with each step a maledictionand a benison he moved strongly steadily toward the light
