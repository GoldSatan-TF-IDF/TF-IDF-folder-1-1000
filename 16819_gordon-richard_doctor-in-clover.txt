richard gordon doctor in clover first published in you may be surprised to hear i announced to my cousin mr miles grimsdyke frcs that ive decided to do the decent thing and settle down in general practice do i attribute this decision to a severer sense of professional duty or to a severer hangover than usual neither but all my chums from st swithins seem to be installing wives and families and washing machines and it seems high time i did the same take my old friend simon sparrow for instance why in the days of our youth we got chucked out of pubs together and now his idea of whooping it up on a saturday night is taking the lawnmower to pieces believe me im going to become dear old dr grimsdyke the chap whos brought half the district into the world and pushed the other half out of it beloved by all until its time to collect oldage pension and chiming clock from grateful patients i suppose you realize gaston how difficult it is these days to get into general practice of course quite as bad as getting into the test matches but not for fellows like me who know the ropes youve heard of palethorpe and wedderburn the medical employment agents miles frowned the people in drury lane i have never had recourse to them myself i happen to know old palethorpe personally we met last summer on an occasion when i was able to offer him valuable professional advice i didnt mention to my cousin wed run into each other at sandown park races where i put palethorpe on such a good thing hed kept my medical career close at heart ever since unfortunately miles has no sense of humour its the tragedy of modern life that so many peopledictators tax collectors tennis champions teddy boys and so onseem to have no sense of humour either if you really intend to settle down my cousin continued i might say i am delighted that you have chosen this particular moment to do so in fact i will confess that is exactly why i invited you for lunch today more greens one should keep up ones vitamin c this time of the year enough is enough thank you it was one of those beastly days in midwinter when dusk chases dawn briskly across the london rooftops and fog was hazing even the chilly halls of the parthenon club where we sat the parthenon in st jamess struck me as about as comfortable for lunching in as the main bookinghall at euston station but miles was one of the newest members and as proud of the place as if it were the house of lords i supposed it fitted into his selfportrait of the upandcoming young surgeon he was a small bristly chap generally regarded as embodying the brains of the family who had just reached that delicate stage in a surgical career when your car is large enough to excite the confidence of your patients but not the envy of your colleagues and how exactly are you earning your living at this moment miles went on i have many irons in the fire i told him though i must confess the fire isnt too hot theres my medical articles for the popular press to start with miles frowned again i cant say ive noticed any theyre all signed by a harley street specialist of course it would be gross professional misconduct to put my own name you certainly show a remarkable ingenuity for practising without actually doing any medicine which just proves what ive always heldmedicines a jolly good general education it teaches you the working of everything from human nature to sewage farms not to mention all those little bits of latin and greek which are so useful in the crosswords but you must realize gaston the time has come to put this freeandeasy existence behind you for good youre not a mountebank of an undergraduate any more you must now maintain the dignity of a qualified practitioner oh i agree with you being a medical student is really the worst possible training for becoming a doctor miles dropped his voice below the hushed whisper permissible for conversation in the parthenon i am now going to tell you something in the strictest confidence oh yes mr sharper at st swithins is to become professor of surgery at calgary university really i hope he enjoys crawling about in the snow potting all those bears that isnt the point there will therefore be an unexpected vacancy on the surgical consultant staff i shall in due course be applying for it as mr sharpers own senior registrar i do not flatter myself in believing my chances are excellent he helped himself to another boiled potato though as you know considerations other than the strictly surgical sometimes weigh strongly with the selection committee i nodded i remember one chap was turned down because he wore knickerbockers and arrived for the interview on a motorbike quite so to be perfectly frank gaston it might embarrass me if you simply continued to flit about the medical scene my dear old lad i hadnt realized this worried him sufficiently to stand me a lunch i may be a poor risk for a fivebob loan but you can always rely on me to help a kinsman a couple of weeks to say farewell to the haunts of my misspent youth and ill have made myself scarce from london for good miles still looked doubtful i hope the permanency of your new position is more durable than some of your others they were mere flirtations with work this is the real thing and everyone will say see how that steady chap miles has put even old gaston grimsdyke on his feet if that is indeed so im much indebted to you we may not always have seen eye to eye gaston oh come every family has its little misunderstandings but i assure you i have always acted entirely for your own good and what precisely is this position you have in mind gp up north i explained i had been in palethorpes office that morning when hed greeted me with the news i have exactly the right opening for you dr grimsdyke general practice in the midlandsthe backbone of england you know assistant wanted with a view as we say start end of january dr wattle of porterhampton a very fine man it doesnt matter what the doctors like i told him how about his wife palethorpe chuckled how i wish our other clients were half as perspicacious fortunately mrs wattle accompanied the doctor when he called and i can assure you that she is a highly respectable and motherly middleaged lady nubile daughters it is their sorrow to be a childless couple alas i believe that is why they particularly asked me to find some decent honest upright wellmannered single young practitioner to share their home with them i can only hope you come as a nice surprise muttered my cousin when i told him at last i feel set for a peaceful and prosperous career i went on enlarging on my prospects a little who knows what the future holds the dear old wattles might take me to their bosoms they might look upon me as a son to enlighten their declining years they might send for their solicitors and start altering their wills there should be plenty of lolly about in porterhampton too they make turbines or something equally expensive up there my dear gaston you know you really must grow out of this habit of counting your chickens before the hens even ovulated whats wrong with a little imagination i protested lord lister and alexander fleming wouldnt have got far without it anyway at the moment roots are fairly sprouting from my feet like spring carrots until then porterhampton was just another entry in my football pools but a fortnight later i found myself driving past the town hall on a morning as crisp as an icicle and pretty solemn i felt about it too while lunching with miles id been putting an optimistic face on a pretty desperate situation which is another of the useful things you learn from studying medicine i didnt really like the prospect of being a respectable provincial doctor in fact i didnt really like the prospect of being a doctor at all i was a medecin malgr–π lui id taken up the profession because nobody in the family ever had the originality to think of anything else and anyway all my uncles and cousins seemed to have a pleasant time of it with large cars and everyone listening to their opinions at cocktail parties but with medicine and marriage the earlier you go in for either the riskier the project becomes quite a different chap emerges at the end of the course from the applecheeked lad with big ideas who went in its great fun at first of course being casualty houseman in a clean white coat with all the nurses saying good morning doctor even if the job does consist mostly of inspecting unpleasant things brought along in little white enamel bowls its a bit of a shock finding afterwards that youve got to make a living at it though i suspect a good many housemen feel the same and keep pretty quiet the public doesnt much care for entrusting their lives to doctors who dont love their profession even though they entrust them every day to bus drivers and no one expects a bus driver to love his bus but as i couldnt go exploring like dr livingstone become a prime minister of france like dr clemenceau or play cricket like dr w g grace i had to find a steady job like everyone else and what of these wattles i wondered as i drove past the porterhampton fish market they might at that moment be hopping about like a small boy waiting for the postman on his birthday or they might be plotting to kick me about like a medical tweeny fortunately for my low psychological state i was soon reassured over my conditions of work i found the wattles house somewhere on the far outskirts in a road of roomy victorian villas apparently reserved for prosperous turbinemakers as i drew up in the bentley the motherly mrs wattle herself appeared at the gate dear dr grimsdyke she greeted me were so delighted youve decided to bury yourself in our rather sleepy little town charming place im sure mr palethorpe spoke so highly of you you know im awfully glad he persuaded you to come but you must be tired after your long drive ill show you to your room and theres a nice lunch ready as soon as my husband gets in from his rounds i slipped off my overcoat dear dear no buttons on your shirt doctor you must let me have it tonight and any socks and things that need darning just leave them on the kitchen table my room ran a bit to chintz and watercolours of st ives but seemed very cosy there was a bookcase full of detective stories a desk and a large double bed already airing with a hotwater bottle like an oldfashioned gingerbeer jar going downstairs after tidying up i found roast beef and yorkshire on the table with apple pie and stilton waiting on the sideboard im sure youd care for a bottle of beer today cooed mrs wattle mr palethorpe said you took the occasional glass id met dr wattle himself only for a brief interview in london and he was a little pink perspiring chap with a bald head resembling a freshlyboiled egg delighted to see you my dear doctor he shook hands warmly we may call you gaston may we i hope youll be very happy with us is that your car outside very dashing of you to drive an old open tourer but do take my wifes morris when its raining wont you would you care for an advance of salary well sort out your duties later if you ever want time off for anything dont hesitate to ask your chairs over here gaston sure youre not in a draught i hope youll find my wifes cooking to your taste the roast beefs not overdone anything special you fancy to eat do please let us know horseradish asked mrs wattle later we had crumpets for tea and finnan haddock for supper and in the evening we all three sat round the fire making light conversation mr palethorpe revealed you had quite a roguish wit said mrs wattle playfully shaking her finger so i told them the story about the bishop and the parrot though of course altering the anatomical details a bit how pleasant to hear a young voice in the house murmured her husband weve so missed company in the evenings ever since the dog died agreed dr wattle after years of living on tins of baked beans and packets of potato crisps and mending my own socks by pulling a purse string suture round the hiatus it did my physiology no end of good to have regular meals and all the buttons on my shirts there wasnt even much work to do old wattle himself handling all the posher patients and leaving me with a succession of kids in the usual epidemic of mumps after surgery and supper we all three gathered for the evening in the sittingroom sometimes we watched the telly sometimes we played threehanded whist sometimes they asked me to tell the story of the bishop and the parrot all over again i was glad to see the wattles had quite a sense of humour but even the prodigal son once theyd used up all the fatted calf must have hankered to waste just a bit more of his substance on riotous living as the local amenities ran largely to municipal parks and museums and so on and as i couldnt go to any of the pubs because i was a respectable gp or to any of the pictures because id seen them all months ago in the west end i longed for one final glimpse of the lively lights of london dr wattle i announced one morning when id been enjoying three square meals a day for several weeks i wonder whether youd mind if i popped down to town this saturday ive just remembered ive got some laundry to collect my dear boy go whenever and wherever you wish thats jolly civil of you awfully annoying and all that but id better make the trip the following saturday evening found me once again in the genial glow of piccadilly circus breathing the carcinogenic hydrocarbons and watching the neon sunrise as the lights came on i dont think theres any sensation to compare with arriving in london after a spell of exile even if its only your summer holidays i felt id never seen anything so beautiful as the submarine glow of the misty streetlamps heard anything as cheerful as the nightly torrent ebbing towards the suburbs nor smelt any perfume so sweet as the reek of a london transport omnibus but i couldnt waste time admiring the scenery and went to a telephone box looked through my little black book then rang up petunia bancroft petunia was a little brunette and an actress ive had a weakness for the stage ever since i was a medical student and nearly eloped with a young woman who was sawn in two twice nightly by a palladium conjurer until i discovered that she was in fact a pair of young women and id picked the half with the shocking varicose veins petunia had been a chum of mine for many years though unfortunately her ideas of entertainment rather exceeded her theatrical standingusually she just walked on the stage and announced dinner was ready but after the show she knocked back champagne like the great leading ladies when the stuff was five bob a bottle also she had a rather hysterical personality and was likely to throw the dessert about and bite the head waiter but after a month in porterhampton petunia seemed just what i needed darling id love to meet you she agreed dont come to the show its lousy and closing any minute anyway see you at the stage door after ten the london streets were as deserted as porterhampton on a sunday afternoon by the time i took petunia home to balhamlike most glamorous hotsies these days she lived quietly with mum and did the washingup before catching the bus to the theatre wed had a pleasant little evening what with supper and a nightclub and even if it did demolish dr wattles advance of salary i was feeling like a sailor after ninety days at sea lovely time darling said petunia at the garden gate when are you coming to live in london again one day perhaps when i retire when you retire but darling i wont ever recognize you then ill have a chiming clock under my arm i told her nightnight the next morning i made my way back to the provinces for good having wrapped all the sunday newspapers in a large brownpaper parcel which i labelled the evercleen laundry washes whiter this little jaunt of mine was a mistake one taste of metropolitan delights had ruined my appetite for porterhampton for good id tried really hard to fool myself i could merge with the local landscape now i realized i couldnt be comfortable anywhere in the world outside harrods free delivery area i faced endless evenings watching the television and talking to the wattles and that night the prospect of both made me feel rather sickly over supper but i had to stay in the place until the st swithins committee had shaken my cousin by the hand and told him where to hang his umbrella and anyway the dear old couple were so terribly decent id never have forgiven myself for hurting their feelings over it dr wattle i began when we were alone after the meal i dont know if ive told you before but ive decided to work for a higher medical degree i hope youll not think me rude if i go to my room in the evenings and open the books he laid a hand on my arm i am delighted dear boy delighted thatunlike so many young men these days inside and out of our professionyou should take a serious view of your work there was a catch in his voice we are all mortal gaston he went on in another few years i may no longer be here oh come come the prime of life and i should like you to be well qualified when you eventually take over this practice my wife and i have become very attached to you these few short weeks as you know we have no children of our own as a young man i suffered a severe attack of mumps jolly hard luck i sympathized the mump virus of course can wreck your endocrine glands if youre unlucky enough to get the fullblown complications if all goes well he ended i hope you will inherit more from me than merely my work i will detain you no longer from your studies the rest of the week i sat in my room reading detective stories and pretty beastly i felt about it too then one morning mrs wattle stopped me outside the surgery door gaston my husband and i had a little chat about you last night oh yes we fear that you must find it rather dull in porterhampton not at all i replied wondering if some revelling turbinemaker had spotted me in that nightclub theres always something happening i told her the assizes last week the antilitter campaign this i mean socially why you never met any young people at all it hadnt occurred to me that in porterhampton there were any so next saturday evening ive arranged a little party for you i do hope you can spare the time from your studies naturally i said i should be delighted though spending the rest of the week steeling myself for the sort of celebration to make a curates birthday look like a night out in tangier when saturday came i put on my best suit and waited for the guests among the claret cup and sandwiches determined to make the evening a success for the dear old couples sake i would be heartily chummy all round and ask the local lads intelligent questions about how you made turbines heres the first arrival announced mrs wattle miss carmichael she introduced a short girl in a pink dress and here come miss symes and miss patcham i shook hands politely with miss hodder and miss atkinson walking up the drive thats everyone she explained gaston do tell us your terribly amusing story about the clergyman and the parrot it struck me as an odd gathering but old wattle handed out the drinks while i sat on the sofa and entertained the girls and after a bit i quite warmed to it i told them the other one about the old lady and the bus driver and a few more that i hadnt picked up from the boys at st swithins and they all laughed very prettily and asked me what it was like being a doctor i was quite sorry when eventually midnight struck and everyone seemed to think it time to close down im sure gaston would drop you at your homes in his remarkable car suggested mrs wattle with a good deal of giggling i discarded girls at various respectable front doors in the district until i was finally left with only one in the seat beside me im afraid i live right on the other side of the town gaston the farther it is the more im delighted i replied politely she was the miss atkinson a little blonde whod given the parrot story an encore quite an enchanting evening i murmured but you were so terribly amusing i always thought medicos such stodgy old things even the young ones i gave a little laugh we doctors are only human you know im so glad she said after leaving her at another respectable door i hurried home for some sleep nothing takes it out of you quite so much as telling a lot of funny stories i know youll be pleased announced mrs wattle a few mornings later ive asked little avril atkinson to supper very pleased indeed i told her courteously the fact is id have been pleased whoever theyd asked even my cousin by then id discovered the dear old wattles were incapable of conversation about anything except happenings in porterhampton which if you hadnt lived in the place for thirty years was like trying to enjoy a play after arriving in the second interval it did me no end of good to hear another voice at table even if they did make me tell the story of the ruddy parrot from the beginning after the meal i announced that my studies could slide for another evening and politely joined the company in the sittingroom then dr wattle suddenly remembered he had a patient to see and ma wattle had the washingup to do leaving avril and me on the sofa alone how about the television i suggested avrils conversation being almost as straitjacketed as the wattles oh lets its my favourite programme tonight i switched on the set turned down the lights and when wed watched a few parlour games and chaps pretending to get fierce with each other over the political situation i very civilly drove her home do you like classical music gaston asked mrs wattle a few mornings later im not adverse to a basinful of beethoven from time to time i admitted im so pleased ive got a ticket for our little amateur orchestra next friday in the town hall would you care to go i was glad of an excuse to go out in the evening now being rather bored with all those stories about chaps killing other chaps by highly complicated means as i sat down among the potted municipal palms i found avril in the next seat quite a coincidence i remarked she smiled you have such a sense of humour gaston wasnt it nice of mrs wattle to give us the tickets oh yes quite the dear old thing seemed to be getting forgetful which i put down to the normal hormonal changes in a woman of her age the next few days were brightened by excitement over the great event in professional circles at porterhampton the annual medical dinner as the wattles seemed to find this a combination of the chelsea arts ball and the lord mayors banquet to please the dear old couple i agreed to put on a dinner jacket and accompany them though personally nothing depresses me quite so much as a lot of other doctors i had just eased into my chair in the ballroom of the commercial hotel when i realized that i was once more sitting next to avril atkinson so nice of dr wattle to have invited me she began are you going to make a speech with your terribly funny stories not for me im afraid though the fat chap with the microphone has a wad of papers in his pocket the size of an auctioneers catalogue remarkable isnt it how men find so much to say after dinner when their wives havent had a word out of them for years over breakfast she giggled gaston youre terribly witty just wait till youve heard the fat chap the guest on my other side having nothing to talk about except the progress of his patients and his putting i passed the meal chatting lightly to avril and when the floods of oratory had subsided took her home in my car you simply must come in and meet daddy she invited her father was a decent old boy who gave me a whisky and soda and seemed intelligently interested in the national health servicerates of pay prospects of promotion for young practitioners and so on i put him right on a few points and went home with the pleasant feeling that id done my social duty by the dear old wattles pretty thoroughly i suppose im a trusting sort of soul strangers at race meetings sell me useless tips at a quid a go motorists miss me by inches on zebra crossings i cash dud cheques for fellows i meet in pubs small boys have me in knots on april the first but it was probably the soporific effect of life in porterhampton which delayed tumbling to my plight until the morning i was called to treat the girl with the pink dress from my party for mumps whens it to be announced asked this miss carmichael as i removed the thermometer from her mouth what announced dont play the innocent doctor everyone in porterhampton has known about it for weeks your engagement to avril atkinson of course avril atkinson i picked up the bits of shattered thermometer from the floor but dash it thats ridiculous i hardly know the girl now now youre always being seen together at concerts and dinners and things as for the time she went to the wattles for supperphew she told me all about it sitting alone all evening on the sofa in the dark i drove straight home and confronted ma wattle so dame rumour hath been at work she said coyly i am delighted gaston for your sake you see my husband and i felt we were selfish monopolizing your cheery company now youre settling down here its only right and proper you should take unto yourself a wife unlike us your later years will be comforted with sons and daughters whom we shall look upon almost as our own grandchildren im afraid ive rather been playing the matchmaker but im so glad you chose avril such a jolly girl the pair of you are ideally suited i had nothing to say i went to my room i paced up and down and glared at st ives i sat on the double bed and bit my nails i wished id taken the advice of the dean at st swithins and made my career in the prison medical service i certainly didnt want to pass the rest of my life in porterhampton even if old wattle bequeathed me the town hall as well i certainly didnt want to marry avril atkinson whod probably make me tell the story of the parrot every morning over breakfast now i couldnt see how to avoid either ive often read in psychology books about the acute anxiety state but i never really understood it until then then i had one of those masterly ideas that sometimes come before the bell rings at the end of examinations mrs wattledr wattle i appeared downstairs to find both of them in the sittingroom i have something very painful to confess they looked alarmed i am already married i felt this was the simplest way out it was beyond me to tell the dear old couple that their own idea of my spouse was as ridiculous as picking the matron of st swithins with a bit of luck theyd kick me out on the spot and possibly use up avril on my replacement my wife works in london she is a nurse a night nurse i couldnt reveal her before becausebecause the position which i have the honour to hold was advertised for a single man i needed the work i sounded so pathetic i felt quite sorry for myself if you will give me a few minutes to pack i ended solemnly i shall remove my unworthy self from your lives for ever how unreasonable ive been cried mrs wattle and burst into tears weve deliberately set asunder two who have been joined together added dr wattle beating his bald head you must ask your wife to come at once gaston ill double your salary well give you the run of the house till you find a place of your own all this might be rather inconvenient i interjected quickly my wifes working every night important private case then bring her for the day insisted mrs wattle how about lunch on saturday yes agreed dr wattle we shall be terribly upset if you dont i felt the script had somehow got out of hand perhaps it might have been easier simply to have married avril the following saturday morning the wattles house was twittering with expectation id better be off i announced as the roast pork and stuffing sizzled in the oven her trains due in twenty minutes do greet her with these chrysanthemums gaston mrs wattle pushed a bunch the size of a sheaf of corn into my arms theyre fresh out of the greenhouse and im sure shell love them and im quite sure were both simply going to adore her i parked the car in the station yard bought a platform ticket and thoughtfully munched a bar of chocolate from a machine i sat on a bench and read the paper until the train arrived peering through the passengers i soon spotted the familiar red hat hello i called hope you didnt have a beastly journey it was stinking welcome to porterhampton and what a dump too the city has several charming features i assure you though i shant be able to provide much of a conducted tour as your train homes at nineten thank god for that what on earth have you got in your arms theyre chrysanthemums from the greenhouse you look as though youve lost your street barrow i think wed better get off the platform i might be spotted by one of my patients i led petunia bancroft to the car ive had some pretty funny parts in my time petunia complained as we drove away but this one makes the crazy gang look like the old vic its perfectly simple i reassured her youve only to play the doctors wife straight to an accomplished actress like you pet my dear its as easy as selling theatre programmes if i hadnt been out of work i wouldnt have sniffed twice at the idea believe you me regard it as a professional challenge costume all right perfect for the part i thought id better leave off my ankle bracelet cant say ive seen a nurse wearing one supposing this old fellowwhats his nameasks a lot of questions with long medical words and that what the hell am i supposed to say leave it to me anyway all hes likely to talk about is our epidemic of mumps just remember the time you had it yourself i havent neither have i good job in your case i smiled might possibly have mucked up your hormones she asked how so i gave a brief dissertation on the pathology and virology of mumps until we arrived at the wattles front gate petunia i announced your cue i was pretty worried about the performance though i didnt let on to petunia another of the useful things you learn from studying medicine is radiating cheerful confidence all round while wondering what the devils going to happen next but i must say she created the part of mrs grimsdyke magnificently in half an hour the old couple were all over her where did you train my dear asked dr wattle as we sat down to lunch oh at rada said petunia he looked puzzled that seems a hospital i havent heard of an affectionate name for the royal diabetic i told him is it really dear me i never knew one learns something every day and what is the trouble with this important case your husband tells us youre nursing erfoot and mouth disease attacking a human good gracious me how extraordinary ive never heard of such a thing before in my life petunia means the poor fellow is down in the mouth because hes got one foot in the grave quite a common nurses expression is it indeed of course youve had more recent contact with such things than i gaston how one hates to be thought behind the times i must try it out at the next bma meeting i expect my dear youve had wide experience nursing cases of mumps but i neatly managed to steer the conversation away from shop and as the afternoon wore on i felt my troubles were sorting themselves out splendidly the old couples feelings were saved i was out of the matrimonial target area and i could make a leisurely exit from porterhampton as soon as miles was safely on the st swithins staff besides i now had a handy excuse for nipping down to london any weekend i felt like it my train goes in about an hour petunia reminded me when wed reached the cold ham supper stage what a shame you cant stay longer sighed mrs wattle petunia has to be on duty at midnight i explained as a matter of fact i might as well be getting the car out i opened the front door and a nasty complication to my little plan rolled all over me i suppose this country wouldnt be the same if it werent dosed regularly through the winter with fog can you imagine such national heroes as sherlock holmes or jack the ripper prowling about on nice mild summer evenings how would dickens characters have looked in the neapolitan sunlight or the dear old houses of parliament shining like the taj mahal our national character gets regularly tested by the frightful complications of fogs particularly the great big grey thing that rose like a wall of dirty muslin from the front doorstep id better telephone british railways i muttered the word trains evoked only a mystified silence on the wire the midday hasnt turned up yet from manchester said the fellow at the station and where the morning express from glasgows got to nobody knows if you want your prospects of getting to london tonight sir theyre nil its the biggest and thickest weve had this century according to the wireless so now petunia will have to stay till morning said ma wattle smiling benevolently but thats impossible she cried has to be back to her case i explained quickly surely under such circumstances a replacement could be found in london insisted dr wattle petunia stamped her foot gaston can drive me only into the first ditch im afraid i absolutely and positively i managed to shut petunia up the wattles clearly thinking this rather odd behaviour for a pair of lovebirds dont worry my dearest i pretended to give her a tender kiss leave it to me i hissed in her ear ill get you out of it im not worrying at all my sweet youd blasted well better she hissed back we all sat down and looked at the television i spent the rest of the evening trying to concoct some fogproof excuse should i pretend to perforate a duodenal ulcer or set light to the house or simply make a clean breast of it on the hearthrug i rejected each one they would all upset the wattles too much in short nothing i could evolve by tenthirty prevented the pair of us being ushered by ma wattle into my room with two hotwater bottles in the double bed you dirty little stinker started petunia as soon as the door was shut this is the meanest and nastiest trick for lords sake dont make so much noise were supposed to be a devoted couple id like you to understand dr grimsdyke that i am most definitely not that sort of a girl i know i know but if youll only give me a moments peace i can sort the whole thing out no one is sorrier than i nobody will be by the time my brothers hear about this i cant help the ruddy fog can i anyone would think id put it there myself petunia threw herself on the bed and started pounding the eiderdown youve got to get me out of here at once i tell you in five minutes otherwise ill smash the window and scream for the police pet im doing my best there must be some way of ill scream i will ill wake all the neighbours you just listen she drew a deep breath for gods sake pet the telephone rang in the hall hold off the sound effects till ive answered it i hissed dr grimsdyke said a womans voice on the line speaking you swine you cad you beast you bigamist now just a second if youll tell me whos speaking you know perfectly well whos speaking avril of course im only ringing to inform you that tomorrow morning im starting a breach of promise suit thatll blow you out of porterhampton so hard you wont stop till you reach the white cliffs of dover which i hope youll drop over and break your filthy neck let me tell you but i can explain absolutely everything i insisted cant i come round in the morning and see you you most certainly cant come anywhere near me apart from everything else im in bed with mumps which i caught at your beastly party and ive changed my cards to another doctor you just wait till my brother comes on leave from the commandos good night in the space of five minutes id been abused by two women and threatened with assault from their relatives which i felt was a record even for chaps like bluebeard but the telephone had given me an idea i tapped on the wattles door ive been called to a case i explained i dont expect ill be long wrapping a scarf round my neck and pocketing a tin of cough lozenges from the surgery i set out to spend the night in the fog while petunia tucked herself cosily into the double bed the fog was lifting as i tramped back to the wattles home id coughed my way into the darkness with no particular object except keeping alive till morning about a hundred yards from the house id wandered into the main road to london where i met a chap whod lost his lorry he remembered a place in the area called clems caff which we found by walking an hour or so along the white line the caff sported a coke stove and was full of lorry drivers in steaming overcoats resembling overworked horses i bought a cup of tea which seemed to entitle me to sleep on the table like everyone else about fivethirty i woke up feeling as if id just been released from the rack in the tower i crept inside the house tapped softly at the bedroom door and petunia let me in you look as if youve just come off everest she said i hope you passed a good night yourself i replied shortly absolutely adorable i havent been so warm for months she was already up and dressed and seemed more amenable than the evening before poor gaston are you sure you wont catch your death i wouldnt really care at the moment if i did im sorrybut it wasnt really my fault was it perhaps you could have slept on the floor behind the wardrobe or something i think it was a far far better thing that i did you know there really is something of the sidney carton about you dear no other man i know would have been half so noble anyway its all over now the fogs thinning rapidly and as far as i remember theres a good train about five on sunday afternoons if you can stick it out till then im sure i can said petunia its really awfully cosy here you do look pale this morning giggled mrs wattle when i appeared at breakfast i hope you got plenty of sleep the day passed without mishap petunia seemed quite to enjoy herself sitting about the house reading magazines and in the afternoon i drove her to see the town hall the waterworks the bus depot and the new abattoir quite a pretty little place after all she remarked as i pulled up outside the municipal baths its a wonder ive never been here on tour would you like to see the statue of the first mayor yes please said petunia after tea and dundee cake i looked at my watch and announced to the wattles perhaps my wife ought to be getting ready were due at the station in half an hour but isnt there a later train darling asked petunia i could always catch that theres the eight fortytwo i told her looking surprised and the ten six ill take the ten six a far better idea agreed ma wattle a few more hours together mean so much at your age dont they shortly afterwards we were left alone as a matter of fact we were always being left alone and dr wattle must have got awfully tired of sitting in his cold consultingroom whats the idea petunia i demanded at once i thought you couldnt get out of the place quick enough she helped herself to a cigarette from the silver box gaston she said ive been thinking i flicked the wattles table lighter thinking what that this is the nicest part ive ever played you were a great success at it thank you very much and now for the final curtain but do you know why i was a success ive just realized it myself it was because i felt the parthere she indicated her midsternal region thats essential for all highclass acting so they tell me petunia sat on the sofa do you remember gaston what you told me in that nightclub the last time we were out together remembering what chaps tell them in nightclubs is another illustration of how women are congenitally defective in sportsmanship that i was the dearest and sweetest girl youd ever met and how you wished you could live in my arms for ever ah yes perhaps gaston dear you didnt think i took your remarks seriously of course i did as far as i remembered she was hitting someone on the head with a balloon at the time its terrible how i have to disguise my feelings my sweet we actresses must always put our career first we can never enjoy the simple home life of other women its awfully tragic i think youre perfectly right i told her briskly wonderful thing devotion to ones vocation youll never regret it once youre a famous star with half london at your feet id never be a famous star not someone like monica fairchild with every manager in london fighting over her its no good fooling myself id just continue with walkingon parts and live with mum year in and year out except for a few weeks on tour in miserable theatrical boardinghouses oh come youre just a bit depressive for the moment i bet sarah bernhardt felt exactly the same dozens of times but seeing you here petunia went on flicking her ash over the bearskin rug in your dear little home in this sweet little town has opened my eyes my racket isnt worth the candle i want to settle down but this isnt my dear little home i argued its dr wattles dear little home as for the town i came here intending to settle for life and now i wouldnt even touch it for bed and breakfast it would send a girl like you crackers in less than she got up and stood so near me i could see the arteries in her conjunctivae this last twentyfour hours ive realized how wonderful it is being your wife but dash it youre not my youre so sweet so modest so honourable so upright so tender so considerate gaston darling ive decided to accept you we can get married secretly in some registry office sorry to disturb the nest of lovebirds ma wattle chuckled entering at that moment i just wondered if your wife would like some nice hot soup for supper to brace her for her journey mrs wattle petunia turned to face her im not going i must stay with my husband ill send a telegram to london and resign my job my mother can send on my things tomorrow im absolutely delighted exclaimed the old dear embracing us as i always say a womans place is at her husbands side come what may of course my children you may stay with us as long as you wish ill just put the kettle on for your hotwater bottles i expect after such excitements youll both be wanting to go early to bed if i wasnt keen on marrying avril id rather have swallowed the entire poisons cupboard before marrying petunia an agreeable companion for a gay night out certainly but you cant make a life partner of a woman who keeps trying to conduct the band with sticks of celery you havent eaten your nice soup gaston said ma wattle at supper not very hungry im afraid what a wonderful thing love is i was nearly sick over the sliced brawn i was edgy and jumpy the rest of the evening which of course the idiotic wattles put down to passion or the expectation thereof worst of all the mental trauma of the past two days seemed to have beaten my brain into paralysis nothing i could contrive by ten oclock prevented petunia and myself again being shown into my bedroom alone at last breathed petunia yes but only for a couple of shakes i told her smartly as soon as the wattles have bedded down im going to skip it into the night again but gaston surely youre not going to leave your wife pet you chump youre not my wifeonly on the programme let me make it perfectly clear im not going to stay with you up here how honourable you are she breathed how fine how different the grimsdykes of course have their honour but i must admit i wouldnt have objected to the same arrangement if wed been in a hotel at brighton instead of the wattles spare bedroom under prevailing circumstances the only place for me was clems caff well be married tomorrow if you like she said starting to unzip her dress a girl friend of mine once got a special licence terribly easily petunia you dont understand i understand everything darling youre a wonderfully honest man and i shall love you more and more as the years go by about twenty minutes later i was sitting again over one of clems cups of tea i woke at fivethirty the next morning so ill from the effects of prolonged exposure that i would almost have married petunia on the spot for a comfortable nights rest in my own bed i got back to the house shivering and with a shocking headache and found dr wattle in the hall just come in from seeing the mayors gout he greeted me i didnt know youd been called out too i never heard the phone it was someone with fits difficult diagnosis took a lot of time you dont look very perky my boy are you sure youre all right bit chilly this night air perhaps id better take your temperature as he removed the thermometer from my mouth he asked ever had mumps well im afraid you have now mumps i cried butbut that means isolation im afraid so youll have to stay in your room your wife hasnt had it either then youd better be strictly alone ill go up and break the sad news its best for you not to breathe over the poor child petunias rather alarmed about it explained dr wattle returning with some surprise she seemed remarkably upset over those hormonal complications i told her how terribly rare they are but shes still awfully agitated keeps saying it would ruin her career i shouldnt have thought it would have mattered much one way or another to a nurse however its none of my business well make you up a bed in the attic i slept for twentyfour hours which dr wattle later wrote a letter about to the bmj entitled unusual stupor in epidemic parotitis petunia spent the morning gargling then disappeared for london as soon as my lumps were down i announced i must go to the seaside for convalescence and sent a wire from london explaining id been summoned to a dying uncle in south africa i felt pretty sorry for myself id broken a couple of girlish hearts had a nasty illness and expected hourly to be assaulted by commandos and so on in the street porterhampton had thenceforward to be blotted from my atlas and now i had to explain it all to my cousin but at least i never hurt the dear old wattles feelings from your appearance started miles you would seem to have finished some protracted party if you must know i replied rather hurt ive had a nasty attack of epidemic parotitis ive hardly got over it yet im sorry it being one of my principles always to confess my shortcomings promptly particularly if theyre likely to be discovered pretty quickly anyway id telephoned miles on arrival and invited myself to dinner i now sat in his south kensington drawingroom wondering how best to explain the retreat from porterhampton and when are you returning to your practice asked miles i shifted on the sofa as a matter of fact old lad im not what damn it youve not been thrown out already thrown out i looked offended i resigned with the dignity of a highprincipled cabinet minister miles fell silent to fill the gap i reached for a magazineone of the shiny ones which report the activities of all our bestbred young women and horses thats what i need i said indicating a photograph of people with long drinks on a yacht at cannes a few weeks in the sunshine to buck me up miles made a noise like a tearing sheet of canvas damnation gaston are you mad are you fit for some institution here you areout of work penniless a walking disgrace to your family if not to your entire profession and you ramble about weeks in the sunshine really i tossed the magazine aside with a sigh the trouble is youre perfectly right i admitted im not the shining figure of the eager young doctor youre the shining figure of the shiftless young wastrel and i dont mind telling you i seriously advise you to see a psychiatrist he might at least be able to explain your highly unstable occupational history the fact is old lad i dont need a psychiatrist to tell me that i dont like medicine very much miles stared as though i were cinderella telling the fairy godmother she didnt care greatly for dancing at porterhampton the dear old couple handed me every chance to settle down as a respectable family man and family doctor but do i want to be the modern gp signing certificates for all the uninteresting patients and hospital letters for all the interesting ones no i jolly well dont and neither do a lot of other chaps judging by the correspondence in the bmj as ill never be a specialist in anything and i couldnt possibly sit in the town hall with a map of the local sewers doing public health there isnt much left the trouble is im temperamentally unsuited to my work but think of all those years of studywasted theyre not wasted a bit i argued look at all the famous chaps whove benefited from a medical educationleonardo da vinci john keats chekhov and so on not to mention crippen you must quite definitely see a psychiatrist and meanwhile how precisely are you going to earn your bread ah yes i agree thats the problem further discussion about my professional future was prevented by the appearance of miles wife how charming youre back so soon gaston she greeted me we quite thought youd gone to seek your fortune up north i decided that opportunity taps less faintly in london connie im so glad now well see much more of you what did you say miles dear nothing nothing muttered miles i knew connie pretty well in fact once i was in love with her this happened when i was a student and miles had just qualified as mr sharpers junior casualty housesurgeon and pretty pleased with himself he felt about it too as i reflected during dinner that evening miles and i had never really hit it off at st swithins or even as kids miles was the one who didnt get his boots dirty always had his sums right wasnt sick at all the parties and didnt make a fuss about his tonsilectomy at school he used to make me blow up his football and toast his crumpets then i followed him to st swithins and like everyone else started medicine by dissecting the dogfish which has put me off fish suppers ever since miles was already well into the course and by the time i got as far as the anatomy rooms kept buttonholing me in the corridors with fatherly advice if you spent a little more time dissecting and a little less writing all those stupid jokes for the students magazine was his usual line you might show you were taking your career seriously i thought the last one was rather funny about the girl who said she suffered from claustrophobia because she had a terrible fear of confinement take it from me gaston youll regret this frivolity one day you stick to your anatomy its the grammar of medicine personally i disagreed i think they only fill medical students with anatomy like they used to fill kids with brimstone and treacle the experience is obviously so unpleasant everybody agrees it must be doing them good im not at all certain it isnt my duty to write to my father he generally ended my own father having unfortunately perished in the ramc i was brought up under a victorian system of guardians with dr rudolph grimsdyke as chief paymaster uncle rudolph practising at the time out east miles was his nark on the spot and i suppose he sneaked in the end because halfway through the course the old boy cut my allowance by half i know that ever since la boh–∫me its been thought rather romantic for students to starve in garrets holding the tiny frozen hands of their girlfriends but that sort of existence didnt appeal to me at all particularly as all the girls i knew seemed to complain shockingly of the draughts even in comfortable cocktail bars shortly after the onset of this financial anaemia miles qualified glittering with scholarships and prizes gaston he said getting me into a corner of the st swithins casualty department one winter afternoon i want a serious word with you oh yes id be much obliged if youd try to embarrass me a little less now that im on the st swithins junior staff you must realize that i at least dont wish the entire family to be made ridiculous throughout the hospital its bad enough your always disappearing to the dograces but this habit of taking menial employment my dear old lad i assure you i dont do it for fun anyway its all your old mans fault being so tightfisted surely you know by now i dislike work in any form whatever i was at the time restoring my enfeebled exchequer with such casual jobs as dishwashing in west end restaurants and barkeeping in east end pubs and had just finished a profitable though strictly limited run as father christmas in an oxford street store thats not the point at all mr sharper was certain he saw you the other day he was extremely blunt to me about it this morning oh really i thought his keen surgical eye had pierced the whiskers but i bet he only made a fuss because i told his beastly kids to ask for a complete set of electric trains and a couple of motorcars i do wish youd take this seriously gaston lets talk about it another time i must be off now im afraid otherwise ill be late for work a few days after this argument i met connie by accident all medical students dream of witnessing some really satisfactory road smash then appearing on the scene to calm the panicstricken bystanders with the magic words i am a doctor ive done it myself three times the first the policeman told me to run home to mother the second i grabbed a tourniquet from some fumbling old boy and discovered he was the professor of surgery at st asaphs now of course i walk rapidly in the opposite direction and leave it to the ambulance boys remembering sir lancelot spratts resuscitation lecturewhen i chuck myself into the thames in despair ladies and gentlemen i hope ill be given artificial respiration by a fit boy scout and not some middleaged medical practitioner whos soon more out of breath than i am but when one is young one doesnt consider such things on this third occasion as soon as i heard the scream of brakes and tinkling of glass i leapt into the middle of sloane square and took sole charge in the next part of the dream the injured party isnt a poor young child or a dear old lady but a beautiful girl having hysterics and thats exactly what i found so i popped her in a taxi and drove her round to the casualty entrance at st swithins where miles organized xrays diagnosed a colles fracture and signed an admission form for his ward charming girl too i observed as connie was wheeled away thank you gaston for holding the xrays always glad to help i might pop up and see her later terribly important to followup cases so they keep telling us mr sharper allows only his own students in his wards im afraid oh come cant you stretch a point a point being defined as possessing position but not magnitude is incapable of being stretched said miles all the same i went up the next morning with a bunch of roses how terribly sweet exclaimed connie looking beautiful despite the plaster and bandages and your assistants just called too with the mimosa assistant the doctor who helped you with the xrays ah yes useful chap the staff in modern hospitals outnumbering the patients by about five to one the inmates can be excused for confusing the ranks i remembered there was once a frightful row when sir lancelot spratt in a white coat was mistaken for the ward barber youll be out of here this afternoon i went on not bothering to start long explanations when time has healed all your wounds would you care to come out for a bite of dinner but id love to doctor jolly good ill get your telephone number from the ward notes unfortunately connie turned out to be the daughter of a shockingly rich fellow from lloyds so i couldnt buy her a pint of beer and show her the ducks in st jamess park and pretend id given her an exciting evening also i knew a determined chap like miles wouldnt easily give up while i was sitting with her a few weeks later in the savoy hoping she wouldnt feel like another drink i remarked casually seeing much of my cousin these days as a matter of fact yes im going to the theatre with him tomorrow it may be rather cheek of me to ask this connie but id rather you didnt mention me to him if you wouldnt mind she looked surprised why ever not just to save the poor chaps feelings these little family jealousies you know he feels it rather being my underling at the hospital how awfully considerate of you gaston naturally i wont say a word but supposing he talks about you he never does i assured her another martini yes please said connie i passed a couple of enjoyable months escorting connie to all the more fashionable plays and restaurants particularly as she still seemed to imagine that i was some wealthy young specialist and i never seemed to find the chance to put her right then one afternoon miles cornered me in the surgeons room i believe youve still been seeing connie he demanded i tossed my sterile gown into the students linen bin on and off yes id like you to know that iim perfectly serious about her this didnt disturb me miles was perfectly serious about everything may the best man win and all that eh damn it gaston i wish you wouldnt regard this as some sort of sporting contest i happen to love connie deeply i wish to make her my wife good lord do you really the notion of miles making anyone his wife seemed as odd as palm trees growing on an iceberg and ill thank you not to trifle with her affections he added you will will you i returned feeling annoyed at his tone and how do you know i dont want to make her mrs grimsdyke too you youre in no more position to marry than a fourthform schoolboy i felt the conversation was becoming embarrassing and edged away besides i had to be off to work again entertaining connie was making such inroads into my finances that id been obliged to find more regular employment fortunately id met a chap called pedro in a shaftesbury avenue pub and after giving him some free advice about his duodenal ulcer and a good thing for kempton park i was offered five evenings a week as a waiter in his soho restaurant pedro was a fierce taskmaster most of his relatives still chasing each other over sicilian mountains with shotguns and i had to clean all the soup off my best set of tails every night before going to bed but the tips were good enough compensation for both or they were until that particular evening when miles walked in with connie shall we sit over here she said advancing towards my corner i hate a table too near the door i ducked quickly into the kitchen what the ell are you up to demanded pedro ier just wanted to adjust my sock suspenders i dont pay you to adjust your socks mister you get back in there theres customers just come in i passed a hand across my forehead you know pedro i dont think im feeling very well tonight a bit faint i might be sick over the fish or something if you dont mind ill just totter through the staff entrance and make home to bed ow the ell you think i run my business one man short pedro picked up a carving knife you leave this restaurant only over your dead body see mister if you want to be sick come out and be sick in the kitchen like everybody else you go to work i edged back through the swing doors i slipped my menu and table napkin behind a bread basket and prepared to dash for the pavement id almost made the main entrance when connie glanced idly round and spotted me why its gaston hello there you dining here too miles turned round and scowled oh hello connie yes i am as a matter of fact expecting an old school chum chap called honeybank doesnt seem to have turned up charming little restaurant isnt it oh very you seem very dressed up muttered miles going on you know a ball and all that i think men look their best in tails remarked connie dont you miles what on earths dear pedro doing i thought dear pedro was probably putting that knife on the grinding machine but only murmured something about having to be off but if you havent eaten you must stay for a bite with us connie insisted im sure miles wouldnt mind not a bit growled miles it might be a little awkward actually but definitely gaston tell the waiter to bring another chair ah there you are pedro how is your lovely canneloni tonight delicious madame pedro came over rubbing his hands i stood on one foot leaning against the table dashed difficult striking an attitude simultaneously suggestive of helpful servility and longstanding chumminess and the osso buco it is excellent pedro added then shall we all have canneloni followed by osso bucoconnie looked inquiringly at miles and myself im terribly hungry two canneloni two osso buco snapped pedro in my ear didnt you ear what madame says how extraordinary repeating the order like that exclaimed miles just a little joke i explained as pedro backed away i know him very well connie sighed how lucky you are i cant imagine anything more useful in london than being friends with all the head waiters but gaston do sit down you make me feel uncomfortable standing about like that just a second if youll excuse me phone callthe school chum you know i slipped back to the kitchen what the ells the matter with you tonight demanded pedro you stick around with a silly grin on your face like a drunk monkey how you expect me to run my restaurant if you dont listen to the customers look pedro i really think i ought to be at home tucked up in bed take that in and don talk so much he handed me two dishes of canneloni good lord exclaimed miles youve brought the food yourself ha ha just another little joke dear old pedro you know i keep threatening a public health inspection of his kitchen and just nipped in to take him by surprise the canneloni was ready so i brought it along connie found this terribly amusing but gaston you havent a plate and do please sit down ill just prop on the back of this chair i edged myself into a position where i might be mistaken for serving the spinach they get so terribly crowded im sure pedro hasnt got a spare seat i dont think ill try any canneloni myself thanks but let me help you you serve quite professionally exclaimed connie jack of all trades you know are you sure youre quite all right tonight demanded miles oh fine thank you i felt that the situation was reasonably hopeful as long as they crammed down their blasted canneloni before pedro came back what were we talking about i suppose youve heard the story of the bishop and the parrot just then a voice behind me called waiter well you see this bishop had a parrot waiter and this parrot used to belong to an old lady who bought it from a sailor say waiter there isnt a waiter in sight interrupted connie never is when you want one grumbled miles i think hes an american who keeps shouting said connie and the old lady always used to keep it under a green baize cloth in the front parlour every morning shed take the cloth off the cage and every morning the parrot said hey waiter for chrissakes a fat man id just served with cigars and brandy appeared at my elbow excuse me folks i just wanted to tell the waiter here ive had a darned fine meal and darned fine service i reckon its the best ive struck since ive been in europe i was just getting on my way when i thought shucks i gotta give credit where credit is due thanks a lot son this is for you the beastly chap stuffed a pound note into my top pocket but how extraordinary exclaimed miles he thought you were the waiter laughed connie people never notice the fellows who serve them with food i mumbled conan doyle or edgar wallace or someone wrote a story about it but he did seem pretty definite miles gave me a nasty look oh miles you know what americans are said connie at that moment pedro appeared again i pretended to be arranging the flower vase everything all ri no said miles the waiter hasnt brought any grated parmesan with my canneloni pedro glared across the table zere is no grated cheese with the canneloni i glanced round for the cheese thing i might reach across for it with a little laugh thats exactly what i said miles returned it happens that im particularly fond of grated cheese with my canneloni so am i said connie there is no grated cheese with the canneloni shouted pedro in my direction good gracious man exclaimed miles dont yell at me like that i am not yelling at you like that monsieur i am yelling at im like that there is no grated cheese on the canneloni connie jumped up how dare you address my guests in that manner i am going to leave this restaurant this very instant pedro looked as if hed been hit in the neck with one of his own canneloni guests madame what guests youre fired he added to me i shall never eat here again and i shall tell all my friends not to eat here either come along miles treating our guest here as one of your waiters but damn it madame e is one of my waiters e come every night part time only five days a week i insisted gaston connie gave a little gasp is this really true i nodded the grimsdyke ingenuity had been beaten back to its own goalline i reached for my napkin and automatically flicked the tablecloth im not a doctor really i murmured im a student i take this on for a little extra dibs there was a silence connie started to laugh in fact she laughed so long she almost asphyxiated herself with a stick of italian bread in the end we all four thought it a tremendous joke even pedro but connie never looked at me the same way again and a fortnight later got engaged to miles i was pretty cut up about it at the time i suppose i often wonder how life would have turned out if miles had been more of a gentleman and taken her somewhere like the ritz the only compensation was that according to the american chap if i had to be a waiter i was a damn good one im afraid i was somewhat overoptimistic at the way things would go at st swithins announced miles connie had left us after providing a charming little dinner and i was guessing my chances of getting a cigar the appointment of sharpers successor has as usual got mixed up with hospital politics he stared gloomily into the fruit bowl sir lancelot spratt is making an infernal nuisance of himself on the committee he is opposing my candidature purely because mr cambridge is supporting it sir lancelot has quarrelled with him you know cambridge refuses to knock down his old clinical laboratory and sir lancelot wants to park his car there to think my future decided by a car park theres nothing like a mahogany table and a square of pink blottingpaper to bring out the worst in a chaps character i sympathized how about the other runners there are thirty other prospective candidates for the post all as well qualified as i but we are mere pawns mere cyphers perhaps i should apologize for being short with you earlier gaston the strain you know the uncertainty he miserably cracked a nut i felt sorry for the chap personally there was nothing id have liked less than being a consultant at st swithins having to wear a stiff collar every day and never being able to date up the nurses but it had been miles ambition ever since he was cutting up that dogfish and i rather felt that connie too fancied herself in a new hat running the hoopla with other consultants wives at the annual hospital f–∫te besides miles was the brightest young surgeon st swithins had seen for years and i should have felt a bit of a cad not helping so worthy a practitioner along the professional path if you didnt get on at st swithins i tried to console him youd find a consultant job easily enough in the provinces but it wouldnt be the same thing and of course connie and i would have to leave our home i nodded since the waiter episode girls had been in and out of my life like people viewing an unsatisfactory flat but id always retained a soft spot for connie the thought of her confined for life to a place like porterhampton upset me so much id almost have had another go at living there myself to prevent it in such delicate circumstances i suggested i take it youd more than ever like me tucked away in some respectable job exactly find me one old lad and i will i cant possibly face palethorpe for months of course i have some influence with the free teetotal hospital at tooting theyll be needing a new housesurgeon next week and the week after im afraid as far as im concerned miles stroked his pale moustache a pity you didnt keep your position on the medical observer at least it utilized your talent for the pen respectably that was a congenial job i agreed until the old editor banished me to the obituaries the medical observer was the trade press which lands on doctors doormats every friday morning and is widely appreciated in the profession for lighting the saturday fires it has an upstairs office near the british museum in imminent danger of condemnation by the health fire and town planning authorities where id been assistant to the editor a thin bird with a wing collar and severe views on the split infinitive you cant imagine how depressing it was writing up dead doctors from nine to five i told miles though i composed my own for the files while i was there and a jolly good one it will be too yours isnt bad either i am gratified to hear it perhaps you should go abroad an oil company for which i do insurance examinations are prospecting up the river amazon in brazil they have a vacancy for a medical officer on a fiveyear contract the salary would certainly appeal to you and you just said you could do with some sunshine but not five years of it all at once miles began to look irritable again i must say gaston for a man in your position youre being extremely difficult to please oh i dont know if im going to sell my soul i might as well get a decent price for it i do wish youd discuss the subject of your livelihood seriously i was just about to old lad i dont suppose you could advance me ten quid could you resigning abruptly from porterhampton left me a months salary short you know i am against loans among relatives but i will agree if you accede to my suggestion about the psychiatrist i am certain thats what you need i can easily arrange for you to see dr punce who manages the aptitude tests for the oil company he rather specializes in whittling down square pegs i dont share the modern reverence for psychiatrists mostly because all the ones i know are as cracked as a load of old flowerpots but the financial blood was running so thinly i accepted i suppose you have no serious plans at all for maintaining yourself miles asked putting away his cheque book ive a few more medical articles on the stocks id also thought of trying my hand at a bit of copywritingyou know dont let your girdle be a hurdle we make a snazzier brassi–∏re and so on miles winced gaston looking for another job asked connie appearing with the coffee thats no problem anyway a bright young man like him should be in demand anywhere a bit infra dig i thought a doctor going to a psychiatrist like a fireman ringing the station to say his house was alight i didnt remember much of the psychiatry course at st swithins myself except the afternoon tony benskin was left to hypnotize a young woman with headaches and once hed got her in the responsible state suggested she took her blouse off apparently tonys hypnotic powers are low voltage because the girl clocked him one against the corner of the instrument cupboard quite some confusion it caused when the chief psychiatrist came in to find the patient stamping about shouting and the doctor unconscious but i dutifully appeared at dr punces rooms in wimpole street the following afternoon and found him a tall thin fellow in striped trousers a pincenez on a black ribbon and sidewhiskers i was shown in by a blonde nurse which put me in a awkward position at the startif i gave her the usual onceover the psychiatrist might decide something pretty sinister and on the other hand if i didnt he might decide something even worse i hit on a compromise and asked her what the time was i took a seat and prepared for him to dig into my subconscious shaking the psychopathic worms out of every spadeful i dont suppose you treat many doctors i began i assure you that all professions are fully represented in my casebooks psychiatry is the spice of life and all that i laughed but he had no sense of humour either the note i have from your cousin mentions your difficulty in finding congenial employment he went on offering me a cigarette as psychiatrists always do i nodded miles seems to think i should find a job with security though frankly i rather prefer insecurity but i suppose thats a bit of a luxury these welfare days hm i am now going to recite a succession of words i wish you to say the first word that comes into your head in reply light no its going very well thank you ive got some matches of my own that is the first word oh i see sorry yes of course ersun night club hm sex psychiatrists line sinker straight finishing crooked psychiatrists i say im terribly sorry i didnt mean to say that at all dr punce sat for a while with his eyes closed i was wondering if hed had a large lunch and dozed off when he went on dr grimsdyke i have had a particularly heavy month with my practice i fear that i am sometimes tempted to be rude to my more difficult patients if its any consolation i sympathized with him im tempted quite often too but dont worrythe feeling will pass i recommend a few days in the open air have you heard the story of the donkey and the salt he asked bleakly no i dont think i have i settled down to listen knowing that psychiatrists pick up quite a few good ones in the run of their work id like you to follow it carefully there was once a donkey who fell into the water crossing a stream on a very hot day with a load of salt eventually he got to his feet feeling greatly relieved because the water had dissolved his burden the next day he was crossing the stream loaded with sponges this time he deliberately fell but the sponges soaked up so much water the donkey was unable to rise at all the animal succumbed what do you think of that ha ha i said jolly funny in fact i thought it a pretty stupid story but one has to be polite you think that the story is funny oh yes best ive heard for weeks i suppose you know the one about the bishop and the parrot dear me dear me said the psychiatrist and started writing notes after a good many questions about the grimsdyke childhood which was just the same as any other beastly little boys he asked any sexual difficulties by jove yes i told him the story of avril atkinson but he didnt seem impressed your trouble dr grimsdyke he finally decided wiping his pincenez is that you find yourself in uncongenial employment i asked him what i was supposed to do about it but he only said something about it being a consultingroom and not the labour exchange i mean being a doctor doesnt train you for anything else much does it not like some of those barristers who get fed up standing on their feet drivelling away to judges and collect fat salaries running insurance companies there have been medical bishops and ambassadors rhodesia had a medical prime minister goethe and schiller were of course once both medical students yes and dr gatling invented the machine gun dr guillotin invented the guillotine and dr dover became a pirate i dont think ive much qualification for any of those professions im afraid i suggest some nonclinical branch how about entymology are you fond of insects i thought deeply well if im really no good as a doctor i suppose i could always end up as a psychiatrist i say im terribly sorry i added just for the moment i was forgetting good afternoon dr grimsdyke rightho do you want to see me again no i dont want to see you at all the nurse will show you out i left him shaking his head and fumbling nervously with his pincenez the poor chap looked as though he really ought to have seen a psychiatrist how did you get on asked connie answering the door when i called to report well i think i won i hope he recommended shock treatment your uncle rudolphs in the sittingroom good lord is he really wheres miles out on a case but dont worryuncle only wants to offer you a job one of those rich patients whove been buying up the local country houses has asked him to jamaica for a holiday as hes got twentyfour hours to find a locum for the next three months i suggested you thats really very decent of you connie since returning from the east the old uncle had settled at long wotton a pleasant niche in the cotswolds with thatched roofs and draught cider and cows in the high street my session with the psychiatrist not producing much alternative to a lifetime of gp and miles ten quid already having undergone severe amputation i felt glad of a decent job anywhere i consoled myself that half rural practice is veterinary medicine anyway and im rather fond of animals my daughterinlaw talked to me for thirty minutes before persuading me to take you as my locum uncle rudolph greeted me he was smaller and bristlier than miles with hair and eyebrows like steel wool under the influence of powerful magnets and an equally prickly ginger tweed suit thats very civil of you uncle i told him but as a matter of fact youre not putting me to any trouble as im quite free at the moment if you come to long wotton on thursday i can hand over my mrs wilson will look after you adequately though she is attuned to the habits of an elderly widower so dont expect champagne and caviar for breakfast good lord no i couldnt possibly manage anything heavier than cornflakes in the morning anyway kindly remember gaston that there are a large number of important people in the neighbourhood most of them are my patients and i wish them to remain so now listen to me i understand from miles that you are short of cash i am rather undernourished in the pocket at the moment i admitted you know i have certain funds under my control which i saved you dissipating as a medical student if you behave sensibly and efficiently at long wotton i am prepared to release them if not you will have to wait until my demise and i can assure you that my bloodpressure is excellent all that matters uncle i told him is giving you satisfaction in fact you might just as well advance me the cash now but he didnt seem to grasp the point and hurriedly asked connie to fetch him another whisky and soda shortly afterwards miles came in and nobody took much notice of me any more i arrived in the country on one of those april days when all the flowers look freshly painted and all the girls look beautiful the english spring had arrived as described in the poems and travel advertisements instead of the grey slushy thing we usually get id already spent a few weekends at long wotton and found it a friendly place where the inhabitants are all acquainted if not as i later suspected from the general feeblemindedness all actually related although im not much of a one for country pursuitsguns make such a frightful noise fishing gives me a bad cold for weeks and i regard horses as highly unroadworthy vehiclesit was pleasant to find myself respected locally as a learned chap and not just the fellow who dishes out the chits for false teeth also there was a very amiable young subpostmistress and i was looking forward to a few months quietly letting life go by and avril atkinson and porterhampton fade into my subconscious after a week or so i was even becoming a little bored with existence presenting no problems more complicated than keeping the uncles housekeeper happy and she seemed very satisfied with the story of the bishop and the parrot then i returned one evening from repairing the effects of a pitchfork on some bumpkins left foota very pleasant consultation with everyone touching their forelocks and asking if i could use a side of baconand found the old dear herself standing at the garden gate looking distraught doctor doctor she called something terribles happened i was a bit alarmed the cream might have gone off i was looking forward to my evening meal of fresh salmon followed by early strawberries particularly as the old uncle had overlooked handing over the cellar keys in his hurry to be off and id just found themburied under the coal in the outhouse of all places doctor youre to go at once she went on its very urgent to nutbeam hall she explained when i asked where its his lordship theres been a terrible accident a bit of a tragedy i felt fancy missing a dinner like that but the grimsdykes never shirk their professional duty and pausing only to load the bentley with sufficient splints and morphine to tackle a train crash i sped up the road to nutbeam hall everyone in long wotton knew lord nutbeam of course though i dont mean they played darts with him every night in the local in fact most of the inhabitants had never seen him the old boy was a bachelor who lived in a rambling house apparently designed by charles addams his younger brothers missus doing such things as ordering the coal and paying the milkman he appeared only occasionally when they gave him an airing in an old daimler like a mechanized glasshouse always with brother or wife as bodyguard this was the pair who received me in the hall a long dim place crammed with furniture and as stuffy as the inside of the family vault im the doctor i announced but dr grimsdyke dr rudolph grimsdyke is enjoying a little wellearned holiday im his locum and nephew dr gaston grimsdyke i saw them exchange glances the hon percy nutbeam was a fat chap with a complexion like an old whiskyvat which i suppose hed acquired at his brothers expense his wife was one of those sharpfaced little women with incisors like fangs to whom i took an instant dislike of course im perfectly well qualified i added sensing they might not take kindly to anyone but the accredited family practitioner naturally naturally agreed percy nutbeam very sociably we dont question that for a moment i am sure youve had very extensive experience doctor put in the wife well very varied anyway look here i told them feeling rather awkward unless its a matter of saving life on the spot if youd rather call another practitioner not at all said mrs nutbeam briskly my husband and i have the utmost confidence in your handling his lordships case havent we percy of course amanda i must admit this made me feel pretty pleased the old uncles full of homely advice about wool next to the skin and so on but after all those years among the hookworm and beriberi hes as out of date in medical practice as a gladstone bag i could see they were delighted at an uptodate chap like myself with all the latest from hospital then whats the trouble i asked we fear a broken hip doctor announced amanda nutbeam thats serious i believe could be very our aunt died after a broken hip murmured percy it all depends on the constitution of the patient i told them remembering my orthopaedic lectures please let me impress upon you doctor said amanda that his lordship is very delicate very delicate indeed added her husband this way doctor if you please i went upstairs feeling pretty curious id already decided it was the old storypoor old lord nutbeam was potty and the family were making themselves thoroughly miserable keeping it quiet instead of getting him decently certified and sending him baskets of fruit every friday i was therefore a bit startled when my clinical examination provided a couple of eyeopeners in the first place far from being dotty lord nutbeam had an iq in the professorial class i fell from the library ladder doctor he explained from his bed appropriately enough as i was reaching for my first edition of reli gio medici you are familiar with the work perhaps you have also read dr william harveys de motu cordis in the original latin i should much like to discuss it with a medical man not wishing to chat about all those books im going to read whenever i get a spare moment i put my stethoscope in my ears then i got my second surprise from the conversation downstairs id gathered lord nutbeams grip on life was as secure as on a wet conger eel but i quickly discoveredfractures aparthe was as hale and hearty as i was i am very delicate doctor he kept on insisting though he looked a spry old boy with his little white moustache i neither smoke nor drink and live on soft foods ever since i had the fever at the age of twentyone my dear brother and his wife have been devoted to my welfare dont worry i told him well soon have this little matter cleared up and youll be able to go on reading just where you left off a few minutes later i again faced the ambulant members of the nutbeam family in the hall and announced in suitably sepulchral tones that his lordship had indeed fractured the neck of the right femur ha muttered percy nutbeam auntie then it is serious doctor but please let me reassure you i possibly gripped my lapels once we get anyone as chirpy as lord nutbeam into hospital and the hands of a decent orthopaedic surgeon well have him on his feet again in no time meanwhile i have administered a sedative and the fracture isnt very painful i guarantee hell stand up to everything wonderfully i was then rather jolted to hear amanda nutbeam ask doctor dont you think it would be far far kinder just to do nothing a very eminent specialist left our aunt to pass peacefully away added percy but dash it i exclaimed how old was your aunt ninetytwo lord nutbeam was fifty the age when most men are telling their secretaries theyre in the prime of life look here this is quite a different case his lordship is so delicate life is merely a burden to him persisted amanda been delicate for years doctor even in the nursery he was always being sick surely doctor it would be a happy release he will have no more troubles among the angels ended percy nutbeam looking at the chandelier now i may not be the most erudite of medical practitioners but many years patronage of the sport of kings has left me pretty sharp at spotting something fishy so i eyed this couple pretty sternly and said if i dont get lord nutbeam into hospital this very night itll bewhy gross professional misconduct to say the least you can hardly get him there without his consent replied amanda sharply she gave me a smile as unfriendly as one of sir lancelot spratts laparotomy incisions and lord nutbeam would never consent to anything whatever without consulting us first said percy now just a minute you are very young doctor amanda continued i can assure you his lordship would be much happier passing away peacefully in his own home rather than being mutilated among strangers our aunt added percy was very contented right to the end here i say i think your consultation is over doctor the butler will show you to the door i was so furious i couldnt enjoy my salmon but i managed to cram down the strawberries and a bottle of the uncles liebfraumilch then i paced the room and smoked a couple of his cigars i looked up watsonjones fractures and joint injuries and i found a copy of hadfields law and ethics for doctors but though this is pretty hot on such things as relations with the clergy and opening a vein after death its a bit short on handling murderous relatives i wondered what the devil to do i thought of telephoning another doctor but felt this would produce only an action for slander finally i decided a if old nutbeam continued to lie flat on his back he would undoubtedly perish b you cant pressgang people into hospital and c some pretty nasty questions were going to be asked at the inquest apart from medical ethics the thought of the beastly brother and wife itching to get their fingers on lord nutbeams cash and title fairly made my blood boil particularly as i now realized my welcome to nutbeam hall didnt come from heartfelt appreciation of my clinical abilities but because they thought i had more chance of knocking his lordship off than my uncle had after sitting down with a drop of the uncles special liqueur brandy i made my decision my only course as a doctor and gentleman was to return to nutbeam hall forthwith and give all concerned a jolly good piece of my mind five minutes later i arrived again at the front gates turning a few choice phrases over in my thoughts when i noticed a ruddy great rolls parked outside i was wondering if the nutbeams had simply preferred to bypass me and summon a specialist off their own bat when the front door opened to admit a severelooking bird of consultoid aspect wearing striped trousers and carrying a briefcase good evening sir i said good evening he replied got into his rolls and drove off id hardly time to sort this out when the door flew open again and mrs nutbeam fell on me like her longlost baby doctor doctor thank god youve come back you must get his lordship into hospital at once this very instant cried percy panting up behind with the very best specialist available regardless of expense everything humanly possible must be done for him the telephone is just inside the hall doctor now just a minute i found this rather confusing a couple of hours ago you told me please disregard whatever i said a couple of hours ago returned amanda nutbeam i was too upset by my dear brotherinlaws accident to think properly we both were doctor we were quite beside ourselves deciding there was no point in asking a lot of silly questions i telephoned an eminent bonebasher in gloucester whod done a neat job on a patient who went through a threshing machine shortly afterwards i was gratified to see lord nutbeam departing tuckedup in an ambulance particularly as the original grimsdyke diagnosis had been confirmed like any gp pushing his patient into hospital these days i didnt see his lordship again for a fortnight i was meanwhile kept agreeably busy remedying the rustics and though the uncle didnt even send a postcard miles telephoned a couple of times but he was too concerned over sir lancelots car park to ask how i was getting on then one saturday i decided to drive over to gloucester to watch an afternoons cricket and looked into the jenner memorial hospital to see lord nutbeam during the tea interval i found his lordship very perky in a private room with a smithpetersen pin holding his hip together though we hadnt much time for a quiet chatmodern orthopaedic wards are pretty active places with all those nice girls from the physiotherapy department laying cool hands on fevered joints and making you kick your legs in the air as though you were about to turn out for the arsenal but the old boy seemed to be enjoying it all and while a little redheaded staff nurse brushed his hair he started asking my views on the original works of hippocrates youll soon be back among your books again i said not wishing to pursue the subject indeed doctor i believe my library is the only pleasure in my life except on saturday nights when i sometimes play the piano i was reflecting that this sort of existence would have me stone dead in a fortnight when we were interrupted by the surgeon himself a big redfaced jolly irishman most orthopods are when you come to think of it just as ophthalmologists look like dyspeptic watchmakers and bladder surgeons resemble prosperous commercial travellers hes all yours now mboy said the surgeon as we left the room together after examining the patient his rehabilitation will go much smoother at home and this sisterinlaw seems agreeable enough to nurse him anyway im off on monday for a months fishing in county mayo how is he for cash by the by according to village gossip crammed with it is he now the orthopod seemed to brighten at the prospect of having his fishing on lord nutbeams hip odd sort of feller dont you think i couldnt see him saying boo to a newly hatched gosling ill be sending you the usual letter about treatment meanwhile tell him to confine his reading to the bottom shelf when a few mornings later they unloaded his lordship at nutbeam hall and i pushed his new wheelchair into the library i felt pretty contented with myself the whole episode had already increased my professional standing in long wotton no end im far from saying the natives were hostile but in the country they regard anyone who hasnt lived among them for thirty years as a day tripper and now there was plenty of glowing gossip to warm the ears of the old uncle on his return if i could present him with a lord nutbeam skipping about the front lawn hed not only give fewer of those oldfashioned looks whenever i suggested enterprising lines of treatment but painlessly disgorge my cash on the spot i am certainly glad my brotherinlaw is back in his own home doctor remarked amanda nutbeam it is only here i think that we really understand his best interests so ive noticed i told her and now for a few weeks of rest and quiet and nourishing food i added confidently and his lordship will be dancing the highland fling if he wants to but i should have learned long ago that in the turf and therapeutics its disastrous to back a dead certainty for some reason lord nutbeam didnt want to get better id imagined that once he was home hed settle down to a nice long read but instead he sat staring out of time window with cups of beeftea getting cold at his elbow sometimes he picked up the anatomy of melancholy but it didnt seem to hold him sometimes he pushed himself to the piano but he could manage only a few bars of valse triste to cheer him up i wheeled him round the garden telling funny stories but he never seemed to see the point alas poor yorick was the most i could get out of him his lordship grew steadily feebler and feebler while everything else in sight was burgeoning wildly in the sunshine it wasnt long before i began to grow alarmed about his condition modern medicines all very well with antibiotics and heartlung machines and so on but once a chaps decided he doesnt want to live any more were not much better off than the witchdoctors in central africa and my professional problems werent made easier by the other nutbeams who now the excitement had died down treated me like the man come to mend the drains far from his lordship they were terrible snobsparticularly the missus whom everyone knew in the village was only a roadhouse remnant from percy nutbeams youth anyway it would be much more convenient if you could make your daily visit earlier she said as i limped into nutbeam hall one evening after a heavy days practice among the pigsties we are expecting lord and lady farnborough for dinner any minute and i should naturally prefer my guests not to be greeted in the hall by the doctor perhaps you would also have the goodness to change your shoes before coming to us dr grimsdyke i realize that you cannot avoid walking through the farmyards during the day but i must say her attitude made me pretty annoyed particularly as i felt she wouldnt have tried it with the old uncle not with those oldfashioned looks of his then a couple of days later lord nutbeam went off his food and started looking like socrates eyeing the hemlock were all bursting to see you back to normal again i told him hopefully writing a prescription for another tonic heres something which will have you chirping with the birds in no time thank you doctor you are very kind indeed everyone is very very kind especially of course my dear brother and his wife he listlessly turned a few pages of gibbons decline and fall but i fear my accident had more effect than i imagined ive hardly been out of nutbeam hall for many years you know on account of my delicate health meeting so many people in the hospital was something of a disturbance you are doubtless familiar with the lines in grays elegy in a country churchyard feeling that churchyards were definitely out i interrupted with the story about the parrot but i dont think he got that one either i left him in the library wondering whether to assemble the family again and confess the old boy wasnt living up to my prognosis but i was stopped by percy nutbeam himself in the hall could you spare time for a whisky and soda doctor my professional duties being over for the day i accepted im very worried about my brothers condition he declared after a bit of chat about the weather and the crops and so am i i told him i remember the case of our aunt so well the collapse seemed to set in all at once like a pricked balloon i suppose theres not any danger ofer is there i nodded im afraid ive got to say there is the poor chap looked so concerned i felt i must have misjudged him all along then how long doctor would you give him might be a matter of only a week or two i said gloomily good god not before may the twentyeighth i looked puzzled wondering if theyd arranged a picnic or something this is a very delicate business doctor he poured himself another whisky but i must be frank with you you remember sir kenneth cowberry i dont think ive had the pleasure he was leaving as you returned the night of the accident hes the head of hoskins harrison cowberry and blackthorn my brothers accountants you know i thought wed better send for him at once in case there were any arrangements my brother might have wished quite i said lord nutbeam naturally desires to leave my wife and myself his entire fortune after all we have devoted our lives to his welfare quite quite but it was only that evening we learnedmy brother is oddly secretive about money mattersthat he had in fact already made over his estate to me in order toer escape death duties you may have heard of other cases doctor but under the rules of the inland revenue department my brother must stay alive for five years after signing the document or it doesnt hold water and those five years are up at midnight may the twentyeighth so doctor if you can keep him alive till theni mean i hope and trust he will have many happy years among us yetyou understand the position i didnt think highly before of this pintsized lord and lady macbeth now i felt it would serve them damn well right if the government carted off the lot to pay among other things my national health salary i understand the position very well i replied wishing i could produce one of the uncles looks id very much taken to old nutbeam and i was determined to keep him alive for the three score and ten but the situation was getting beyond a chap of my modest experience and out in the country i hadnt any of my chums to ask for advice i wished the uncle would get fed up sitting on the beach at montego bay and come home i even wished miles would turn up for the weekend i was wondering what to say next when i had another of those profitable inspirations of mine i think it would be wise i announced to have another opinion there might be some other condition ive overlooked after all doctors can make mistakes just like accountants as many opinions as you wish dr grimsdyke theres a man in harley street just right for this type of case though his private fees are rather high thats of no concern at all i assure you and of course hell charge a guinea a mile for the visit percy nutbeam looked a bit concerned doing the mental arithmetic but he agreed nothing is too expensive with my brothers life at stake plus his firstclass fare and meals naturally hes a general surgeon but i guarantee hes got the sharpest diagnostic nose in london his names sir lancelot spratt delightful air declared sir lancelot id driven over to greater wotton junction to meet him and pretty nervous i felt about it too in my days as a student at st swithins sir lancelot and myself disagreed about everything from the way i tried to treat appendicitis to the way i tried to treat the nurses and his last remark the day i proudly told him id qualified was that the archbishop of canterbury would presumably now have to make an addition to the litany i bowed him from his carriage like royalty come to open the local fat stock show i hope youve no objection to travelling all this way sir i began feeling that id sent for rembrandt to paint the attic objections why boy it is the duty of consultant surgeons and the fire brigade to give their services whenever and wherever they are needed it is moreover extremely pleasant to escape from london on a summer morning and im being handsomely paid for it dont be so damned humble grimsdyke he poked me in the epigastrium with his walkingstick a doctor must feel humble only towards his own abilities excellent roses these apricot queens i believe what sort of mulch dyou use this remark was directed to the stationmaster greater wotton being one of those junctions regarded as an exercise in landscape gardening interrupted by the occasional arrival of trains sir lancelot then ignored me for ten minutes erudite discussion on the merits of horse and cow manure come to think of it that sort of ability represents his genius most surgeons can talk only about the inside of their patients or the inside of their cars but sir lancelot has informed views on everything from nuclear physics to newts i am presumably obliged to travel in that he said indicating my car am i permitted a bite to eat before seeing the patient ive arranged a modest meal sir remembering that a high bloodsugar is conducive to mental tranquillity id decided to give the old boy a jolly good lunch before getting down to business i rarely take wine at midday sir lancelot observed later mellowing over the roast lamb and a glass of the uncles ch–≤teau lafite but i must say dr rudolph grimsdyke has excellent taste in it i agreed though id been a bit alarmed to notice the cellar had somehow got down to only a couple of bottles the only locums i did were in the east end of london where in those days the doctors were as halfstarved as the patients sir lancelot gazed through the window where the cuckoos were tuning up among the blossoms he seems to have found himself a very agreeable spotbotanically ornithologically and even meteorologically but not anthropologically sir i said brightly feeling it time to mention the nutbeams according to the essayist hazlitt sir lancelot observed with a nod all country people hate each other you will now kindly recapitulate the family history of your patient you were not particularly explicit on the telephone an hour later the pair of us were marching into nutbeam hall i think the hon percy and his repulsive missus were staggered to find themselves faced with a chap in a frock coat and a wing collar who glanced round as though hed been sent to condemn the place by the local medical officer of health we are delighted sir lancelot simpered amanda nutbeam who of course thought doctors were all right as long as they had titles i am so pleased you accepted our invitation to take over his lordships case sir lancelot looked as though she were a junior probationer whod dropped a bedpan in the middle of his weekly ward round madam i have not assumed clinical responsibility for lord nutbeam his medical adviser remains dr gaston grimsdyke at whose invitation i stand here now oh of course sir lancelot that is normal professional procedure these remarks put my morale up no end despite our differences in the past sir lancelot wasnt so much offering the olive branch as proffering ruddy great groves but i should have realized that a chap like him would back me to the scalpel hilt now that i was qualified and one of the boys we shall see the patient if you please the nutbeams looked rather flustered and i should be glad if you would kindly provide me with a clean hand towel i remembered sir lancelot always demanded a clean towel in uppish households and in a tone inferring that it was a pretty stiff request dr grimsdyke will lead the way he went on as i stepped respectfully aside the patients doctor precedes the consultant into the sickroom that is etiquette and i should be the last to alter it our consultation was a great success sir lancelot started by discussing ancient chinese medicine for twenty minutes then he examined the patient had a chat about byzantine architecture and left his lordship looking his brightest for weeks and you discovered the original fracture solely from the physical signs grimsdyke he asked as we left the room yes sir congratulations the difficulty in making such a diagnosis is matched only by the disaster of missing it thatsthats very kind of you sir i believe in giving credit where credit is due in your case it happens to be remarkably easy i felt jolly pleased with myself all the same though ive always maintained that orthopaedic surgery is only a branch of carpentry and now i come to think of it i was rather hot stuff in the woodwork class at school the other two nutbeams were waiting expectantly in the hall but at the foot of the stairs sir lancelot simply picked up his hat sir lancelot percy looked as though this wasnt much of a run for their money yes mr nutbeam have youer anything to say about my brother i shall have a consultation with my colleague here who will inform you later that is the normal procedure but if you could hold out even a word of hope exclaimed amanda i fancy glancing stealthily at the calendar i think my colleague will allow me to say that you will shortly see an improvement in his lordships condition thank god for that they cried together now if you please dr grimsdyke we shall return to your surgery he pulled out that great gold watch of his we have really little time for discussion before the four oclock train sir lancelot didnt mention the patient on our way back to the uncles cottage being more interested in describing all the different methods of thatching i had to wait till he was enjoying a cup of tea in the parlour when he declared apart from an uncomplicated healing fracture theres nothing whatever wrong with lord nutbeam but theres one thing he needs desperatelyan interest in life believe me its perfectly easy to be bored to death what do you suggest more books sir sir lancelot seemed to find this amusing from you grimsdyke a remarkable answer the advice about never judging others by yourself is one of the stupider of proverbs if humanity didnt show an astounding sameness the practice of medicine would come to a dead stop he spread a scone with clotted cream and strawberry jam i agree that after a lifetime playing the recluse lord nutbeams expedition to hospital was something of a shock with the appalling advance of specialization hospitals have become quite overcrowded with staffit is of course completely impossible to get any rest in them did you notice his nurses as a matter of fact i did sir there was a staff nurse and sir lancelot raised his hand it is quite enough answer grimsdyke that you noticed them no doubt lord nutbeam finds the amateur ministrations of his sisterinlaw less agreeable i shall send down a qualified nurse from a london bureau tomorrow you will see to it that she isnt overruled by the family that might be a bit difficult sir rubbish he helped himself to a slice of fruit cake theres only one way to handle difficult patients difficult relatives and difficult horses and thats by keeping on top i hope my visit has clothed you with a little added authority thats often the only value of the consultant appearing on the scene at all how about tonics sir to my mind there is only one effective tonic i shall arrange for that to be sent from london also i think i have time for another cup of tea if you please by the by he went on as i put down the pot you knew your cousin miles was putting up for the consultant staff at st swithins he did mention it to me sir hows he fancy his chances i think hes modest by nature sir i replied cagily hm i am only betraying an open secret by saying that cambridge is being remarkably difficult in the selection committee obstinacy is such an extremely unpleasing characteristic sir lancelot stroked his beard how are your relations with your cousin we do rather move in different worlds sir i dont know if you are sufficiently familiar to drop a hint that his chances at st swithins would be considerably bettered if he were a little more disgustingly human otherwise hes an exemplary candidate his work has ability his manner has confidence and what is more important his wife has money but whoever the committee elects you have to live with the feller for the rest of your professional lifetime and nothing is more trying than being yoked to a pillar of virtue as you can find from the divorce courts any afternoon im sure miles is dedicated to his profession sir i remarked taking the chance to slip in a good word for the chap nothing declared sir lancelot is quite so dangerous as the dedicated man shortly afterwards i drove him to the station i no longer had any qualms about tackling the nutbeams even over the nurse a nurse that will be rather tedious doctor amanda objected at once we had one in the house before the time my husband had pneumonia it really was most difficult they feel quite entitled to have their meals at the same table and even attempt to sit with one in the evenings this annoyed me more because im a great admirer of the nursing profession or at least of some of it remembering sir lancelots advice i said pretty stuffily if you dont obey your doctors orders there really isnt much point in having one i assure you i can put up with any inconvenience for the sake of my brotherinlaws health she returned i will instruct the housekeeper to prepare a room immediately i myself wasnt much looking forward to sharing the clinical management of lord nutbeam with a nurse knowing how sir lancelots taste in them lay his ward sisters at st swithins were a couple of women who could have kept attila the hun in bed for a month on breadandmilk and i expected someone about six feet tall with a chin like a football boot old enough to have spanked lord nutbeam as a baby and tough enough to try it now it was therefore with some astonishment that i arrived at nutbeam hall the next evening to discover the most beautiful girl id seen in my life good evening doctor she greeted me i am nurse jones i have given the patient his bath and he is ready for you to see him now i couldnt do anything except stare and bless my luck she was a dainty demure creature with a little bow thing under her chin she looked like snowwhite just growing out of her dwarfs i was hopeful that our professional relationship would quickly ripen into something more promising the subpostmistress being all very well for country rambles but having the annoying habit of continually explaining how you counted postal orders oh jolly good i said i hope you like it here in the country perhaps youd care to see the local beauty spots one afternoon when youre off duty she gave a smile as gentle as the ripples on the village pond that is really most kind of you doctor but im afraid i shant find much time to spare with such an important case well see eh nothing brings a man and woman together like treating someone elses illnesses lets go and inspect his lordship i found lord nutbeam sitting in bed sipping a glass of champagne where on earth did that come from i exclaimed but the note from fortnum and masons said youd ordered it for me doctor oh did i yes of course i did bollinger eh sir lancelots favourite tipple jolly good tonic dont you find i would never take alcohol except on doctors orders of course but i must say it does make me feel extremely well how much do you want me to drink of it doctor i believe six dozen bottles arrived downstairs i murmured something about a bottle a day keeping the doctor away and invited myself to a drop how do you like your new nurse i asked as she disappeared to find a glass lord nutbeam thought for some moments she reminds me of a little crabbe she doesnt walk sideways i said feeling this rather uncomplimentary courteous though coy and gentle though retired he quoted the joy of youth and health her eyes displayd and ease of heart her every look conveyd i felt that the case had taken a turn for the better nurse jones was a great success all round in a couple of days she had old nutbeam out of his wheelchair tottering round sniffing the flowers the next week shed taken to driving him about the countryside of an afternoon in the daimler and calling one lunchtime i was surprised to see hed gone off his usual diet of poached egg on pulverized spinach and was tucking into a steak the size of a bathmat even the percy nutbeams didnt object to the new regime partly because his lordship was every day in every way getting better and better and partly because of the way nurse jones handled the missus nurses are charming girls though unfortunately inclined to be bossy doubtless the effect of spending their formative years telling old men to get back into bed but nurse jones was as sweet and gentle as gees linctus and always took care to address mrs nutbeam like an edwardian housemaid straight out of the orphanage the nurse at least knows her place amanda admitted to me one afternoon which is a very welcome discovery in anyone these days though of course she could hardly expect to mix with people of our class not only was she trained at some extremely obscure hospital but her father i believe is an engine driver you mean in loco parentis i suggested but amanda nutbeam definitely had no sense of humour either all the same im glad sir lancelot spratt recommended her she seems to be doing his lordship the world of good she was doing me the world of good too after passing the day sticking penicillin into rural posteriors you cant imagine how you look forward to half an hour with a civilized popsie in the evening good evening nurse jones i would greet her at the bedroom door and how is his lordship this evening very well thank you doctor he has taken his vitaminized milk and played clair de lune twice on the piano and how are you nurse jones very well thank you doctor perhaps one afternoon you would like a spot of fresh air and a view of the beauty spots nurse jones perhaps one afternoon doctor after a week or two i felt the time had come to put our acquaintance on a rather jollier footing old nutbeam had hobbled out of the room somewhere and nurse jones had been listening very respectfully while i held forth on the osteopathology of uniting fractures so i put my arm round her waist and kissed her the result was rather unexpected id imagined that shed drop her eyes and dissolve into grateful sobs on my waistcoat instead she caught me a neat uppercut on the left ramus of the mandible i dont know if many people have been clocked by nurses but quite a lot of power they pack after all those years shifting patients about with their bare hands she hit me clean off my balance right into the remains of his lordships dinner but i was even more startled at the appearance of little nurse jones herself she looked as though shed been charged with a powerful current of electricity she was all eyes and teeth and fingernails you despicable young man she hissed do you take me for one of your hospital pickups keep your hands to yourself and your manners to the saloon bar i say im most terribly sorry i brushed off the remains of a fruit salad it was all meant in a perfectly friendly spirit like at christmas oh i know you young doctors she looked as though she wanted to spit out something nasty do you imagine i put up with five years hard labour in a hospital like a workhouse just for people like you to maul me about huh i want more out of life than that its bad enough drudging away night and day without having to defend yourself against hamfisted romeos as soon as youre left alone in the same room you make me absolutely nauseated strong words of course but the grimsdykes i trust are ever gentlemen and sensitive to the first hint that their attentions might be unwelcome a thousand apologies i told her rather stiffly its all this hot weather were having i can assure you nurse jones that the incident will not occur again i can assure you too she said at that moment old nutbeam pottered back and she became her usual demure self once more for the next few days i didnt know whether i was more confused than disappointed after all every housemans tried a bit of slapandtickle in the sluiceroom and the worst response is usually a few remarks about not being that sort of a girl and sister might come back in a minute anyway but nurse jones could look as if butter wouldnt melt in her mouth while comfortably able to digest redhot nails it was puzzling and rather a shame id been particularly looking forward to those beauty spots arriving at nutbeam hall a few evenings later i thought at first that nurse jones was in form again then i recognized the voices behind the drawingroom door for a man in your position behaving like that with one of the servants mrs nutbeam was declaring is absolutely disgusting my dear bleated percy shes hardly a servant of course shes a servant ive had ladys maids in the past who were twice as good as she is but my dear and in our own home with your own brother lying ill in the next room really percy my dear youve always treated me atrociously but this is too much far too much havent i enough on my mind at this moment but my dear how was i to know shed make such a fuss i was only trying to hold her hand and you have the effrontery to offer that as an excuse if i had my way id bundle the little baggage out of the house in the next five minutes its only that shes kept your brother out of his grave that i tolerate her at all let me tell you my dear the scene wont be repeated and let me tell you my dear that if it is ill break your neck it was quite a consolation to find that nurse jones dished it out impartially to all comers thereafter i paid fewer visits to nutbeam hall his lordship no longer needing my constant attentions anyway there wasnt even much excitement for the percy nutbeams watching lsdday approaching as he quietly became haler and heartier every moment under the mellowing influence of the coming largesse the ghastly couple grew quite friendly towards me and even asked me to a cocktail party with a lot of their friends who looked as though theyd been delivered in horseboxes at last the twentyeighth of may dawned another jolly elysian summer day in the afternoon i drove to nutbeam hall for my final visit i found percy and his wife standing in the hall looking as if theyd just checked off the winning line in their penny points dr grimsdyke percy said at once we both want to thank you for restoring my dear brother to us it is a great comfort doctor to have him with us today and of course for many more years to come if god spares him added percy looking at the chandelier again to mark our appreciation amanda went on my husband and i would like you to accept this little gift i hope it will remind you of one of your earliest successful cases whereupon percy handed me a gold cigarette case still in its box from cartiers i stumbled out a few words of thanks wondering how much it had set them back then i suggested id better make my adieus to the patient himself my brothers out for his afternoon drive at the moment percy told me but of course hes due home any minute he never likes to be far from nutbeam hall said amanda do wait doctor perhaps a cup of tea at that moment we heard the daimler in the drive and as we opened the front door lord nutbeam got out with nurse jones it was then i noticed something about himpossibly the look in his eye like a chap reaching for his first pint at the end of a tough game of ruggerwhich made me slip the cigarette case into my pocket and prepare for trouble percyamanda began lord nutbeam allow me to introduce lady nutbeam the two honourables looked as though theyd been run through the middle by a redhot cautery thats impossible cried mrs nutbeam not impossible at all my dear amanda ethel and i were married half an hour ago in gloucester registry office two very pleasant young men from the waterworks department were our witnesses percy nutbeam gasped but the money im afraid there isnt any percy not for you anyway the deed is of course annulled by my marrying before the five years are up you will inherit the title when i eventually perish unless ethel and i happen to have children mrs nutbeam burst into tears but i doubt whether there will be much money left because i intend to spend it i realize now how i have wasted my life because you two cleverly insisted on keeping me under your noses im not at all delicate ethel tells me im as vigorous as any man of twenty i knew id been missing something ever since i was among all those nice young people in hospital lord nutbeam smiled benignly all round dear doctor do you recall i once mentioned grays elegy in a country churchyard i was about to quotefull many a flower is born to blush unseen and waste its sweetness on the desert air charming poem well im going to blush all over the place from now on ethel and i are off tomorrow for our honeymoon at monte carlo you must come doctor and visit me there when weve settled down you probably prefer to stay here percy and so you may if you wish until we get back dont forget the present darling said lady nutbeam looking as unruffled as when she changed his lordships pyjamas ah the present it was you doctor who brought dear ethel and i together so perhaps you will accept this little token of our lasting gratitude and affection and he handed me a gold cigarette case still in its box from cartiers i dont believe a word of it said miles dont you indeed i replied and produced a couple of identical gold cigarette cases from my pockets the only snag is knowing what to do with the things my life never being organized to meet such a situation i think ill reserve one for the hock shop and have the other engraved with gratitude from a successful patient then i can offer people cigarettes from it and do my professional standing no end of good though i suppose i might as well have with gratitude from her royal highness while im about it dont you think id left long wotton that morning to the touching distress of everybody particularly the subpostmistress who burst into tears and gummed up all the threepenny stamps even the old uncle had congratulated me on handling the nutbeams and not only written a comfortable cheque as promised but given me a straw hat from jamaica percy nutbeam himself had smartly disappeared from the district it was rumoured to sell cars in a piccadilly showroom and id half a mind to go along later and make faces through the plateglass window it was a beautiful afternoon in the middle of ascot week as i arrived in london when even the chaps with placards announcing doom is nigh at the bottom of the edgware road looked as though the world wasnt such a bad old place after all i was sorry to find the only drab patch on the whole cheerful canvas of life was poor old miles himself theyve postponed the appointment at st swithins for six months he announced not seeming really interested in cigarette cases the committee have invited professor kaiser from kentucky to fill the gap with a clinical visit gloved hands across the sea and all that he snorted not a bit of it its nothing but a transparent ruse for everyone to organize their forces my only encouragement is that mr longfellow from the neurosurgical department is now supporting me though of course he always opposes sir lancelot in everything because sir lancelot gave him out umpiring the last staff and students cricket match i shouldnt be at all surprised at that miles stared gloomily at the print of luke fildes the doctor if only the patients knew what went on behind their backs why dont you and connie get away from it all and take a holiday i suggested the yearly change of scene is essential for mental and bodily healthlesson one social medicine nothing depresses me quite so much as packing but the sunny shores of the mediterranean only seem to give me the gutrot id thought of passing on sir lancelots advice but the poor fellow looked so hopelessly miserable i said instead dont worry about me old lad ill do my bit by staying out of sight and out of trouble at least for the next six months you know gaston youreyoure being rather decent about all this not at all one of the family good cause and all that im sincerely grateful to you if can be any help in finding a new position not necessary old lad i have a scheme which will take me right out of everybodys hair for a bit youre not emigrating i thought his voice sounded a little too hopeful apart from the oil company i know the secretary of the commonwealth resettlement board pretty well at the club he could easily fix you up somewhere like australia or canada i shook my head worthy places all but i shall remain based on this blessed plot what was it old sir lancelot used to tell us i know onehalf of this country thinks its underpaid and the other half that its overtaxed but believe me gentlemen its cheap at the price anyway my immediate future is taken care of in the homeland respectably i trust very but i must maintain strict professional secrecy about it at the moment miles looked surprised but asked no more questions we parted on such excellent terms i wished afterwards id thought of asking him for another ten quid i didnt enlighten miles that i was planning to write a book because he would have told me it was a stupid notion and i should have agreed with him though a good many other doctors seem to have had the same ideaoliver goldsmith smollett rabelais conan doyle somerset maugham and so on the thought had come to me in the uncles study at long wotton where id been browsing to keep up with lord nutbeams conversation halfway through the worlds ten great novels it struck me that a chap who could write the obituaries for the medical observer ought to be pretty good at producing convincing fiction the only snag was paying the rent while writing it and i suppose the same problem worried goldsmith and smollett as well but now i had the uncles cheque i could afford to take a small houseboat in chelsea if i managed to live largely on baked beans and benzedrine the next afternoon id an appointment with some publishers called carboy and plover in bloomsbury a district with highclass literary associations but now consisting of small hotels for drunk scotsmen missing the night trains from kings cross a hospital story eh theyre generally sellers at any rate said mr carboy he was a fat chap in a tweed suit whom id found sitting among photographs of his bestselling authors and prizewinning cattle reading the farmer and stockbreeder but he was very civil and gave me a cup of tea the drama of the operating theatre murmured plover a thin pale fellow on whom nothing seemed to grow very wellhair moustache bowtie all drooped like a sensitive plant after a thunderstorm ill have a go then i said i felt the interview was more encouraging than the one you got on entering st swithins when they just told you the number of chaps they chucked out for slacking have a go by all means doctor agreed carboy just send us the manuscript when its finished cant promise anything definite of course but well certainly read it erone small point i didnt want to raise sordid questions among such literary gents but i went on i met an author chap once who said publishers often made a small advance we should be delighted doctor said carboy absolutely delighted agreed plover nothing gives a publisher greater pleasure than encouraging the young artist eh plover but alas the state of the book trade simply terrible just now affirmed plover drooping further quite indescribable bankruptcies weekly poor hargreaves shot himself only yesterday im not at all certain ended plover that i didnt hear the crack of a pistol shot on my way to lunch i left wondering whether i should offer to pay for the tea in the absence of patronage from carboy and plover i put one cigarette case up the spout bought a secondhand typewriter and rogets thesaurus and settled down to work being a medical student is jolly good training for becoming an author in both occupations you have to sit at a desk for hours on end when youd rather be out in the pubs and to live on practically nothing though i must admit it was only late in the course that i developed this knack for the studious life the old uncle had become even stickier with the money after a surprise visit to my new digs one evening when the landlady answered his question is this where mr grimsdyke lives with thats right sir bring im in and mind is poor ead on the doorstep i also found that writing a book like taking out an appendix looks rather easier from the appearance of the finished product than it is the snag in writing a book about hospitals is that everyone imagines the atmosphere inside resembles the closing stages of a sixday bicycle race while the operating theatre is really a relaxed and friendly place like a wellrun garage also the public thinks all surgeons are highprincipled and handsome though most of them are little fat men with old pyjamas under their operating gowns mainly worried about getting the next hernia done in time to have a decent lunch my hero one clifford standforth frcs was a brilliant upright serious young surgeon and somehow he didnt seem the sort of chap whod last half an hour at st swithins without getting his leg pulled by everyone down to the firstyear students after a few weeks with foolscap on the floor as thick as the snow on a christmas card i found myself like any other hermit in pressing need of a decent meal and some conversation and i invited myself round to miles flat for dinner i thought i could finally pass on sir lancelots remarks about slapping chaps on the back a bit more but i found the fellow in an even deeper condition of acute melancholia whats up now i asked sir lancelot still creating about that car park barefoot miles replied oh i said hes putting up for the job too unfortunate i agreed everythings against me muttered miles i thought the fellow had settled down for life as reader in surgery at west riding hes your only serious rival i suppose as ever agreed miles bitterly youve never said a word i suppose gaston not about the true story i shook my head not even to connie thank you gaston i appreciate that deeply i felt so unhappy for him i had to help myself to some of his whisky and soda the barefoot incident was the only shady part of old miles rather sad salad days everyone at st swithins thought it pretty mysterious at the time the general rumour being that the poor chap had suffered a nervous breakdown following years of chronic overwork which was highly gratifying to students like myself who believed in long periods of recuperation between exams it all happened just before miles went up for his finals before either of us had yet run into connie charlie barefoot was a small untidy pink chap who resembled a cherub in glasses and the pair of them had met their first week in st swithins over that beastly dogfish i say isnt that humes treatise on human nature you have there asked miles waiting for the class to start one morning barefoot nodded i like to keep my mind occupied while im hanging about for anythingtrains haircuts scholarship exams and so on but isnt that darwins origin of species miles said it was i thought it a useful start to ones medical education but ive been waiting for months to discuss darwins views on natural selection and ive been waiting for months to discuss humes views on subjective idealism after that they were great pals medical students in the first year have hardly shaken the schoolroom chalk from their shoulders but they soon learn to crowd the rear benches of the lectureroom so that unobtrusive exits might be made should the subject start to pall miles and barefoot were always left with the front row to themselves where they answered all the questions took notes by the armful and generally gave the impression intellectually of a pair of young mozarts at the end of the first year miles won the deans prize in biology with charlie barefoot proxime accessit that got rid of the dogfish by promotion from the medical kindergarden to the anatomy rooms they shared the same leg miles ive got some capital news barefoot announced as my cousin arrived one morning theres a vacancy in my digs tony benskin doesnt want to stay any longer i dont know why but he got quite shirty the other day just because i wanted to discuss the popliteal fossa over breakfast if you were thinking of making a change ill give my landlady notice tonight miles replied at once my lodgings are really very difficult for studying in the evenings quite apart from the noise of paddington station there are a couple of ladies on my landing who seem to have a tremendous succession of visitors youll find it much more agreeable at muswell hill mrs capper provides use of the parlour and lets us make cocoa as late as we like in the evening miles moved his books and bones across london and from monday to friday every night afterwards the pair of them swotted at mrs cappers parlour table on saturdays they went for a long walk in the country and took supper at lyons in time miles won the gold medal in anatomy with barefoot again runnerup by the time id shaken off the blasted dogfish myself miles and barefoot were already at work in the st swithins wards despite the standing impression of hospital inmates medical students are let loose on live patients only after a couple of years of cutting up dead ones and a pretty testing transition it is too a good many bright young anatomists ive seen floundering about among the dirty dressings and vomit bowls and they say all the best surgeons were as hopeless at anatomy as all the best judges were at law but even sir lancelot spratt agreed it was simply a matter of time before miles won the university prize in surgery with barefoot as usual panting a few marks behind then a most unusual dislocation nobbled this pair of academic steeplechasers when i started in the hospital myself i found that once youd sorted out the odd sounds that come rumbling up a stethoscope the greatest difficulty in a medical ward is not making a diagnosis but making a bed hospital sisters regard the students as farmers regard their own unavoidable pests and insist on all blankets being replaced complete with official hospital corners which was totally beyond old miles he couldnt examine a patient without leaving him like a finisher in a sackrace after inspecting a particularly tricky case of splenomegaly one evening miles was struggling to tuck back the foot of the bed without repeatedly folding his tie into it when a voice behind him said softly if you let me do it perhaps it would be easiest for both of us in the end my cousin found a small blonde junior nurse smiling at him awfully decent of you he stammered youre working terribly late arent you she gave the bedcover a professional flick oh i dont know i rather like work you new on the ward i came down from ent yesterday my names nurse crimpole mines miles grimsdyke of course i knew that you did surely everyone in the hospital has heard of the clever miles grimsdyke quite unlike the other one she gave him another smile miles stomach felt as though hed swallowed a nest of glowworms what would you enumerate as the differential diagnosis of acute nephritis asked charlie barefoot across mrs cappers redplush tablecloth later that evening miles switched his eyes from mr cappers buffalo group over the fireplace eh you all right barefoot looked concerned you havent touched your cocoa yes im fine thanks fit as a flea though perhaps im overdoing the saturday tramps a little sorry old man it wasnt important anything interesting happen in the ward this evening no nothing worth mentioning at all said miles the next saturday miles told barefoot he was visiting his aunt in sydenham and took nurse crimpole to the pictures you really mustnt work so hard she murmured as he held her hand afterwards outside the mortuary gate i shouldnt like anything to happen to you perhaps ill cut down in the evenings a bit dulcie the finals arent for a couple of years yet anyway and im sure youre not getting nearly enough to eat mrs cappers a bit mean with the firstclass proteins i must say do look after yourself mileswont you she looked into his eyes and stroked his lapel tor my sake next week miles told barefoot he was visiting his uncle in beckenham and took nurse crimpole to the palladium for once in his life old miles found he couldnt concentrate unlike myself whose thoughts tend to wander from the books in the direction of lords or epsom miles could control his brain like a prize fighter his muscles but now nurse crimpoles smile kept coming between him and such things as the electrocardiographic diagnosis of fallots tetrology no nurse had wasted her time on the poor chap before with such grand people as housemen and registrars about in the ward come to think of it no woman had wasted her time on him at all i wish id known what was going on i might have buttonholed the chap and offered some fatherly advice miles decided the next saturday to tell barefoot he was visiting his nephew in croydon and take nurse crimpole to the corner house when he slipped into the ward sluiceroom to issue the invitation he was surprised to discover her chatting to his roommate just looking for my diabetic specimens miles said quickly theyve been taken down to the path lab old man charlie barefoot told him if youre going that way ill come along and collect my own byebye dulcie he added to nurse crimpole see you on saturday two oclock outside the nurses home she replied and went on polishing her bedpans miles felt hed been given the electroconvulsive treatment hed seen in the psychiatric department it had never occurred to the idiot that dulcie crimpole could have eyes for anyone elseparticularly he felt angrily a stodgy old bookworm like charlie barefoot known nurse crimpole long he asked in the pathology laboratory his hand trembling as he unstoppered a bottle of benedicts reagent ive seen her about the ward you know miles paused i didnt go to my relatives those last weekends he scowled so she tells me i think dulcies a very nice girl so do i said charlie barefoot that evening miles glanced up sharply from his muirs pathology and said perhaps barefoot you would have the kindness to return my pencil when youve finished chewing it this happens to be my own pencil grimsdyke and i am not chewing it i distinctly saw you chew it just now apart from ruining the pencilmy pencilyou ought to know that chewing pencils is a thoroughly unhygienic habit leading to the transfer of streptococcus viridans and large numbers of other oral pathogens oh take the bloody pencil said barefoot and went up and sat in his bedroom it was the old business of sex cutthroat rivalry in class had never ruffled the two chaps friendship now they glared at each other all night across the top of their textbooks the following saturday evening miles sat alone miserably drinking cups of cocoa and wondering blackly how to do charlie barefoot down the saturday afterwards he told his chum he was taking dulcie to the festival hall and visited her parents in guildford on the monday morning the whole hospital discovered that he and nurse crimpole were engaged barefoot was very decent about it i wont say i am not disappointed he confessed in mrs cappers parlour dulcies a wonderful girl and i was getting rather fond of her butwell theres no one id rather lose her to than you miles its really extremely generous of you charlie and whens the wedding not till ive qualified of course ive cabled my father out east that my new status certainly wont interfere with my work youll be my best man i hope that will be my only consolation for the whole affair youre a brick charlie and youre a real sport miles they shook hands across eden amp hollands obstetrics now began charlie barefoot what would you consider the leading features in the management of a case of puerperal paranoia the years which stretch pretty chillingly ahead of you as a junior medical student soon start to melt away as far as i remember after that miles took dulcie out regularly every saturday while barefoot went by himself for tramps in the country the rest of the week the pair of them studied as steadily as before youll collar the medical and surgical prizes in the finals all right conceded barefoot when the exams were only a few weeks ahead miles smiled across the plush tablecloth now a little faded it could easily be your turn charlie barefoot shook his head no miles youre streets ahead of me on the practical but i suppose wed both better get on with some work theres really so much revision to get through what are the ninetyfour causes of haematuria when miles next met dulcie he explained he couldnt spare his saturday afternoons from studying any longer but you really must get some fresh air she insisted after all now im a staff nurse and know all about these things lack of sunlight can reduce your vitamin d right down to dangerlevel damn vitamin d exclaimed miles and a b and c as well miles she said horrified at such blasphemy im sorry dear im a bit irritable these days its only the pressure of work are you sure thats all youre looking terribly peaky yes of course thats all old miles is fundamentally honest which has nearly wrecked more careers than his own he disliked telling dulcie a lie but how could he explain that he wished the ruddy woman were dead a couple of years in the roughandtumble of the hospital wards has changed far worldlier young fellows than my cousin as a junior student hed been surprised at any girl smiling at him now he was almost a doctor and got smiles all round some of them very pretty ones and he could no longer dissuade himself that the woman was a shocking bore are you sure youre getting enough sleep dulcie went on the professor says seven hours is the normal minimum and what about your diet im certain youre not taking nearly enough calories dr parsons gave us a smashing lecture about them yesterday very interesting dear how would you like to pass the afternoon shall we go round an art gallery if you dont think it would tire you too much from the way you walk about miles im not at all sure you havent got flat feet the wedding was planned for a fortnight after the examinations and i was already wondering how to raise the rent of a moss bros suit i hadnt seen anything of miles for weeks and supposed he was swotting steadily for the exam in fact he was mostly sitting in mrs cappers parlour trying to find some honourable escape from his obligations short of suicide after my own later experiences in porterhampton i could sympathize with the chap he told me afterwards hed almost reached for murrells poisons before the answer appeared with the clarity of all great inspirations miles decided deliberately to fail his exam even i could appreciate the simplicity of the scheme miles couldnt sit again for another six months and by then dulcie crimpole might have got tired of waiting she might have got a sisters job miles away in the north she might have got run over by an ambulance at least he wouldnt be walking up the aisle with her in exactly six weeks time hello exclaimed barefoot arriving home from his tramp in the chilterns youre looking much happier with life tonight personally i always find the day of the examinations as unattractive as the day of judgement but miles and barefoot strode into the examination hall a few weeks later without flinching good luck miles whispered barefoot as they separated among the schoolroom desks just far enough apart to make cribbing rather tantalizing my cousin smiled this time you dont need any charlie miles told me he did well in the written paperbottling up that knowledge from mrs cappers parlour would have been almost as heartbreaking for him as marrying nurse crimpole besides the clinical session presents more opportunities for spectacular failure under the eye of the examiner himself when a few mornings later miles approached the bedside of his allotted examination case he felt both determined and serene well my boy began the examiner appearing after the interval they give you for diagnosis what do you find wrong with your patient i am afraid sir said miles that i cant make a diagnosis of anything at all the examiner seized him by the hand congratulations weve put in a perfectly normal man and youd be horrified at the peculiar diagnoses ive had to put up with all morning mr miles grimsdyke isnt it i thought so only a student of your outstanding ability could have seen through our little deception excellent my dear sir good morning poor old miles staggered into the street gripped by an alarming thoughtafter all those years of being an academic athlete it was impossible for him to fail an examination at all he made his way from the hall in a daze wondering what the devil to do there was still the oral examination that afternoon hed half a mind simply to clear off to the cinema instead but theyd only give him another appointment like a candidate taken ill the vision of nurse crimpole rose before him wearing a wedding dress when he finally focused on his surroundings he found himself facing a sign announcing the red lionales and spirits i dont believe miles had ever swallowed a drink in his life but he felt so miserable he decided to experiment with the treatment hed seen me administering to myself for years good morning sir said the chap behind the bar what can i get you i want a drink of course sir what sort of drink it had never occurred to miles that there were different ones he noticed an advertisement showing bottles glistening on blocks of ice which looked very refreshing a drink of that vodka sir large or small oh large please i didnt have time for my second cup of tea at breakfast the story of miles oral examination never got out no one likes a bit of gossip better than me but even i should have felt a cad so much as hinting about it his answers to sir lancelot spratt at first flew across the greenbaize table even though he was grasping it for support as he wiped away the perspiration with his handkerchief now mr grimsdyke went on sir lancelot perfectly used to the oddities of nervous candidates let us discuss the subject of gastric pain no said miles i beg your pardon i said no youre always discussing gastric pain and do you know why ill tell you its because you know all about gastric pain you might know sweet fanny adams about anything else as far as your students are concerned youve bored me stiff with gastric pain for three years and im not going to talk about it now youre perfectly correct mr grimsdyke agreed sir lancelot after a thoughtful pause of all dead horses to flog dead hobby horses are the worse im glad that a gentleman of your courage had the decency to stop me becoming a tyrannical bore on the subject thank you we shall discuss nausea and vomiting instead oh god said miles and gripped his waist coat he still might have passed if he hadnt been sick into sir lancelots homburg the next evening the passlist was read from the examination hall steps with the announcement that charles barefoot st swithins had won the university prizes in medicine and surgery miles wasnt mentioned at all hed arranged to meet dulcie crimpole outside swan and edgars and hurried to detonate his news but before he could speak she held out her hand and said goodbye miles goodbye yes she felt for her handkerchief iim afraid ive been a bad girl im very fond of you miles butim really in love with charlie barefoot after all now we want to get married miles gasped butbut how long has this been going on just a few weeks ive been out with him every saturday while you studied at home but i didnt want to tell you before i thought it might upset you for your examination even sir lancelot himself doesnt know the full story about dulcie crimpole miles whispered on the doorstep as i left for the houseboat after dinner i believe i read in an advertisement somewhere that vodka leaves no smell on the breath i nodded a wise choice at the time having such a formidable rival for the job as barefoot is bad enough as it is but if the tale got out just at this particular moment rely on gaston old lad compared with me an oyster is garrulous besides i have problems enough of my own not serious i hope purely professional and happily resolving every moment he frowned slightly what exactly are you up to gaston one day i hope youll find out meanwhile dont worry ill take any odds you end up with a permanent stable at st swithins its certainly kind of you to give me some encouragement im afraid i dont seem to get much of it these days dinner had been pretty gloomy that evening with miles brooding on barefoot and even connie hardly able to raise a laugh when i told a few funny stories to cheer them up falling into the prevailing mood i started pondering on my own troubles with the book then i suddenly had another of those brilliant inspirations of mine here i was stuck over portraying to the public the brilliant and dedicated young surgeon and sitting opposite glaring into his raspberries was the prototype known intimately from childhood whenever my clifford standforth was faced with a tricky situation i had only to ask myself how would that chump miles have tackled it and that should be good for another twenty pages i was so taken with the idea i could hardly finish my coffee before hurrying back and trying it out on the typewriter i felt i could have the manuscript on carboy and plovers doormat in a fortnight which i might have done if a telegram hadnt arrived a few days later from my forwarding address saying come immediately monte carlo all expenses paid lady nutbeam the summons wasnt a particular surprise id been followingup my former patient closely this being easy from the newspaper placards which generally said something like lord nutbeam again the old boy was whooping it up on the riviera at a rate which made champagne charlie look very small beer and people read so much about him on the bus going home hed become one of the things the british public wondered how on earth they existed without like penicillin and television im not one to refuse a free trip even to margate and anyway the houseboat had sprung a leak which id calculated in another ten days would put me completely under water but i hesitated wondering if lord nutbeam should have summoned a more highpowered doctor than myself finally i decided that if he really wanted my own humble ministrations i couldnt let the old boy down and stuffing my manuscript and stethoscope into a suitcase i rapidly switched professions and booked on the next plane south the following afternoon found me driving in his lordships new rolls among the palm trees it was aubrey who insisted on sending for you said lady nutbeam greeting me at her hotel she looked just the same except for the diamonds he doesnt trust foreign doctors are you sure he shouldnt have got the president of the royal college of physicians instead not at all doctor after all youve saved his life once already havent you i found old nutbeam lying in a darkened room suffering from nothing worse than a chronic hangover fortunately i have wide clinical experience of this condition and prescribed a diet of dry biscuits with some french spa water that tasted like bottled gasworks thats a relief lady nutbeam agreed as we left him suffering in peace though i didnt think it was anything serious but i hope the poor dear will soon be himself again hes so enjoying life at the moment he was rather out of training for it thats all perhaps you could stay on a few days doctor she paused on the terrace gazing at the millionaires yachts parked in the harbour as thickly as the cars on brighton front as a matter of fact i am a little worried about my husband you mean i suigested that party i read about in the papers pouring champagne over the maharajah she nodded and setting off fireworks under the greek millionaire not to mention the icecream down the french ballet dancers dress im afraid doctor aubrey might sometimes strike one as a little childish pure boyish high spirits im sure i should like to think so id be much obliged if youd keep an eye on him for a while you might be able to control him a little you know he thinks the world of your advice you would be our guest of course i gathered the nutbeams and a good many other people in monte carlo had cash in lands where you didnt have to fill in beastly little forms to get it out i could possibly spare a day or two i admitted if youre still sure im the right chap but youve learned the penalty of boyish high spirits already doctor havent you lady nutbeam smiled i noticed in long wotton you took the lesson to heart as the days went by and nobody asked me to leave i found myself a regular member of lord nutbeams household along with the chauffeur and the valet come to think of it id always wanted the job of private physician to a travelling millionaire though these days theres as much chance of finding anybody travelling with their private executioner his lordship being an easy patient i passed the time sitting in the sun finishing my book and brushing up my frenchi flatter myself im rather hot stuff at this defense de cr–≤cher and cr–∫pes suzette business gar–∑on i was saying fluently after a week or so apportezmoi une verre du bon vieux bi–πre anglaise sil vous plait and if thats the luncheon menu you have there ill try the gratin de langoustines georgette thats sort of muckedup shrimps isnt it monsieur has the true english sense of humour remind me sometime to tell you the story of l–πv–πque et le perroquet were the roses sent to the young lady i met in the sporting club last night mais certainement monsieur jolli bon spectacle and waiterinform the chauffeur ill be taking the car this afternoon i might do a little shopping in nice entendu monsieur i felt that life for grimsdyke was looking up the waiter had hardly left the terrace to collect my midmorning refreshment when my patient himself appeared lord nutbeam seemed in excellent spirits and was smoking a cigar my dear doctor when on earth are you going to let me have a drink he started as usual i was passing such a delightful time going through the barmans cocktails id just reached that most interesting concoction of tomato juice and vodka there is so much to catch up on in life next monday you might run to a glass of vin blanc i told him sternly but doctor the film festival it starts tomorrow and i do so want to give a little party for those bright young people ive never met a real film star you know indeed the only one i remember is a dog called rintintin i dont expect hell be coming of course he offered me a cigar they say this young lady is arriving at the hotel from london this afternoon he added picking up a magazine with melody madder on the cover it was difficult at the time to pick up any magazine that hadnt she was a redhead in a tight dress whonot to put too fine a point on itstruck me as suffering from pronounced mammary hyperplasia but it seems a condition in which people are widely interested and in the past few months shed become better known to the british public than the britannia on the back of a penny fascinating creature mused lord nutbeam remarkable how the point of interest changes isnt it forty years ago it was all legs and forty years before that the girls wore bustles i do so hope i shall live to see what it is next the odd thing is i remarked ive a feeling ive met her somewhere i suppose i saw her in a picture i only wish you had met her doctor i should so much like the pleasure of doing so myself though ethel seems most unenthusiastic at the idea if you could ask her to my party i should certainly express my appreciation tangibly you havent a rolls have you i promised to do my best and how is the book coming along alas for some reason i seem to be getting so behind with my reading these days for the past couple of days the hotel had been steadily filling up for the festival mostly with actresses who were more or less overdressed or more or less undressed and all anatomically impossible actors holding their breath while photographed in bathingtrunks and film stars husbands discussing their wives income tax the rest i supposed were the financial wizards who could be spotted through their habit of approaching closed doors with their hands in their pockets with about fifteen people fighting to grab the handle first it didnt seem easy to make the acquaintance of such a highpowered hotsie as melody madder even if we were staying in the same hotel i didnt even see more of her arrival than the top of her famous red hair what with all the chaps trying to take her photograph i found a quiet corner of the lobby and searched for a plan to present her with his lordships invitation there wasnt much point in simply going along with a bunch of flowers even lord nutbeams name not cutting much ice with the woman whod become as much a national institution as the lions in trafalgar square i supposed i could send up an elegant little note which at least might produce her autograph in return as the first step seemed finding her room number i was approaching the reception desk trying to remember the french for suite when i was elbowed aside by a fat woman in a hat with cherries dangling from it its an utter disgrace the fat woman started on the unfortunate chap behind the counter our rooms that stuffy i darent draw a breath hasnt been aired for years if you ask me and as for the beds i dont even like to think about them but if madame will open the shutters open them you try and open them youll have to use dynamite i was a bit annoyed at the elbowing though i saw her pointfresh air is provided free in english hotels all round the windows and under the doors but in france they get some inside a bedroom and like to keep it for years and another thing the light wont go on and i got stuck in the lift the hotel engineer will attend to it at once madame as for the plumbing its disgraceful whats the idea of that ridiculous washbasin six inches off the ground sir theodore theobald shall hear about this believe you me furthermore my daughter is still airsick and i must have a doctor at once a doctor mrs madder we shall send for the best available i pushed myself forward forgive my butting in i said quickly but if you want a doctor i happen to be the chap she looked as if i were another of the local inconveniences the gentleman madame is personal physician to lord nutbeam oh are you well i suppose youll do but i dont mind telling you here and now you cant expect any fancy fees in an emergency mrs madder it would be quite unethical for me to make a charge this seemed to tip the scales and i felt pretty pleased with myself as i followed her into the lift and up to a bedroom stuffed with flowers not only could i issue old nutbeams invitation as i felt melody madders pulse but i might be able to go over her chest as well get yourself ready my girl said mrs madder advancing to the bed ive brought the doctor good lord i exclaimed why hello petunia petunia gave a little shriek and sat up in bed gaston what on earth are you doing here but what are you doing here in that hair too whats all this demanded mother mum its dr grimsdykeyou know the one who used to bring me home in the rattly old car oh it is is it yes i remember now ive often seen him from the bedroom window you seem to have come up a bit in the world pet i observed warmly jolly good job you didnt get the mumps after all i kicked myself for not recognizing all those photographs though i must say shed been heavily camouflaged since the days when we shared the same bedroom in her natural state old pet would never strike you as particularly short on the hormones but the way the film chaps had got her up she looked like an endocrinologists benefit night shes still feeling sick said mother mum im not i told you im not yes you are it was just the same when we went on the coach to hastings youre always sick for hours afterwards perhaps you will permit me to prescribe mrs madderor mrs bancroft rather i took charge of the situation if youll run down to the chemists with this theyll concoct it on the spot whats wrong with the hall porter may i ask better go yourself to see they make it up properly these french pharmacists you know mum hesitated a moment but seeming to think it safe because i was the doctor left the pair of us alone gaston its divine to see you again petunia held out her arms but what on earth are you giving me to take bicarbonate of soda which you could get from the chef i just wanted a moment to find how the transformation had taken place she laughed of course i havent seen you since that place up northwhats it called mother was furious shed no idea id met you though wanted to hear what id been up to fog or no fog you know what shes like im beginning to find out she almost threw me out of the house i was terribly hurt after all nothing in the slightest immoral happened there at all quite i said she told me to get a respectable jobusherette nursemaid secretary or something i was awfully upset because i never really wanted to leave the stage not even if i hadnt half a chance of reaching the top you seem to have disproved that one anyway oh being an actress isnt much to do with all this pet picked at the bedcover its the other things that count i wanted a mink coat and what girl doesnt i mean to get a start you have to wear the right clothes appear in the right places meet the right people the only people i met were as broke as i was which i knew for a fact because i tried to borrow money from all of them i know the feeling petunia smoothed back her new red hair the very day after the fog i went to shaftesbury avenue to see my agent and as usual he said sorry darling nothing at the moment unless you happen to be a distressed gentlewoman i asked why and he told me monica fairchild had just been in you know who she is gaston i certainly do i was her doctor for a bit before she had the baby whoever her doctor is now told her to get away from it all and have a rest she was leaving the baby with her husband and taking a mediterranean cruise and wanted this distressed gentlewoman as her secretaryexpenses paid no other dibs of course i remembered miss fairchild was as openhanded as a dyspeptic taxcollector when i got out into shaftesbury avenue again petunia continued as i took her hand in a professional sort of clasp it struck mewham if i could play a doctors wife in a fog why couldnt i play a distressed gentlewoman on a cruise and if i got friendly with fairchild theres no knowing how shed help me along anyway id have four square meals a day and perhaps a bit of fun also i could get away from mum for a bit so i put on my old tweed skirt and went round to her flat in mount street and got the job she didnt know me from eve of course you then developed one of these famous shipboard friendships with the fairchild i suggested and thats how you got on all the magazine covers not on your life in fact when i see her again shell probably tear my hair out to stuff her pillow with i looked surprised we went down to the ship with enough luggage for a circus petunia went on you cant imagine the fuss with the photographers flowers and all the sailors trying to get her autograph nobody took any notice of me of course especially in my old tweed skirt if i didnt know i was dogsbody there and then i soon found out it was miss bancroft tell the captain i must have my special diet and miss bancroft complain the waters too hard for my complexion and miss bancroft if they dont stop that awful siren thing this very minute i shall positively have hysterics i should have gone crackers if the old hag hadnt been seasick you know she usually looks like a combined operation by dior and elizabeth arden lying on her bunk groaning under an icebag she reminded me of one of my touring landladies when the rent was overdue i think it gave me a bit of confidence great leveller the nausea i agreed in fact it gave me enough confidence to put on my new dress id bought it with all the money i had left in the world it was the one i wore on the cover of last months gentlemens relish i remembered it was a thing fitting petunia as closely as her epidermis to which it gave way for large areas about the upper thorax it was the first night we had dinner at the captains table he was ever so nice kept leaning over to pass me the butter and things with his own hands he didnt take half as much notice of fairchild sitting there in her best mink she was furious of course developed a headache and disappeared to her cabin and next morning the steward told me id been shifted to another table it was behind a pillar thing in the corner with five commercial travellers from birmingham a bit of a comedown i sympathized eating below the old salts salt cant blame fairchild i suppose even offstage a star has to keep in the limelight and dont i know it now but i dont quite follow how this made you into melody madder i felt puzzled all fairchild did was chase you about enough to have made all cleopatras slaves give notice that all started when we got to naples when count longrandesi came aboard what the terribly rich chap who takes horses all round the world to jump on them over bits of wood petunia nodded by then fairchild had found i was in the profession she wasnt so easy to fool as that little fat man up north i had to read scripts to her in the afternoons and one day she turned on me and said youve been on the stage miss bancroft i said yes you came to me under false pretences she said i told her an actress could still be a gentlewoman and i happened to be a distressed one that turned her nasty and she made me do all her laundry pretty grubby some of it was too anyway the count appeared with his horses for london he was all big eyes and kiss your hand and of course fairchild was after him out for the count in fact i laughed he saw me first petunia continued not seeming to see the joke i had that dress on ever so sweet he was what with buying me a green chartreuse in the veranda caf–π though i suppose i should have known better than putting fairchilds nose out of joint all over again the next morning she told me i wasnt to wear my dress any more what a bitch in the manger after that the count didnt take much notice of me not in my old tweed skirt but at least he kept fairchild quiet for the rest of the cruise she hardly spoke to me until we were nearly home again then just before we got in she said miss bancroft im sorry if ive been overwrought during the cruise my nerves you know do tell me if theres anything i can do in london to help you though of course im going to hollywood in a couple of weeks for the next two years just look at this lovely blue mink the counts given me she said he was bringing it to london for his sister but hell buy her another one at bradleys isnt he sweet she said do be a darling she said and slip it over your shoulders when we go through customs theyd charge me the absolute earth if i tried to bring two minks through the barrier and i cant possibly afford to throw my money away on stupid things like duty why it quite suits you she said and you agreed pet didnt have much choice actually the customs man was an absolute darling though i suppose he rather liked the idea of running his hands through monica fairchilds underwear as soon as hed done that little squiggle with his chalk and left us fairchild said thank you miss bancroft so i said thank you for what and she said for wearing my mink of course so i said your mink but my dear this is my mink dont be an idiot miss bancroft she said you know perfectly well i only asked you to wear it through customs did you i said i cant remember perhaps wed better call back that nice customs man and see if he does miss bancroft petunia you wouldnt as you know yourself monica dear i told her the road to success is strewn with unfortunate accidents goodbye and thank you for a lovely trip by the way i noticed on that little card thing that the penalties for even suspected smuggling include long periods in the clink so there i was gastonloose in london with a blue mink cape and an old tweed skirt i suppose i wasnt very honest really but i promise ill send it back once shes home from hollywood jolly quick thinking if you ask me i said admiringly i suddenly felt that pet had a bit more power under the bonnet than id imagined its about the most innocent way ive heard of a girl getting a mink coat anyway after that all the breaks seemed to come at once my agent took me to lunchin the mink of course we met adam stringfellow hes a director who was casting some models for a picture he gave me a few days at the studio and since then everything sort of built up and whats it like i asked bloody hard work said petunia i looked surprised having gathered from the newspapers that all she did was drive about in big fat cars with big fat chaps and draw a big fat salary do you know what time i get up in the morning before my milkman i have to be at the studio by six if you please for hairdo and makeup you cant imagine how ghastly it is playing a passionate love scene before breakfast lying on a bed and remembering to keep one foot on the ground to make it all right for the censor like billiards i observed and im not myself any more oh come perfect health i assure you i mean im melody madder limited with a board of directors and things everyone does it because of the tax and of course theres mum ah yes mum then theres another thing she looked up at me fluttering her brandnew eyelashes gaston my sweetdo you remember how once you loved me only too well pet my dear i was still getting a bit of rheumatism in the shoulder the longterm aftereffects of clems caff do you know i believe youre the only friend ive left in the world and i need help darling good lord do you desperately im in terrible trouble oh yes i looked cagey knowing the sort of trouble girls specially reserve the doctors among their old friends for but petunia went on its all mums fault really promise cross your heart you wont say a word of course not we doctors you know professional secrecy well ill tell you its simply that but at that moment mum arrived back with the medicine this will have your daughter spry in no time i told her shaking the bottle i particularly hope shes in form again tomorrow night because ive been asked to invite her to lord nutbeams little party shell have to get permission from sir theodore first said mother and from mr stringfellow of course i have to ask their permission for everything petunia apologized from the bed and my permission i might say added mrs bancroft im still your mother you know yes mum said petunia i do so hope the young lady is free agreed lord nutbeam when i arrived at his suite to explain the snags id planned such a splendid little evening there will be champagne of course and a band to play south american dances have you heard of the rumba doctor it does my hip tremendous good i wanted fireworks as well but ethel seems most disinclined i made a consoling remark about guy fawkes coming but once a year and he gave a sigh and went on dont you think doctor that people are becoming such spoilsports these days not ethel of course the dear girl is most understanding i wanted to buy a tank of those tiny fishes in the aquarium and serve them frozen in the waterice tomorrow night it would have been such a capital lark but the hotel management wouldnt hear of it i shot the old boy a glance id wondered more than once since arriving at monte carlo whether his wifes diagnosis of presenile dementia wasnt correct i supposed it was all right to make your medical adviser an applepie bed and to stick a champagne bucket on his bedroom door to dowse him with icecold water on retiring or even to bust in with shouts of fire when hes enjoying an early night and have him looking pretty stupid running into the hall in his pyjamas with everyone else in tails and tiaras moving off to the opera all right when your advisers a chap like me perhaps but if lord nutbeam really had summoned the president of the royal college of physicians the little episodes might not have ended with such hearty laughter all round but we shall have a lot of fun his lordship went on im arranging for a lifesize statue of miss madder in icecream and we can eat her also the delightful gentleman from south america has promised to let me conduct the band all evening if i want im sure everything will be very jolly by then i was as keen as old nutbeam for petunia to get clearance all round and come to the party as pet bancroft shed always been a very decent sort whom you didnt mind introducing to your friends when she wasnt in her waiterbiting mood but dancing round the room with melody madder i felt could make you seem no end of a chap the odd thing was though i hadnt been keen on marrying petunia bancroft i wouldnt at all have minded melody madder i supposed freud was rightif adult happiness comes from fulfilling the longings of childhood id always wanted to marry a film star along with opening for england at lords and beating the school record of twentyfour strawberry ices at a sitting the only snag was not much liking the idea of getting into bed every night with a limited company i idled away the following day seeing some of the films which were all about peasants and chaps in factories who took a gloomy view of life then i put on my white dinnerjacket and wandered into lord nutbeams party sure enough there was petunia bursting at the gussets with bewitchery miss madder i bowed may i have the pleasure of this dance gaston darling but i must introduce you to sir theodore first id heard of the chief financial wizard of union jack films of course generally making speeches after eightcourse banquets saying how broke he was whats he like i asked oh perfectly easy and affable as long as youre used to dealing with the commissars in charge of siberian salt mines i found him sitting over a glass of orange juice with the expression of an orangoutang suffering from some irritating skin disease of course you know quinny finn of course everyone knew quintin finn you keep seeing him on the pictures dressed in a duffel coat saying such things as up periscope bombs gone or come on chaps lets dodge it through the minefield actually he was a little weedy fellow who smelt of perfume and this is adam stringfellow id always imagined film directors were noisy chaps with large cigars but this was a tall gloomy bird with a beard resembling those portraits of thomas carlyle everyone shook hands very civilly and i felt pretty pleased with myself particularly with my old weakness for the theatre i was wondering if pet perhaps retained the passions of porterhampton when she interrupted my thoughts with id particularly like you to meet mr hosegood petunia indicated the fattest little man id seen outside the obesity clinic he had a bald head a moustache like a squashed beetle and a waist which like the equator was a purely imaginary line equidistant from the two poles my future husband ended petunia shall we dance gaston i almost staggered on to the floor it was shock enough finding petunia already engaged but the prospect of such a decent sort of girl becoming shackled for life to this metabolic monstrosity struck me as not only tragic but outrageously wasteful congratulations i said congratulations what about your engagement oh yes thanks its supposed to be a secret studio publicity want to link me with quinny finn i hope youll be very happy thanks ill send a set of coffeespoons for the wedding thanks we avoided lord nutbeam chasing some italian actress with a squeaker gaston began petunia yes thats exactly what i wanted to talk to you about yesterday jimmy hosegood i mean i dont want to marry him at all you dont i looked relieved thats simple then just tell the chap but sir theodore and mum want me to well tell them then you try telling them i could see her point gaston i need your help terribly dont you see ive simply no one else in the world to turn to how on earth can i get rid of jimmy i danced round in silence it seemed a case of good old grimsdyke again always tackling other peoples troubles helping them to get out of engagements or into st swithins this chap hosegoods in the film business she shook her head hes in gowns hes got lots of factories in manchester somewhere but he puts up the money for the films you follow but i dont even know the fellow i protested and you simply cant go up to a perfect stranger and tell him his fianc–πe hates the sight of his face come down to our tent on the beach and have a gettogether im sure youll think of something absolutely brilliant darling you always do promise but before i could make a reply mrs bancroft was elbowing through the crowd petuniatime for bed yes mum here i say i exclaimed dash it its barely midnight the only advice i require from you is on medical matters young man up you go petunia dont forget your skinfood on the dressingtable no mum or to say good night to sir theodore yes mum and adam stringfellow yes mum good night gaston they left me in the middle of the dance floor feeling pretty cross id been looking forward to a jolly little party with britains biggest sex symbol and here she was pushed off to bed like a schoolgirl on holiday i stared round wondering what to do with the rest of the evening as i didnt seem to know anybody and lord nutbeam was starting to throw charlotte russe into the chandeliers i thought i might as well go up to bed too excuse me said a voice behind me i turned to find a tall blonde with a long cigaretteholder and one of those charm bracelets which make women sound like passing goods trains whenever they reach for a drink youre dr grimsdyke arent you quite correct known melody madder long years and years i returned pretty shortly almost at school together in fact really how very interesting dont you think its stuffy in here shall we go outside for a drink she took my arm you can tell me the story of your life in the moonlight i dont really think youd be very interested but im sure ill be very interested indeed doctor she made for the terrace lets sit in the orangery where well not be disturbed i didnt see petunia for the next twentyfour hours lord nutbeam being in such a state after the party we had to spend a quiet day motoring in the mountains in the end id passed a pleasant little evening with the blonde whos name turned out to be dawn something and was one of those sympathetic listeners who make such good hospital almoners and barmaids after a few glasses of champagne shed got me telling her all my troubles including miles and trying to write a book though i kept pretty quiet about petunia and jimmy hosegood id already decided it was as dangerous to go mucking about gaily in peoples love affairs as to go mucking about gaily in their abdomens and to let poor old pet manage this amorous tweedledum herself i supposed i could have told him she was married already with a couple of kids in dr barnardos i could have said she ground her teeth all night in bed i could have challenged him to a duel when at least id have stood the best chance of scoring a hit but these ideas all struck me as leading to unwanted complications it was a couple of mornings later when i wandered down to the beach to find petunia and discovered hosegood in the tent alone on a deckchair that looked as unsafe as a birdcage under a steamroller nice day he said as i appeared great stuff for toning up the system a bit of sunshine as he was fully dressed except for his boots and socks i supposed he was drawing up the beneficial ultraviolet rays through his feet mind if i sit down i was looking for miss madder make yourself comfortable lad she was called on some photographing lark somewhere he seemed very civil so i took the next chair enjoying all the fun of the festival i asked hosegood sighed id be happier on the sands at morecambe i would straight i dont hold with all this flummeryflannery myself though theres plenty as does not that im one to interfere with anybodys enjoyment as long as its decent i expect youre a pretty knowledgeable chap about films i went on trying to work up some sort of conversation me dont be daft lad i never go to the pictures unless i cant help it he sat for some time staring at his bunions there didnt seem much else to talk about whats your line of country he asked im a doctor you are by gum he almost rolled off the deckchair just the feller im looking for delighted to be of assistance i said politely tell me doctorhow can i get some of this blessed weight off losing weight is perfectly simple i replied is it he brightened up a bit then what do i do doctor eat less but i dont eat enough to keep a bird alive not fattening foods at any rate nothing likewell oysters for instance one dozen oysters i disillusioned him have only the food value of a lightlyboiled egg go on but i thoughti can be frank with you of course doctor now that im getting marriedmelody and me yknowand none of us are getting any younger perhaps a few oysters i disillusioned him about that one too how about massage he asked hopefully isnt that good for taking off weight excellent i told him for the masseuse hosegood looked gloomily at the agreeable combination of blue sea and girls in bikinis frolicking in the sunshine i recalled a dietetic lecture at st swithins when a professor resembling an articulated meatskewer explained how he lived on a diet of crushed soya beans while sir lancelot spratt who held that no gentleman ever dined off less than four courses suffered violent trembling attacks and had to be taken out they say in the papers its dangerous to be fat hosegood added sombrely the commonest instruments of suicide i agreed have rightly been described as a knife and fork but ive led a good clean life theres some ive seen in the club eating like steam shovels and never putting on an ounce ive only to look twice at the menu myself and im letting out all my trousers again one of the nastier jokes of nature i sympathized its all a matter of the appetiteregulating centre nuzzling in the cranium between your pituitary gland and our subconscious fixations about mother then perhaps you can suggest some sort of diet doctor as a matter of fact i can usually i prefer professional incognito in social surroundings what with people keeping coming up and telling you all about their ruddy prolapsed kidneys but old hosegood struck me as a very decent sort and even a good bridegroom for a girl preparing to risk getting stuck in the door of the church the st swithins hospital diet i explained producing the card from my wallet all perfectly simple as long as you remember to treat potatoes and puddings like deadly nightshade no fish and chips nor alcohol im rather fond of a drop of beer so am i thats the bitter pill but he didnt seem in the mood for joking and pocketed the card in silence thank you doctor ill give it a go at lunchtime im having a bite with stringfellow in the caf–π de paris i suppose he wants to talk me into more brass for melodys picture talking of miss madder i went on i certainly wouldnt contemplate marriage until youve lost a couple of stone he looked alarmed you really think so without a doubt most dangerous this wasnt strictly correct professionally though i remembered a fat chap brought into st swithins orthopaedic department on his honeymoon with a dislocated shoulder when the bed broke besides i went on theres always the risk of i was aware of lady nutbeam standing in front of us looking flustered doctor there you are ive been looking simply everywhere we have to go back to england at once this very afternoon good lord really nothing serious i hope my husband he hasnt fractured his other hip no no its the hotel management the white mice he let loose at breakfast oh i see id like you to come in the car with us doctor im afraid aubreysometimes a little trying even for me of course i said though id counted on another fortnight of free drinks in the sunshine if mr hosegood will excuse me ill pack at once and this telegram just arrived for you for me i didnt think anyone knew my address i opened it it said return england instantly whole country disgusted by your behaviour miles and how pray started miles do you account for that it was a few days later and id gone round early to his flat to see what the fuss was about account for what it seems like the morning paper to me not even todays either you fool read whats on the middle page good lord i exclaimed theres a photo of me there was a headline saying melodys men also pictures of quintin finn commanding a battleship and jimmy hosegood laying on the beach like a jettisoned beer barrel i gave a laugh it says dr gaston grimsdyke the fashionable young london physician is also tipped at the festival as the future mr madder i wonder what gave them that idea lots more about me too good god man you actually seem proud of it well ive never had my photograph in the papers before miles got rather excited the disgrace and scandal of your being mixed up with thisthis melody madders a very decent type and i wont have anyone being beastly about her i helped myself to a cup of his coffee anyway youve been advising me to marry and settle down for years not to the woman with the most advertised thorax in britain but miles interrupted connie dusting somewhere in the background nobody believes what they read in the papers kindly leave this discussion to us far from people forgetting it i had a most uncomfortable evening of ribald jests last night at the club as you have deliberately bruited my name abroad me i havent bruited anyones name anywhere i glanced again at the paper and noticed something about my cousin the brilliant harley street surgeon oh well you know what reporters are for getting up a story i suppose it was that blonde in the hotel i should have spotted she was a journalist but i just thought she was nosey and sporting about paying for the drinks mind if i have this piece of toast this happens to be my breakfast oh sorry and whats all this rubbish about you writing a book mires began again put that in too did she as a matter of fact ive just sent off the manuscript to carboy and plover jolly good advance publicity youve really written a book exclaimed connie how terribly clever of you may i remind you that you were not trained to waste your time scribbling penny dreadfuls its high time you made some contribution to the progress of medicine my best contribution to the progress of medicine old lad would be giving it up not to mention your obligation to suffering humanity suffering humanitys so overstocked with doctors theres always a few of the poor chaps on the dole i told him and all of them probably better than me now look here i started to feel annoyed with my idiotic cousin i may not have written war and peace but im jolly proud of my modest literary efforts and im not going to have them sneered at by chaps whove never written anything except the footer reports for the school mag and pretty terrible they were too if my memory serves me right you have utterly ruined my chances at st swithins of course miles went on staring at me icily it happens that the committee is in an extremely delicate state at the moment barefoot has obtained a large grant from the mckerrow foundation which he will use for surgical research at st swithins if appointed as you know sir lancelot is combing london to find funds for exactly that purpose now the possibility of my becoming related by marriage to a woman withwith her bosom brazened on every billboard in the country is a stick for sir lancelot and every other opponent to batter my chances into nothingness i reached for one of his cigarettes miles i said im getting a bit fed up with all your beastly little backstairs bickering at st swithins as a matter of fact youre a selfish and selfopinionated chump who thinks everyone in sights got to drop what theyre doing and rally round to help you get exactly whatever you wantyou were just the same at school over the jam cupboard how dare you exclaimed miles damnation he added as the telephone rang in time hall sorry old girl i said to connie as he disappeared to answer it afraid i got a bit out of hand with your old man but i think youre right she put down the duster absolutely right id hate to think of miles getting anything except on his own merits and pretty good merits they are im the first to admit i took another look at the newspaper i suppose he rather got my dander up about the novel i apologized though i expect hes right its a bit stupid of me giving up a nice safe profession like medicine safe for the doctors at any rate do you know what i think connie sat on the chair beside me listen to me gastonive known a lot of writers and artists particularly before i met miles i suppose ive run across most of the ones whove since made a name for themselves in london ive darned their socks and stood them meals as often as not and i can assure you of one thing if you really want to write books or paint pictures a little matter like starvation isnt going to stop you thats jolly decent of you connie this was the first really cheering word id had even from carboy and plover anyway she added if youre not suited for being a doctor youre not and it strikes me as better to face it now instead of killing a couple of dozen people to find out miles returned it was sir lancelot spratt he announced he wishes to see you in his theatre at st swithins as soon as you can possibly get over there i was glad to leave both miles and myself becoming a little exhausted by the conversation but i edged through the traffic across london feeling pretty worried about whatever sir lancelot had in store for me i supposed he took the same view as miles and was going to choke me off for disgracing the hospital by appearing in the same newspaper column as poor petunia it had been great fun telling my cousin what a pompous little pustule he really was which id been meaning to ever since he confiscated my private bag of doughnuts but it seemed a bit hard if the old boys at st swithins could use my chumminess with petunia to wreck his hopes of promotion i decided it was only fair to repair what damage i could his remarks about my literary efforts had been pretty galling i admitted but in this country authors are thought a pretty unproductive class anyway i hadnt been back to st swithins for months and it was pleasant to stroll again through the old gateway and have a word with harry the porter about the prospects for goodwood i took the lift up to sir lancelots theatre thinking how frightfully young the students were getting and waited rather nervously in the surgeons room while he finished off a gastrectomy right mr hatrick you sew him up and be careful of that tatty bit of peritoneum i heard him booming nurse my morning tea and two digestive biscuits if you please ah there you are grimsdyke he appeared in the pair of brightblue pyjamas he used for expressing his personality under sterile operating gowns our patient from long wotton seems to be making a satisfactory if not spectacular recovery sir lancelot began so it would seem sir but i want a word with you about another matter ah yes sir i braced myself at least he couldnt throw anything handy and messy at me like he used to inside the theatre sir lancelot untied his mask i believe you are acquainted with this young miss melody madder you mean miss melody madder the actress sir naturally your cousin buttonholed me in the parthenon yesterday with some garbled and apologetic story on the matter i understand there has been something in the newspapers i only read the times of course ier dont really know her sir merely on nodding terms oh just happened to pass her in a crowd sir i see not my type at all sir i dont much like mixing with those sort of people always avoid them sir indeed in fact sir i can confidently assure you that she wouldnt know me from adam then i am extremely disappointed to hear it it happens that particularly wish for an introduction to this young woman myself good lord do you really sir sir lancelot started munching a digestive biscuit i had hoped to prevail upon your kindness to effect it grimsdyke under the circumstances there is no reason for my detaining you any longer i am much obliged to you for calling good morning oneone moment sir i mean to say i know her pretty well sir that is i could easily get to know her sir what the devil do you mean you are being insultingly evasive fact is i confessed i didnt think youd approve of her sir and why not pray i am as appreciative of success on the stage as in surgery i have attended sufficient theatrical people to know that it comes in both professions only from exceptional talent and exceptional hard work he took another swallow of his tea now listen to me you may be aware that i am launching an appeal for funds to carry on surgical research at st swithins the national health service of course doesnt run to such luxuries miles mentioned it sir i am arranging a meeting in the founders hall at the beginning of the next academic year to initiate the campaign you are familiar with the words of horace si posis recte si non quocumque modo rem no of course youre not it means money by right means if you can if not by any means money i should much like miss madder to be present she is after all of considerably more interest to the public than the appearance of merely the prime minister or archbishop of canterbury and in this case beggars fortunately can be choosers you think you can persuade her good then i leave it entirely to you he brushed away the digestive crumbs it was perhaps the odd sensation of doing sir lancelot a favour which suddenly gave me another of my brilliant ideas i felt i could now put poor old miles right back in the running for st swithins how much does the fund need to get it off to a good start sir i asked some ten thousand pounds i should say you are surely not going to write a cheque grimsdyke no sir but lord nutbeam might indeed it was miles who suggested it sir he felt sure lord nutbeam would cough up for surgical research in view of his clinical history sir lancelot stroked his beard hm well if either of you can persuade him i need hardly say that i should be delighted keep me informed now i must get on with the next case good day good day sir by the way grimsdyke sir lancelot paused in the doorway miss madder sir he made vague movements in front of his thorax its all done with wires and whalebones isnt it oh no sir its all living tissue is it by george you must be a more enterprising young man than i imagined she was one of my patients sir i explained though i thought it best not to tell the old boy id only been treating petunia for nausea a fund for surgical research i should be delighted to contribute said lord nutbeam thats really terribly decent of you you see i was talking to sir lancelot the other day and he felt thatshall we sayten thousand pounds would make a nice shot from the starting gun my dear doctor i assure you i shall give the utmost that i can possibly afford im so glad you drew my attention to it and what are you doing this lovely morning ethel and i are continuing to explore london such fun you know we are going to the zoo again where i find the monkeys absolutely intriguing would you care to accompany us jolly kind of you but ive got to drive out to the union jack film studios have you indeed i should love to visit a film studio myself if you have a moment before you go would you be kind enough to slip round the corner and buy me a large bag of monkey nuts it was a few days later and one of those mornings which make you think of flannels on the village green punts dozing on the river strawberries and cream in the garden and all the other gentle english summer delights which compensate for the place being uninhabitable most of the winter i was still staying with the nutbeams in their house in belgravia and the previous evening id telephoned petunia about sir lancelots meeting come and see me at the studio tomorrow shed invited and darling what are you doing about jimmy hosegood i didnt mention i intended to do nothing about jimmy hosegood though feeling a bit of a cad like st george pretending the fiery dragon was only something to do with the roadworks and hes got so peculiar lately petunia went on ever since you put him on that diet thing peculiar how like a centipede with corns ever so gloomy and grumpy and biting everyones head off even sir theodores the sudden drop in bloodsugar is inclined to make people touchy st francis must have been absolutely intolerable until he got into his stride hes even being sticky about putting up the money for my picture adam stringfellows awfully upset not to mention mum perhaps i might be able to prescribe some counter therapy i suggested see you for lunch i was as curious as old nutbeam to explore a film studio though rather disappointed to find the buildings stuck in the middle of the sussex countryside resembled a municipal sanitorium there were even the same long concrete corridors inside where you could fancy you smelt the antiseptic the only difference being the place hadnt any windows and everyone was walking about dressed up as roman soldiers and hawaiian dancing girls as nobody took any notice of me and all the doors had no entry on them i stood wondering where to go then petunia appeared in an evening gown nicely displaying her gynaecoid pelvis gaston darling have you been waiting long ive been in the rushes lets go down to the canteen ive only twenty minutes before im due on the floor again all right for this st swithins lark i asked after greeting her warmly oh that yes studio publicity have passed it but what about jimmy gaston im absolutely at my wits end honestly hows he looking i asked you can see for yourself hes in the canteen with mum the studio canteen looked like any other works eatingplace except that being full of actors it suggested supper at a fancydress dance in the corner were petunias mum and hosegood he brightened a little as i appeared and exclaimed doctor dont you notice the change in me i was just wondering who the thin chap was i told him though he looked exactly the same except for an expression like mother hubbards dog rolls sir asked the waitress take it away hosegood recoiled as though offered a basket of live snakes and asked for lean meat poultry game rabbit cooked by any method without the addition of flour breadcrumbs or thick sauces see doctorim sticking to that diet like glue i didnt come all the way out here today to talk about your diet mum interrupted giving me a chilly look nor did i expect to discuss my business before strangers i simply want to know why you refuse to put up the end money for melodys film ive got to think about it mumbled hosegood gloomily moneys a serious business yknow as managing director of melody madder limited i demand a better explanation look mrs bancroftonce melody and mes spliced mum i really be quiet this is nothing to do with you i cant understand this change of attitude at all mr hosegood this started an argument which made a pretty miserable lunch of it especially with hosegood ordering cabbage broccoli spinach root vegetables not parsnips boiled or steamed without the addition of fat then a thin chap with long hair appeared to tell melody she was wanted on the set and mum of course went too leaving me to finish off with her fianc–π very difficult mrs bancroft sometimes he remarked why not tuck into a whacking fourcourse meal tonight for a treat i suggested things will look much rosier afterwards but he only shook his head and asked for lettuce radishes watercress parsley with dressing not containing vegetable or minerals oils and i i announced jolly hungry from the country air am going to have a slice of that nice ginger flan hosegoods jaw dropped my favourite dish the poor fellow salivated so much as i cut myself a large wedge and covered it with cream i fancied hed ruined his tie for good id just stuck my fork into the sticky ginger bit when the waitress said i was wanted on the telephone it was petunia from her dressingroom gaston you must do something she seemed almost in tears its mum now she tells me ive got to marry jimmy next month and sir theodores to give it out to the papers tonight what on earth am i going to do im terribly sorry about it pet i apologized weakly but i really dont see how i can possibly but gaston you must oh god heres mum again see you on the set i went back to my place with the nasty feeling that id let down poor old petunia but she was an idiotic little girl to imagine i could ruffle the amorous intentions of a highpowered financial wizard like hosegood besides no scheme had occurred to me except eloping with her myself and miles would be chasing us all the way to gretna then i noticed my plate was empty with jimmy hosegood looking like a cat climbing out of an aviary good lord i exclaimed you didnt the ginger tart mumbled jimmy five hundred calories what a fool cheer up i told him after hed repeated this continually for several minutes to err is not only human but rather fun anyway well get some of it off with a brisk walk down the corridor to petunias studio studio he laid a hand on his waistcoat i dont know if im well enough to get on my feet it must have been a shock to his gastric mucosa having a dish like that slung at it after weeks of fish and sodawater but i was more interested at what went on inside the studio than what went on inside old hosegood and insisted he showed me the way all right doctor he said lumbering up but by gum i do feel queer id often wondered how they set about making a film the only one id seen being on the diagnosis of skin diseases in st swithins outpatients which wasnt quite the same thing we arrived at a door marked stage d and went into a dim place the size of a cathedral filled with chaps sawing up bits of wood the studio seemed to be lined with old sacks was decorated only with notices telling people not to smoke or drop hammers on each others head neither of which anyone was paying any attention to the floor was covered with an undergrowth of cables and copses of arclamps there were chaps running about girders in the roof like hornblowers sailors in the rigging and there were other chaps pushing trolleys from one end to the other and back again with shouts of mindcherbacspliz on the whole i was rather disappointed it reminded me of the st swithins operating theatrethe object of attention was illuminated with bright lights it all seemed highly disorganized to the onlooker there was nowhere to sit and rest your feet and everyone not working was drinking cups of tea in the far corner was a typical nightclub except that it had no roof and all the guests in evening dress were reading the morning paper or knitting in the middle stood petunia talking to quintin finn and pretty smashing she looked too with her red hair glittering in the lights hosegood was meanwhile complaining he wanted to sit down and noticing a canvas chair next to the camera with melody madder stencilled on the back i eased him into it right children said adam stringfellow who seemed to be a sort of referee were going now quiet please quiet yelled the two assistant directors more young chaps with long hair who acted as linesmen someone in the background went on hammering sounding like a machine gun at a funeral quiet yelled all three directors ready melody asked stringfellow take one action just at that moment i sneezed quiet terribly sorry i apologized purely reflex action quiet speck of dust im afraid quiet rather dusty places these studios for gods sake shouted stringfellow cant you control yourself at your age well go again stand by everyone take two action hosegood hiccupped would you have the kindness to hiccup just a little more softly mr hosegood asked stringfellow i fear it may inconvenience us by getting on the soundtrack once again take three action but quintin finn had some dandruff on his collar and a chap with a whisk came to brush it off take four continued stringfellow now looking like thomas carlyle in the middle of one of his famous attacks of the sulks this is only costing us a hundred and fifty quid a minute all right melody action one second said petunias mum oh god said stringfellow my daughters hairs not right at the back i began to feel sorry for the stringfellow chap even though he didnt understand the elements of nasal physiology makeup please fix miss madders hair at the back they got ready to start again and i was feeling pretty excited at seeing a real film being shot when there was a shout from the back of tea break and everyone knocked off for a cup and a bun i didnt have the chance for a word with melody because she was kept talking in a corner by adam stringfellow and anyway my attention was divided between hosegood whod gone green and quintin finn who was asking my opinion of all his pictures do go and see my next one dear said quintin im a commando major and its ever so exciting there goes the shooting bell again i do so hope this wont make us late this evening my chauffeur roland gets ever so cross if i keep him waiting the naughty thing with the permission of mrs madder and the man with the chronic hayfever stringfellow announced as the bell stopped we will now go again quiet everyone for gods sake at your marks melody right take five action that time they started but melody got her lines mixed up again said stringfellow with the expression of sir lancelot spratt when the gastroscope bulb went out no wonder people watch television take six action poor melody possibly rattled by the sight of hosegood undoing his waistcoat made a mess of it again in heavens name miss madder youve only to say thank you for a wonderful evening do try and concentrate darling please dont you talk to my daughter in that tone said mum if you interrupt any more mrs madder i shall ask you to leave the set she got up you will will you and where would any of you be without my daughter id like to know im sorry mrs madder deeply sorry but i am suffering from bad nerves and an inadequate budget and i cannot stand any more nonsense from you or anyone there was a howl beside me as hosegood staggered to his feet gripping his epigastrium damn it he gasped its all the fault of that bloody ginger tart what did you call my daughter you swine mum shouted marry her over my dead body and she hit him on the head with a convenient carpenters hammer what am i supposed to do at this performance anyway asked petunia nothing except read sir lancelots little speech ive subedited it a bit by the way i didnt think there was much point in your quoting in latin wont i have to talk to a lot of doctors only my cousin miles and hes been incapable of speech for days the posh job hes after at st swithins is decided next thursday week petunia lit a cigarette one thing im not half so scared of doctors and hospitals as i used to be not after visiting poor dear jimmy after his accident how is the patient by the way oh fine the doctors have let him out for convalescence hes gone to morecambe it was the middle of september and autumn had come to london with the newsvendors placards changing from close of play to classified results and the first fierce winds starting to tear the summer dresses off the trees id just picked up petunia at her chelsea flat and was driving her across to sir lancelots meeting in st swithins ill nip in and collect his lordship and his lolly i said drawing up in belgrave square once youve said your little piece hes only got to hand sir lancelot his ten thousand quid then we can all go off and have a drink its as simple as that i found lord nutbeam sitting by the fire sealing the envelope hello i greeted him and how are we feeling this morning id become a little worried about my patient in the past few weeks hed been oddly subdued and gloomy and inclined to sit staring out of the window like in his worst long wotton days but i supposed this was reasonable in a chap whod just finished a couple of months trying out all the nightclubs in london i am still a little low thank you doctor a little low indeed i fear im hardly up to the strain of presenting my modest donation in person i nodded i certainly wouldnt recommend a stuffy meeting if you dont feel equal to it though everyone will be frightfully disappointed of course besides i have a visitor calling at noon and i shouldnt like to keep him waiting ill give it to the lord mayor to hand over then i suggested the lord mayor id prefer it if youd just quickly present it yourself doctor me but dash it im not nearly important enough oh come my dear doctor i assure you that you are in my eyes at any rate i shall stay here i think and read a book or perhaps i shall play a few pieces on the piano right ho i agreed anxious to be off ill tell you all the nice things they say in the vote of thanks the meeting itself like any other of sir lancelots special performances inside or out of his operating theatre was organized on a grand scale the old founders hall at st swithins could look pretty impressive with all those portraits of dead surgeons glaring down at you from the walls not to mention the scarlet robes and bunches of flowers and chaps popping about taking photographs and the television cameras id been a bit worried how the consultants at st swithins would react to petunia as she appeared in a dress cut down to her xiphisternum but they seemed delighted to meet her and all bowed over her politely as they shook hands sir lancelot himself greeted us very civilly ushering us to a couple of gilt chairs in the middle of the dais where hed arranged the lord mayor and some of the most expensive bloodpressures in the city i am indeed sorry to hear lord nutbeam is indisposed he remarked but i need hardly say your appearance here today miss madder will attract considerable interest to our cause may i introduce one of my junior colleagues mr miles grimsdyke he is taking the chair sir lancelot banged on the table your grace my lord marquis my lords my lord mayor ladies and gentlemen he began may i invite silence for our chairman my cousin made an efficient little speech and if he did dwell rather on the dear old hospital and his unswerving affection and loyalty towards it i suppose a chap has to advertise then the flashbulbs went off like brocks benefit night as petunia got to her feet she made an efficient little speech too though i dont think anyone was paying much attention to what she said next it was my cue in the regrettable absence of lord nutbeam i announced i have great pleasure as his friend as well as his doctor in presenting this cheque for ten thousand pounds to start so worthy a fund there was applause i wondered for a second whether to give them the story of the bishop and the parrot as well but decided against it this is a very proud moment for me declared sir lancelot taking the envelope as many of you know it is well over forty years since i first came to this hospital as a student in that not so distant age appendicitis was still a desperate operation tuberculosis was indeed the scourge of our civilization and pneumonia as often as not a death warrant it was also an age when any political gentleman trying to interfere with the affairs of our great hospital would get his fingers burnt very smartly indeed with the passing years these walls which st swithins men grow to venerate so deeply have remained much as for the previous two centuries but inside them has occurred a revolution in therapy as great as during those exciting times when lister was introducing asepsis pasteur founding the science of bacteriology and john snow first alleviating the ordeal of the patient and the frustration of the surgeon with ether anaesthesia much of course remains to be done many of our old hospital buildings for example cry for demolition to ease our lives with a little space to park our cars but surgical research is the cause nearest the heart of many assembled in this hall today it is certainly nearest to my own i am sure we all have in mind the words of the immortal martialnon est vivere sed valere vita estas i gratefully accept this giftthis most generous giftfrom lord nutbeam to relieve our cares in that direction everybody clapped again i must say i felt pretty pleased with myself as it hardly seemed yesterday since sir lancelot was kicking me out of the theatre for stamping on his left foot instead of the diathermy pedal under the operating table particularly as he went on i feel i must express in public my appreciationthe whole hospitals appreciationof these young men dr gaston grimsdyke and his cousin mr miles grimsdyke it is through their agency that we are honoured this afternoon with the presence of such a charming and distinguished lady of the stage as miss melody madder there was further applause this time more enthusiastic indeed continued sir lancelot tearing open the envelope it is to these gentlemen that we are indebted for the suggestion of lord nutbeams most munificent he went pink all over i glanced at him anxiously i wondered if the poor chap was going to have some sort of fit grimsdyker he hissed what the devils the meaning of this meaning of what sir look at that you fool feeling a bit embarrassed what with everyone watching and the television cameras i took the cheque seems all right to me sir i said shifting rather from foot to foot payable to you and signed nutbeam i hope you are not suggesting it cant be met i added a bit dignified i do not doubt that for one moment considering that it is made out for one pound four and eightpence good lord sir so it is butbutdash it i mean to say there must be some mistake get out of this hall this instant you rogue you vagabond you unspeakable idiot never let me look again upon your unbearable im sure theres some explanation i was aware that an odd sort of silence had fallen on everybody get out roared sir lancelot oh yes sir rightho sir i left the meeting in some confusion i think it was the lord mayor who had enough presence of mind to jump up and start singing god save the queen twenty minutes later i was throwing open lord nutbeams front door and bumped into the severe bird in striped trousers id last seen emerging from nutbeam hall but i didnt intend to pass the time of day with him and burst into the drawingroom where i was a bit startled to find lady nutbeam next to his lordship on the sofa wearing her old nurses uniform look here i began at once if this is another of your stupid jokes my dear doctor what on earths the matter you look quite beside yourself i jolly well am beside myself i chucked the cheque at him youve made an absolute booby of myself sir lancelot and the entire staff of st swithins not to mention all sorts of city nobs i go along to this jamboree thinking id got the ten thousand quid youd promised but my dear doctor i feel i never promised any such sum at all but damn it you did i told you ten thousand was wanted to start this blasted fund and you agreed on the nod dont tell me youve simply forgotten or perhaps youve just omitted to add the noughts i added a bit hopefully i indeed remember perfectly well your mentioning the sum lord nutbeam continued calmly but i fear i never said i would present sir lancelot with it all but hell why on earth one pound four shillings and eightpence because my dear doctor replied lord nutbeam simply it is all i have left there was a silence oh i said i see we wondered why everyone was making such a fuss over the presentation added lady nutbeam though i assure you doctor it gives me great pleasure to present my all to such a deserving cause as surgical research he took his wifes hand i fear i have been overspending rather of late but ethel and i have had a lovely summer havent we my dear and now im going out to get a job and we can start all over again said lady nutbeam the men will be coming for the cars and the furniture this afternoon fortunately i still have a cottage near nutbeam hall and with my books and my piano no doubt we shall be just as happy though i fear doctor i can no longer offer you employment in my household as much as i should like to there didnt seem anything to say goodbye my dear doctor and my warmest thanks i put my hand in my pocket ii dont use this very much i said id rather like you to have it it might be able to help you out a little i gave him back his gold cigarette case miles was already in his flat when i arrived oh gaston said connie opening the door he didnt look up as i entered youd better emigrate he remarked quietly yes id better i said it had been raining heavily all day it had been raining heavily all the day before in fact it had been raining heavily as long as i could remember and i was beginning to get the feeling of living under water i looked through the window of the clinic which was constructed largely of old petrol tins there was the river amazon very muddy and full of crocodiles beyond were some trees behind were some trees and all round were more trees it struck me what a damn silly song it was they used to sing about the beastly things i wondered whenever id see london again id had a pretty miserable week while miles fixed me up with the oil company mooching round saying goodbye to things id hardly thought twice about before such as nelsons column and the swans on the serpentine id already forgotten how long id been in brazil the only newspapers coming with the weekly launch but i supposed it was only a couple of months that meant another four years or so before i would ever again taste a mouthful of good old london fog i wondered if miles had got his job i wondered if sir lancelot had got his cash i wondered who had won the november handicap i wondered if i were going steadily potty and would see my old chums again only between a couple of those chaps in neat blue suits you sometimes saw lurking round st swithins my reflections were interrupted by a cry behind me of hello grimalkin old thing howd you like another little game of rummy i turned to face dr janet pebbley my professional colleague i suppose so there doesnt seem anything else much to do for the next five years gosh youre funny but i always say theres nothing like a game of cards for passing the time when my friend hilda and i were doing our midder at the femina i always said to her hilda i said lets have another little game of rummy and i bet theyll be popping like corks again all over the place before weve even had time to notice it janet pebbley and i had arrived together to share the job of looking after the locals bad feet and yellow fever inoculations and she was the only englishwoman i had to talk to in fact she was the only person in the whole of brazil i had to talk to except myself and id tried that a few times already personally im generally in favour of female doctors who these days all wear nice hairdos and nice nylons but janet was one of the standard type whose psychological development became arrested somewhere about the hockey stage she was a tall pinkfaced girl qualified a few years before from the london femina who looked as if she could rearrange stonehenge singlehanded the trouble was i was falling in love with her i suppose that psychiatrist in wimpole street would have explained it as a conflict between my id and my superego but as far as i was concerned i knew it was a damn silly thing to do but seeing janet every day i somehow had no alternative its like when they stick a pair of rats in a cage in the physiology laboratory when she emerged from her tiny bungalow for breakfast every morning with a hearty cry of hello there grimalkin hows the old liver today i knew perfectly well i should lock myself in and tell her to call me in five years time but i didnt i sat at the table eyeing her like a hungry cat in a cheesemongers what are you going to do grimalkin she asked when wed finished our meal of pork and beans that evening when your contracts up and you go home i mean i looked past the oillamp through the clinic window where insects nobody had ever heard of before were jostling in the darkness it was still raining of course i dont think i can see quite as far ahead as that i can this five years will pass in a flash an absolute flash as i said to my friend hilda the very day we were starting together at the femina time always does flash by if you will it to you know what im going to do no ill have a bit of money saved up then well both have wont we nothing to spend it on here except fags first im going to have a jolly good tramp all over scotland then im going to settle down in practice somewhere in the midlands my friend hildas up there and strictly between entre nous she could fix an opening she made a little squiggle with her finger on the tablecloth two openings if she wanted to i realized id taken her other hand janet yes youre jolly nice you know go on with you grimalkin but you are honestly the nicest girl i can remember janet i but luckily the old superego fell like a triphammer yes grimalkin nothing i said youre not looking very bright tonight the heat you know the rain bit worked up howd you like a nice game of rummy it will help you to unwind i suppose so i said though i felt the spring had bust long ago the next night i kissed her grimalkin she shrieked you shouldnt but janet ii love you there was silence except for the rain on the roof i do really and truly cross my heart youre the only girl in my life oh grimalkin i knew it as soon as i set eyes on you at london airport i could tell youd taken to me i dont know what it was perhaps it was the sad sort of look you had i knew youd want someone like me to cheer you up being cheered up by janet pebbley was like having your back scratched with a horserake and perhaps the memory of it brought down the superego again havent you anything else to say she asked but i shook my head and we had another game of rummy the next day she left in the launch for a week at the companys headquarters in manaus as id read all the books and damp had got into the gramophone and you cant play rummy by yourself i spent the evenings contemplating life somewhere like porterhampton with janet there would be her friend hilda of course and that tramp round scotland but i was so ruddy lonely looking at the rain i started counting the days till shed come back as carefully as the months till wed both be released after all she wasnt a bad sort of girl a bit jolly at breakfast admittedly but i could get used to that her friend hilda might be quite witty and delightful come to think of it id always wanted to have a good look at scotland the british consul in manaus could marry us and that would leave a whole bungalow free for playing rummy in i started to prepare little speeches and wonder if it would possibly be a fine day for the wedding janet came back to the camp with more pork and beans and a couple of new packs of playing cards i waited until we finished our evening meal and when the brazilian cook chap had cleared away the dishes said janet yes grimalkin i have something i want to ask you really grimalkin the superego quivered on its bearings the mechanism had rusted like everything else in the ruddy climate janet weve got on pretty well these last few weeks or months or whatever theyve been havent we like houses on fire grimalkin i mean weve managed to hit it off pretty well together youve certainly kept me entertained with all your jokes especially that one about the bishop and the what i mean is i thought in the light of experience and under the circumstances that is you wouldnt mind if i asked you go on grimalkin there was a shocking crash indicating somebody knocking on the corrugated iron door just one moment i unlatched the door outside was mr carboy in a homburg and holding an umbrella at last he cried i am in the presence of the master allow me to shake you by the hand he did scattering drops of water all over the place butbut what on earth are you doing in brazil i stared at him i thought you were busy correcting proofs in bloomsbury my dear fellow luckily i was halfway here on holiday in nassau when the news came news what news but havent you heard about your book of course tremendous success my dear chap weve reprinted it six times already and burnt out two rotary machines magnificent noticeslook ive got some of them here union jack have been cabling me every day for the film rights i might tell you that melody madder herself is absolutely desperate for the part of the girl why youve got the whole country laughing its head off with your portrait of that pompous and pigheaded little surgeon this was all very confusing butbutdash it when you gave me that contract thing to sign in london you said the book trade was in such a state nobody read any new novels any more ah well youre a doctor you know its sometimes better to say the patients going to die and collect the credit eh ha ha talking of contracts a fellow from potter and webley hasnt been prowling round has he nasty little man with a moustache and a dirty briefcase good well perhaps youd like to sign this here and now for your next six books substantially increased royalties of course how dyou do madam he noticed janet so sorry to disturb your evening but we wont be long as we cant keep the launch waiting launch waiting i felt a touch of the vertigo we did you say but ive got a job here for the next five years at any rate my dear fellow i soon fixed that with the oil people your replacements arriving tomorrow why youve got receptions television personal appearances and no end of work to face better hurry up the plane leaves at midnight another few hours and youll be facing the photographers in london i wondered whether this was all hallucinations due to the collapse of my psychological mechanisms well i said i suppose id better pack grimalkin ah yes id forgotten janet what was it youyou were going to ask me i was just going to ask if youd care for another game of rummy i said ten minutes later i was in the launch i noticed that the rain had stopped the literary lunch at porterhampton was a great success id spent the morning autographing copies of the novel in the local bookshop and even if most people did come up and ask if i sold postcards it had been fun signing something different from prescriptions for cough mixture the old wattles were all over me and ma wattle even made a speech we look upon gaston grimsdyke as one of porterhamptons own sons she asserted it will be a great consolation to dr wattle and myself now that we have reached the later years of our lives to remember that he once lived beneath our humble roof but i must not keep you from our honoured guest whom i am sure will treat us to that delightful wit which we in porterhampton are already privileged to know so well meanwhile it is my great pleasure to present him on behalf of his former patients with this splendid chiming clock after that i told them the story of the parrot which everyone now seemed to think funnier than ever though i was a bit put off halfway through noticing little avril atkinson eyeing me from the end of the table sorry i was so cross that foggy night she smiled catching me as i dashed for my train it was only the mumps you know doesnt it make you feel wretched all healed i trust everything is healed now gaston but theres just one little favour id like to ask you could you possibly get me melody madders autograph i suppose these days you actually know her dont you i reached london in time to decide comfortably which west end restaurant to try for dinner and felt it would be rather pleasant to drop into my club for a whisky and soda the first person i met in the morningroom was old miles my dear chap i said offering him a cigar hows the new job going at swithins congratulations thats jolly kind of you but i believe you very kindly gave me them shortly after the book came out not that i mean on becoming a member of this club he seemed to have some difficulty in talking what with grinding his teeth oh that thanks actually old carboy put me up he says an author needs a bit of standing care for a drink no no thank you i must get off to a meeting at st swithins he turned to go gaston yes miles i admit im finally on the consultant staff at st swithins i admit ive struggled and schemed all my life to get there i admit it is my major ambition achieved even before my middle age but damnation when i think of all the work the years the worryandandyou just scribbling away on bits of paper the poor chap seemed about to burst into tears which im sure would never have done in the parthenon here steady on old lad all right ill steady on i wont say any more except one thing do you happen to know gaston that you have made me the laughingstock not only of st swithins but of the entire medical profession do you i am aware of it i am aware of it perfectly well people dont come out with it of course oh no not now im a consultant but the studentsonly the other day i heard one shout three cheers for clifford standforth as i walked in to lecture everyone knows as well as i do that you made the character a ghastly caricature of myself your own cousin too if i may refer you to that little bit inside the flyleaf all characters are entirely imaginary and any resemblance bah said miles and walked out give my love to connie i called after him i ordered my drink and wondered if i could nip down to cartiers before they shut and buy a wedding present for petunia id been rather startled when shed told me at the studio the day before she was marrying jimmy hosegood after all it was mum i suppose she explained she wanted me to marry jimmy so i didnt then she didnt want me to so i did but im terribly in love with him darling even mums becoming reconciled now hes got a seat on my board i didnt say anything i supposed all women are a bit potty and actresses especially so besides petunia went on look at the difference in him now hes got back from morecambe hes even skinnier than quinny finn the odd thing was after hosegoods blow on the head he could eat as much as he liked without putting on an ounce a jolly interesting piece of clinical research i thought which id have written up for the british medical journal if they hadnt been after my address all these years over those arrears of subscription as for petunia she was just the same though i noticed shed turned into a blonde i lit another cigar and was making for the front door feeling pretty pleased with myself when i heard a roar behind me you boy i turned round you grimsdyke i want a word with you ah yes sir come here and shut the door after you i cant tolerate draughts no sir sit down there not like that boy you havent got a spinal curvature have you from leaning all your life on the counters of fourale bars no sir sorry sir now just you listen to me young feller me lad sir lancelot sat back and placed his fingers together i recall you once tried to make a fool of me as a student some nonsense about distributing invitations for my nonexistent birthday party i could easily forgive that knowing your pathetically infantile sense of humour but i cannot forgive your making a much bigger fool of me in front of a duke a marquis and a couple of earls not to mention a mixed bag of civil dignitaries and please chuck that cigar away if you havent the taste to choose something better my advice is to give up smoking yes sir terribly sorry sir but i did explain in my letter of apology how id sort of put the carte blanche before the horse an explanation is not an excuse fortunately for st swithins nobody quite understood what passed between us on the platform i suppose they were all too intent looking at the young woman you brought equally fortunately sir james mckerrow was singularly sympathetic when i confided the storynot to mention singularly amusedand donated an additional ten thousand pounds from the funds of his foundation none of this prevents my telling you grimsdyke that you are a young man of extremely limited intelligence mediocre ability flabby moral fibre and more bright ideas than are good for you the fact that you a grown adult let everyone push you about as they wish is a perfect disgrace particularly when its your own cousin you understand me yes sir exactly sir you agree with me i suppose i do sir you will kindly take pains to mend your ways in future please remember however much your name appears in the papers as far as i am concerned youre still the miserable little moronic worm i remember when you first stuck your beastly acneinfected face into my operating theatre yes sir good said sir lancelot suddenly very affable i thought id get that over to prevent yer getting a swelled head now lets have a drink and ill buy you a decent cigar it was midnight when sir lancelot and i left the club together can i give you a lift he asked though i suppose youve got a rolls of your own now im sticking to the old bentley thank you sir and what are you going to do now write another book for mr carboy i suppose no more medicine im afraid not sir its nothing to be ashamed of medical truants have played as much of a part in helping our world forward as a good many doctors and personally i find nothing so stimulating as the smell of burning boats but youll miss it i think perhaps i shall really sir however as you will remain on the medical councils register till death or striking off do you part you are perfectly at liberty to open an abscess or deliver a baby whenever the occasion arises and you happen to feel like it and you probably will medicine like murder will out unless i send my cases to miles at st swithins i smiled if you see him by the way say im sorry i made him sweat a bit over his appointment of course it was a foregone conclusion i just wanted to cut him down to size that grimsdyke is one of the most valuable operations in the whole repertoire of surgery good night my boy good night sir and you might also tell your cousin i knew perfectly well he didnt have a nervous breakdown at that examination but i dont really think a fellow ought to get bottled just before he comes up for his finals sir lancelot drove off leaving me with plenty of food for thought i realized more than ever what a really great chap he was but the most important thing about him was having such a jolly good sense of humour
