sophie littlefield aftertime the first book in the aftertime series for m with love and regret there you are and always will be in your pretty coat skating lazy eights on the frozen pond of my heart that it was summer was not in doubt the nights were much too short and the days too long something about the color of the sky said august to cass maybe the blue was bluer hadnt autumn signaled itself that way before a gradual intensifying of colors as summer trailed into september once cass would have been able to tell from the wildflowers growing in the foothills where she ran in august petals fell from the wild orange poppies the stonecrop darkened to purplish brown and butterweed puffs drifted in lazy breezes deer grew bold drinking from the creek that ran along the road the earth dried and cracked and lizards and beetles stared out from their hiding places among the weeds but that was two lives ago so far back that it was like a story that had once been told to cass a story maybe whispered by a lover as she drifted off to sleep after one too many jack and cokes ephemeral and hazy at the edges she might not believe it at all except for ruthie ruthie had loved the way butterweed silk floated in the air when she blew on the puffs ruthie who she couldnt see or touch or hold in her arms ruthie who screamed when the social workers dragged her away her legs kicking desperately at nothing mim and byrn wouldnt even look at cass as she collapsed to the dirty floor of the trailer and wished she was dead ruthie had been two cass pushed herself to go faster her strides long and sure up over a gentle rise in the road she was barely out of breath this was nothing less than nothing she dug her hard sharp nails into the calluses of her thumbs hard harder hardest the skin there was built up against her abuse and refused to bleed to break it she would need something sharper than her nail teeth might work but cass would not use her teeth it was enough to use her nails until the pain found an opening into her mind the pain was enough she had covered a lot of ground this moonbright night now it was almost dawn the light from the rising sun creeping up over the blackblue forest skeletons a crescent aura of orange glow in the sky when the first slice of sun was visible shed leave the road and melt into what was left of the trees there was cover to be foundsome of the native shrubs had survived greasewood and creosote still grew neck high in some places and it was easy to spot them you saw them before they saw you and then you hid and you prayed if they saw you at all if they came close enough to smell you you were worse than dead cass stayed to the edge of the cracked pavement of what had been highway weaving around the occasional abandoned car forcing herself not to look inside you never knew what you would see often nothing butit was just better not to look chunks of the asphalt had been pushed aside by squat kaysev plants that had managed to root in the cracks past the shoulder great drifts of it grew the dark glossy leaves hiding clusters of pods the plants were smoothstemmed without burrs or thorns walking among them was not difficult but walking on pavement allowed cass now and thenand never when she was tryingto let her mind go back to another timeand when she was really lucky to pretend all the way back two lifetimes ago taking ruthie barely walking down the sidewalk to the eleven buying her a blue raspberry slurpee because ruthie loved to stick out her blue tongue and look at herself in the mirror cutting across the school parking lot on the way home jumping over the yellow lines lifting ruthies slight body and swinging her laughing through the air yes pavement was nice cass had good shoes though she didnt remember where she got them they seemed like they might have been mens shoes plain brown laceup walking shoes but they fit her feet a small man then how shed got the shoes from himit didnt bear thinking about the shoes were good they were comfortable and hadnt given her blisters or sores despite the many days of walking a movement caught her eye off in the spiky remains of the woods cass stopped abruptly and scanned the tree skeletons and shrubs a flash of white was it or was it only the way the light was rising in the sky reflected offwhat though there were only the bare trunks of the dead cypress and pine trees a stand of dead manzanita the low thick growth of kaysev a few of the boulder formations that dotted the sierra foothills snap cass whipped her head around and saw the flash again a fastmoving blur of fabric and oh god it was white a slip of a little darkhaired girl in a dirty white shirt who was sprinting toward her at a speed that cass could not imagine anyone moving cass who had run thousands of desperate blacktop miles one life ago trying to erase everything running until her legs ached and her lungs felt like tearing paper and her mind was almost but never quite empty but even cass had never run like this girl she was twelve or thirteen maybe even fourteen it was hard to tell now before the fourteenyearolds looked like twentyyearolds with their pushup bras and eyeliner but hardly anyone dressed like that anymore the girl held the blade the way they taught the kids now firmly in front of her where it would have the best chance of slicing through a beaters flesh because thats what she thought cass was a beater and the thought hit cass in the gut and nearly knocked her over with revulsion her hands went to her hairline where the hair was just growing back in soft tufts an inch at most she knew how her arms looked covered with scabs almost worse now that they were healing the patches of flesh falling away as the healthy skin pushed to the surface but that was nothing compared to the ruin of her back she hadnt been able to clean herself in days and she knew she carried the smell the long hair on the back of her head the hair she hadnt pulled out was knotted and tangled her nails were blackened and broken real beaters usually had no nails left but how could the girl be expected to notice a detail like that in the second or two it took the girl to cross the last dozen yards of scrubby land cass considered standing firm wrists out chin up giving her an easy target they were taught well any child over the age of five could find the jugular the femoral the carotid the ulnar they practiced on dummies rigged from dolls and clothes stuffed with straw sometimes they practiced on the dead at the last minute cass stepped out of the way she didnt know why it would have been easier so much easier to welcome the blade to let it find its path to her vital core and feel the blessed release of her blood still hot and red despite everything bubbling over the slice in her flesh falling to the hardened earth maybe her blood would help the land heal faster maybe on the spot where her blood fell one of the plants from before would return a delicate mountain bluebell they had been her favorite the tiny blossoms shading from pale sky blue to deep lilac but cass stepped out of the way damn her soul three times now it had refused to die when death would have been so much easier cass watched almost impassively as her foot shot forward nimbly her stance steady and her balance near perfect the girls eyes went wide she tripped and in the last moment when the blade flew from her hand and she lurched toward cass the terror in her eyes was enough to break casss heart if only she still had one to break everyone remembered the first time they saw a beater usually it was more than one because even in the early days they gathered in packs three or four or more of them prowling the edges of town cass saw hers in the qikgo cass worked in the qikgo until the end where else would she go she couldnt leave silva not without ruthie but as the world fell apartas famine crippled africa and south asia as one g capital after another fell to panic and riots in the wake of random airbursts as china went dark and australia mined its shoresmim and byrn held on all the tighter to their granddaughter cass had no detailed plan only to wait until there were no more police no sheriffs no social workers no one willing to come when mim and byrn called them to block cass from seeing her daughter or even setting foot on their property when that day came she would go to their house and she would take ruthie back by force if she had to it would hurt to see the anger and contempt on her mothers face but no more than it had hurt her that mim refused to acknowledge how far cass had come how hard she had worked to be worthy of ruthie the ninetydays chip she kept on her key chain the twoyear medallion shed earned before her single relapse the job shed held through it allmaybe managing a convenience store wasnt the most impressive career in the world but at least she was helping people in small ways every day rather than fleecing them out of their money the way byrn did with his questionable investment strategies but she and her mother saw things through very different lenses it would not hurt cass to see her stepfather who was finally weaker than she was his exlinebacker frame now old and frail compared to her own body which she had made lean and hard with her relentless running she anticipated the look of powerlessness on byrns face as she took away the only thing he could hurt her with she looked forward even more to the moment when he knew he had lost she would never forgive him but maybe once she got ruthie back she could start forgetting that time was almost upon them cell phone service had started to go in the last few days and the landlines hadnt worked for a week televisions had been broadcasting static since the governments last official communication deputizing power and water workers that had been such a spectacular failure skirmishes breaking out in the few remaining places there had been peace before that the rumor was the government had shut down all the media on purpose some said it was the russian hackers now they said the power was out over in angels camp and every gas station in town had been looted except for bills shell where bill and his two sonsinlaw were taking shifts with a brace of hunting rifles who was going to care about the fate of one little girl now two days earlier cass had stopped taking money from customers unless it was offered some people seemed to find comfort in clinging to routines from what was quickly becoming beforeand if people reached for their wallets then cass made change people took strange things there were those who had come early on for the toilet paper and aspirin and bottled waterand all the alcohol to casss relief now people wandered the aisles aimlessly and took random items that would do them no good anymore a prepaid calling card a map meddlin her boss hadnt made an appearance for a few days the qikgo cass figured was all hers no matter she didnt care about meddlin the others the fragile web of workers who staffed the other shifts had been gone since the media went silent on a brisk march morning a day after the lights started to flicker and fail cass was talking to teddy a pale boy from the community college who lived in the apartments down the block with a handful of roommates who didnt seem to like him very much cass made coffee wondering if it would be the last time and wiped down the counter there hadnt been a dairy delivery in weeks so she set out a can of the powdered stuff when the door jangled they both turned and looked feverish teddy said quietly cass nodded the ones whod been eating the blueleafthe ones whod livedwere unmistakable the fever made their skin glow with a thin sheen of perspiration their movements were clumsy but most remarkable were their eyes the pupils contracted to tiny black dots in darkeyed people the effect was merely unsettling in paleeyed people it was both captivating and frightening if everything hadnt fallen apart there would have undoubtedly been teams of doctors and scientists gathering the sick and studying and caring for and curing them as it was all but those closest to the sick were just happy they kept to themselves glass over over one of them said a man whose plaid shirt was buttoned wrong so that one side hung farther down than the other speaking to no one in particular a second a woman with lank brown hair that lay around her shoulders in uncombed masses walked to a rack that held only a few bags of chips and pushed it with a stiff outstretched hand and as it fell to the floor she smiled and laughed not bothering to jump out of the way of the bags which popped and sprayed dry crumbs gehhhh she crowed and cass noticed something else strange about her something she hadnt seen before the womans arms were raw and red blood dried in patches the skin chafed and missing in spots it almost looked like a metal grater had been run up and down her arms her shoulders the tops of her hands cass checked the others their flesh was also covered in scabs cold alarm traveled up casss spine something was wrongvery wrong something even worse than the fever and the unfocused eyes and the incoherent speech she thought she recognized one of the group a short muscular man of about forty whose complicated facial hair was growing out into a sloppy beard he used to come in for cigarettes every couple of days he was wearing filthy tan cargo shorts and the skin above his knees was covered with the same sort of cuts and scrapes as his forearms hey she said to him he was standing in front of a shelf that held the few personal products left in the storebottles of shampoo and mouthwash boxes of bandaids would you like her voice trailed off as he turned and stared at her with wide unblinking blue eyes dome going he said softly then raised his wounded forearm to his face and eyes still fixed on her licked his lips and took a delicate nip at his red glistening skin his teeth closed on the damaged flesh and pulled the raw layers of dermis pulling away from his arm stretching and then splitting a shred of flesh about the size of a match tearing away leaving a bright tiny spot of blood that glistened and pooled into a larger drop for a moment he stared at her the strip quivering between his teeth and then his tongue poked out and he drew the ruined skin into his mouth and he chewed holy fuck dude teddy exclaimed stepping back so fast that his foot thudded against the front of the counter casss stomach turned with revulsionthe man had chewed off his own skin and eaten it is that what had happened to his entire arm were the scabs and open wounds his own doing fuck dude the man mumbled as he burrowed his teeth along the ruined flesh of his arm his tongue probing and searching looking for undamaged skin cass realized horrified the pattern of the woundscovering the forearm and upper arm fading at the elbowit was exactly consistent with what he could reach with his own mouth and as if to confirm her suspicion the man twisted his forearm in his mouth seeking out any bit of flesh that was left undisturbed finally trailing up to his hand and taking a deep bite from his scabby palm so that blood trickled between his lips and ran down his chin out cass managed to say get out she ran to the thin woman the one who had toppled the chip stand and pushed the woman staggered backward regarding cass with faint interest cass she mumbled as she found her footing cass castle hassle cass stared at her then she made the connection this was the girl who worked at the bank on days when cass took the cash down to deposit only cass hadnt seen her in a few weeks since the banks closed their windows shattered by looters who thought cash might somehow help cash they found they couldnt get because it was sealed in vaults no one could open the young woman used to wear her hair differently she curled it every morning and she favored bright eye shadow green that shaded to black around her carefully rimmed lashes shed worn lowcut tops and dresses in colorful patterns a far cry from what she wore now a red knit tshirt several sizes too big that was only partway tucked into her jeans do you know me cass demanded but the girls eyes flickered and shifted and she murmured something that sounded like yam yam before shuffling over to where the others stood somethings fucked up with them teddy said do you hear that theyre all likedelirious cass nodded we have to get them out teddy slipped past the little group and held the door open wide we were just getting ready to close he stammered and despite her unease cass noticed the we and was glad maybe teddy would stay maybe he would keep her company and when there was nothing left in the store to give away maybe he would be there to help her figure out what to do next cass had been on her own for a long time now and she had told herself she didnt want anyone else even on the days when she felt most alone when the craving for a drink was almost unbearable but maybe now she did a friend how long since she had a friend buoyed by the thought she went up to the three feverish people she put her hands to the back of the girls shirt trying not to look at the raw and weeping flesh of her limbs and pushed the girl allowed herself to be guided to the door and the others followed when cass got them outside she ducked back in and shut the door twisting the heavy bolt into place the day had been warm but a low layer of clouds made a thin shadow over the sun the three people she had locked outside looked up at the sun without blinking cass wondered if they were slowly going blind the girl took a step toward the man with the misbuttoned shirt and for a moment cass thought she was kissing him pushing her face into the back of his neck he didnt flinch but he didnt turn to embrace her either thatshes teddy said in alarm and cass looked closer the woman shook her head and only then did cass realize shed sunk her teeth into the mans flesh and was tugging at it tearing at it trying to rip off a shred teddy turned away and vomited on the floor as a bright trail of blood snaked down to the mans collar and the woman began to chew the girl with the blade was named sammi but cass didnt find that out until later as dawn broke they left the road and traveled through the woods by the time they got to the school maybe a mile down the sun was high in the sky it was the clearest sky yet since cass had returned flawless blue and as they rounded a sharp bend topped by a rock outcropping and what must have once been a beautiful stand of cypress the school stood out in stark relief against the eyesearing blue it had been built in the last few years before the architect had gone in for broad stretches of stucco a roof molded to look like cedar vaguely prairiestyle window placement and overhanging eaves the sign still announced in iron letters against hewn stone copper creek middle school cass knew this school theyd built it halfway between silva and terryville she had driven past it a hundred times thinking about ruthie going there someday she was close to home the girl hadnt spoken a single word cass tapped the girls blade against her own thigh loosening her grip on the windbreaker shed taken off and looped through the girls sleeves as a kind of makeshift harness before remembering the dangers and grabbing it even tighter im sorry she mouthed but only because the girl couldnt see she led them across the parking lot with sure quick steps shoulders held high and cass couldnt help but admire her courage for all the girl knew cass would have followed through with her threat and sliced her ear to ear the blade was a good one a twoedged straight stiletto with a small guard the blade itself perhaps six inches long someone loved this girl someone had made sure she had a good weapon had cared if she lived another day she pulled the girl tight against her and bit out the words hating herself for saying themand knowing they were lies when someone comes out tell them ill kill you she murmured tell them that first the girl only nodded it made sense to choose a school of course the threats of before seemed minor now everyone worried that deranged people would come into schools and steal the children away harm them kill them or that one of the students would bring a gun to school and take out his classmates yes things like that had happened back then just often enough to keep everyone vigilant and the schools had been built with more and greater safety measures until in the end they were fortresses reinforced and sealed and locked down in some ways it wasnt so hard to stay safe even now a basic wall could keep beaters away a fence even one that was only ten feet tall like those that surrounded the schools courtyard as long as there were no citizens close by nothing to attract the beaters and drive them into a frenzy of fleshlust nearly any barrier at all would be enough to make them lose their focus and wander back to their fetid nestlike encampments they saidat least near the end of casss second lifethat the beaters were waning cass wasnt so sure it was true that they had formed larger and larger groups nomadic little bands that took over neighborhoods and entire towns so they werent appearing in sporadic places as much they seemed to have flashes of longing for before just as everyone else did you could see them sometimes doing homely little things it was like the bits of speech that sometimes bubbled from their lips phrases that meant nothing fragments that tumbled from whatever was left of their minds dislodged from memory that had given way to the fever and the disease cass had seen one trying to ride a bicycle and falling off when its jerky motions caused the wheel to spin and flip it tried again and again and then suddenly lost interest and wandered away another time she had seen one at a clothesline taking the pins off one by one and holding them in its ruined hand then reattaching them cass had known a woman who had been a social worker before her name was miranda they had not been friends exactly but they had sheltered together in the library before a halfdozen beaters came through a back door that had been left open one day and dragged her off miranda had once worked with violent offenders counseling them to look deep inside themselves to find the key to who they were before abuse and anger had changed them she had been extraordinarily successful the pride of the anza county correctional systems anger replacement therapy program miranda had believed that in those moments when the beaters appeared to be connecting to a memory miming some homely everyday task there was a chance to remind them of who they had once been that if you could reach them in that momentif you could reconnect the splintered shards of memorythat you could reverse the process of the disease that the afflicted would comprehend the horror of what they had become and choose to come back miranda had wanted to try it it wouldnt be so hard to capture just one she had argued at one of the town hall meetings bobby held every few days bobby was the de facto leader of the ragtag group of a few dozen people sheltering in the library miranda tried to recruit a few of the men one who used to be a deputy sheriff several hardmuscle types whod worked in construction and of course bobby they all listened to mirandas plan capture a beater bring it backrestrain it observe it wait until the right moment and then she trained in the ways of the desperate the outcast would speak to it bobby listened but he could not contain his incredulity you think youre what some kind of zombie whisperer because you got a few crack whores to give up their babies is that it miranda you think a beaters like some guy beats his wife on payday miranda had argued back passionately but when the beaters came for her that day breaking in that forgotten back door while the kitchen detail was cleaning up from a lunch of kaysev shoots and canned apple pie filling when miranda had taken some trash to the back hall by herself it wasnt reasoned argument that issued from her lips it was screaming as raw and desperate as the screams of any of the others who were taken screams that echoed in casss mind on nights when sleep wouldnt come the school though cass guessed that they had not lost anyone that way here in addition to the fences brick walls surrounded the entire courtyard the doors would be the type that shut automatically guards would be posted they undoubtedly did all their harvesting and raiding at night maybe they even had a few flashlights some batteries why had they let this girl out on her own it made no sense even though it should have still been safethe beaters rarely went hunting before the sun rose high in the skywhat adult what parent would allow a child to go out alone had she somehow gotten separated from others had some greater threat come along there was a sudden clang and the door to the school burst open and a woman ran out wailing her flipflops slapped against the pavement and she stumbled at the kaysevchoked median that once kept the carpooling moms in orderly lines a pair of men chased after her trying to restrain her but the woman shook them off sammi she screamed but cass pulled the girl tight against her and held the blade to the soft skin under her chin stop there cass yelled and then she added the one thing that might convince them to do as she said i am not a beater she watched them look at her watched the terror in the womans expression and the fury and determination in the mens slowly tinge with doubt she felt their gazes on her ragged skin her scalp where the hair was only now growing back she waited holding her breath until she saw that they knew until they saw that her pupils were like anyone elses black and pronounced i dont want to hurt this girl she called trying to keep her voice steady i dont want any trouble i am not a beater and i can she had been about to say that she could explain her appearance but that was a lie she couldnt explain and no one else could either i can prove it if you let me im not asking to come in i dont want anything from you except to be allowed to continue into town let the girl go one of the men said the woman sank down to her knees and extended her arms beseechingly please she keened please please please please please and something shifted inside cass a memory of ruthie being carried away screaming sent to live with casss mother and the man shed married the man whod made her life hell she remembered her own pleas how she had gone down on her knees just like the woman before her now how shed collapsed on the floor after the front door shut behind mim and byrn and the court people carrying her ruthie away how shed cried into the soursmelling carpet until she could barely breathe she released the girl then and watched her go to her mother jogging across the pavement but not before glancing back over her shoulder a defiant glance sparked with victory the girl felt shed won well cass certainly felt like shed lost so maybe that was fitting the mother gathered the girl up in her arms as though she wanted to meld her to herself and cass had to turn away the men must have thought she was trying to leave though because an instant later she was knocked to the ground and she felt the weight of them crushing her into the gravelpocked asphalt the rough pavement smelled like tar and scraped against her cheek the blade had fallen from her hand no matter these men were guards they would have their own and it would be a quick death better than she deserved she waited but after a moment the weight lifted and a strong hand grabbed hers pulling her up roughly inside he said and that was the first word she ever heard smoke say they had set up a kitchen of sorts in the schools courtyard and a small crew was cooking over a fire in a makeshift hearth ginger the scent of sautéed kaysev was in the air a group of children sat at a table taken from one of the classrooms eating and cass saw that theyd made the kaysev into a sort of pancake shed seen that before when people were figuring out different ways to prepare the plant after so many weeks of eating it raw the smell of the cakesmade with a flour ground from the dried beansprompted a powerful hunger she didnt know she was capable of anymore and there was another smell one that made her doubt her senses is that coffee her escort was a man of medium height hardmuscled with broad shoulders and powerful forearms sunstreaked brown hair fell into his chambrayblue eyes and he kept pushing it impatiently aside his mouth was on the generous side almost sensuous but his expression was hard once a week on sunday its strong but you only get one cup you know what day it is cass asked surprised who kept track anymore the man didnt answer but led her over to a door that stood open propped with a stack of books us history cass read on the spines books left out to the elementswho would abandon a book outside to be ruinedbut thoughts like that led straight to a spiral of despair whenever something reminded her of before it was a quick trip back and it hit her hard like now textbooks had been sacred once but books needed readers and all the teachers were dead from hunger or disease or riots or dragged off by the beaters or desperate like cass just to survive there was no one left to teach children like ruthie cass forced those thoughts from her mind as the man guided her into the hallway his hand at her waist gentler now earlier hed been rough as he searched her patting down the ragged and stinking canvas pants and athletic shirt that stuck to her the same clothes shed woken up in a couple of weeks earlier hed avoided touching her scabbed flesh and stopped short of searching the folds and crevices of her body for which she was grateful hed lingered at her hair combing his fingers through its greasy filthy length while he held the ends bunched in his fist the stubble at the front had caused him to frown but hed said nothing it had hurt like hell when his hands moved along her back and shed ground her teeth to avoid crying out in pain there whole sections of flesh had been ripped from her body and it was taking much longer to heal than the scabs on her arms an ordinary citizen would have succumbed to infection blood loss exposure but somehow in the days after the things tore into her back she had developed a freakishly powerful immune system and was healing how she had recovered from the disease she had no idea but thin layers of skin were slowly building from the scabbed edges smoke had not detected anything amiss in the ruined landscape of her back and for that cass was grateful she didnt want him to see cass blinked as her eyes adjusted from the bright morning sun to the gloom of the interior a single transom window lit the space the other windows were covered by miniblinds they were in what had been the schools administrative office the bulletin boards had been stripped bare except up at the top where a few ragged papers were still attached with pushpins artcarvedorder your class ring now one read another advertised cash for printer cartridges a woman came around the corner and stopped short staring at cass with shock processing her appearance we found her outside the man said quickly she brought sammi back the woman merely nodded but cass could see the relief written plain on her face a child had been missing the people sheltering here had been waiting knowing it was likely that their beautiful young girl would never return none of them were new to loss nowby most estimates threequarters of the population was dead victims of starvation and fever and suicide and beaters you learned to protect yourself but the cost of steeling yourself against grief was that you had to steel yourself against joy as well you might as well have some the woman said and only then did cass notice that she carried a glass carafe of steaming black coffee get her a cup smoke the man called smoke went into the hall leaving the woman to stare openly at cass she was a lean woman with poorly cut hair pieces of it jutting unevenly at her cheekbones but she was cleanremarkably so her skin looked healthy and her eyes were clear cass found herself wondering if she was the mans lover and her gaze went to the womans fine small hands the nails trimmed neatly her smooth pale legs under the plain denim shorts im nora the woman said cass cleared her throat until this morning she hadnt spoken in many days and she was out of practice im cassandra cass smoke returned carrying a large blue mug nora poured from the carafe and cass accepted the mug and held it near her lips not sipping the glazed porcelain almost too hot to bear her eyes fluttered closed as she inhaled as deeply as she could and when she opened them she saw that smoke was staring at her with an expression that was part curiosity and part calculation and no part fear she drank the taste brought back a sharp memory of the room in the basement where she attended a thousand aa meetings the first time she accepted a cup of coffee only because everyone else was drinking it shed never liked it much drank it only on the occasional morning when she needed a little extra lift to get going but at that meeting she drank two cups and on the way home she bought a tencup model at walmart along with two pounds of ground beans at work she made the first pot at am when her shift started and the lastdozens of pots laterwhen whoever was on afternoons arrived at two oclock this coffee was a little odd it was like the kind her mother used to make before her father left in an old tin percolator with green enamel flowers worn nearly away for a moment cass felt an intense ache for her motherfor who shed been before she met byrn before she started insisting that cass call her mim for the woman whod once read to her at bedtime whod let cass bury her face in the crook of her neck and breathe the soap and hair spray and perfume and sweat slowly not trusting her hand not to tremble cass lowered the mug to the table may i sit yes of course nora said she exchanged a look with smoke as he pulled out a chair for her and cass was certain that these two were lovers only troubled ones you could see it in the way his gaze slid warily away cass leaned over the mug and let the steam warm her face whats todays date she asked nora blew out a little breath before she answered august twentysixth its sunday august so it had been almost two months since the end of what shed come to think of as her second life she thought about that last day not the last moments which she wouldnt remember but what came before shed been sheltering in the library for a couple of months before she went to get ruthie determining that there was finally no one left to try to stop her the first morning she had her baby back they woke up together on the makeshift bed in casss corner of the library away from the others tucked in a narrow corridor behind the periodicals beneath a water fountain that hadnt flowed in a month cass kept her space clean her few possessions stacked and folded and arranged with care that day she woke to the sweet scent of ruthies hair her small body tucked perfectly into her embrace her head under casss chin she lay still breathing happiness in and hope out watching the sun cast strips of yellow light on the wall through the miniblinds a week earlier theyd lost miranda and casss mood had faltered but now that she had ruthie life seemed like a possibility once more you going to explain that nora said not unkindly pointing at casss arms cass folded them selfconsciously they hurt but not as much as they had when she first regained consciousness lying in an empty field then she had been horrified at the way she looked her wounds raw the crusty scabs black in some places leaking clear reddish fluid her back had been an agony of shredded flesh and it was still healing but the wounds on her arms were almost completely healed marking crisscross scars across her flesh on the road she mumbled things happen you know i felli ran into things no shit nora said go easy smoke murmured a warning in his voice look at her nora hissed her voice low and angry weve seen that before you know we have smoke shook his head it isnt the same only because you dont want to see it the same as what cass demanded smoke looked at the table wouldnt meet her eyes theres been a few kids not just kids nora interrupted mostly kids teenagers they cut themselves they pull out their hair why would anyone do that cass asked horrified to look like beaters nora said to look like you to mock the world or to come into settlements and everyone takes off screaming and then they help themselves to whatever they wantwater food drugs anything that is if they dont get themselves shot first you think i youre fucking insane cassd been trying to hold on to her patience but thisnoras implication that she had done this to herself on purposeit was too much so wheres all my stuff then if ive been terrorizing citizens and stealing from them where is it i dont have anything on me nothing i dont mean to just let her tell her story smoke glared at nora and after a long moment the woman gave a faint shrug cass took a breath let it out slowly considered how much she wanted to give away these people could help her or not they could let her go or not already she felt certain that they would there was no cruelty in them only caution and who could blame them for that the girl she hedged sammi why was she out alone why dont you tell us about you first nora said coldly and this time she refused to acknowledge smokes warning glance all right cass gathered her thoughts i lived in silva in tenaya estates you knowthe trailers smoke nodded i know the place i livedalone i worked at the qikgo off lone pine back in the spring during the siege i stayed on for a while i thoughti didnt want to give up i guess but you know when they started coming into town more she didnt add that people stopped showing up at the aa meetings until one day she was the only one in the room that day she knew she couldnt live alone anymore anyway i went over to the library to shelter she dug her fingernails into the callus of her thumb under the table where they couldnt see the next part was hard i was there the first time the beaters came when they took a friend of mine and the second time she couldnt bring herself to tell it not yet are there stillis anyone still over there yes last time anyone was there they were up to around fifty smoke hesitated and cass got the impression he wasnt telling the truthnot all of it anyway they got it reinforced they havent lost anyonenot inside anyway in a while we have eighty here theres a few dozen in the firehouse and you know you have your folks who are still trying to stay in their own places more than youd think really fewer every day nora muttered not our place to judge smoke said in a voice so low cass was sure it was meant only for nora do you talk to themthe people at the library she asked now that she was so close fear bloomed in her heart we did smoke said untilwell we had some trouble a couple of weeks ago since then weve stayed local seventeen days nora said with surprising bitterness smoke nodded acknowledging her point what happened you dont know the suspicion was back cass looked from one to the other mystified no i donti told you ive been on my own since i woke up and some people would just say that its awfully convenient that you cant remember anything nora said and that you just happen to show up after the rebuilders set up camp over there who are so now you want to accuse her of being a rebuilder smoke said really nora thats a little paranoid even for you nora scowled freewalkers dont threaten to kill children everyone would have thought she was a dont say it cass interrupted resisting the urge to clap her hands over her ears she couldnt bear to hear the word to hear the accusation again please look why dont i just leave now no one said anything about that smoke said tiredly youre safe here everyones just on edge its been hard shit no one needs to tell you that for a moment no one spoke cass could feel noras anger clogging the air still all i want to know is how shes managed not to be attacked she said addressing smoke alone walking alone as long as she says she hashow does that happen cass glared back ive been lucky i guess lucky nora repeated spitting out the word as though it was poison listen to me my daughter was there cass snapped in the library the second time we were attacked we were outside she wantedto be outside what ruthie had really wanted was to pick dandelions one of the few plants to survive the siege cass had taught her to hold the blooms under her chin so that the yellow reflected off her pale creamy skin oh look you must be made of butter she teased ruthie peppering her sweet face with kisses and then ruthie would laugh and laugh and tickle casss chin with bunches of dandelions wilting in her chubby little hands ruthie wanted to pick dandelions and they were hard to find at dusk so it was barely twilight when cass led her outside to the little patch of dead lawn in front of the library after she looked carefully in every direction but not carefully enough because the beaters were learning and they had learned to hide they hid behind a panel truck on two flat tires that had been abandoned half a block awayand they waited and then they moved faster than cass thought possible awkward loping strides accompanied by their gurgling breathless moans and cass grabbed for ruthie who was tracing the path of a caterpillar with a stick and thought it was a game and danced out of the way and darted into the last glorious rays of sun as it slipped down the horizon the challenge drained from noras face dont she begged smoke placed a workroughened hand over noras and didnt look at cass nora he said heavily she uhher nephew she was watching him i was supposed to be watching him nora said hollowly she pulled her hand away and stood knocking over her chair she backed out of the room brushing against the coffeepot on the counter it fell to the ground shattering and splashing hot coffee but she just turned and bolted down the hall shes smoke said watching her go then he turned back to cass im sorry no need to apologize cass said but the truth was that she did need it not the apologybut the way his voice softened when he spoke to her and the way his eyes narrowed with concern when he looked at her taking in what had happened to her poor body and not turning away that most of all she needed that the not turning away something did happen to me she found herself saying the words tumbling out as though a trapdoor had been opened inside her something bad telling was crazy telling could get her thrown out of here or worse but smoke looked at her as though he saw her saw the real her and she wanted to hold on to that wanted him to know the truth and still see her the kindness hed already shown her should have been enough settle for that she willed herself settle for good enough but cass could never leave well enough alone she didnt know how she wanted someoneone other human beingto know what had happened and not turn away your daughter smoke said softly was she taken no cass said but i was smoke helped her cut her hair he handed her the scissors a pair of office shears that were too bulky and too dull to do a good job even if she had a mirror even if she knew what she was doing hed said it would give her less to explain to the others cass knew he was right still when she made the first cut the sight of her filthy and matted hair falling to the floor caused her to suck in her breath her hair had been her best feature once long and thick and shiny dark blond burnished with gold curving inward where it lay across her collarbones she refused to cry as the hair fell away but when she had cut as far as she could reach and smoke closed his large hand gently over hers and took the scissors away she squeezed her eyes shut and mourned the loss of the last faint reminder of her beauty as he carefully trimmed the back afterward he gathered her hair with his hands and haphazardly piled it in a file box while cass got control of herself he carefully avoided looking her in the face and cass knew that she was hard to look at an ugly hardworn thing she demanded that he take her to the library that night and he agreed once cass made it clear that she was going with or without him he tried to talk her into waiting a few days when the full moon had waned the beaters had become bolder he warned her coming out on moonlit nights as well as mornings and early evenings gone were the days when they only ventured out in the middle of the day but cass didnt care shed been out every night since she woke up she wasnt going to stop now not when she was so close to ruthie smoke took her to the cafeteria which they had set up as a community room with toys and activities for the kids and chairs and sofas arranged for conversation makeshift shelves held kitchen implements and plates and cups blankets and clothing were folded and stacked there were rows of paperbacks vases of the few surviving wildflowers board games and puzzles were set out on tables and two separate card games were in full swing eight or nine kidstoddlers up to sixor sevenyearoldsplayed on carpet scraps arranged on the floor at one end of the cafeteria sammi was watching them along with a boy about her age smoke led cass into the large open space and the adults conversations died people set down their playing cards the baskets of clothes they had been folding the kaysev they had been separating and cleaning and preparing they regarded cass with open curiosity and in some cases suspicion and fear and hostility sammis mother was in a group of women who had been chatting as they washed and dried dishes there was a tub of soapy water another of clear no doubt creek water that had been boiled cass had seen the blackened fire pit in the courtyard the hearth built of rebar and steel beams and that fireproof plastic weave this is cass smoke said into the silence shes a citizen just like us shes not like us sammis mother said setting down her washrag her voice shook she tried to its okay mom sammi said she put down the bucket of toys shed been holding a pretend zoo was laid out on the floor and she and the boy had been helping the younger kids stack wooden blocks to make cages its not okay her mother hissed but she stayed where she was one of the other women laid a hand on her arm and said something that cass couldnt hear she only did what she had to sammi added glaring at her mother defiantly besides if you didnt keep me cooped up in here like i was in jail dont sammi the boy said quietly not now id rather take my chances out there sammi said pointing out the window at the street that ran alongside the building beyond the iron fence cass saw abandoned cars some with graffiti painted on the side several had crashed into each other by accident or on purpose crushed metal and broken glass surrounding doors that no one had bothered to close then she saw something else something that struck whitehot fear in her heart in the yard of a squat brick bungalow across the street a small clump of beaters shuffled around a kiddie pool theyd managed to drag from some where one was trying to sit in it two others were trying to turn it over another stood close to the house staring into a large picture window and absently tugging at its ears she wasnt the only one to spot them a few sharp gasps a collective wave of fear that ran through the room theyve started gathering here in the afternoon waiting smoke sighed running his hands through his hair for a moment he looked a decade older than the thirtyfive cass had taken him for sometimes a dozen of them they wander off when the sun starts to get low for now anyway the beaters had everyones attention the argument between sammi and her mother was forgotten cass took the opportunity to slip out of the room smoke following her without a word she could not stay there watching the beaters enduring the scrutiny of all those people she would wait in the office alone until evening after all shed become accustomed to her own company cass added it up in her head a hundred seventyfive maybe two hundred people left between the library and the school and firehouse silvas population had been over four thousand before the famine and the riots and the suicides and the fever deaths before the beaters began carrying the survivors away as the sun sank down in the sky cass felt restless she had been alone in the office for hours waiting for night to come no one had disturbed her no one had even walked by the door she stood up and stretched easing her hip and thigh muscles they were tight all the time now from the walking when she regained consciousness all those days ago she saw the sierra foothills in the distance the flat dry central valley all around her she had been lying under a stand of creosote a few yards from the edge of a farm road one she didnt know all those years living in silva ever since mim and byrn had moved there during casss senior year of high school she had never traveled far from the long flat straight stretch of highway that led up into the hills from the central valley the few times shed made the fourhour trip to san francisco with friends to see a concert or spend the night on someones friends couch getting high and drinking cheap wine shed barely noticed the chicken and cattle ranches flanking the highway the clots of houses that passed for towns the collapsing sheds and silos left over from more prosperous times she had been lying in a thicket of dead brown weeds kaysev had taken root in patches between the dead plants and cass had been curled up with her face in a soft clump its gingery scent in her nostrils along with the other smells the metal tang of crusted blood the rotting spoils of her own breath her bodys odor foul and acrid her mind had been clouded and troubled both racing and stalled somehow she had no idea how shed come to be lying bruised and mangled in the weeds and she wondered if she was dead because her last memory was praying for death when the beaters closed their ruined fingers around her arms that was all she remembered and it came to her through a dense tangle of lost and broken thoughts so she understood that time had passed since that terrible moment how much time she had no idea the brown weeds made a stark pattern against the clear sky and cass had wished she could just close her eyes and finish the job of dying but then she saw what had become of her flesh stretching made the wounds on her back throb and cass pulled her shirt up and over her shoulders to let the rooms cool air reach them just for a moment just to take away the constant ache for a little while she leaned into the stretch and tried not to think only to wait for smoke to come and get her and take her to what was next a sound at the door broke her concentration cass pulled her shirt down hastily but it was too late it was the girl sammi she had approached the room so quietly and she had seen for a long moment they stared at each other cass holding her breath the girls eyes wide with surprise and curiositybut no fear can i come in of course cass said the girl slipped gracefully into a chair at the same table where cass had drunk coffee hours earlier she had washed and changed her clothes and her hair had been combed and plaited neatly the braids made her look even younger but cass could see that she was well into adolescence maybe fourteen that might explain her rebellion against her mother but cass figured it went further than thatthere was a reckless spirit to her a spirit not so different from her own so you really were attacked by beaters the girl said what happened cass winced telling smoke had been hard enough especially when he asked to see her scars the look on his facethe horror the pityhad been almost more than she could bear but it was worse when he turned away from her it had taken him a few minutes to get his composure back and hed remained cool and distant even when he promised to keep her secret i was cass started to speak found that her mouth was too dry she licked her lips and cleared her throat wished for water i was taken yes but i i woke up and i wasall right sammi didnt hide her skepticism what about those cuts did one of them do that to you or did you do it to yourself cass had wondered the same thing a thousand times the wound pattern held clues the damage was all in places she could reach by herself and it was safe to say she was the one whod bitten and chewed herself the wounds on her back were another matter the beaters always started with a persons back where the large uninterrupted stretch of flesh made their ravenous feeding easiest only after they chewed it away did they move to the backs of the legs the buttocksand eventually when they had eaten away all they could they turned their victim over and started on the front she touched her stubbled hair i did this so you were one for a while at least sammi said its the only thing that makes sense did you eat the blueleaf cass shook her head but who could say with certainty when the government dropped kaysev from planes all over the nation its last act before it ceased to exist the second strain had somehow gotten mixed in everyone had a theory about that most thought the researchers made some sort of mistake sending the wrong seed but some people thought blueleaf had evolved on its own that mutating cells had been heeding nothing more than the call of evolution and some saw the hand of god in the appearance of the rogue leaves whose edges were slightly pocked and tinged faintly blue his punishment for the profligacy and faithlessness of the last decade the blueleaf took root an occasional lowgrowing and stunted patch among the healthy kaysev at first no one noticed by the time anyone made the connection it was too late for the first wave of the infected detection wasnt the only problem the early stage of the disease didnt hint at what the victim would ultimately becomeit hid its curse in a cloak of sensual delirium first came the fever of courseand that felled thirty percent of the infected mostly the very young and the old but if you survived that you felt so fucking good word quickly spread that when the fever leveled off you experienced a high not unlike ecstasy your skin pigmentation deepened an appealing effect when coupled with the feverish sheen the irises of your eyes intensifiedgreen turned jade blue shone brilliant sapphire brown sparked goldbut your pupils stopped dilating and without bright light you could barely see you ceased to care as your mind started to take elaborate journeys on its own the hallucinations were elaborate and often sexual there were no terrors or suicidal impulses you simply lay about flushed and beautiful sighing with pleasure for a week or two until you started to pick at your skin and pull at your hair until your confusion deepened and your speech grew unintelligible and your blood burned hot and you flayed your own skin and developed a taste for uninfected flesh cass had spotted a few blueleaf plants here and there as she followed the road up into the foothills citizens learned to kill the plant on sight and theyd managed to drive the wretched thing nearly to extinction only a few months after they first appeared cass herself pulled the plants from the ground and trampled them whenever she saw them even though her body had somehow rebuffed the disease my mom says blueleafs only here that its not in the rest of the country what do you mean theres been freewalkers throughsome guy who had this ancient radio like from the s or something there was something about it that it could get a signal even with all the power dead and he said he talked to people in other states and they dont have blueleaf they have the kaysev but no ones getting sick thatsthats not possible everyone would leave california if that was true sammi shrugged thats what he was trying to do he was going to walk all the way to nevada he just stayed one night a couple people believed him they went too well cass spoke carefully she knew how fine the line was between hope and fantasy it would be nice maybe once they get the beaters under control yeah i know its a long shot and all im just sayin she looked increasingly embarrassed twisting her hair around nailbitten fingers but i was just wondering you know how you got infected cass took a deep breath i was attacked i remember that i dont remember what came after butwell im hoping someone at the library will know you think they might still have your little girl there your daughter cass nodded unable to speak i hope they do sammi said fiercely my mom she worries about me like all the time she and my dad separated back in january and he moved up to sykes and we dont know if he well you know i mean the last time we talked to him he and this guy this guy who had gas you know like a full tank or almost a full tank my dad was going to have this guy bring him down only the roads she stopped talking and swallowed and cass spotted the hole in her bravery the roads theyd become nearly impassible in places as gas ran out and gridlocked intensified as wrecks piled up and people panicked and abandoned their cars and tried to make it back a few did many others didnt and a few just stayed locked inside terrified until they starved or someone shot them for their fuel or one of the beaters happened to remember what it was to open a door the memory of the mechanical motion released from the recesses of its ruined mind a small step to feed its larger need a few days before she moved to the library cass had watched from her kitchen window as a car tried to navigate the debrisstrewn street that ran along the front of the trailer park woodbine avenue had once been one of the busiest streets in town with two lanes in each direction so it was a logical choice for someone trying to get throughor out oftown but cass hadnt seen a car in days no one had gasand no one had anywhere to go rumor had it that the biggest cities had fallen first and anyone whod set out for sacramento or san francisco hadnt been seen since but cass didnt recognize this car a blue camry with a crumpled front bumper when it slowed to a stop at the site of an accident that had blocked the road for weeksa semi truck had overturned trying to make the tight turn causing a pileup that no one had bothered to clear the drivers abandoning their vehicles to search for sheltercass waited for the car to turn around and go back the way it had come for some reason this driver hesitated in seconds a cluster of the diseased loped out from behind the eleven across the street lurching and babbling most started trying to climb on top of the car moaning with hunger and frustration but one held a large rock in his scabby hand he beat the rock against the driver side window persisting even when blood dripped from his arm cawing excitedly until the glass finally shattered the beaters screamed as they dragged the driver a middleaged man dressed in a wrinkled buttondown shirt and plaid shorts from the car he screamed louder maybe cass started she had to steel herself for the lie she was about to tell maybe hes there still in sykes there must be shelters there groups of people like this sammi shrugged an obvious effort to be brave whatever i can try to find out you know when i get into town they wont know no ones traveling between much anymore i mean besides you what were you doing outside this morning cass asked gently sammi looked at her hands the nails were bitten i sneak out sometimes she said when the raiding parties go out at night i hate it here its like being in jail and i always come back before it gets light out what about this morning ikind of got turned around you were lost cass clarified sammiyou have to know how dangerous it is to be out there alone you were alone how far have you walked anyway sammi demanded since you you know woke up look sammiyou cant tell anyone what im telling you about me being attacked sammi nodded solemnly i promise no really you cant tell anyone sammi nodded again and you have to stop going outside on your own this time sammi didnt react didnt meet her eyes say it sammi please i know you dont like being cooped up here but just promise me you wont go out alone sammi rolled her eyes okay okay i promise cass sighed i dont know how far ive walked really at first i didnt it was like i was sleeping and awake at the same time i didnt go very far for a while i was stopping a lotmaybe that was a week until i felt right again and even then cass passed a hand over her eyes rubbed the skin between her eyebrows even then i didnt cover a lot of distance because of trying to hide when it was light out you know to keep watch and at night when the moon went behind a cloud or the stars failed to light the sky she couldnt go very far at all because she couldnt see back in the library shed hoarded matches and two good flashlights and a cache of batteries but she had none of that when she woke up no pack no food no supplies and she was wearing clothes shed never seen before how far did she travel every night maybe a few miles as close as she could figure it cass had started out about thirtyfive miles downmountain maybe a little more since she had weaved back and forth to avoid going too close to the road the beaters didnt leave the roads when they could help it they liked to follow an easy path and their stumbling awkward gait did not lend itself to obstacles on uneven terrain they stumbled and fell a lot still if theyd caught her scent a glimpse of her in the woods nothing would stop them from coming after her no matter how deep she ran so she had tried to stay out of sight of the road and roads eventually ran into towns which she had to avoid more and more once she noticed like smoke had said that the beaters were clustering around the population centers of before one time a few days after she woke up shed been dozing the afternoon away in the skeleton of a live oak tree it was a hundred yards or so from the road and upwind so cass figured it would be safe enough low in the foothills the trees were sparse to begin with and most had died there was little in the way of cover a sound broke nearby and she came awake instantly her heart racing she almost fell as she looked around for the source of the sound then she spotted the man who had walked directly below the tree his footfalls cracking on broken branches he was walking fast a bulky pack on his shoulders his gait sure and strong a loner cass guessed someone wholike sammiwould rather take his chances outside than live cooped up in a shelter suddenly there was a second sound over on the road cass had been so focused on the man that she hadnt seen them approach beatersfour of them stumbling and crying outand theyd heard him too fear turned casss blood cold for a second the man paused looking around wildly his eyes went wide and he began to run faster than cass had ever seen a man run after a few dozen paces he shrugged the pack off his back and it fell to the ground as the beaters cries escalated into enraged screams unburdened he ran even faster but he wasnt fast enough it was dumb luck that he ran forward if he had run perpendicular to the road the beaters would have come close enough to casss tree to smell her as it was cass guessed the man stayed ahead of them for a quarter mile before they caught up she watched the whole time willing the man forward with her entire being as the beasts knocked into each other and stumbled on the uneven ground and shoved at each other they were so awkward so ungainly but their strength and speed were otherworldly in the end two of them tripped each other and fell to the ground snorting and snapping with fury as they beat at one another with clumsy fists but two surged ahead cass pressed her face into the scratchy trunk of the tree and covered her ears with her hands but she could hear the mans terrified screams and the beaters triumphant crowing as they carried their prey back down the road to wherever their nest was sammi was watching her light brown eyes wide and speculating smokes going to take you isnt he cass nodded sammi gave her a fragile shadow of a smile hes good hes brave you know how he got his name no he was living up at calvary episcopal i mean not like because it was a church they were just using the church for shelter yes i remember there were people living there when i was at the library and the beaters came and they got one of them or i dont know maybe more than one im not sure only they got this one guys wife and he went nuts and tried to burn the place down with everyone in it you know like a group suicide they had this tank natural gas or something and he totally blew it up you could see it all day the sky was like black you know liketotally dark he died but smokewell i dont know what his name used to be it was right when we all moved in here how long ago was that it was around the beginning of may we saw the fire we saw the sky go dark and all well smoke got a lot of the people out he rescued them yeah he got this whole family jed andjeds that guy who was babysitting with me hes sixteen his parents and his brothers and a bunch of other people too smoke helped them get out and when they came here his hair was burned but that was all he smelled like smoke but he wasnt burned and people said it was a miracle i dont know if it was really a miracle but the girl seemed suddenly embarrassed cass followed a stray impulse and covered the girls hand with her own sammis skin was warm and she could feel her strong pulse at her wrist i dont know she said softly maybe theres still room for a miracle or two in the world maybe sammi said she sounded like she thought cass was going to need one late in the afternoon smoke returned sammi was long gone not wanting to worry her mother any more than she already had casss heart went out to the girl shed once walked the same complicated tightrope of parental loyalty and teenage rebellion the challenges of school and friends and her fathers absence aftertime everything was turned upside down kids with their more elastic notions of what was real rebounded and adapted while the adults struggled except for the ones who lost their families aftertime orphans did not fare well they were responsible for much of the looting and destruction that happened nowthe ones who managed to escape predators whose movements were no longer tracked and monitored they found each other somehow their senses tuned to the same frequency of grief and anger and formed gangs who roamed the streets with breathtaking indifference to the danger destroying everything in their pathjust as everything that they had loved had been destroyed cass didnt doubt that the bands of fake beaters that nora had mistaken her for were comprised of kids like these sammi had already lost one parent cass prayed that the girls mother would stay safe smoke brought plates piled with food and two plastic bottles filled with murky boiled water there was a salad of kaysev greens dressed with oil and vinegar there were also three blackened strips of jerky the aroma caused cass to salivate and she could practically taste the salty meat still before accepting the plate she asked why smoke didnt meet her gaze they want something in return he said newsthere are a lot of people who wont make the trip anymore in the last couple of weeks its become a lot more dangerous theres been trouble and not just from the beaters what do you mean smoke made a dismissive gesture long story ill tell you about it on the road but just folks with their own ideas about who ought to be running things what you mean like whos in charge here cass saw a chance to ask something that she had been wondering who is anyway you not me smoke said with finality were a collective here we make decisions as a group but look like i said its a long story well have time for it later but now you should eat but cass gestured at the plate what kind of stores do you have smoke shrugged but his unconcern wasnt convincing quite a bit actually we still go raiding me some of the others there are still houses within a mile or two that havent been cleared yet we only do one a night take five or six of us and go cass nodded she had come across some of these houses herself even sheltered in them what about the walmart smoke shook his head beaters got there first nested all over it theres still a lot of canned food and other stuff in there but we cant touch it it was an older store up highway outside the silva town limits it didnt sell produce or meat but that would actually be an advantage since there would be no spoilage and there would be medicine diapers clothes toiletries processed foods winter coats and gloves boots but were doing okay smoke continued we got to the village market early on cass knew the place a momandpop grocery in a strip mall that stocked highend gourmet stuff for weekenders and skiers wasnt it mostly cleared out back during the siege yeah but we went back and finished the job you knowpeople were panicking grabbing stuff weve found things in houses people will have a whole room full of bottled water frozen dinners and shit they just left out when they couldnt fit it in their freezers not that it mattered not after the power went out cass shook her head at the waste weve got about five thousand cans were trying to save the bottled water we have and just rely on the creek theres some cereal pasta rice spicesnot much meat this is pretty much the end of it he said pointing at the jerky cass noticed that his own plate held only salad and cold kaysev cakes medicine we got into the clinic and theres a woman here who was a doctor a couple others a nurse and a paramedic so we have antibiotics painkillers bandages like that cass chewed trying to savor the salty jerky she had never liked it before but now it tasted better than anything shed ever eaten do you think its true she asked after she took a sip from the bottle hed brought can you just live on kaysev i mean after after everything else is gone she didnt say because no matter how many stores they had managed to lay in here or anywhere else the survivors would go through them eventually smoke shrugged they certainly wanted us to believe that cass remembered the presidents prepared remarks distributed to all the networks after he himself had gone to an undisclosed shelter it was one of the final broadcasts before everything shut down paul palmer of ktxt his hair looking like hed done it himself the part slightly askew his eyes hollow and his voice wavering it was a few days before the media disappeared foreverand only a matter of hours before the planes left air bases in brunswick and pensacola and fort worth and china lake and everett loaded with their secret freight tested and developed and grown in a dozen different locations across the us paul palmer hadnt even bothered to conceal the fact that he was reading from the teleprompter fullspectrum nutritional mass hed intoned code name kiv later shortened to k and then kaysev protein calcium vitamins fiber they could have been lying though cass said they obviously never tested it i meanif they had they would have figured out about the blueleaf before they went and dumped seed over thousands of square miles cassyou should know blueleafs only in california at least it was unless its drifted yeah ive heard that cass said remembering sammis story only thats just one more rumor the only people who know are the pilots who dumped it and even they dont know what was in the seed mix no smoke said quietly its true travis was the only base that went for it even china lake turned it down but they were doubling back over the same flight patterns as travis so it didnt matter how could you possibly know that smoke was silent for a moment not meeting her eyes because i was working in fairfield at the time practically right next door to travis i used to drink with some of those guys butwouldnt that be confidential why would they open up to some guy in a bar smokes face darkened and his mouth went tight it was more than just a bar conversation we werefriends and i guess they needed to talk when they got back from taking the kaysev up those guys were career pilotsthats what they knew who they were they knew it was the last flight they were ever going to take so yeah they talked cass thought about what he was saying it was tantalizing to think there was part of the worldpart of the country eventhat was still free of beaters a place where people didnt live in constant terror but there was something off about smokes story about the way he wouldnt look at her at the barely concealed emotion in his voice how would the pilots know what they were flying she demanded i mean the militarys never been known for transparency i would think something like that would bewhat do you call itneedtoknow especially if there was disagreement about what exactly they were going to distribute smoke shrugged look i only told you becausewell i thought it might give you hope cass didnt believe him but she wasnt ready to let the conversation drop why are you still here if youre so sure blueleafs only in california its way too unstable to try to make it out of state now thats got to be a hundred miles most of it overmountain sammi told me other people have done it smoke laughed bitterly yeah what she told you was that other people tried i met that guy the one shes talking about tried to talk him out of it but he was determined was one of those new roaming prophetpreachers i bet he didnt make it twenty miles up the road on foot i did cass thought darkly shed made it farther than that alone with nothing but her wits although shed had ruthie to live for maybe that had bought her survival smoke seemed to have lost any interest in the conversation he reached for her plate and cass didnt stop him she allowed him to scrape the last of her meal onto his own plate and collect her empty bottle ill take care of the dishes he said ive packed for both of us well leave in an hour or so theres wash water in the courtyard if you want it women use it after dinner then the kids men wait until morning this is your chancetheyre expecting you theyll have supplies for you he hesitated i told them you were shy that youd want to keep your undershirt on your underwear he was gone before cass could objector thank him cass followed the sound of laughter staying to the long shadows under the eaves shed already decided that if either sammi or her mother were in the courtyard shed retreat without showing herself shed done enough damage to the fragile network of relationships in the school but the four women clustered around the makeshift tub were strangers the tub was really more of a giant trough composed of sections of white plastic pipe that had been capped off and propped up on a pair of sawhorses it had been filled with water that steamed in the rapidly cooling evening a small fire crackled in the hearth a few yards away a neat stack of burning madrone branches giving off a spicy pleasant smell several pots of different sizes simmered on the grate above and cass guessed they poured the boiling water into the tub to keep the communal bath warm and to replace what sloshed and splashed out with their movements two of the four women were naked except for plastic flipflops and one of them held a nearly new bar of soap the naked women washed passing the soap back and forth one of the other women was undressing hopping from foot to foot as she stripped off her clothes and tossed them into a pile the fourth woman had put her clothes back on and was toweling her hair she was telling some sort of story that had the others cracking up but when they noticed cass approaching they all went silent im sorry cass said i didnt mean to smoke said i might be able to wash excepti um we have extra towels the woman who was undressing said offering a tentative smile i brought two i wasnt sure if you its pretty casual we keep the water hot for a couple of hours and people just show up whenever some people anyway one of the naked women said she was a wellbuilt girl in her early twenties who didnt seem the least bit selfconscious about dragging her soapy washcloth up and over her wide thighs her rounded stomach some folks i dont think theyve had a bath since they got here they get kind of unfresh you know what im sayin she gave cass a friendly wink as her companion flicked her with her own washcloth not everyones as comfortable strutting around buck naked as you she scolded grinning forgive nance here shes got no manners i um cass said swallowing is it okay do you mind if i dontuh if i keep she hugged herself tightly battling her warring desires to keep the evidence of her attack hidden and to wash her filthy body its okay the first woman said gently handing her a small towel and a folded washcloth they werent terribly clean but cass took them gratefully she set the towel on the ground and stripped out of her overshirt and pants before she could change her mind keeping her eyes downcast and then approached the trough wearing only the nylon tank and panties that shed been wearing beneath her clothes all this time there were only a few scars on the backs of her thighs and they had healed to barely distinguishable discolorations but the gouges on her back were still raw and obvious she knew this from tracing them with her fingersthe undeniable evidence that shed been torn at by beaters but there was more to her discomfort it had also been years since she had undressed in front of another woman and she felt her skin burn with shame as the others watched her it was different with men shed been with so many shed stopped counting one weekend when by sunday she couldnt remember the name of the one she brought home friday she hadnt been selfconscioushadnt been conscious of anything really other than the driving need not a hunger for the coupling itself but a need to beat her pain and confusion into a thing that could be contained again could be put away far enough in the depths of her heart that she could keep going keep living to get to that place she had to use her body to show and undress and flaunt it all of which was done without a second thought but now she felt hot shame color her face as her nipples hardened under the tight shirt exposed to the evening chill she had no brawhat would these women think of that cass didnt know what to make of it herselfon the day she woke up when she stumbled to her feet and tried to work the kinks out of her mysteriously abused limbsshed gone to tug at her bra a habit of decades and found it wasnt there cass hooked her thumbs in her socks and pulled them off tossing them on the pile there was nothing more that she could take off illwhy dont i the woman who had been telling a story said she made a move toward casss clothes pile and hesitated she looked cass in the eye and spoke slowly and clearly she was old enough to be a grandmotherold enough to be ruthies grandmother anyway she had several inches of silver roots an expensive dye job now losing ground what must have been a severe bob softening to a wispy cut around her chin im sonja she said carefully if you dont mind ill take these things bring you back clothes that are clean that you can wear on your that will be good for traveling cass made a sound in her throat a rusty and illused sound that was meant to convey gratitude hot dampness pricked at her eyes and she found that her lips did not move well but sonja just nodded and swept up the mess of clothes hugging them against her body as though they didnt stink as though cass had chosen and treasured them rather than the truththat she couldnt say who shed taken them from and what shed done to the person who wore them before cass wanted to watch sonja walk away to watch the filthy and hated rags disappear but she knew that if she did she wouldnt be able to concentrate on the bath and the bath was a rare treat she had not had or even allowed herself to dream of having such a thing in such a long time there had been several moonlight splashes in the streams and creeks that crisscrossed the foothills but the water never came up any farther than midankle and no matter how cass cupped her hands and splashed she succeeded only in wetting her clothes and her skin never cleansing them she approached the trough the concrete cold and rough on her bare feet focusing on the steam that rose into the evening air out of the corner of her eye she saw the woman who was undressing pause her jeans folded in her hands she had not yet spoken and unlike the others she had made no move to welcome cass hostility came off her in waves the others had somehow made their peace with cass with what she had done to sammibut this woman did not want her there cass inhaled deeply of the steam someone had crumbled something aromatic into the water bath beads or powder or something else that perfumed the air with lavender and created a thin layer of white bubbles she longed to dip her fingertips into the water she was so filthy she could barely abide herself and she wanted desperately to wash even a little of her shame away instead she forced herself to turn away from the water toward the silent woman ill go if you want me to she offered quietly but the womanshe was a handsome woman with a short nononsense haircut and sharp cheekbonespicked up her shoes and socks and glared at cass no ill go she muttered and stalked away im sorry cass said to the others her voice barely more than a whisper i should stay one of the women said im gail trust me you need this way worse than she does cass was grateful but she stared down at her hands crisscrossed with cuts from running into dead shrubs and trees and from falling in the dark the nails were black and broken her wrists creased with dirt her own odor was strong enough that she caught sour whiffs when she moved she could only imagine how she smelled to others if you dont mind she said suddenly near tears and more humbled than she had ever felt in her life id like to stay i was about done gail said flipping thick brown braids over her shoulders and stepping aside to make room but dont worry ill stick around and chat she stepped closer her smile slipping when her glance fell to the nearly healed wounds on casss arms when she looked in casss eyes again her curiosity was edged with sadness did you do that she asked and for one heartskipping moment cass thought gail knew that she had guessed about the attack the beaters everything and then the truth hit her bringing clarity but no lessening of shame gail thought shed harmed herself and she wasnt wrong not about the story only about the details there were daysdark days when the end of the evening approached with no relief in sight no one to slip into the shadows with no strong man to bend her over double until there was no room for her own regrets nights when every shot she downed added to her screaming headache without ever bringing the blessed numb of forgetting and on those nights once or twiceor three or four timesshed found that sharp thing the shard of broken ashtray the coiled end of the corkscrew the dull knife a bartender cut limes with she found the thing and she traced the shape of her shame until she could finally focus on the pain and forget the rest so yes once shed borne the road map of shame on her skin and was this really so different these marks made by her own hands in a fever she didnt remember she hung her head and blinked at the hot mist in her eyes immediately gail put her hand warm and comforting on casss wrist in the small band of unmolested flesh between her hand and the first of the chewed places im sorry gail murmured please justjust forget i said anything past is past here if you want it to be everyone gets to start again cass shivered unable to speak well look nance said interrupting the moment with deliberate cheer look were just glad youre here youre the first new face weve had inwell a while ive been going nuts here with all these yokels nance isnt cut out for smalltown living gail said withdrawing her hand after a final squeeze the moment had passed nothing more than milkweed on the breeze shes way too upscale for the rest of us im from oakland nance said i just came up here to help my mother when things went bad i never dreamed id get stuck here nance isnt much of a nature person gail said she keeps wishing shed wake up and thered be room service i put in this shower last year nance said in my condo one of those rain shower ones there were jets along the side steam and i bet you never had any trouble finding someone to share it with you right gail said winking at cass nance also doesnt like the men here cass dipped her washcloth into the warm water savoring the sensation of the water closing over her fingers her hand her wrist slowly she trailed the cloth in an underwater figure eight ill ruin this water itll be filthy when im done gail shrugged it wasnt exactly crystal clear to start with we just drag it up from the creek we dont bother to strain it or purify it when its just for washing nance wrinkled her nose yeah it smells a little like rotting fish i dont know what well do when we run out of shower gel to hide the smell well stink gail said just like we do now only by then well all be so used to it that it wont matter it was all the encouragement cass needed she submerged her arms up to her elbows then lowered her face into the water and stayed under as long as her breath held out she came up with the water dripping down her face and blinked it out of her eyes ohhh she breathed tell you what gail said i have a little shampoo left oh i couldnt cass said yeah you can gail reached into a plastic tote put your hand out cass did as she was told and gail squeezed out a dollop of creamy shampoo it smelled like rosemary and it was familiar cass had a bottle of it once long ago she held it up to her face and breathed as deeply as she could trying to imprint the memory of the smell in her brain then she rubbed it onto her cropped hair and began to work it into her scalp taking her time making small circles the hair around her hairline was growing in soft and fine cass wondered if pulling it out had damaged the roots in some way before when she was a teenager she remembered her mother warning her that if she plucked her eyebrows too often the hair wouldnt grow back she had believed her mother before byrn when it was just the two of them her mother taking such care in her mirror in the morning and before dates cass sitting on the edge of the tub to talk to her she thought that might have been when her mother was happiest when she was getting ready for a new man before there had been time for him to disappoint her or in the end to leave her when it was all possibility when jack or david or hunt was still new to her i have a good feeling about this one she would always say winking at cass as she slipped her blouse over her head adjusting her breasts in her satiny bra buttoning just enough buttons to give a hint of cleavage she always had a good feeling before even with byrn cass forced the thought from her mind when the shampoo was exhausted the dirt and grease in her hair overwhelming the lather she lowered her head and let the water come up over her scalp and the back of her neck down her shirt she swept her hair through the water rinsing out all the shampoo then she came up sputtering a second time her hair plastered wet and warm against her shoulders nance made a show of pretending to look into the trough cant even tell she said well be able to wash all the kids and a few stray dogs in here too gail made a face our standards arent very high im thank you cass murmured she took the soap bottle nance offered and squeezed a little onto the cloth and started scrubbing her body she began with her shoulders and worked down her arms she took the suds that gathered in her hands and rubbed them into the synthetic fabric of her tank top doing her best to clean the fabric she wished she could take it off that she could stand here naked and scrub until she was finally clean but this would have to do aint no big deal nance said what youre gonna owe us big for is taking the only goodlookin man we got with you here give me that she took the cloth from cass and dabbed at the back of her neck her shoulder blades letting the water sluice down to soak the back of her shirt the water stung when it came in contact with the torn flesh and cass worried that the fabric would cling tightly transparently to the canyons of her wounds and she twisted away pretending to soap her back as far as she could reach nance pulled away from her mild hurt in her expression and cass wished she could explain no its not you its me that her own body was a horror she couldnt shed that nances healing touch was a gift she hadnt earned and couldnt accept nance squeezed the water from the cloth and folded it carefully once twice then she pressed it into casss hands but before she let go she gathered casss smaller hands in her own large and capable ones and held them for a moment with a tenderness that brought tears to casss eyes her sense of exposure deepened while men had touched every inch of her body sometimes without even knowing her name and sometimes with the kind of careless fervor that left her bruised and battered no woman had touched her since her own mother stopped bathing her since the age at which she was old enough to turn the taps herself the image that flashed through her mind her mother watching her impassively smoking as cass struggled to let the water out the drainshe must have been all of nine smarting from her fathers absence and shriveling from her mothers indifference when she finally let go nance picked up her own towel and began drying off cass finished her washing concentrating on the sensation of the warm water as it ran down her stomach down her thighs and calves to puddle at the ground when the others turned politely away she washed between her legs lathering and scrubbing as though she could wash away a decades shame with meager and inadequate supplies rinsing the panties as well as she could with handfuls of murky bathwater the synthetic fabric clinging to her skin and revealing the thick dark patch of hair beneath smoke will come right back here after he walks with me cass said wanting to turn the attention away from herself i just need but she didnt need smoke shed come this far on her own surely she could manage to cross the last four miles of bare road before the outskirts of silva the handful of blocks to the library you take him girl gail said suddenly serious you let that man help you youve been out of the towns you dont know what youre up against ive seen beaters cass protested a few anyway on my way here its the people you need to worry about just as much nowadays gail replied you come through cities nance demanded ignoring gail you seen their nests cass hesitated the biggest town shed passed was a half a dozen houses and a gas station clustered around a crossroads highway intersecting a farm road that disappeared into dusty fields but she hadnt seen beaters there no evidence of a nestno alcoves or storefronts littered with filthy clothing mounded in shallow rings no piles of household castoffs hoarded for the haphazard longago memories they held no fetid stink of unwashed ravaged bodies mingled in restless sleep of torn flesh and leaking damaged bodies seized upon and devoured and finally abandoned the few beaters shed seen had been small and restless roving teams and if shed wondered where they sheltered she cast her doubts aside plunged them into the unknowable so that she could take another step and another so that she could salvage sufficient hope to continue on the others exchanged glances how many at a time twothree and tell me didnt that strike you as strange it had of course once the cloudiness had shaken itself loose from casss mind and she was thinking more clearly since the beaters had evolved they had formed larger and larger packs like a snowball rolled around a snowy field picking up mass they seemed to take comfort in their own kind occasionally youd even see them in a clumsy imitation of an embrace patting each other or grooming the hardtoreach tufts of hair at the back of their heads even hugging they didnt ordinarily feed on each other after the initial flush of the diseasethey hungered for uninfected fleshbut occasionally youd see them nipping and tugging gently at each other with their teeth almost the way puppies played biting with their tiny milk teeth i dont know cass said all of it was strange all of it was horrifying well this is new just the last few weeks theyve started going out a couple at a time kind of poking around together like they have a plan wesome of uswe think theyre scouting a thrill of fear snaked along casss spine a sensation she had thought was lost to her after the things shed seen and suffered she didnt think she could be terrified again what do you mean she demanded theyre on the lookout for opportunities for us theyve started working on strategy whispered no it was impossible the beaters were disorganized stripped of their humanity reduced to little more than animals motivated by an overwhelming need to feed the spells of humanlike behavior were nothing but the debris left behind when the soul made a clumsy exit from the shell of a body that remained to suggest they were evolving the ability to reason to planthat was as senseless as suggesting that a flock of ducks could orchestrate a diving attack were not saying theyve succeeded yet nance said quickly i mean its not like they get very far before they get distracted or wander off or whatever but the fact theyre coming out in small groups like thatand they hang out around the edges across the streets all around the schoolits got to mean something it might just be the evolution of the disease cass ventured grasping at possibilities you knowlike in the whole first population as it progresses there had been a lot of discussion of the evolution of the disease when people first realized that the sick were turning into something else something far worse before anyone called them beaters people repeated rumors that their brains were infected with a madness similar to syphilis but back then much as nineteenthcentury syphilitics suffered from lesions and tumors and dementia before they died aftertime people had initially thought that those who ate the blueleaf would eventually die once the fever escalated maybe gail assented an act of generosity just i want you to know what youre up against smoke knows hes been watching them he takes notes nance added he keeps a journal he used to be a teacher or something well we dont know that gail corrected her he doesnt talk about himself much he said something about it once nance insisted teaching cass toweled off her damp body and thought about the man who had offered to freewalk with her to the library four miles of unnecessary risk the overwhelming impression she got from smoke was ofdepth layers he would not be an easy man to know there was the story he told about the air force pilots she still didnt think he was telling the whole truth somaybe he was a liar or maybe he was just keeping parts of the truth to himself but he was brave or more precisely he had a lack of concern for himself and an abundance of concern for others he had been the first to come at her when she and sammi approached the school and it had been his body crushing hers when he took her down his arms had been hardmuscled despite her strength and fitness she was smaller by several inches and thirty or forty pounds he could have hurt her easily but he hadnt even bruised her what about nora cass found herself asking hisgirlfriend gail made an exhalation of air through her teeth is that the impression you got well theyrei dont know what youd call it they met here nance said nora when she showed up she was a mess kept to herself wouldnt let anyone close at first after her nephewonce he was taken smoke got her talking again i mean im pretty sure theyre doing the nasty gail said flashing a grin that didnt make it to her eyes smokes hot and theres lots of women wouldnt mind a little of that cass felt heat rising in her face that wasnt what shed meantnot sex just the way they had been around each other it suggested a relationship beyond the bond of people sheltering together in close quarters and shed been what exactly curious envious the voice inside her suggested she didnt like that answer but it had the ring of truth to have someone else to go through this withwhat would that be like to have someone to tell your fears to your wishesyour regrets people are funny nance mused some people aftertime its like theyre dead inside like they were already taken even though their bodies are still here and other people justi dont know its like they light up not in a good way necessarily mind you but more like some sort of crazy energy that they rely on just to keep them going yeah gail agreed some people get all manic theres been all kinds of hookups you go looking for a flashlight or something and open a door and theres people on the floor like well you know and then next time you turn around theyre doing it with someone else remember scott and meena nance said and then the two of them were doubled over with laughter cass couldnt help smiling along their mirth was so infectious whats so funny sonja had returned carrying a stack of folded clothes which she held out to cass i had to guess at sizes but i was trying for practical here ill take your towels im on wash tomorrow anyway cass accepted the clothes she hesitated embarrassed before handing over the sodden towel and the washcloth dingy from scrubbing the dirt from her skin i dont want you to have to dont worry about her nance said affectionately tossing sonja her own towels shes a shitty laundress she needs the practice well if i had something to work with besides creek water yeah yeah cry me a river gail laughed sonja here was a designer at nike before she had like a milliondollar budget a staff and a fancy office and this chore stuff has been really hard for her oh right sonja said giving her a goodnatured shove i had my own latte machine and a jacuzzi in my bathroom and a dozen male interns to go down on me under my desk during lunch too good times nance said as they made their way back toward the building relaxed and laughing the sun sinking toward the tree line in a pool of molten orange cass hung back watching shed never had women friends never known what to say how to breach the boundaries but now as she prepared to go into the unknown again she suddenly wished shed tried harder cass dressed in the clothes sonja brought the fabric was stiff from line drying and rasped against her scabs even through the damp tank top but cass was so accustomed to the dull ache that she barely noticed her wounds hurt almost unbearably when she first woke but before long she was left with a dull constant sensation that was as much numbness as pain the disease which had boosted her immunity before retreating had clearly changed her sensitivity to pain as well something to be grateful for the clothes smelled faintly of lavender a soft jersey shirt that had belonged to another woman hiking pants that were new or nearly new maybe nabbed from one of silvas several outdoorsman shops when the looting turned to general panic and then mass stockpiling the greatest luxury was a new pair of socks sammi had brought these to her in the small office where cass had retreated to wait after the bath it was part of a warren of tiny rooms behind the old reception area and cass guessed it had once belonged to an administrator a viceprincipal or parttime nurse there was no window only a desk that had been pushed against the wall a couple of chairs an expanse of industrial carpeting still littered with staples and eraser dust and tiny paper circles from a hole punch the detritus of human activity before the sight brought back a memory of the sound of a vacuum cleaner and cass realized she was moving her arm back and forth in the obsolete appliances oncefamiliar arc with a sense of longing even when she sat in the chair with her hands pressed tightly between her knees and her eyes closed her mind was filled with a memory of the task and it was almost like a forbidden thrill to envision making long slow paths on the carpet feeling the handle vibrate in her hand the debris disappearing into the vacuum after a while sammi came unannounced and furtive the socks were rolled up and hidden in her pocket the tags still attached mens hiking socks pale gray with an orange stripe knit into the band at the top sammi handed them over and shook her head impatiently when cass protested that she couldnt accept them theyre for you besides you can do something for me if you ever get to sykes and if you meet my dad tell him im okay she said his name is dor doran macfall sammias soon as i get my daughter im going to go to the safest place i can find im sorry but i cant promise im not asking for a promise sammi interrupted impatiently only no one knows whats going to happen anymore no one knows the future and maybe youll see him i meanyou got this far didnt you you were attacked you got infected youre the only person ive ever seen who got better fear sluiced through casss veins sammi i never really said she began her mouth dry sammi shrugged but she held on to casss gaze dont worry i didnt tell anyone but your skini mean thats the way it starts that and your eyes theyre way too bright most people just dont want to remember that anymore i mean now that they just kill anyone they suspect might be infected waitwhat yeah if someones even suspected theyre shot theres like a special store of bullets for it and everything they have these elections for who has to do it winner loses and has to kill the dude kids arent supposed to know sammi added shrugging as if the absurdity of such a rule eluded her back at the library before cass was attacked those who were suspected of infection were rare enoughthere was so little blueleaf left and no one ate it on purposethat bobby ordered that they be kept in the old operations room among the silent heating and airconditioning equipment until their future was clear other diseases brought on fever after all so you didnt want to kill everyone in the end only one actual infecteda silent and redfaced old man who wore canvas coverallshad stayed there during casss time at the library even when he began pulling his hair out tearing the skin of his scalpeven when his pupils had shrunk down so far that he couldnt see bobby and another man coming the day they hit him on the head and dragged him to the edge of town and left him thereeven then he refused to admit he was infected the old mans speech had become a bit slurred and that was the last of it for him but cass swallowed hard my armslike you said it came out in a hoarse whisper as she covered the shiny thin scars with her hands unable to look yeah but you act normal youre not feverish and you dont talk crazy once they figured out that you werent going to kill me you know when you started talking and allyou know how sometimes people only see what they want to see cass nodded thinkingbut you still see maybe it was because sammi was young and maybe it was more than that sammi gave her a little grin look youre really not so bad you did fix your hair kindaand your scars are almost gone what you really need cass smiled moved despite herself that the girl was trying to cheer her up yeah eyeliner really thick you know she tugged her lower lid down to show cass where shed apply it then she hesitated they say theres others she finally said that got better i mean its just a rumor this one time a raiding party went down toward everett but yeah maybe youre not the only one cass felt her heart speed up a prickling of hope radiating along her nerves others survivors she asked who wereattacked who started to turn and came back sammi shrugged didnt meet her eyes it was just a rumor my mom says its just people being confused by those fake beaters i mean no one heres seen it or anything and most people think its like what do you call that when people make up stories and they get passed around urban myth cass said trying to cover her disappointment yeah that as far as anyone here knows no ones ever come back before so they dont believe in it but i do i can tell youre different and its not just thatyouve been on your own and they havent gotten to you most people would be dead already so that means youre lucky too but i dont id go with you the girl pushed on and cass had the sense shed practiced this speech in advance im not scared only mom doesnt have anyone else now i need to be here for her but youre going to make iti know you are and you dont even have to go looking for my dad just only if you happen to meet him somewhere hes like six feet three and and then suddenly just like that she faltered her courage evaporated in a mist of sniffles and her smoothskinned face collapsed in on itself she looked like she was about to bolt and without thinking cass reached for her sammi didnt so much lean as fall into the hug and cass wrapped her arms around the girl all elbows and slender limbs and held tight im sorry sammi snuffled against the crook of casss neck but she didnt let go nothing to be sorry about cass said softly and then she said something else a dangerous thing that she didnt plan and immediately wondered if she would regret ill find your dad ill find him and ill tell him youre all right oh thank youthank you sammi said umcass could youyou know if you do find my dad i was wondering if you could tell him something for me you want me to give him a message yeah i mean hell know what it means she bit her lip and looked away just tell him that i never forget i never miss a night and i never will they set out in the charcoal gray of nightfall the approaching darkness taking the color from the earth leaving it a land of black forms and navy sky someone had given cass a backpack a sturdy model made for day hikers inside were a good blade bottles of water energy bars a can of orange segments she wished she could thank her benefactor but no one would own up to the gift no one came to see them off either cass understood despite the lighthearted moments at the bath and the provisions in the end theyd chosen to stand with sammis mother at least publicly no one but smoke and sammi knew she was attacked and she hoped no one really blamed her for the way shed brought sammi back to camp with a blade at her throat they must have known by now that she wouldnt have killed the girl or maybe they just trusted smokes judgmentand too she might well have saved the child getting her back to shelter before the sun was strong in the sky and the beaters were out in force but sammi was well loved here and everyone knew the dangers cass and smoke faced knew smoke might not be back aftertime goodbyes had become too hard when each one might be the last behind them the doors closed with a solid thunk and cass felt a shiver travel up from the base of her spine smoke took the lead walking a few steps ahead he had changed into hiking boots and a longsleeved shirt over a tshirt and set an easy pace just a day earlier cass was setting out alone at this hour after spending the daylight hours hiding and trying to get some sleep her destination was the same silva or as close as they could get before next sunup her urgency was stronger if anything for how close she was but things had changed in her brief stay at the school after being around people again for even such a short time she was reminded of their unpredictability their vulnerabilitytheir humanity human beings were driven by emotions and hungers and drives and there was no telling what they would do in times of stress her fellow shelterers had rescued ruthie that day and cass prayed that they had cared for her ever since but now she allowed herself to consider what instead they might have done with her little girl what they might have told her would they have cherished her held her read her stories and combed her fine hair would they wipe her tears when she cried or would they have been too busy too distracted too indifferent even when cass woke up to the horror of her ruined flesh the hair ripped from her scalp sticky and sore in unfamiliar clothes she hadnt been afraid for herself only for her little girl she had put her faith in the people who rescued ruthie to care for her because she had no other choice she would gladly have relinquished any chance to see ruthie again if only she knew her daughter would always be safe and loved after all hadnt she done so once already every time she raised the bottle to her lips she had chosen her addiction over her baby that was the most painful truth of her recovery and it was hard not to believe this was her punishment to be separated from ruthie without even the knowledge that she was all right if only there was something to trade someone to trade with cass would rip her soul from her body and hand it to the devil himself would walk into the gates of hell with her head held high if someone could just take care of ruthie and now that the library lay ahead in the gloom cass could no longer prevent herself from wondering if ruthie might have been ignored neglected discarded no no noif she didnt get the thoughts under control she would lose her mind her breath would come out in a scream that would split the air and alert any nightwandering creatures of their presence cass took two jogging half steps to catch up with smoke and wrapped her hands around his arms he turned and held her by the shoulders searching her face in the moonlight whats wrong cass could feel her heart pounding in her throat fast and staccato she worked her lips but no sound came out did you see something hear something cass cass shook her head and licked her dry lips and managed two syllables ruthie and then smokes arms were around her in an embrace that was at once strong and cautious it wasnt a bear hug not as committed as that but more like he was making of himself a support for her to lean on she rested her face against his broad chest and squeezed her eyes shut and listened to his slow strong heartbeat i dont know if shes all right she said after a while keeping her eyes closed she could feel smoke nod as he held her a little tighter his arms drawing her closer against him i know he whispered but we try anyway right we try anyway after a while longer cass pulled away embarrassed blinking away the threat of tears she did not cry easily not anymore so what was happening to her was it the women at the bath the illusion of friendship was she so hungry for human contact that she had let her guard down so easily she didnt look at smoke but when they started walking again he stayed by her side she knew that earlier hed walked ahead to shield her from whatever they might come up against in the dark now she had lost that advantage but it had been an illusory advantage at best anything that threatened smoke threatened her as well the moon was threequarters full and its watery light was sufficient to mark their way along the road the smell of tar cooling now after a day softening in the latesummer sun mixed with the gingery kaysev and the dry dirt smell of deadwood far off in the distance she heard a cricket and then another a lonely duet there were crackling sounds in the brush now and then jackrabbits and quail and snakes for a while after the countrys livestock had fallen to the waves of bioterror attacks there was panic that wild animals would be hunted to extinction at first people worried that the pathogens killing the cattle and sheep and chickens and pigs and trout and salmon would spread to the wildand themselves of coursebut advances made early in the second decade of the century tailored chemicals to species with astonishing specificity allowed them to be precisely targeted too the agriculture industry refined their acute toxins to target specific and narrow bandwidths of pests and rodents in the wrong hands it was a simple enough exercise to use the same techniques on other species only the attacks on fowl went wide taking out many bird species until it was a rarity to see even a common blue jay or sparrow terrorists killed off other foodsource species with laserlike precision and those who ate the infected meat of course it didnt take long until no one ate any farmed meat at all thats when everyone became a hunter traps and slingshots were cobbled together the many who refused to surrender their guns in the early days of the riots put them into service cats and dogs disappeared first and then rabbits and pigeons and rodents in one surreal episode a grassroots environmental group pasted up posters of the common brown rat all over silva predicting its extinction and urging people to search out vegetarian proteins but things had worked themselves out hadnt they now there werent enough humans left to prevent the poisoned and overhunted species from coming back why not surviving creatures seemed more than content to graze on the kaysev and on each other in the case of the carnivores their populations burgeoned even thrived aftertime cass herself had come upon a nest of baby rabbits a couple of nights ago the mother stared at her with eyes wide and yellow in the moonlight and its heartbeat had felt impossibly fast when cass put her hands around its soft throat but after a moment cass stopped squeezing and backed away the rabbit quivering with fear but alive without tools without fire it would have been difficult to eat the rabbit anyway and it wasnt necessary a diet of kaysev truly was adequate cass never felt full in the language of before she might have said that she never felt satisfiedbut satisfaction was an elusive and outdated concept serenitycontentmentthey seemed as unlikely for citizens as the ability to fly or read minds but what of the women laughing together at the baths what of the easy banter the sly teasing the gentle humor werent these a sign ofif not happinessthen at least ease of mind had the time that passed while cass was gone been enough to heal the survivors the denizens of this land to make them forget or at least accept the worst of the horrors and search out things worth living for at the library the mood had been bleak loss and devastation and grief pervaded every room every corner every conversation there had been talkendless talkbut it was the talk of fear and relief and guilt and desperation a constant discussion of odds and measures and likelihoods as though such talk could keep them safer could keep the churning threats at bay time had passedtwo monthssince cass was taken in two months the people sheltering together at the school had become a real community built on cooperation and friendship and love or at least lovemaking cass thought about the look that had passed between smoke and nora did she mind she asked abruptly you coming with me did nora mind smoke said nothing for a moment and cass wondered if it was something she had no right to ask smoke had offered to accompany her nothing more yes he finally said she minded very much but you came anyway a question more than a statement yes i came anyway and i understand that you want to know why but im not sure i can tell you i mean i know what answers i ought to givethat it gives my life some meaning to be able to help you or that in aftertime we have to think of the greater good not the needs of individuals or even that we have so little of our humanity left that we need to take every opportunity we can to remind ourselves that we arent savages those all work for me cass said after a moment trying to let him know that he was off the hook that he didnt owe her an answer well thanks but the truth isi dont love her nora and maybe this was a convenient way to leave i dont knowi just dont know im sorry i shouldnt have pried yeah wellsome people say i think too much they used to say it anyway now smoke trailed off and they walked in silence he was the sort of man who went to places other people couldnt follow and it made her want to know more what did you do before if its okay for me to ask sure look cass he glanced at her eyes flashing in the moonlight lets get this straight okay seeing as neither of us knows whats coming tonight or tomorrow or next week or next month you can ask me anything you want if i dont want to tell you i wont but i dont see where some sort of notion of of i dont know propriety or whatever is going to help any of us now and talking might help might help what cass wonderedhelp to pass the time or keep her mind off the dangers and worries or make her forget who and what she was and how shed got that way but she didnt ask for clarity deal she said okay soi was an executive coach a what i helped people figure out what was holding them back in the professional workplace smokes voice carried some dark emotion regret maybe and then i showed them how to change so you basically told other people how to do their jobs and got paid for it smoke laughed bitterly i guess thats one way to sum it up on paper my job was to guide people to be more effective in their work through an exploration of their skills and goals and challenges he looked away into the nightblack forest i was good at it too good how could you be too good i got a lot of my clients because they were struggling at work theyd been put on performance review and were in danger of losing their jobs i was like the career consultant of last resort and looking back on it a lot of them were probably in trouble for a reason i should have let things play out the way they were meant to you mean and let them get fired not everyones suited for every job smoke said through gritted teeth sometimes people need to fail so they dont fuck things up for others sometimes systems are designed so that people who should fail do fail cass was taken aback by his barely controlled anger she knew she should stop should leave the subject alonebut for some reason she longed to keep him talking you went around rescuing their jobs for them just like you did at the church the fire youre the rescuer that can be your new job description dont make me better than i am cass smoke snapped and cass knew that she had gone too far she felt herself flame with embarrassment as smoke stalked ahead of her his body tense but after a few moments he waited for her to catch up im sorry i didnt mean its just that i didnt do anything much no matter what they told you you got people out of the fire nothing that anyone else wouldnt have done i was already there it wasnt any big deal to bring the others with me cass knew he was downplaying the event she understood the impulse being talked about got you noticed and being noticed made you public and then people expected you to reveal more and more of yourself she could respect smokes desire for privacy she knew well the need to keep to the shadows so why did she want so much to know more the road into silva wound through mostly unbuilt land its cracked edges sloping into a rocky outcrop ping at the edge of the forest the dead trees could not maintain their grip on the earth where the road carved its path and their black roots bore clots of earth like hungry tumors pinecones from forgotten seasons lay crushed by cars that had long since stopped running they walked in silence before this land was shaded no matter what the season the evergreens thick against the sky then the toxins had blanketed the land and the trees shed their needles and withered in defeat their xylem choked and strangled their bark black and peeling the sun bore down on the ravaged earth during the day at night as now even the moonlight reached all the way to the earth covering everything with a frisson of silver here and there a cabin was set back among the few remaining trees mostly hunting cabins built decades ago before the sierras were discovered by city types looking for vacation homes with easier drives than tahoe in some curtains hung neatly in the windows cheery ruffles and valences hinting at brisk nononsense women with feather dusters and oil soap in others the panes were broken and window boxes hung askew spilling dirt and dead flowers to the indifferent ground when they rounded a bend and cass saw the familiar glass shop that shared a parking lot with a fireplace and hot tub store her pulse quickened now she knew exactly where she was around the next bend small frame houses would give way to larger ones and then the strip mall with the kfc and the orchard supply hardware another half mile took you to the city offices including the old town hall with the basement where cass had attended hundreds of aa meetings a few blocks from that was the library suddenly cass wasnt sure she was ready you know where you are now smoke said you all right she swallowed hard staring across the parking lot at the ruined businesses there were cars in the lot but their tires had been slashed their windshields bashed in it was shocking the way nearly everything had ended up in ruins during the final weeks of the siege some said america had been lucky while the country struggled with outages and dwindling resources canberra reported theyd run out of potable water and seouls citizens lay sightless and bleeding from their ears in the streets victims of a last plague attack that no one bothered to claim and still across the us citizens raged and rampaged brooklyn saw twelve thousand die in the east water riots the senselessness of it amazed casshow a car that was of no use to anyone now that fuel was impossible to find was attacked and ravaged until it was a heap of steel and fiberglass every part of it assaulted and broken but equally surprising was the care people took in other ways the attention they gave the smallest or most unimportant details gestures made all the more poignant because of the unlikelihood that anyone would ever appreciate them the glass shops windows were gone the interior open to the elements and even in the near darkness cass could see desks overturned computers lying on the floor but next door groat fireplace and spa was shuttered up tight the blinds drawn in the front door the patio table and chairs stacked and covered and there was the neat pyramid of smooth stones piled in front of the door no one knew how the stone piles started but before long everyone knew what they meant there were dead inside bodies that had been left because of panic about contamination or because they had reached a stage of decomposition that made it hard to move them easily or simply because there wasnt timeand now with the threat of attack weighing heavy on every raiding party there was never timewhen citizens entered a house and found the dead the piles of stones were a respectful gesture as well as giving notice to others who might come along if the unlikely day ever came when it was possible to clear the buildings to give the deceased a proper burial then the stones could be returned to the fields and creeks and flower beds they came from next to the pile of stones was a second form difficult to make out in the moonlight what is that cass said pointing oh thata pot i think what like a cooking pot yesi guess you didnt its a new thing a way to tell people that theres nothing left inside worth taking no food no provisions the raiders started doing that as a way to show people when a house had been emptied of anything useful it caught on fast but why a pot smoke shrugged why anything why not a shoe or a lamp oryou know how it is nobody knows how these things start maybe a pot because it symbolizes a kitchen and food and its mostly food that you want in a raid well food and medicine i guess maybe just because theyre sturdy and will hold up to the elements does it matter so that meanssomeones been in there looking for stuff you guys i dont know us or the fire station people or even some of the squatters squatters its what theyrewhat everyones calling people who stayed in houses even if it was their own houses yeah i know but thats what they call them not in a shelter youre squatting they passed the little clump of buildings and reached another bend in the road around the corner the road sloped down again and widened sidewalks lining the street where the ranchers and foursquare houses were lined up neatly are there squatters here cass asked her stomach turning with unease in these houses last time i came this way yes there were smoke said weve mostly been going over toward terryville when we go raiding theres a group sheltering there in the mall but theyve had a hard time with security our locations good i thinknot so many beaters since they like to stay in towns the schools just rural enough that we dont see as many of them at least not until very recently do you know which houses have people in them cass asked smoke looked along the row they were walking in the middle of the street their steps echoing slightly i wish i could tell you obviously not the ones with the stone piles and not like that he pointed at a house whose garage door had been crumpled inward by a pickup truck that was still parked there at an odd angle back tires digging into the front lawn a big picture window had been shattered and furniture and lamps were strewn across the front porch maybethere he said pointing at a square brick house that looked relatively unscathed drapes drawn tight in all the windows cass wondered if there were people inside sleeping with blades next to the bed guarding against attack waiting for the sound of scratching at the door and windows the moaning and frantic whining when a beater caught the scent she wondered what kind of person would prefer living with all that fear and uncertainty rather than sharing it with others in a shelter but cass knew the answer she knew exactly what kind of person would make such a choiceshe would before ruthie before she had something she loved enough to keep on living she would have dealt with evil by standing firm and alone against it even ifespecially ifshe knew it was a losing proposition one that was sure to get her killed cass wondered where the beaters were nesting these days before she was taken they had favored places that were open to the air but sheltered like carports and stores with the front windows broken out they slept a lot it had seemed that they slept as much as half the day away not that they ever seemed to achieve a very deep sleep there was a group from the library who spied on them at night miranda before she was taken had gone along a few times taking enormous risks to watch a group that took over a service bay at a big o tires center cass never went along but she listened to their reports fascinated along with everyone else like newborn rats they reported a wriggling pile nightblinded and restless they slept touching their scabbed and weeping limbs draped and entwined almost like lovers some people thought they felt affection for each other but cass doubted it she figured it was just familiarityor more likely something even more base an attraction based on the pathology of the disease the beaters senses had been sharpened drasticallythey were able to sniff the scent of citizens from dozens of feet awayperhaps their sensitivity had been sharpened as well and there was some sort of comfort to be had among their own kind they shared their victims toothere was that where do they nest now cass asked smoke answered reluctantly peace lutheran still last time we were here the ace garden center those are the big ones and there are smaller nests in other places too and they seem to be roving one night here one night there on the move cass considered the implications thats not good no its pretty much fucked no one knows why its happening but everyone seems to agree that the disease is changing and developing or maybe its just that the first wave of infected is reaching a new stage of the disease i mean it makes sense every stage has been welldefined maybe this is just the outcome of whatevers going on you know in their bodies you mean like maybe theyll stop eating flesh and develop a compulsion to follow each other into the sea like lemmings yeah right smoke said the beginnings of a wry smile emerging it doesnt hurt to dream i guess they walked for a while without saying anything the pack cass had been given was surprisingly comfortable the weight of the water bottles and provisions well distributed her borrowed clothes were clean and she liked the sensation of the washed fabrics against her skinit had been so long since she had been comfortable twice they heard the eerie crowing cries of beaters far off in the distance a roving gang of them out on a night wander they seemed to be heading away rather than drawing closer but when smoke took her hand she held on tightly until the night was silent again cass knew how lucky shed been that her journey back had been through largely unpopulated country beaters generally preferred towns now that she was back in silva the things were all around most slept waiting for dawn but as smoke had explained some were restless enough to venture out even when they couldnt see cass didnt know what was worse the thought of them nightblind and stumbling a few blocks away or knowing that tucked away in the buildings they passed were their fetid teeming nests still she felt like she could walk for hours just as she had every night since she woke up as she made her steady way back up through the foothills on those nights she had tried hard to empty her mind of anything but her goal ruthiebut occasionally she couldnt help wondering how shed gotten so far from home beaters took their victims straight to their nests the idea that they had taken her thirty miles or more out of town was unimaginable how would they have carried her all that way when they took a victim one of them would sling the victim over their shoulders and others would restrain the kicking feet the grasping hands of the terrified victim occasionally they would knock the victim unconscious but that was rare the supposition was that they were afraid theyd kill the person or stun them so badly that they werent alert for what came later it seemed to be important to the beaters that people were awake for that hey smoke said quietly closing a hand on her arm interrupting her thoughts they were on another block like the last lined with mature trees small houses in various states of disrepair what cass whispered back immediately her senses were on high alert she scanned the buildings quickly trying desperately to see into the dark shadows i heard somethingi think over there behind that house behind or in because and then cass heard it too a shrill whistling wail not loud it was coming from the direction of a woodshingled cape cod on the right side of the street where the stickpuzzle forms of dead jasmine shrubs stood sentry in front of a lawn choked with kaysev cass searched wildly for the source of the sound but saw only a limp and torn cardboard box blown by the wind against a car that had been driven up to the porch its bumper resting on the paintflaked wood as she squinted she saw that a form hung from the halfopen car door but it was still and unnaturally bent and even in the moonlight cass could see the white of its skull through skin that had rotted away an old kill or a heart attack a fever death even an accidentcass barely gave it a thought as the wailing grew louder then there was another sound from the opposite direction and cass whipped her head back to the left and saw something that seized her with terror a pair of them one had been a woman cass could see because her shirt wasnt buttoned and her large breasts swung free as she lurched toward them she had no hair left and her mouth was a ruined crusted slash where she had chewed her own lips to shreds the other one might have been a woman or a man impossible to tell from its toolarge jeans and down vest trimmed with matted fur both waved their hands wobbling almost comically as they stumbled closer cass felt a scream rising in her own throat and tried to swallow it back but she couldnt help a terrified whimper smokes hand on her arm tightened until it hurt quiet he whispered theyre tracking us by smell and sound only weve got to run cass whispered back they were too close on the right the beater whose moaning had first caught their attention appeared around the corner of the house it lurched into the yard knocking into a dead japanese maple the branches caught on its clothes and its wailing grew louder as it flailed at the tree trying to disentangle a branch that had gotten hooked on its jacket if we run they will too smoke said theyll hear our footsteps feel the vibrations in the ground we cant over here a hoarse voice bellowed from a couple of houses down the street im putting a ladder out the window you got fifteen seconds and then im pulling it back up smoke grabbed her hand and they ran cass looked wildly for the source of the voice and saw something glint in the moonlight there was a clattering of metal on wood and she spotted what was indeed a ladder flipping out the secondstory window of a brick twostory several houses down on the left behind them the wailing grew louder and she could hear feet slapping against pavement like pounds of meat the monsters were faster than she would have imagined it was rare to see them go at a full run they always seemed so unwieldy in their bodies as though the disease had taken away their coordination the connection between mind and muscles from deeper in the neighborhood cass heard the answering wails of beaters awakened by the hunters frenzy they would crawl blindly from their holes to join the chase stepping on each other tripping and lashing out in their fury theyd slow each other down at first but nothing would keep them away once blood was spilled and their momentum would eventually be overwhelming hurry the voice yelled unnecessarily and as they crossed the yard cass felt smokes hand at her back giving her a hard shove so that she nearly plowed into the ladder dangling against the side of the house go smoke urged and cass seized the ladders frame and pulled herself up to the first rung feeling the burn of the effort in the muscles of her arms the adrenaline surge through her body but the beaters huffing and moaning was close so close and as she shimmied her feet onto the bottom rung and hauled herself up she couldnt help turning to look she nearly fell when she saw the halfnaked womanthing with its breasts slapping against its chest as it stumbleran blindly toward them its mouth wide with fury its nightblind eyes looking at nothing its arms stretched out in front grasping at empty air its companion stumbled on the curb and fell flat on the ground facedown in the dead sod and screamed with rage as it struggled to its feet coming fast from the other direction was the beater whod been lurking across the street it was headed straight for a car that was parked in the houses driveway pumping its fists in time with its steps down the street came more of them loping and staggering and waving their hands blindly in front of their sightless eyes as they followed the sounds of the others greedily sniffing the air for the scent dont look smoke yelled shoving at her feet to urge her higher and cass sucked in her breath and climbed hand over hand as fast as she could but not before she saw that the first beater was going to reach smoke before he could follow her up the ladder and the scream kept winding up in her chest she could not watch them take him she would not watch them take him especially because it was her fault because he had she heard a grunt and a dull thud as strong hands grabbed hers and yanked causing her to lose her footing on the ladder but she realized after a moment it didnt matter because she was being pulled through the window the top rung of the ladder scraping painfully against her ribs and hipbones and she twisted desperately in her rescuers grip because even though she couldnt bear to see smoke taken she had to watch because it was her fault and it would never have happened without her and she could do very little in this life this ruined and fuckedup life but she would pay what she owed and right now she owed smoke witness to his last moments but smoke was on the ladder smoke was on the ladder and he was climbing fast skipping rungs big hands grabbing hard and behind him the first beater was sprawled on the ground below the ladder scrabbling to right itself like a beetle on its back as its companion tripped and fell on top of it cass hit the floor and rolled and a second later smoke landed beside her and a large dark shadowy form of a man hauled the ladder clumsily back through the window she had to duck out of the way as the ladders full length was dragged into the room and dropped on the floor with a heavy clatter and then the man put his hands to the window sash and slammed it down so hard the panes shook and even then they could still hear the furious moaning of the beaters below them thatll fry their bacon the man said with a ghost of a chuckle cass turned frantically to smoke her pulse still rocketing and put a hand to his chest feeling the heat of his body through his cotton shirt you werethey almost they didnt smoke said covering her hand with his own and pressing it against him for a brief second before he deliberately separated himself from her grasp thats what matters ive had so many close calls i guess i dont even hardly count anymore the big man said there was a trace of the south in his voice the rasp of someone who hadnt spoken in a whilebut there was energy and humor too whoever their savior was he was not a beaten man i think i musta got some sorta guardian angel in here with me or something you saved us smoke said ah it was a slow night didnt have anything better to do hell theyre all slow nights you know what i mean im lyle welcome to my place im smoke this is cass why dont yall come on down with me to the basement seein as its a special night and all i might break out the good stuff he was already lumbering through the door into a hallway cass looked around the room in the faint moonlight from the window she saw the sort of simple furnishings that looked like they might have been there for several generations a simple woodpost bed dresser upholstered chair the outline of pictures on the walls a mirror over the dresser casting a ghostly reflection youll want to hold on to the rail lyle called over his shoulder ive cleared out all the rugs and whatnot sos i could get around better at night but it wouldnt do to go breakin your neck after you just escaped them critters funny guy smoke muttered as they followed him down the stairs cass held tight to the rail placing her feet on each step with care shed traveled at night for weeks now but there had usually been enough moon or starlight that she could walk with a reasonable measure of confidence occasionally shed trip over some unseen root or rock but she was fit and nimble and hadnt suffered anything worse than bruises and a cut or two here though inside the house the dark was absolute except for the thinnest slivers of moonlight between the boards on the windows as they descended to the first floor there was no stray light at all cass guessed lyle had pulled the drapes tightshed do the same if it was her to avoid seeing the beaters when they came shuffling around down the hall here lyle said and then theres the basement stairs to the right watch out they aint got risers you dont want to go poking a foot through and breaking your ankle come on in and shut the door behind you and ill spark up a light cass followed behind smoke slipping her hand into his back pocket the gesture felt too intimate almost presumptuous but she needed to hold on to something she could feel his warmth through the denim with her free hand she felt along the wall brushing her fingers against wallpaper a door frame the entrance to the basement stairs she was the last onto the landing and she closed the door tight behind them lyle snapped on a flashlight and cass blinked against the sudden pool of thin light that illuminated rickety wooden stairs an unfinished basement and lyle himself at the bottom busying himself at a card table loaded with supplies his face was obscured by a length of thick brown hair collected into a loose ponytail at his neck as she made her way down the rest of the stairs he looked up and she saw a face with a full beard and kind eyes set in a network of wrinkles that made his smile look almost mischievous he set the flashlight upright on the table so it pointed up at the ceiling filling the room with a ghostly light that cast crazy shadows on the unfinished concrete walls he held out a hand first to smoke who shook it without hesitation and then to cass she was surprised at how careful his touch was how soft his palm now this aint exactly the ritz lyle said but i got it set up comfy enough i guess aint any light can get out of here and these walls are twelve inches thick so those nasty fuckers wont give us any trouble tonight when they cant smell you they just wander off like the dumbasses they are he dragged an old upholstered rocker closer to the light and then went to a makeshift storage unit constructed of plywood and concrete blocks and pushed objects around talking the whole time cass honey you sit yourself down in the nice chair us fellas can sit our asses on the foldups i know theyre back here somewheremy wife used to have this place organized like the fuckin library of congress or something probably would of alphabetized it if i let her cass considered refusing their hosts chair but it looked so comfortable and she was still shaking so badly from their narrow escape that she collapsed into it gratefully it smelled of aftershave and tobacco and the wellworn cushions sank under her tired body okay here we go lyle said coming back with a pair of folding metal chairs sorry smoke buddy id go up to the kitchen for a couple of nicer chairs but i dont see no sense getting our friends out there all riled up again they can hear you through the walls up there cass asked no maam i dont think so but you see they know im in here me and travers across the streetwhy ever since they figured out we were here its just about been driving them nuts they come around every day whole mobs of em wander back and forth between our places moaning and carrying on like a bunch of horny teenagers going on a panty raid oh excuse me cass i dont mean to be crude its just been a while since ive had any need of uh whadda you wanna call it social skills he laughed a rich booming sound and reached for a tupperware box on a nearby shelf its okay cass said i dont mind smoke took the seat next to her lowering himself with care cass had noticed that all his motions were deliberate he struck her as a careful man one who did little without forethought she wondered if that was a result of the work hed done before or if he had always been that way so theyve been coming around for a while smoke asked you been here the whole time yes sir i hunkered down when the shit hit the fan and i aint moved got nothing against folks who want to band together but i guess you can say im a natural loner them rebuildersyou heard about themi got no need to get myself bossed around you know smokes expression tightened how do you know were not rebuilders lyle barked out a laugh no offense boss but rebuilders dont go out without some serious firepower they aint fearlesstheyre just well armed you were a rebuilder you woulda shot those fuckers and then held me up for good measure shooting wouldnt have done much good not even if i was a better shot than i amthere must have been a dozen of them closing in on us a beater could be felled by a bullet but only if the shooter was using a heavy gauge and nailed the brain or the spine hit anywhere else even in the heart or the gutshots that would take down a citizena beater could keep going for crucial seconds even minutes as it took its time bleeding out even a dying beater would keep trying to claw its way toward a potential victim until its last breath left its body those rebuilders train all day long lyle said a lot of em could hit my left nut from across town with one eye shut but i take your point smoke relaxed slightly ive hada runin with them myself dont much care for their philosophy but i dont know that ive got what it takes to live like this on my own either you might say im not much of a joiner lyle said as he settled his own large body onto the remaining chair and started going through the box i might be a stupid son of a bitch trying to tough it out here on my own me and travers hes just as stubborn as me and them beaters getting smarter our odds aint great only been a week or so theyve started doing what you might call a regular patrol through here lyle took out a folded plastic bag and carefully opened it shaking out a halfsmoked tightrolled joint i been saving this sweet little blunt for a special occasion aint a whole lot more where it came from least until i figure out how to smoke me some kaysev if you know what i mean id be honored if youd finish it up with me inot for me cass said quickly lyle nodded and sparked up a lighter a cheap plastic bic he took from the box i got a little bit of johnnie black up there on the shelf too if youre interested no thanks im uh im an alcoholic there was an awkward silence while cass kept her features as still as she could it was not the first time shed made such an admission not by a long shot but it was the first in aftertime thered been drinking in the library for some the days were a lot easier to take through a haze of inebriation a notion cass understood all too well but bobby had put a stop to that he designated the mens bathroom as a place people could go if they wanted to get drunk there and nowhere else and it was a testament to his power over all of them that everyone cooperated cass had found the mens bathroom easy to resist shed never been much of a social drinker anyway she had liked to numb herself in solitude no worries little sister lyle said softly i can put this away if thats easier no noyou go ahead he hesitated his gaze traveling to the scars on her arm he sighed and reached out to touch them so gently that his callused fingertips tickled youve had a rough road he said softly and cass realized that lyle thought shed made the scars herself cass resisted the urge to hide them to jam her hands under her legs instead she gestured to the box and forced a smile its fine really come on someone around here might as well get a buzz on well okay if you insist but just say the word he took a deep draw on the joint squeezing it delicately between his large stubby finger and thumb and held the smoke in concentrating with his eyes shut and a look of intense pleasure on his lined face thats the ticket he finally said and passed it along to smoke smoke took a hit before passing it back not sure i know how to thank you for the hospitality no problem mind telling me what has yall out on the streets anyway aint any water in this block and the raidersno offensebut the raiders usually seem a little better organized than you two cass glanced at smoke he returned her gaze with concern but didnt speak he was leaving it up to her she considered not telling twentyfour hours ago no one knew her story the only people who knew about ruthie were the others at the library and even they didnt know the full story since shed only had her daughter back for a day before the attack besides there was no way to know how many of the people who were there that day were even still alive but what would it hurt now to tell the truth the old shame that had weighed so heavily was gone now vanished along with everything else familiar from before she like all the other citizens had been given a fresh start true it came at a terrible price and there was no way to know how long they had remaining but cass had wasted enough in her lifetime or lifetimes she wasnt going to waste any more opportunities she pulled her knees up to her chest and wrapped her arms around them the chair rocked slightly with the motion im looking for my daughter are you now lyle encouraged her with a smile as he and smoke passed the joint back and forth you have a little one shes almost three her name is ruthie she was at the library when i waswhen i had to leave lyle narrowed his eyes and waited but cass forced herself to take a breath and let it out slowly lyle probably thought shed done something reckless while she was drunk gotten expelled from the library well let him think it the truth would only make things worsehow likely was he to let her stay if he knew what she was hiding under her shirt if he knew what she had been if he were to start imagining the things she couldnt remember doing and you think your little girls here in town cass nodded we were sheltering at the library it was two months ago do you ever get over there not so much inside the place if i see raiding parties out ill go along and lend a hand once in a while theyve checked up on me and travers over there a few other stubborn assholes like us who insist on squatting but i havent heard of any kids really and im sorry im not sure i would have remembered if they were talking about iti dont know the first thing about kids cass tried to cover her disappointment thats okay ill know soon enough lyle nodded youre welcome to stay with me as long as you want i reckon youre anxious to get moving again especially now that youre so close but im guessing the rat bastards are going to be hanging around for a while anyway usually they just fuck around during the day but now and then like tonight a few of emll show up trying to trick me into coming out you think theyve evolved that muchawareness smoke said waving away the joint which was burned almost all the way down lyle took a last big puff and stubbed the spent butt out on a jar lid before he answered tough to say they dont seem any smarter than before if anything theyve lost all their you know whadda you want to call it their language skills you know how they used to say little odds and ends almost make you think like they had something going on upstairs he tapped his head for emphasis a long coil of his brown hair springing out of the elastic yesa few words at a time little phrases smoke said yeah that well they arent doing much of that anymore now its all this wailing and snorting and shit like theyre a bunch of rutting pigs only pigs are probably a damn sight smarter than they are but their habits smoke said carefully they still look like a bunch of fuckedup retards on the dance floor when they walk and you still see them doing all kinds of freaky shit like theyre trying to remember what it was like to be human like i saw this one out there with a doll taking her dress off and putting it on again course then it pulled the dolls hair out or just the other day here comes a couple of em with a wheelbarrow im not shittin you theyve got this thing loaded up with a bunch of bricks and a watering can and i dont know what else kind of crapand theyre trying to wheel it down the street only they aint got any balance and its just dumpin shit out and then they stop and try to put it back in best entertainment ive had for weeks ill tell ya watching those two assclowns finally they just left the whole mess next door in my old neighbor besss yard right in the flower beds oh that old bitch woulda loved that ill tell you lyle chuckled a deep satisfied sound that amazed cass he genuinely seemed amused by what was just one more chronicle of how horrifying the world had become cass wondered how he did itsurely a little weed wasnt the only answer if it was shed happily light up if she thought drinking would help shed go right back to it only she knew better drinking had taken away her pain for a while but it hadnt given her anything back but emptiness and if she ever wanted emptiness that badly again shed just kill herself hang herself from a light fixture in an abandoned house or slide a blade into the soft flesh of her wrist it wasnt like shed be the first but you said theyre stalking you here smoke said like they keep track of which houses have squatters theyre not just responding to catching a scent or seeing movement through the glass or oh for sure aint any doubt about that thats no good smoke said heavily hell no it aint its fucked is what it is so theyve got some sort of memory and planning i mean even if its just rudimentary yeah i guess you could say that its like theyre all in on it figuring out how they can work together theyll do anything if theres a chance they can bring down a live citizen theyll bang their heads into a wall until theyre dead long as the wall gives way even a little bit and after one does it the rest figure out if you bang on the wall long enough itll break and then next time its all of em bangin their heads theyre fuckin unstoppable yeah thats a bit newish but still different from you know waiting for you to come out lyle shrugged i figure waiting around probably feels about like headbanging to them sometimes i go up to the window upstairs and holler at them just to watch them get all pissed off theyll throw themselves at the house for a while climb on top of each other trying to get to the top windowsthe lower ones are all boarded up now one time i pushed a dresser out the window on one of em broke its skull clean in half he chuckled good timescourse i had to drag it away later myself how do you cass gestured around the basement the shelves were well stocked with supplies cans and boxes of food paper towels and toilet paper i mean what do you um what do i do all day lyle chuckled the sound rumbling deep in his chest fair question well i go out every single day i dont aim to let the fuckers keep me cooped up i mean i aint crazy i usually go right after nightfall or right before dawn you hardly ever see one of em out then its about four blocks to the horseshoe so thats a big feature of my day cause i take four or five jugs with me the horseshoe was a branch of the stanislaus river that wound through town a walking path had been laid several years back and young mothers with strollers brought stale bread for their kids to feed the ducks before cass had taken ruthie there when she was a baby so what else lyle continued ticking his activities off on his thick fingers well i go poking around in folks sheds and garages and whatnot see if i can find anything useful and i been digging a new latrineover in besss backyard in fact dug it right next to those fuckin roses she was so damn nuts over if i had a nickel for every time she came over here to bitch and moan about my tree dropping plums on her rosebushesand she had a yappy little dog too but luckily she took it with her when she moved on down to the library though i suppose someones made dogburgers out of it by now cass exchanged a glance with smoke when shed been at the library there had been a nopets policy bobby had been firm on that resources were to go to humans anyone who didnt like it could try their luck living on their own outside with their dog or cat bess had undoubtedly given up her dog in exchange for safety everyone did some of the most hardcore people thought that all animals brought to the library ought to be relinquished for food but in that regard bobby showed one of his infrequent moments of public compassion he himself would offer to take the pet to the edge of town where dogs could join the feral pack sometimes seen scavenging there and cats could climb the shredded bark of dead eucalyptus were you married i mean were you living alone during the siege cass asked fascinated no luckily my last wife took on out of here a couple of years ago back when you could still buy a bag of flour for under ten bucks better for her i imagine she hooked up with this guy from sacramento had a boat dealership up that way i expect he was able to set her up pretty well maybe take care of her duringeverything hope so anyway for the first time a troubled look crossed his face a flicker of sadness i was fond of that one he added softly smoke shook his head smiling well my hats off to you keeping yourself busy i can think of worse ways to spend the apocalypse this aint the apocalypse buddy we already done lived through that lyle exclaimed smacking smoke on the shoulder and bellowing out a laugh were the survivors man you got to remember that dont know how much longer well be around but every day i walk outside and i give those hellcreatures a big fuck you and i figure im still ahead you know what some people say smoke said his voice oddly hollow stamp out the blueleaf we can end this in one generation i havent seen any sign of it since late june it cant survive the heat ive seen it cass said not nearly as much asbefore and its kind of dry and theres dead leaves on the plants but its out there smoke stared at her his brows knit his expression opaque it was almost as though he was trying to decide if she was lying if its out there it wont be for long he finally said they were invented in a lab kaysevs thriving blueleaf isntwhat that says to me is the blueleafs not going to stand up to evolution careful friend lyle said gently youre back into theories now and aint any knowing when it comes to theories youll drive yourself crazy you go down that path all im saying is you make shit in laboratories its probably pretty easy to get it wrong people arent god or else the blueleaf will develop a resistance cass said she didnt like the edge in smokes voice it made him seem more vulnerable evolve into a new strain a stronger one a superblueleaf superblueleaf smoke repeated his voice laced with sarcasm that a technical term cass pressed her lips together stung this was a side of smoke she hadnt seen before an unkind side im sorry he said immediately im sorry cass i didnt mean that i justi dont know i didnt think first cass waited only a second before she nodded biting her lip maybe he was right maybe the blueleaf was already dying out blue means trouble that was the frantic cry that went up around town even before anyone understood the full horror of the disease in the first weeks after the smaller bluetinged plants appeared among the sturdier kaysev a quarter of the towns remaining population died dark bile bubbling at their lips as they went into convulsions the old and sick and very young had to be buried in trenches the last of the fuel that hadnt already been raided went to powering the earthmoving equipment and nearly every healthy young person helped out with the task then they found out what else the blue leaves did to you blue means trouble the children who survived learned to run screaming for an adult when they saw the distinctive leaves with their slightly feathered edges the adults learned to gather and burn the plants the blueleaf strain was susceptible to the sun and heat unlike its stronger cousin by late may it had begun to die off on its own unable to tolerate the sierra summer climate youre right lyle nodded nobodys seen a one of them things since summer round here but how do we know theyre not thriving up north even if it cant root down south now whats to prevent it from adapting like cass here says the governments been up to some crazy shityou cant tell me kaysevs not a whole new branch of botany or whatever the fuck science it is you can make a plant like that you can make a fucking variation for every climate but nobody wouldno sane person would eat the blueleaf now cass protested she was something of an expert on selfdestruction and in aa shed seen just about every variety of desperation but surely no one would choose the beaters fate on purpose lyle shrugged thats not the only way its spread anyone whos attacked now ends up dead in fortyeight hours smoke said almost angrily its not like early days early days when the beaters would occasionally attack their quarry in the streets they could be overpoweredshot or cut or bludgeoned if not to death at least into submissionand the victims brought home with a few bites only to start to go feverish hours later soon the beaters changed their tactics and started carrying their victims back to their nests youre sure about that lyle asked what if they get close but you get away maybe you got a scratch or two but you think youre okay you going to be willing to wait and wonder its only spread through saliva smoke said a scratch cant hurt you and their blood cant infect you you gonna stake your life on it only it wouldnt be your life now would itits everyone who gets left behind lemme show you something he dug into his pocket and showed them his open palm on which they could see a small brown pill potassium cyanide he said matteroffactly got it from a buddy of mine was in the service he picked em up overseas somewhere gave one to travers across the street if the beaters get too close to me someday ill pop this suckerill be out of my mind before those fuckers get their teeth in me dead quick enough to spoil their party thats noble i guess smoke said in a tone that clearly said otherwise hey i never claimed to have all the answers lyle said holding up his hands in surrender but if theres even a chance i could end up being a carrier or something if theres beater blood messing up my dna id rather be dead than accidentally spit on someone i mean ive heard the same things you have about the spit being the only way but let me ask you something how exactly can anyone be sure since there hasnt been any research done since long before the first beater took its first bite no one spoke for a moment and then lyle dropped his hands and gave a crooked smile aw dont listen to me im just a dumbass making the best of it out here in the trenches i didnt mean to pick any fights either truth is im glad for the company dont know about you but i believe ill turn in for a while i hardly ever sleep a night through anymore but i get a few hours now then a few hours in the afternoon anyway let me show you where you can bunk up he was already on his feet closing the cover on his stash and setting the tupperware box on a shelf next to a box marked christmas decorations what hed said cass reeled from the horror of the possibility that she carried within her the seeds of the disease that she could infect others but she would know her body would tell her she had become a scholar of her own body finetuned to its needs the cycle of craving and release and addiction and recovery she knew exactly when her period was coming when a tendril of pain would bloom into a fullblown headache when a twinge signaled a simple muscle pull and when it was something more serious if the poison was within her shed know wouldnt she smoke offered cass his hand and she allowed him to help her out of the old chair they followed lyle up the basement stairs at the landing he turned and said regretfully i think wed better leave the light here i dont like to get em riled up at night they keep thumpin and scratchin at the walls if they see lights on in here makes it hard to sleep he set the flashlight on the landing and led them back down the first floor hall up the steps to the second floor where moonlight seeped through the windows this is me lyle said pointing to the room theyd come through earlier when he rescued them yall take the guest room there its got a nice queen bed oh were not cass said realizing he meant for them to sleep together then she shut her mouth embarrassed there were only two rooms separated by a small bathroom ill take the floor smoke said i didnt mean to make assumptions but you got a shot at a bed here why not take it lyle said might as well get a good nights rest when you can its all right cass said i mean we can share its just just nothing just a man and woman exhausted from fear and adrenaline no doubt theyd be out the minute they hit the bed there was nothing suggestive or sexual about it aftertime was about needs basic necessities social conventions had long since disappeared two people could share a pail of water or a can of peas or a bed and it meant nothing more than survivalanother day or hour or minute on a planet that had grown increasingly inhospitable theres a bucket in the bathroom lyle said i wish i could offer you better i clean it out every day though and i keep a stack of clean rags in there i wash em down at the creek ive never been the best housekeeper but i guess itll do thank you smoke said seriously man im sorry i got a little testy with you back there lyle held up a hand to stop him no worries my friend i reckon all our nerves are shot to hell im honored to have you yall take first shift in the john if you wantill be up for a while cass went first after she rested her hands on the sink and gazed at the mirror she could see very little in the moonlightbut it was the first time shed seen her reflection at all her face was smooth unmarked her lips were dry and chapped but there were no signs that shed chewed them she felt a faint stirring of hopemaybe shed recovered before she got really bad beforeshed had a chance to do anything reprehensible she touched her cheeks with her fingertips tentatively she was lucky not to have been bitten there whatever it waswhoever it waswho rescued her from the beaters feeding frenzy they had been quick there hadnt been time for the beaters to consume anything more than the strips of flesh from her back casss hands went automatically to the small of her back the wounds she could reach near her tailbone was a raw patch where as far as she could tell a section of skin about four inches long had been ripped away when she first woke her exploring fingers touched something wet and the pain was unbearable and it had been days before she could stand to touch herself again the beaters loved only flesh skin they did not eat muscle or sinew or bone and they chewed sections of flesh free and then peeled them away their jaw strength magnified by the disease and by their furious hunger for that reason the wounds they made tended to be elongated shreds and strips peeled away of course when they were done it didnt matter since they feasted until little was left skinned but otherwise intact their victims were left alive and in agony their deaths hours or days away they died in the throes of the fever but at least they never lived long enough to turn into monsters but casss attackers had presumably been interrupted how and by whom she had no idea still she was grateful that the beaters had time to tear only a halfdozen holes in her back from the base of her spine to her shoulder blades she pulled her shirt over her shoulders and slowly turned until she could see her back in the mirror dreading her reflection but the wounds werent the festering and oozing things she feared they would be they were healing regrowing flesh where it had been taken in the mirror they seemed to glisten pale layers of skin filming over the red and raw underlayers cass realized she had been holding her breath and turned back pulling on her shirt as she exhaled slowly her hair soft from its recent shampoo stuck out in jagged clumps where smoke had sheared it off but at least it didnt look like shed pulled it out herself she looked a little like a punk rocker from thirty years earlierher mothers time when women used to cut their hair short and spike it she thought of wetting it down to tame it and her hands went automatically to the faucet and turned the handle before she remembered the futility of the gesture water had not run in these pipes in months as the siege worsened it eventually became clear that not only did the government not have the ability to repel the relentless bioterrorist attacksthey were never going to be able to identify with certainty who had unleashed them the toxins were manufactured in japan russia even finland outsourced across a thousand corporate shells but terrorist groups in greece and sri lanka and colombia and somalia took credit along with the usual suspects as every major food crop was decimated and livestock lay rotting in stinking shallow graves peoples fears morphed into a terrible fury rioting roving bands of citizens stormed every municipal and government office and the very people who were trying desperately to hold on to order were either dragged out and beaten or ran for their lives one by one substations on the power grid flickered out water stopped running through the municipal pipes cell towers went dark and still everyone kept making mistakes forgetting that the light switches no longer turned on lights that faucets wouldnt deliver water that phones wouldnt ring or connect anyone that stoplights would never guide them and toilets would never flush it took a while but eventually everyone adapted the things from beforethe hydrants and lamp poles and public restroomsgradually they became just another part of the landscape unnoticed and untouched and yet here she was hands turning the cold knobs expecting water to fill the basin cass closed her eyes and focused on the sensation she could almost feel the water rushing over her fingers she imagined water arcing from a drinking fountain remembered how it felt pooling in her mouth cold against her tongue she remembered a garden hose on a hot day testing the water dribbling out of it and waiting until the sunheated water ran cool before putting a thumb over the nozzle and making a rainbowdappled spray for ruthie to run through droplets sparkled like a thousand tiny crystals in the sun anguish seized cassnot just a longing for another time but a sense that she herself was lost that her exile from the rest of the world had left her without a place to return to she was missing two months of her life and during that time the world had moved on without her the beaters had evolved citizens had evolved too the shelters were full of survivors who made homes inside the schools and libraries and supermarkets and churches in the time since she was taken they had shared meals and made friends theyd buried their dead and given birth and made love theyd cried and grieved and laughed and created new memories and she had not been there cass was alone like she had always been alone since the day her father walked out the door and her mother hardened and changed into someone else the bad decisions she made in high school only grew more desperate as she pushed everyone away she piled failure onto disappointment until there was no path back eventually her friendships atrophied and disintegrated and the only people in her life were the people she drank with or fucked for a brief shining time there was ruthie ruthie brought cass back to life ruthie helped her start to be a person again until that dark moment when she stumbled when her darkness reached up for her and pulled her down again and maybe mim and byrn were rightmaybe they had to take ruthie away from her maybe they had no choice because cass didnt deserve her cass ground her knuckles hard against the porcelain of the sink until her bones ached shed finally gotten ruthie back only to fail her again shed had her daughter less than one day before she carelessly let the danger in shed almost let her daughter die a horrible death a sound came from her throat a strangled whimper there was a knocking on the door and then it swung open and smoke was there are you all right cass his hand hovered in the air as though he was afraid to touch her and he said her name again cass slowly she raised her face to the mirror and this time when she looked at herself there was a sparkle of tears in the moonlight and cass realized that she was crying for the first time since the day the social workers had come for ruthie she stared at her ghostly reflection in disbelief and it was only when smoke took her by the shoulders and turned her toward him when he reached a gentle hand toward her face to brush away her tears that she shoved him no immediately he put his hands in the air and backed up into the door im sorry i didnt mean you dont understand itsits what lyle said i could be a she swallowed hard a carrier you know i could have it in me the disease it could be in my tears smoke shook his head no cass no i dont believe that and even if it were possible it wouldnt be your tears just your saliva you dont know that thats just a rumor not for sure maybe but theres a guy at the school came out from ucsf in the early days of the siege one of the last ones to make it before the roads got all fucked up he was a researcher in infectious disease he knew his shit cass and he said its like with rabies you get it from being bitten from an infected animals saliva and even if theres traces of the virus in other body systems its not enough to cause infection he said they tested one of them one of the beaters before they lost power in the lab they didnt get very far but the abnormalities or whatever were in the saliva and they found traces in the spinal fluid and internal organs but at such a low level that it wasnt enough to pass on the disease he could have been making it up he could have been crazy he yes smoke interrupted yes he could have been lying but i choose to believe him thats all we can do anymoreis to choose what were going to believe and what not to believe this time when he traced his thumb gently along her cheek cass stayed still when he grazed the tender skin below her eyes her tears spilled over and splashed hot on his skin but he did not flinch what happened to him cass whispered the scientist he moved on he felt it was only a matter of time before the beaters spread east he figured within a year theyd have reached the midwest and south but he went north he thought the beaters might not be able to handle colder climates you believe that smoke said nothing but his fingertips traced her hairline over her ears settled under her chin yeah maybe he finally said i mean theyre still human kind of theyd die of exposure when the temperatures go below freezing so i think theres a good chance theyll naturally keep moving south with the weather look lets not talk about all this anymore now come with me cass lets lie down ill stay awake with you until you fall asleep let me helpyou dont need to feel so alone cass ducked her chin the moment was broken she was done crying for now she followed smoke out of the bathroom and into the guest room and as he closed the door silently behind them she turned the bedcovers down and slid between the sheets they were marvelously cool and silky against her skin they smelled like fabric softener and cass realized that they hadnt been slept in since the last time they were washed smoke unbuttoned his shirt taking his time and watching her watching him in the moonlight he slid it off and folded it and laid it on a chair then he took off his belt and boots and socks and dropped them to the floor he got in the bed next to her slowly carefully leaving an expanse of white sheet between them he propped himself up on an elbow and gazed at her and she couldnt help it she sucked in her breath and felt her skin grow hot being watched like thiscass felt the old stirring the need that had always made itself known to her without subtlety whenever she felt her solitude too acutely the weight of all her terrible decisions there was only one way to block it out and that was to smother it with something stronger she had started using sex to obliterate the pain when she was a senior in high school a few years later shed evolved it into a high art learning to attract and control and barter and for a while that was enough but over time it took greater and greater risks sheer heights and breathless drops to satisfy her need for release drinking helped but drinking only masked the need it never took it away and there had been plenty of nights when she didnt manage to pass out before she had to satisfy the hunger that wouldnt be quieted plenty of nights when shed done things that skated a very thin line between pleasure and pain when she didnt recognize her own cries couldnt tell if they were anguish or satisfaction ruthie had been conceived on such a night only cass had no idea which one there had been too many now the old swirl was hot within her the rushing dizzying bloom of need and fury that felt like molten iron and burning acid all at once a killing thirst that demanded to be slaked but something was wrong instead of anger it had been stoked by fear fearand loneliness and these emotions could never be powerful enough they could never force her to do what anger could dobecause she was a creature of rage she burned whitehot when she drank and fucked and ran miles through the foothills when she pushed her muscles her lungs her legs so hard they screamed out for release without her rage she was nothing but emptiness a shell of a person and yet the swirling need was there threatening to overtake her if she didnt satisfy it how long had it been since casss mind raced as she realized she hadnt touched herself hadnt had even that pale substitute since she woke in her matted bed of dead weeds how was that possible all these long days on the road and cass had never once missed the touch of a manor even the satisfaction of her own handsuntil now with smoke next to her smoke whose eyes glinted even in the dark i canti need she started to say but she didnt know what came next its nothing to be ashamed of smoke said his voice little more than a low vibration that traveled from his body through the soft clean sheets and blankets and mattress and pillows and into her body spreading out from the middle sounds and sensations that broke apart and reformed as more than just words im not ashamed she whispered back but it was a lie her shame was so great so powerful it was a tiger in a cage it was hungry it wanted to devour her as it had devoured her on so many nights before its teeth were sharp the only way to keep the tiger in its cage was to fight back with the rage inside her and she only knew one way if she couldnt drink her shame into submission she had to let it out through her body until the sensations overtook her emptied her cleansed her im not afraid smoke said and he reached out a hand and closed it over hers but he didnt come any closer he kept the distance between thema gulf he wouldnt cross a moat he would let her stay behind im not afraid of you and i dont believe you have anything evil inside of you i could kiss you now and i wouldnt be afraid i want to kiss youim not afraid no cass protested she couldnt stand to look at him she turned her face to the pillow trembling no no no but she held on to his hand and it was herit was all herwho pulled hard who took his hand and pressed it to her body over her shirt ground his palm against her nipple as she found the corner of the pillowcase and bit down hard smoke waited his body tense and still next to her and only when she whispered please eyes squeezed tight against everything she couldnt bear to admit to herself only then did he trace the softest path across her collarbone with his lips while he pushed her scrabbling fingers away and locked them tight in his own dont kiss me cass whispered fiercely if she could shed seal her mouth cover it over with skin so the disease if it was harboring inside her insidious and undetected could only boil its toxins within her she would not risk smokeshed swallow the disease whole if she had to she would be its host she would give it her body but she would not let it claim him too dont you ever kiss me cass let him pin her in place because she wanted to be pinned and somehow he knew she did not want to be able to fight against this she knew herself too well knew how savagely her body would fight if it had a chance so she lay with one arm trapped under her hip her other pressed to the mattress in smokes fist as he unbuttoned her shirt one excruciatingly slow button at a time he slid his fingers along the edge of the bra the women had brought her it was a serviceable thing nothing like the black and lacy ones she used to wear a stretch of beige with businesslike stitching and sturdy straps but it was a simple matter for him to unhook the front and ease it out of the way while her treacherous body slid closer to him as close as it could while he held her in place she was strong but she was compact legs and arms whittled down to muscle and sinew and not much else smoke was broad and dense and unstoppable and she shivered with anticipation as he covered her body with his own and held her motionless and watched her the window was open cass had not thought to worry about it and there was no time to be afraid nowany beaters wandering around out side could fuck themselves because she had to be here for this moment had to be all here body and mind and whatever shreds were left of her soul sheer curtains fluttered in the window gossamer panels of white that waved and floated on the breeze a woman chose those curtains the breeze was cool and delicious and it blew gently across her body across her nipples exposed and hard and aching the breeze was indifferent to the siege it was the breeze of before and as smoke lowered his mouth to her slow and unstoppable it occurred to her that the breeze had defied the beaters the famine the routed cracked and poisoned earth it waited for night and then it came as it ever had and cass welcomed it and drank it in smokes mouth it was hot it was soft but thenoh god then it wasnt he closed his lips around her and stroked with his tongue and even then he was strong he was insistent had she known he would be like this the moment she saw him in the little room that was once a school office as he looked her up and down cass with her wrecked flesh and stinking body and misshapen clothes her hair in knots no better than a rabid dogthere had been something even then hadnt there but cass had steeled herself against it she had thought her body no longer carried that taint the things shed suffered in some way shed thought they had sucked all the life from her not just hope and faith but this this most elemental longing of the body for recognition for slaking for surfeit this was somehow different from the desperate coupling shed done a thousand times in the back room of her trailer in backseats in roadhouse parking lots in cheap motel rooms and alleys and up against cars this was a bid for life smoke grazed her nipple with his teeth and she cried out and bucked against him she wrapped her strong thighs around his waist and forced him harder against her he slid his hand into what was left of her hair he tugged and she arched her back and then he released her hair so that he could undo her pants could jam the zipper down and slide the rough fabric over her hips taking the plain white cotton panties with them she made the sounds that meant no that meant this is not a good idea but the sounds somehow didnt turn into words were just sounds just wailing needful sounds he kissed her neck traced a path around her jaw down across her throat as his hand found its way between her legs her legs that fell open for him in greedy betrayal he pressed his palm gently against her and hesitated as though he might stop there his touch was not tentative she knew he meant to be reassuring and that was not enough no that would not be enough it would never be enough cass lifted her hips off the bed and ground against his hand and he entered her with his fingers he was not gentle he did not take his time he did not coax out her moisture to ease his way he jammed them hard inside her and she broke her own rule she had kept her mouth clamped shut but now she cried out a hungry desperate sound that was nearly mad with need smoke plunged into her as far as he was able but then his thumb slid against her in the mere suggestion of a caress he barely touched herthereand cass threw herself into the rocketing sensation and kicked him hard on the backs of his calves he answered with a growl that was deep and dangerous and pushed her back against the bed with a hand splayed at her throat she was pinned again helpless against him and that may have been the only thing that allowed her to open her eyes and look at him a lock of her hair had fallen into her mouth and she seized it with her tongue chewed it their eyes met and it was some trick of the moonlight or of her own fevered need that she could see into him through what was real into what was before into his before self into his days of rote striving his complacency his success and cass knew in that instant that smoke had never been a man she could want before and it was only the siege that had forged and molded him into this smoke lowered his face close to hers and she saw the look in his eyes he wanted her to see it he wanted it to be unmistakable as he spread her wetness all over her found it with his insistent fingers and sluiced it into her folds and crevices stroking her all the while making her watch and when her breathing grew hard and loud and ragged he plunged into her again but this time it was all of his fingers and he took his other hand and slid his thumb into her mouth and she clamped her lips around it and sucked it hard and writhed and bucked against him like she could take his entire being inside her and when she shattered she was sure she was dying because every part of her splintered and went flying into the sky in different directions and she didnt even care and then time passed and the breeze kept up its gentle journey and the tearsbecause yes shed sobbed when she came probably she had been crying the entire timethe tears dried to salty tracks on her cheeks smoke held her and when his hands found the wounds on her back he explored them with his fingers so gently that it only tickled a little and he murmured that he was sorry so sorry and she let him touch the entire expanse of what was ravaged and hurt when she shivered from the night chill he pulled the covers up over her body then he stroked her cheek and she could smell her own scent on his fingers and she turned her face away and the shame was back just like that you shouldntyou put your fingers in my mouth you wanted them there smoke answered without any trace of regret but i could be we could both be dead tomorrow smoke said sharply and then relenting besides i didnt kiss you cass considered that technically it was true he hadnt kissed her on the mouth but all it would take was the tiniest cut or scratchoh god had she bitten him she couldnt remember it wouldnt surprise her but she had needed him in her mouth only it wasnt his fingers she longed for and as images flashed across her mind she felt herself blush and then she pushed his hand off her hip and wrapped the bed linens more tightly around herself what smoke said allowing himself to be pushed away you didntyou know i wasthat was all about me smoke shrugged and settled himself on his back making do with the short end of the blankets that cass had left him youre keeping score confusion and uncertainty roiled and surged you say that like you think there will be a next time i have no expectations smoke said wearily for what its worthi enjoyed every minute of that youre an exceptional woman cass im not cass screamed but without words and without sound im not im not im not long after smokes breathing went steady and even long after her own body went leaden with fatigue and only her racing mind prevented it from falling into a deep sleep the voice inside her raged against its walls you arent exceptional you arent anything you were nothing now youre diseased you are the disease you are the vessel and you are wrecked and poisoned and evil calmed by the voice that was vile but at least familiar cass finally let go of the sheet she had bunched tight in her hand she stopped scraping her nails savagely at the skin of her thumb as the voice lulled her to sleep with its familiar lullaby of selfhatred this was a landscape she knew well this was home but as she finally drifted off to sleep the stretch of white sheet between them so inviolable it might as well have been a brick wall cass was unsettled to realize that there was a tiny tendril of hope twining up the walls around her heart ruthie was reaching up for her stamping her foot stamping in frustration her sweet little rosebud lips wobbling toward a wail she was dressed improbably in the pink terry cloth onesie cass had brought her home from the hospital in a gift from meddlin who had been beside him self trying to keep the qikgo staffed while she was on her brief maternity leave ruthie was a big girl now and the pink onesie had morphed into a bellsleeved dress with a full skirt that swung around her chubby knees as she stamped and pouted she was trying to tell cass something but cass couldnt hearit was as though there were a thousand layers of sound in her ears and she could hear none of them tears welled in casss eyes and she tried with all her might to bend down and pick up her baby or at least kiss her frown away but she couldnt move and then the outlines of ruthies dress started to break up and scatter and ruthie began to fade her cries turning to frantic screaming casscass cass felt a strong hand close on her shoulder and she fought her way awake the horror of the dream falling away in shards she blinked hard a few times and sat up looking frantically around the unfamiliar room until she remembered where she was in daylight the room was smaller than it had seemed last night with a beadboard ceiling sloping toward the window and rosepatterned wallpaper the curtains that had drifted on last nights breeze lay limp in the window barely stirring there was a whitepainted dresser with a porcelain lamp and a basket of pinecones a faint scent of dried eucalyptus tinged the air cass rubbed her eyes and forced herself to look at smoke the stubble on his face gave him a raffish air and his eyebrows knit in concern only underscored the effect of a pirate his tshirt had twisted during the night and she caught a glimpse of his stomach flat and hard with a line of black hair below his navel trailing down she felt the stirring inside her a response that last night had sealed indelibly in her mind and she fought it hard you all right smoke asked voice sleeprough but gentle instead of answering cass rolled away from him and untangled herself from the blankets she stood hastily pulling up her pants and slipped out of the room she retreated to the bathroom and pulled the door tight behind her inside on the closed toilet seat lay a bowl of water and an unopened toothbrush and a fresh tube of toothpaste on the floor was a second bucket the waste bucket had been emptied lyle had been up before them and the extent of his hospitality stopped cass in her tracks and halted the panic that was threatening to careen out of control dragging her behind it it wasnt that other people hadnt offered help some of the shelterers at the library made an effort when she first arrived but she was so accustomed to keeping to herself that accepting an extra serving of food a muchthumbed magazine from six months earlier an invitation to walk around the courtyard in the eveningthese were foreign notions and it was so much easier to turn away than to risk letting a stranger get close to her what did it mean that she was allowing lyle to help her now was she changinghad the brief contact with smoke with sammi with the women at the bath already turned her into someone different a self that she didnt recognize was she growing softer weaker in her longing for human contact she picked up the toothbrush and peeled back the packaging running her tongue over her cracked lips her teeth yesterday the women had loaned her supplies and shed brushed for what seemed like hours trying to remove the weeks accumulation of matter from them among all its other properties the kaysev stems woody fibers did a serviceable job of cleaning teeth but the taste of toothpaste and the cool clean sensation afterward were a welcome relief she brushed slowly savoring the taste then she used one of the folded cloths that lyle had left to wash her face her hands between her legs trying to get rid of every trace of the night before she did not think of smoke and she did not think about the dream ruthie though not thinking about them took all her concentration she thought of the real ruthie the way shed looked when cass went to mim and byrns place to take her back shed been worried that the months of separation might have erased her from her daughters mind but the minute ruthie saw her in the doorway she jumped up from the sofa where she had been playing with a thin gray cat and ran to her blond curls flying eyes wide with relief and joy cass took a deep breath and looked into the mirror the first thing she noticed was how green her eyes were and for a moment she was electrified with terror until she figured out that it was only the pure strong light of morning that had shrunk her pupils she cupped her hands around her face and leaned toward the mirror and her pupils expanded in the tunnel of dark she had created and she exhaled with relief before the turn her eyes had been a muddy hazel green now they were the vibrant green of lemon leaves bright irises were an early symptom of the disease one of the things that gave the infected such ethereal beauty shortly after the blueleaf appeared before any of them had turned all the way but the shrunken irises that followed turned beaters eyes into bright soulless tunnels passages that seemed to lead to their poisoned cores by contrast casss eyes sparkled with life making her look alert and intelligent andpretty cass felt her face flush she touched her cheeks her chin the skin was clear and almost luminous her eyelashes stood out against the delicately veined eyelids longfringed and black her hair looked badly cut but not terrible it was glossy and the same rich golden brown it had always been the new growth at her crown nearly indistinguishable from the rest after taking a thorough survey of her face she couldnt put it off any longerit was time to look at her back she skimmed off her shirt and turned and oh god it was worse than shed thought worse than shed imagined worse than shed seen on anyone who wasnt already dead or dying the pocked areas where chunks of flesh had been chewed off were red and angry and raw shreds of blackened dead tissue were stuck to the crusty shiny layers underneath in some areas it looked like muscle was still exposed though concentric layers of healing skin as thin as tissue paper skimmed over the wounds from the edges inward thank god shed hid herself from the women at the bath what would they have done if they knew they had been so kind especially the one who had washed her so tenderly never knowing what lay under her shirt if they saw were forced to look at the evidence of the attack on herespecially after what shed done to sammieven the most compassionate among them would be unlikely to show her any mercy cass tried to force a memory from her mind a night when she had gone on the raiding party from the library shed been at the library for a couple of weeks and was going stircrazy her only outdoor time in the courtyard where she stared at the same treetops the same stretch of sky day after day so when the raiding party assembled after dark with their empty packs and bags she put on her own knapsack and held her blade at the ready and went out with them into the night there was an air of forced joviality whispered joking and brittle laughter they went south down past the high school to a culdesac of rundown seventiesera trilevels one of the curious truths of aftertime was that the most opulent homes didnt yield the best spoils it was the solidly middle class who were most likely to have costcosized stores of granola bars midol hand sanitizer they found enough to fill their packs in the first few houses theyd come back another night and make their way around the rest of the block there was no rush they were like summerfat squirrels hoarding for a winter that still seemed faroff the others seemed to relax now that they were headed homeuntil they passed the old arco and heard garbled pleas for help coming through the minimarts shattered double doors it was not the voice of a beater helppleasehelp cass couldnt tell if it was a man or a woman it was like a scream that was leaking air agony enunciated with excruciating care walk on cass bobby said softly drawing her away from the others his hand gentle but insistent at her back bobby was always so kind to her he wanted to be with her he said he was willing to wait until she was ready but how could she ever be ready half a dozen times she had turned him down and still he was trying to protect her didnt he understand that she didnt deserve him dont tell me what to do she whispered backing away from him from the concern in his eyes she had to show him that she was not his and though her heart hammered with fear she walked straight over to the minimart shining her flashlight in front of her there were none of the things inside she knew or they would have come loping and gnashing in pursuit the minute she and the others came close but what she saw in the flashlights illumination was clearly a nest befouled clothing and blankets mounded into a pile a dozen feet wide the space made by pushing all the stores racks and shelves to the side the beaters usually only left their nests during the day when their tinypupiled eyes could absorb enough light to see but for some reason these ones had gone hunting that night the nest stink was powerful and cass knew any number of the things could be nearby and she would have turned and runexcept that on the nest lay one of their victims it was a man she thought it was anyway but only because he still had his hair which was buzzed short he was naked but the rest of his body held no clues to his gender all of the skin having been eaten away under a basting of blood the flesh was flayed and ribboned and chewed bone showing through in a few places but mostly red muscles and sinew and nerves and tendons remained the tough soles of his feet had been left whole and his toes were undamaged but even the flesh on top of his feet had been ripped away the network of delicate bones showing through the gore his face had been left mostly intact other than the cheeks which had been chewed through facial skin was thin maybe the beaters found it tedious and had gone looking for another victim instead at any rate the mans eyes were wide with shock and his lips convulsed as he tried to speak it took several attempts for him to put the syllables together killme no cass whispered her hand flying to her mouth no no no a hand yanked at her elbow and she stumbled as she tried to resist outside it was bobby and his expression magnified in the tilting flashlight glow was grim cass nodded dumbly and backed out of the building shoes crunching on the broken glass that littered the entrance into the night where the others waited one a man in his fifties who had been a highway patrolman before had his hands over his ears to shut out the tortured moans cass allowed herself to be led down the street away from the arco away from the beater nest away from the pulped matter that had once been human no one said anything bobby caught up with them a couple of blocks later he fell into step next to cass and stayed by her side until they were back at the library cass knew bobby had killed the hopeless victim but they never talked about it she had been a coward now given the chance to do it again she would have sliced the mans throat without hesitation and held what remained of his hand while he bled out was it courage she wondered as she slowly put her shirt back on and buttoned it or only loss that had numbed her or was it the effects of succumbing to and then beating the disease whatever the reason she had changed her whole body had seemed warm since she first awoke a matter of degrees maybeperhaps even fractions of a degreebut she would swear there was a difference her body was rebuilding itself relentlessly her immune system hypervigilant against infection the scabs on her arms had mostly healed now that she was clean and groomed she looked human enough that most people would think she was completely normal cass ran her fingers through her hair combing it as well as she could she had been called beautiful by a lot of people mostly men never mim who had reminded her often that she had inherited her fathers coloring which she called coarse he had mediterranean blood and like him casss skin darkened to olive her hair in between brown and blond mim herself was pale as parchment and jealously guarded her skin wearing big hats and sunscreen even for trips across town there had been nothing mim enjoyed more than reporting that she had run into some acquaintance whose crows feet and sunspots and blemishes had worsened bet they wish theyd done what i did shed smirk mim was dead of course she died with her skin as flawless and unlined as ever at the age of sixtyonebut cass supposed her storied beauty must have been marred by the red flush and frothing spittle that marked a blueleaf fever death at least shed been spared the other dying from the initial fever meant you never had to worry about becoming a beater cass folded the used cloth and laid it on the edge of the tub and returned to the bedroom smoke had made the bed but he was gone a flicker of panic flashed through cass before she heard talk coming from downstairs and she picked up her backpack and followed the voices the men were sitting in a tidy kitchen splashed with sun streaming in the upper third of the windows the bottom had been boarded up and there was a flap of fabriccovered plywood on hinges at the top that could be lowered to block the sun completely raised it let in sun but did not give a view to the outside cass paused in the hall listening she has enough to worry about smoke was saying she needs to know before yall just show up at the library lyle said softly them rebuildersthey dont take kindly to bein told no as i guess you know as well as anyone smoke muttered something that cass couldnt hear it dont matter lyle said you got to hear what im sayin here that storys made it all the way here hell its probably got around half the state rebuilders gaining ground every daythey aim to take over hell they want the valley the whole fuckin statewho knows folks are afraid they want someone to believe in and thats you which is all good but you got the girl with you now and maybe youre not the worst thing to happen to her see but she needs to know it aint gonna be easy cass stepped into the kitchen dont you think i know that whens the last time anything was ever easy mornin princess lyle said raising his glass of water in a mock toast cass saw that a glass had been poured for her as well and she sat in the chair closest to lyle not looking at smoke she wasnt ready to look at him yet the sensations of the night before still lingered on her skin but she could not afford to be distracted not with the hardest part of the trip still ahead good morning she said taking a drink from the glass the water was cloudy with tiny specks floating in it i boiled it lyle said gesturing at the kitchen counter on which plastic jugs full of water were lined up i get a fire going every few nights haul up water from the creek and set in a big batch i strain it get it as clean as i can its delicious cass lied really it tasted like nothing it was nothing nothing but sustenance even if it was swimming in bacteria her body would take from it what it needed and leave the rest she just had to maintain survive the nontaste of the liquid triggered a memory of a meeting one weeknight after shed done a double shift at the qikgo cass sat in the back of the meetings at first and participated as little as possibleuntil the day she couldnt leave the church basement because she knew that if she did she would get so drunk she might never recover that she would drink until the bottle fell from her fingers and she passed out she wanted to drink until she was dead she wanted to drink until everything was dead so instead she sat silent but trembling through the lunchtime meeting and then stayed in the room crying and sweating until the first person came back for the five oclock meeting by then she was lying on the carpet next to the wall her face pressed against the dirty rubber baseboards and it took two people to help her into a chair but she stayed the night cass was thinking about she had gone to the meeting after her double shift too tired to do anything but go through the motions she passed when it was her turn to speak she moved her lips when everyone else did but didnt listen to anyones stories until the end they stood they held hands they said the words take what you need and leave the rest take what you need and leave the rest just one sentence from the stupid thing they always repeated at the end of every meeting shed heard it dozens of times before it meant nothing only it kept going through her head as the other people in the room talked and smiled and sniffled and hugged what do i need she had asked herself it wasnt the stories not the burnt coffee or supermarket cookies or the company of these other people not the chanting or the handholding or the hugs which she had trained herself not to feel not the manuals and books and pamphlets and tokens there was nothing in the room she needed but when she left she had what she needed it was a puzzle like the ones shed once liked to do the riddles in her childhood i have no feet but i can runi am as big as an elephant but as light as a feather there is nothing here that i need what do i need thank you she told lyle then she forced herself to turn and look at smoke who was watching her warily his expression guarded thank you she forced herself to repeat though the words were like broken glass in her mouth they passed the day helping lyle move furniture around lyle had left thin strips of windows exposed along the top which let in enough light to see what they were doing his back was hurting from the effort of hauling them into the window the night before and he needed their help to set up the downstairs rooms in anticipation of the beaters next escalation in cunning they created barriers at all the points of entry into the house putting china cupboards in front of the boarded windows dismantling a dresser and nailing the pieces over the doors that left only the back door which had no glass panes that could be broken it had two sets of dead bolts installed since the start of the siege twice as they worked stumbling groups of afflicted came down the street their snorting and moaning could be heard even though the downstairs windows were shut tight the second time seven beaters milled across the street at the house where lyles friend travers was presumably still living when cass went to the upstairs bathroom she could see the beaters shuffling around the front lawn bumping into each other a pair lay down in a bed of kaysev growing in front of an ornamental stone bench one nibbling gently at the others arm it took a moment for cass to realize that the one being gnawed was lying still only a twitch of its leg now and then convincing her it wasnt dead do you have binoculars lyle cass asked lyle looked up from the coffee table whose legs he was sawing off he and smoke were planning to brace it along the bottom of a large window in the dining room that i do missy but are you sure theres anything out there you want a closer look at he asked i justjust for a quick look cass said she couldnt bring herself to say that their moans had been traveling straight through her skin and making her thrum with anxiety not knowing what they were up to was worse than the alternative lyle merely nodded and went to the kitchen he returned polishing a compact pair on his tshirt got these for hunting he said damn shame my wife made me keep my guns locked up at the cabin or we could take a few potshots and scare those suckers off magnified the beaters looked even worse than the few cass had seen on her journey on those occasions she had watched from hiding spots behind shrubs or rocks from a distance they looked merely unkempt and wounded their skin split and ragged in various states of injury and flensing but up close cass could see the large patches of skin that had been chewed down to tendon and muscle and bone one of the beaters no longer seemed to have the use of one of its arms which appeared to be missing several fingers and was gnawed nearly through at the elbow it had also apparently chewed away most of its lips and its ears were crusted black knobs where it or something else had torn the flesh away oh god cass breathed she moved the binoculars her hands shaking until she found the two of them on the ground and focused the one who was being chewed on was she saw now twitching spasmodically the remains of its chewed fingers jerking almost rhythmically she moved the binoculars up its thin tshirt clad body until its head came into view it too had suffered mutilationits own work or that of others impossible to know gouges in its neck and cheek were crusted with blood and its mouth was a gaping black hole it was nearly bald and its head was covered with scabs but it wasnt until cass moved the binoculars to take in the one crouched next to it that she understood what was happening the other beater had chewed through a vein or an arterysomething big anyway it was bleeding out nearly dead so far gone as to be indifferent to its fate both their faces and shirtfronts were covered in blood the others had noticed what was going on in the flower bed and were lurching over and crouching down next to their dying companion shoving each other out of the way whats going on lyle demanded and held out a hand for the binoculars he looked only for a few seconds before lowering them oh he said heavily theyll do that sometimes nowadays when they havent had any freshyou know when they havent caught anyone for a while the blood cass said weakly yeah well they dont prefer it but in a pinch i guess they get desperate cass remembered the times during the siege when shed seen one of the beaters whod been cut with a blade when someone managed to get close enough during an attack their own blood fascinated them it stopped them in their tracks even if they were seconds away from snagging a victim and they would let go of a persons arm or tshirt to stare at the blood as it ran from their bodies they would pat at it like a child with finger paints seemingly oblivious to pain spreading it around on their clothing and skin they would taste it and suck it off their fingers but tentatively not thirstily it was that fascination that sometimes saved people it was the reason the children had been taught to use the blades cut a beater deeply enough and it would bleed out like a citizen but even if the wound didnt kill it spilling its blood would distract it enough so you could get away it worked for a while it probably wouldnt work anymore but cass closed her fingers on the handle of the blade in her pocket anyway in the evening lyle lit candles there was canned soup and snack packs of oreo cookies the kind kids used to have in their school lunches the soup was cold but it tasted delicious afterward cass helped lyle with the dishes they were chipped stoneware with an ugly design of brown owls winking against an orange sun these dishes had no doubt been purchased by one of the wives whod come and gone strange to think about what people held on to what brought them comfort that thought was still in casss mind when she and smoke set out again after nightfall lyle shook smokes hand and gave her a hug a crushing lengthy one and told them they were always welcome and stood in his doorway watching them make their way down the street in casss pocket was a crystal suncatcher that shed stolen from lyles house it had been hanging in the window in what had once been the dining room she was sure that if shed asked he would have given it to her with his blessing but cass couldnt ask she had to steal she didnt know why and wondering wouldnt help it wasnt all that hard to keep the image of the beatersswarming across the street feasting on their dying comrades bloodout of her mind cass discovered because now all she could think about was ruthie cass held her blade in her hand as smoke held his they walked side by side down the center of the street it was a cool night and a few leaves had fallen from the sycamores lining the asphalt the sycamores had survived the bioattacks that had decimated so many of the trees of before cass had never cared for them because despite their vigorous spring leafing by late summer they grew dispirited and started to shed yellowed and drying leaves they seemed to cass to lack resolve now though she felt a kinship for them they too were survivors and that meant something cass traced their route in her mind three blocks down arroyo and then a right and a straight shot down second for a quarter mile or so before it deadended in the wide lawn in front of the library a few years ago there had been a fundraising campaign to remodel the place for new carpet and shelves and furniture new computers and an updated catalog and checkout system to pay for it all personalized bricks were sold and laid in a meandering walkway to the front door mim and byrn had bought bricks two of them one said gina and byrn orr the other ruthie haverford it hurt cass that her own name didnt appear on the bricks even though she wanted nothing from byrn and she herself was responsible for the chasm between her and her mother and it also hurt that they insisted on using haverford for ruthies last name because cass had changed her own last name to dollar legally the day she turned eighteen and so ruthies real name was ruthie dollar despite these hurts she knew exactly where the bricks were ruthie was only a baby when the walkway was put down but cass had brought her there in a stroller and showed her where hers was near an oleander hedge later cass held her little fingers and traced the shapes of the letters in her name she had been glad ruthie had a brick so that someday she could bring her friends and show them that she was someone cass thought about telling smoke about the brick but she wasnt sure what words would make him understand and she just wanted to get to ruthie her hands were hungry to touch her her arms longed to hold her her entire body felt infused with the frantic energy of longing for her baby she was alert to the sounds of the night listening for the wailing and snuffling that would signal that they had not been lucky enough she stayed close by smokes side her fingers in her pocket brushing against lyles crystal teardrop and her thoughts chased each other in circles as she tried to focus on her breathing the way that flight attendant in her meetings had constantly been harping about the woman carried with her an air of wounded resentment that made it hard to pay attention as she described how you were supposed to inhale hope and possibility and exhale expectations and disappointment and fear but now cass breathed with everything she had and after they had walked in silence for what felt like a hundred miles the library finally appeared ahead in the gloom we need to go around to the side cass said trying to cover up the dizzy combination of relief and anticipation that flooded through her at least thats where okay smoke said he matched her pace as she sped up barely able to keep herself from breaking into a run but then she stopped short several yards from the door apprehensive you have to knock she whispered when they see me they might think imyou know smoke put a gentle hand to her back cass youre cleaned up you look fine and in the dark your skin cass knew what he meant the wounds along her arm were faded even in the daylight but in the dark they would go unnoticed smoke ran his hand gently down the side of her face tilting her chin up so that she would have to look at him are you all right cass nodded but she didnt trust her voice to speak she led the way to the door but as she was about to knock it opened the woman standing inside held a flashlight hurry she whispered she stepped out of the way holding the door open just wide enough for them to pass cass and smoke slipped inside and the door shut with a heavy thud someone slid a heavy bolt into place as her eyes adjusted to the flashlights glow cass saw that four people were gathered in the small vestibule one of the men held a gun loosely at his side but as she scanned the others she realized that she knew one of them and her alarm lessened slightly elaineits me cass there was a moment of shocked silence and then a flash of recognition elaines eyes widening and her lips parting as though she was about to say casss name and then she didnt instead her expression shuttered but not before cass thought she saw her shake her head very slightly as she raised her arms to cross them in front of her chest do i know you she said elaine dont you casss bewilderment grew into something more confusion edged with cold fear she took another look at the other people in the room their tense posture their hard expressions my name is elaine she said elaine white maybe you took one of my yoga classes her gaze was hard and intent and cass hesitated uhmaybe i used to teach at the third street gym and i had one over in terryville on thursdays and saturdays saturday was such a big class i never knew everyones name but you look kind of familiar yeah cass said trying to gauge where elaine was trying to lead herand why elaine had been a yoga teacher a fact that cass learned during one of a dozen afterdinner conversations when the two of them had worked together washing and drying dishes and ordering the stores tasks reserved for those without children parents told bedtime stories and tucked their little ones in even aftertime leaving the others to fill the hours before sleep with stories of their past never talk of the future she knew that elaine had recently broken up with her boyfriend a man whod left his wife for her that shed had to take out a restraining order against him though hed disappeared early on in the troubles that she had to leave a roomsized loom behind when she came to the library that she missed weaving her blankets and shawls and table runners more than anything from before saturdays i took theuh sacred thread at tenthirty yes that one for a moment they regarded each other elaines mouth compressed in a thin line smoke standing close behind cassand then the man with the gun stepped forward gesturing with his free hand at the two of them all of this is very heartwarming he said in the flat voice of a transplanted midwesterner but your little reunion can wait arms out legs apart cass realized they were going to be searched and drew in a sharp breath shed made it this far and she couldnt risk being turned back now not before she got ruthie elaine i just need do what he says elaine snapped any trace of warmth drained from her voice maybe you were in my class maybe not we werent friends so dont expect me to treat you like we were but i only wanted shut up elaine growled and in the flickering glow of the bulb in the fixture tacked to the ceiling with builders staples cass saw her reach for her belt and knew what was coming even before the woman who had once been her friend produced a gun of her own and pointed it at her heart for a second cass felt like the breath had been knocked loose from her like she was plummeting into a black hole smoke took her arm and she tried to jerk it away she couldnt let this happen couldnt let elaine force her to reveal herself from the corner of her eye she saw a man one of the strangers draw a blade from his pocket and hold it at the ready the man with the gun raised it with a steady hand you dont understand she pleaded even as the others spread out warily in front of her and smoke elaine with whom she had made blackout curtains from heavy sheets of vinyl and a staple gun with whom she had shared the last of her imported tea exchanged a look with the armed man and cass realized that any advantage she had from knowing elaine before was gone trust was precious and easily lost aftertime then smoke did something that surprised her without letting go of her arm he stepped in front of her twisting so she had to double over to prevent him from breaking her wrist ill vouch for her he said voice steady and strong im known here my name is smoke ill wait if you likego ask the others i know you the man with the gun said surprised we raided together a couple of times im miles i remember smoke said you cut your hair yeah miles said and he lowered the gun but not all the way lookthings are different now its not the same its cass sensed the change in smoke already tense his body stiffened and he shifted so she was practically hidden behind him at the same time relaxing the grip he had on her wrist but he held on and she let him rebuilders he said heavily it was not a question theyre here elaine looked at the floor and miless expression changed it contained a warning there was a vote he said meaningfully and cass saw how he locked on smoke how he emphasized each word the other man the one who held a blade loosely in his fingers stepped forward and cass understood that he was the leader shed missed it because of the way hed blended into the shadows but now she realized hed been ready all along had been waiting and watching youre the one from the rock slide smoke drew himself up tall and cass slipped her arm from his grip he was protecting her but she saw now that the threat encompassed him too something was happening that she didnt understand but she pressed close to smokes side if there was aligning to be done she was committed i was at the rock slide that day smoke said his voice steel if you mean the day two innocent citizens died two innocents and a few assholes with too much power and not enough guts these are deadly times they didnt have to be not that day there were no beaters nearby beaters arent the only threat around cass glanced at elaine but she wouldnt meet her eyes she stood with her hands clasped in front of her and stared at the floor im not sure how you can say that friend smoke said seems to me that people are just trying to get by live to see tomorrow so you say but the way things are going those days are numbered rebuilders have a plan somebodys got to step up somebodys got to be in charge otherwise what you got you got anarchy and then your couple of deads gonna look like a bargain he turned his chin and spat on the floor looked back up with eyes blazing people die every day smokeor whatever your name really is some of us arent so scared were just gonna let it happen you ought to be thanking me and everyone else whos turning this sorry little camp into a place where you might just live another day yeah but at what cost smoke stared him down hard ill be dead before ill be your errand boyyours or anyone elses and next time you can be sure i wont stand by and let you take whats not yours only you might just not have a choice youre here on our hospitality you might want to remember that elaine looked up clearly uncomfortable with the direction things were going ease up calder youre not youre a guest of the rebuilders the man said his face coloring so he wasnt in charge of the whole placethere was someone else he reported to cass tried unsuccessfully to catch elaines eye the man pointed at smoke with his blade already turning to leave the room milescheck him elaine you check the girl then put them in the guest rooms put up your hands miles said uncomfortably im sorry i dont bear you no grudge smoke but ill do what i have to ill go you one better smoke said and set his pack on the floor then he slid his shirt off and tossed it to miles who nearly dropped it smoke could have taken his gunthey all knew it instead he turned the pockets of his pants inside out setting his blade carefully on the floor and turned slowly arms in the air theres another blade in the pack provisions thats it cant take your word for it smoke shrugged and took a stance legs shoulderwidth apart arms out then do what you need to do boy ill take her in the bathroom and check her there elaine said she can leave her pack here nobody contradicted her miles approached smoke cautiously and began to pat him down elaine tilted her head toward a door still marked with the symbol of the womens restroom come on cass felt a sudden frantic reluctance to be separated from smoke which was stupid seeing as just days ago shed been completely alone and preferred it that way smoke seemed to read her thoughts ill be fine ill see you inside once our friends figure out were no kind of threat he made it sound like a promise cass swallowed down her panic she nodded and followed elaine forcing herself not to look back inside the bathroom the only light came from elaines lantern so when she stopped abruptly cass ran into her stumbling and then elaine clapped a hand over her mouth and shook her head hard mouthed words dont say anything only when cass nodded did elaine let her go sorry about this she said her tone giving away only a trace of anxiety things got a little tense in there but its for everyones safety lets just get the search over with and we can start over can you take off those clothes please when cass started to answer elaine put a finger to her lips and pulled a stub of pencil and a scrap of paper from her pocket she set the lantern down and smoothed the paper on the counter cass reluctantly started undressing while she watched elaine write play along they listen cass mouthed the word who but elaine only shook her head and stabbed her finger on the paper until cass nodded again when she reached for the pencil elaine didnt stop her cass wrote with a trembling hand her fingers slick on the pencil ruthie elaine looked at the paper and then at cass for a long momenttoo long and cass knew even before elaine shook her head cass felt her knees start to go weak her heart constricting with a sharp ache a cry escaped her lips a truncated sound of grief and elaine reached for her before she could fall cass didnt resist couldnt resist her vision fluttering and when elaine pressed her face close and whispered in her ear she almost didnt hear shes alive get your shit together or you wont be able to help her cass staggered back adrenaline surging through her body she clawed at her shorn hair ground the heels of her hands into her eye sockets took a breath where she mouthed but elaine looked away your shirt please turn out the pockets cass started unbuttoning the shirt a dozen thoughts racing through her head ruthie alivebut not here the library taken over by rebuilders people taking up arms not against the beaters but against one another smoke involved in things she didnt understand she took off the shirt turning out the pockets as elaine had asked there had to be a way to find out more she handed over the shirt and reached for the pencil again but elaine stopped her come on she said briskly quit wasting time get the rest of your clothes off but she started to write again and cass stripped off her pants as she worked okay socks too and hand me your shoes cass did as she was told then hesitated can i keep my she pointed at her underwear she already felt almost unbearably exposed elaine nodded yes but take your undershirt off you can keep your bra on so she was going to have to reveal herself her wounds well they wouldnt be any surprise to elaine she had been there on the last day shed seen it all even the part cass couldnt remember elaine and a woman named barbara had been chatting inside the open door that day when cass and ruthie went down the pathonly a little way down the pathto enjoy the spring sunshine elaine and barbara had screamed when the beaters appeared out of nowhere maybe elaine could tell her what happened after casss memories went blank slowly she lifted the shirt over her head and then she turned letting elaine see she heard elaine gasp and then silence after a moment she turned back around elaine stared at her with wide eyes her face gone pale she picked up the piece of paper and handed it over then turned her attention to the rest of casss clothes busied herself going through them searching the seams and pockets ruthie was saved but we sent her to the convent when the rebuilders came with the rest of the girls i will try to keep you safe but you have to trust me cass read the words twice a third time ruthie was saved ruthie was saved but there were more questions so many more questions she held out her hand for the pencil but elaine shook her head and handed her clothes back taking the piece of paper from cass okay get dressed she said whats going to happen to me now cass asked as elaine tore the paper in half then in half again and again same as every other newcomer elaine says youll be processed in moments she had a pile of tiny shreds she scooped them carefully into her hands and dropped them into a toilet that was clogged with debris floating in murky water as elaine led her from the bathroom cass remembered the sound of a toilets flush a homely sound that she had heard a million times in her life but would never hear again they let them stay but only after the tribunal cass followed elaine through empty halls past the conference room and cass glimpsed lists and maps and machine diagrams tacked on the walls where there had once been childrens drawings she saw smoke sitting at the large conference table next to a heavyset man in a camoprinted shirt elaine saw where cass was looking and nodded briskly thats skiv she said hell make your case hell advocate for you cass wanted to ask what the hell they needed an advocate for and how a total stranger could possibly do the job but she was caught off guard by the transformation of the conference room when she lived here they had pushed the table against a wall moved the chairs to the edges and used the center of the room as a play area for the children a place where parents could relax and share child care now the windows had been partially covered only the top third exposed to let light in the room and the furniture had been centered in the room once again one end of the table had been set up with pads of paper and pens and a coffee cup arranged with military precision smoke and the man named skiv sat at the other end smokes hands were out of sight under the table and cass wondered if they were bound elaine led her to one of the small windowless offices down the hall from the conference room take a good look around she said because when i lock the door you wont have any light youre locking me in its the procedure elaine said dont worry its standard everyone who comes here from outside even if theyre known to someone here they have to stay in these rooms until they figure out what to do with them what to do with them whether they can staywhether they support the rebuilders she shook her head a very small motion that held a warning what exactly are the rebuilders she demanded in a fierce whisper hasnt smoke told you hes like the look that passed over elaines face was part incredulity and part admiration but she frowned and glared into the sparsely furnished room his actions against the rebuilders are wellknown she wasnt going to give cass any information it seemed unlikely but maybe others were listening even here cass entered the small room and did as elaine told her looking around and trying to memorize the rooms features a mattress on the carpeted floor made up with relatively clean linens and a pillow a bucket a plastic jug of water pushed into a far corner where she wouldnt trip over it and spill it the walls were bare but there were holes in the drywall where pictures or bulletin boards had once hung and cass had a flashmemory of a cheerful space decorated with pictures of a laughing family a dog with a frisbee a plaque decorated with flowers and the words blessed are the poor in spirit its like i never lived here at all she said softly touching a gash in the drywall where something had been ripped free elaine handed back her pack i kept the can opener and your blades she said but youll get them back when you leave assumingwell you know she left the room and while cass waited for the click of the lock and the light to disappear she wondered what her alternatives were it sounded like being released sent out to fend for themselves was the best she and smoke could hope for but first she had to find out what and where this convent was she turned it over in her mind trying to remember if there was anything in the mountains that could be called a convent there were churches a catholic elementary schooland why would they have sent the girls away what threat did the rebuilders pose for children there were too many questions cass needed to talk to smoke maybe he knew what elaine was talking about clearly there were things hed been holding back whatever happened at the rock slide for instance she had to have faith in him a prospect that felt far more tenuous than mere hope but there was no one else to trust no one to depend on maybe elaine would returnmaybe she would bring more information with any luck elaine would tell her where to go and they would be allowed to leave while it was still dark it couldnt be much past midnight they could make shelter by morning if they could manage to get out of town and use the darkness for cover assuming their next shelter hadnt already fallen to the rebuilders assuming they could leave behind the things smoke had done cass shivered if she believed the others it meant smoke had killed what did she know about him really theyd shared a night she wasnt sure she wanted to remember hed come with herall right he didnt have to do that but on the other hand maybe he was already on the run maybe he knew it was only a matter of time until he would be held accountable for what hed done and what about you the voice inside her nagged cass knew there was no point in trying to ignore it she had been on the run most of her life smoke had accepted her trusted her even without knowing all of her storyeven with the way she looked her filth her wounds even after what shed done to sammi in the back of her mind shed been considering trying to sneak out alone if she could find out where the convent was unlike smoke she had never challenged the rebuilders with elaines help maybe she could gain their trust convince them to help her find ruthie they had weapons power and information but she knew that she would be killed if the rebuilders found out shed been attacked and if there were still others here from before people who recognized her who remembered her it would be impossible to keep that a secret besides she wouldnt get far without smokeshe needed help if she was going to stand a chance at survival given how much more organized the beaters had become alone in the unpopulated areas was one thing but up here in the mountains the roads were dotted with clusters of houses and that meant beaters and there was something else she also owed smoke for giving her a chance if nothing elseit was more than anyone had done for her in a very long time cass sank down onto the mattress she sat with her legs crossed and listened hard but the only sound was her own breathing after what seemed like a very long time she tapped gently on the walls on either side of her in case smoke had been brought to the next room but there was no response a little later she lay down thinking she might as well get some rest in case she and smoke were going to be made to leave but a few minutes later the door opened it was miles the man whod held the gun on them come with me he said impassively she followed him down the hall to the conference room she was ready to duck her head and cover her face if they encountered anyone hoping her haircut would disguise her but the halls were empty if there were people here they were in the main rooms of the library the stacks and the classrooms the kitchen and the courtyard the administrative area seemed to be reserved for those in charge in the conference room there was no sign of skiv smoke sat alone opposite two men and a woman dressed in basic khaki shortsleeved shirts and fatigue pants sit here miles said pointing at the seat next to smoke and then he took up a position at the door watching the room with his hand resting lightly on his gun belt smoke gave her a penetrating look not smiling but his hand brushed her leg under the table im evangeline the lone woman said she sat between the others a commanding presence cass figured her for the leader her light brown hair tinged with silver was pulled into a severe ponytail she wore no jewelry but she had a blueblack tattoo above one wrist bone a fat tight spiral she saw cass looking at her wrist and held it up for her to examine the koru symbol of renewal from the maori i understand youve beenaway that was putting it mildly and cass was tempted to roll her eyes but there was something dangerous about the woman and she merely nodded yes well the koru is the symbol of the rebuilders smoke made a sound of barely suppressed anger im lost cass said im sorry its like you all think i know things that i dont who exactly are the rebuilders just what it sounds like the man on evangelines left said his facial hair had been carefully shaved to a very thin line along his jaw something that would be difficult under any circumstances but far harder in aftertime with its scarcity of grooming aids were rebuilding were taking whats left after the rest of the world tried to bring our country to its kneesthe raw materials the resources the peopleand were building it back into a civilization we who smoke demanded all i see is half a dozen folks with guns and a few dozen more without any were armed because we have to be evangeline said as long as there are people like you aroundmurderers and insurrectionists but there are many more of us as you well know for every nut who wants to be davy crockett theres fifty who know that communitys built on strong leadership im no murderer smoke said i was acting to prevent more violence which i should point out we had very little of until you people showed up we know a lot about you the other man the one who hadnt yet spoken said he was an unremarkable man of average height and small eyes the most interesting thing about him in fact was how entirely without expression his face was as though nothing that had happened in his life had made a lasting impression smoke or should i call you edward eddy ted am i close if you know so much about me smoke said tightly then i should think you know the answer he chuckled a dry scratchy sound okay got me there big guy edward schaffer while were at it im cole and thats nyland pleased to make your acquaintance youre a man of many accomplishments i was a coach a counselor nothing more more rough amusement youre far too modest ed i mean smoke got to admit im torn here i dont really get this renaming shit like after the siege suddenly everyones hatching out of eggs all over again way i see it were all the same as when we went in just the dice got rolled a little different this time around for some of us he picked up a pencil and tapped it on the table i know who you used to work for buddy he said softly and we all know what they did a lot of people suffered but theres a chance to make things right for the ones who are still here a time for justice maybe cass looked back and forth between the men trying to understand who had smoke worked for what had he done coles an idealist evangeline said im more of a practical person an opportunist you might say and ill be honest with youwhen you two showed up tonight i saw an opportunity to take a strong and public stand against insurrection smoke made a sound in his throatdisgust contemptand his hand tightened on casss leg she sensed that many of his emotions battled for prominencebut fear was not among them you were of no interest to me evangeline continued staring directly at cass but in the last half hour that has changed and now you are far far more interesting than anything else that has happened in a long while cass blinked trying to maintain eye contact with the woman but evangelines words chilled her can you guess why evangeline asked her very softly cass could guess dread collected like dew in her mind the words echoing and reverberating interesting far more interesting she ran her fingers through what was left of her hair tugging at the ends wanting to wrap them around her face hide herself from scrutiny had elaine sold her out had her old friend been tortured into it or rewarded you think im cass whispered hating her voice for shaking i know what you are ive seen it before and i know what to look for i can tell from your eyesand the way your hair is growing in and theres only one way you get marks like you have on your arms let me see before cass could stop her evangeline seized her arm and ran her strong cold hands up and down the surface fingertips tracing the faded scars the touch was intimate far too familiar and cass reacted with revulsion she wanted to yank back her hand she wanted to run she wanted to wipe the traces of evangelines touch from her skin have you ever met another one like you evangeline asked unable to contain a jittering hint of excitement cass hesitated others like her those who had been attacked bitten infectedand lived was it possible how long had it been that she felt alone since she carried her shame with her like a skin what do you mean outliers evangeline said her lips curving into a perfect chilly smile people like you who survived an attack who got better who fought off the infection so it was true disbelief mixed with wild hope as cass allowed herself to consider the possibility just knowing there were othersthey could all be like her weakened damagedbut still she would not be alone the idea was intoxicating im not saying i believe you buthow could anyone do that she asked trying to keep her enthusiasm hidden evangelines smile grew broader she knew she had won nobody knows she said not yet anyway but our people are working on it theyre studying people like you working on developing a vaccine that isnt possible smoke said flatly dont listen to this cass who are you to say whats possible evangeline demanded raising her voice fury twisting her mouth how far have you traveled do you even know whats happening outside this town this county i thought you people didnt use the word county anymore smoke said meeting evangelines anger with his own he had gone very still next to cass his energy coiled and tense i thought you believed those designations were meaningless aftertime evangelines fine skin flushed a faint pink and she glared at smoke the others in the room waited eyes on their leader at last she gave a small nod youre right of course smoke land divisions from before they dont make much sense anymorebut thatll change do you have the faintest idea whats going on at the borders the borders the borders are a myth smoke snapped blueleaf crossed the state line the first time a strong wind came up and you get one beater with a bad sense of direction hell be up to oregon or down to mexico and never know the difference you have no idea evangeline said softly drawing out the words enjoying them were less than sixty miles from the nevada border as the crow flies if theyd armed it wed know evangeline laughed a rich throaty laugh full of pleasure whats so funny cass demanded itsits not funny its sad really evangeline said wiping a mirthful tear from the corner of her eye sad in so many wayssad that even intelligent people like the two of you can be so naive smoke tightened his hands to fists and laid them on the table his jaw worked with fury as he leaned forward closing the distance between him and evangeline say what you mean he muttered oh all right fine evangeline said almost poutingas though he had knocked down a game of checkers the border isnt california its the rockies all the way down to the colorado river theyve cut off half the fucking country cass held her breath it wasnt possible the rockiesin her mind she called up the map from her high school geography textbook the west laid out in shades of sienna and gold and peach and russet california stretching all the way down to the baja peninsula up to washington and oregon idaho nevada utah arizonathousands and thousands of miles stretching out to the pacific ocean to the west and the mountains to the east no one could contain that no matter how many fences they built no matter how many volunteers they armed how many mines they laidcould they and not with the american government effectively gone i dont believe you smoke said but there was the faintest trace of doubt in his voice believe or dont believe evangeline shrugged now that right there thats the true enemy of the future ignorance indifference failure to adapt as opposed to wild theories and fearmongering trading on peoples loss and grief to justify smoke gestured around him including the others in the roomthe guns the library the hidden citizens all of this evangeline folded her arms across her chest and narrowed her eyes youre starting to bore me i thought we could engage in a little intelligent discourse but youre nothing more than anan agitator you didnt fool skiv you know fool him what are you talking about with your whole they fired first defense that wasnt a defense thats the truth smoke cut her off there are people who survived that day who can tell you the real storysome living here at least they were unless youve thrown them out for agitating as you call it youll be taken down to colima tomorrow evangeline continued on as though he hadnt spoken to the detention camp until they can schedule your trial although it might be a while seeing as there are a few other more pressing issues on folks minds you ought to like it thoughfrom what i hear its full of people like you she gave him a smile flicking out her tongue to lick her lips enemies of progress smoke what is she talking about cass demanded in a whisper everyone could hear but she didnt care the panic that had lodged in her gut was escalating smoke shook his head slowly not taking his eyes off evangeline sounds like theyve built themselves a jail he said softly what does that say about your new societyyouve built jails and an army first weve built a community evangeline snapped and a research center in the university hospital weve got the best of the best working down there were the only hope for the future and people know it you think were forcing people to stay here she waited but no one said anything anyone can leave anytime they want we held a vote the people here had the option to choose to go it alone of course we offered protection resourcesbetter facilities cleaner water and when we do develop the vaccine our people will get it first she focused her gaze on cass with distaste it will be quite a while before we have enough for anyone living outside our control you arent developing a vaccine smoke muttered theres no waythe equipment the intellectual capital the infrastructure none of that survived they took it outall of it berkeleys a fucking smoking hole in the ground stanford got leveled they knew where the research was going on and bombed the shit out of it i think youve said enough evangeline said you speak from ignorance and i want to talk to your girlfriend now not you nyland keep him in line the man with the thin beard stepped forward gripping a handheld wand with prongs at the end cass realized with dismay that it was a taser dont believe them smoke said not bothering to lower his voice no matter what happens promise me that cass cass gave him a small nod wondering how she was supposed to know who to trust evangeline watched her with cold interest let me lay out the future for you sister im not your sister cass snapped there was something not right about evangeline some realignment of emotions that crackled under the surface a tightly controlled mania evangeline smiled and suddenly cass realized that she was actually very beautiful if she were capable of a genuine smile shed be stunning of course you are an only child an orphan now your father left the family long ago and your mother i extend my condolences of course the fact that so many have been lost doesnt lessen anyones individual pain we recognize that fear shivered its way down casss spine how did evangeline know so much about her and what about ruthiethe one detail she hadnt mentioned elaine of course it had to be she tried to remember what she and elaine had talked about during the long hours theyd spent together in those early days in the library of course they must have exchanged life stories elaine cass searched her memory trying to dredge up what the woman had told her shed been a gym teacher at an elementary schoolshed been dating another teacher but shed broken off the engagement earlier in the year and thats when she opened her yoga studio she had cats two cats a white one and a striped onethere had been a photo yesshe remembered elaine showing her the photo her voice trembling when she described her cats which had gone missing shortly after the attack on domesticated fowl when suddenly everyone became a hunter oh and she had a younger brother with problems some sort of problems that had landed him in a group home in oakland so it was possible even cass whod lost several weeks of her life had been able to dredge up those details it was well within the bounds of possibility that elaine had been able to tell evangeline the things she knew the question waswhy how had they gotten the information out of her here in this room with the three strangers staring at her and smoke cass had no trouble believing they would do whatever it took to get what they wanted but elaine hadnt told them about ruthie why you cant stay here evangeline continued if people know you returned after the attacktheres a lot of ignorance a lot of fear you wouldnt betolerated well we wouldnt be able to guarantee your safety down in colima we have scientists we have a way to explain things in terms people can understand and we have the others like you if there are others how come ive never seen them before cass demanded how come no one has evangeline shrugged simple unfortunate circumstances our people think that as many as one or two in every hundred citizens is immune an outlier its nothing new theres a similar phenomenon with other infectious diseaseshiv malaria even parkinsons only to recover you actually have to survive an attack or live through blueleaf fever and as you know its become a lot harder to do that cass knew once people realized where the fever led they stopped caring for the infected those who didnt take their own lives were turned out on the streets or even killed if their loved ones could stomach the job were getting close to a blood test evangeline continued soon well be able to tell whos an outlier and who isnt but we need people like you for that people for the studies and thats why were going to give you safe passage to colima she studied cass one eyebrow raised youll never make it on your own theres very little cover in the central valley and the townswell i dont need to tell you but weve got a team headed down there day after tomorrow and you can go with them well outfit you get you a better blade food water first aid suppliesand youll go by truck by truck cass do you understand me just like in the old days you understand that we cannot give you a gun but your escort will be armed well armed at this the man called nyland smiled guns were about as easy to come by as fresh meat theyd been the first thing people hoarded along with water and batteries but it had been amazing how quickly they changed hands when people were stupid enough to use them the outcome of any armed situation was generally that one person ended up dead and the other added a weapon to his stash which didnt much matter until people started hiding their weapons stores the government had issued a call for an arms surrender when street violence exceeded the capacity of the forces left to contain it but no one knew what theyd done with the few weapons people were willing to part with there was no doubt that there was plenty of firepower to be had only most of it was securely hidden away its owners dead or infected most houses raided early on it had been casss vague hope as she walked all those recent days to find a hidden stash she wouldnt be greedy a small handgun ample ammunitionthats what she hoped to find she knew how to shoot shed shot cans and paper targets nailed to trees in the fields at the edge of town with her father for a few years before he left but she would use the gun only for selfdefense or to get ruthie shed do whatever it took to get ruthieand beyond that she had no plan at all but she was no closer to ruthie now than shed been before unless the convent was also in colimawhich seemed unlikelyshe needed to find a way to escape the plans evangeline was making for her and she needed smokes help mr schaffers fate is of no concern to you evangeline said as if reading her thoughts he has things to answer for hes a good man cass protested surprising herself knowing that arguing with them was pointless besides smoke was nothing to her her companion for less than fortyeight hours a quick hand job and a little relief in the dark a man shed used and whom if she remembered him at all in the future would be only a footnote in her journey whatever you think he did fucker knows what hes done nyland said a flush creeping over his face and cass realized that it was personal for this one he had lost something or someone by smoke nothing that didnt need doing smoke bit off the words hard the guy stood so fast that cass didnt have a chance to react knocking over the glass of water on the table in front of him and his fist connecting with smokes face made a sound that was louder than cass would have thought it ought to be but smoke said nothing even when blood dripped from the cut under his eye and onto the table he barely reacted at all they were led to separate offices and cass spent the night in the room with the bed on the floor she slept fitfully until the door opened and a woman she hadnt seen before filled the doorway she was thin and muscular in a hooded jersey and shorts and hiking sandals and she said very little her face partially obscured by the hood which she had pulled over her curly brown hair im here to take you to the bathroom then i will take you to the courtyard where you will be served a meal then youll come back here they walked through empty halls toward the back of the library steps echoing on the tiled floors sheer drapes covered the tall windows looking out onto the parking lot the fabric was not substantial enough to block light but it prevented cass from seeing much pinned to the fabric were handlettered posters with slogans like vigilance report every sighting and equal shares for equal work and curfew means you the outdoor bathroom located in the shed enclosure where the trash dumpster had been kept before wasnt very different from when cass had lived in the library the makeshift panels separating the mens and womens sides had been replaced by sheets of plywood joined by sturdy steel braces the roof now corrugated metal a curtain hung from a shower rod lent privacy the pots they had used before had been replaced by a toilet with a removable insert that could be hauled away to be emptied and cleaned casss escort handed her a bowl of water basic toiletries take ten minutes ill wait inside was a makeshift shower with a water reservoir operated by a rope pull cass undressed turning her back toward the plywood wall before she took off her shirt even though she was alone then she released the water and shivered as it trickled down onto her body in a cold uneven trickle she took as long as she dared scrubbing her hair and skin with the sliver of soap shed been given before rinsing with the frigid water from the tank she dried herself with the stiff scratchy towel the woman had given her and pulled on her clothes she brushed her teeth and spat on the drainage hole and combed her hair with her fingers she folded the toiletries up into the damp towel and left them in a plastic basket on a teak bench and when she emerged from the shower the woman was leaning against the enclosures cinder block wall arms folded across her chest but when she stood straight and pushed back her hood cass stopped abruptly in her tracks it was elaine she was wearing the same clothes as the other woman but her face was unmistakable in the bright light of the new day what hush elaine whispered and pulled the hood forward covering her face walk with me and keep your voice down cass stared straight ahead and concentrated on keeping her expression neutral as they walked back through the stillquiet building elaine pushed open the door to the courtyard and they walked into the sunlight the smell of kaysev and wild onion drifting on the morning breeze a paper cup skittered and rolled across the concrete but otherwise nothing moved on an ordinary day when cass lived here there were people in the courtyard all the time children chasing each other adults drying clothes washed in the earliest light of dawn in the creek or preparing kaysev or scrubbing dishes in the tubs of water they carried back or simply sitting in chairs dragged into the sun talking but now the residents rose and slept and bathed and ate on a schedule set by the rebuilders the courtyards layout was different too arranged for greatest efficiency tables had been organized in neat rows with plastic chairs plates and bowls and cutlery were stacked on shelves a tarp had been rigged to cover them but today in the good weather the tarps were rolled up and tied the fire pit had undergone the biggest transformation of all it was now a sturdy brickandmortar structure that rose a mans height off the ground with a chimney twice that tall and a series of racks and hooks to hold food and pots above the flames we have five minutes elaine said in a low voice biting off the words exercise time walk with me but dont look at me look at the ground keep a steady pace and keep your voice down she led the way along the edge of the courtyard striding ahead with her hands clenched into fists at her sides nothing like the easygoing yoga teacher cass had known before tell me everything you can about ruthie please elaine cass pleaded as she caught up i have to know i have to go get her elaine glanced at her cass saw only the shadow of her features concealed under the hood theyre sending you to colima tomorrow cass she sighed dont you understand and you need to count yourself lucky where theyre sending smoke is way worse ill find a way cass said ill get away from themill runill thats suicide elaine interrupted dont even talk that way ive been on my own for weeks out there i can do it again besides if i dont have ruthie i dont have anything cass swallowed down the lump forming in her throat i might as well be dead i said dont talk that way elaine said angrily im put ting my ass on the line for you here because we were friends becausebecause i thought you were strong strong enough if youre going to give up theres no reason for me to be here okay okay cass said hastily im sorry look just tell me where ruthie is and illill be careful i wont do anything to get you in trouble or any of the others i promise elaine walked silently for a few moments before speaking when she did her voice was softer almost tentative all right ill tell you what i know but you have to understand theres no guarantee thattheres just no guarantees cass thought ruthiesmall hand in hers dimpled knees and cheek so soft she could kiss it a hundred times a thousandand pushed the panic away pushed it with all her might fine when we found out the rebuilders were cominga scout came first so we knewwe sent all the girlsevery female under sixteento the convent the convent cass remembered the words in elaines hasty scrawl in the bathroom what is itlike a church elaine laughed without humor not like any church youve ever seen like a cult i guess i dont really know no ones been in it once you go in you dont come out no one i know about anyway where is it its up in san pedro elaine said san pedro not too far from sykes where sammis dad was maybe fifteen miles to the south the girls heartshaped face her wide gold eyes flashed through casss minda promise she should never have madebut she didnt have time to dwell on the girl now thats forty miles from here elaine nodded its in the old miners stadium theyve taken over the whole damn thing apparently who thesewomen theyre like i dont know fundamentalists i guess sort of christianbut they have a lot of their own beliefs kind of whackedout is what i hear into some strange rituals and shit like that and you sent the children there cass tried and failed to keep the accusation from her voice you sent ruthie yes we did elaine said turning to face cass headon and in a trick of the light a bright beam from the sun that had just crested the roof of the library her face was fully illuminated and cass saw the network of fine lines around her eyes the deep groove between her eyebrows the evidence of the toll the weeks had taken on this woman who had once been her friend and you would have too because no matter what theyre doing with the girls at the convent what the rebuilders do is far worse what do you mean cass asked the world falling away from her the air sucked from her throat what were they going to do to my baby my darling the person id die for no one knows cass dont lose your shit here no one really knows elaine stared straight ahead sped up her pace swung her arms as though she was racing against herself but there were rumors what rumors quiet elaine snapped reaching for casss arm she dug her sharp fingernails into the soft flesh of her wrist kept digging until tears sprang to casss eyes and she finally reluctantly nodded look you cant put too much stock in this we dont really know whats going down in colima they keep us in the dark you know they have their propaganda just tell me all right the vaccine they were talking about you know against the fever no one really thinks they can do that but what they are trying to do is develop a test to see if youre immune or not and people say theyre close but what does that have to do with the children they say theyre taking the kids and testing them first the outliers are going to be raised together down there kind of a superresistant colony get it theyre going to get the best of everythingfood medicine whatever it takes theyre being raised drinking the rebuilder koolaid but what happens to the ones who arent no one knows but it cant be good right cass felt her blood go cold what do you mean look cass theyre zealots they use everything twist everything for their purpose i think some of them are even glad before is gone gives them a chance to reshape the world in their image i mean theyre not going to waste an opportunity just because it goes against what regular people think of as unacceptable what elaine just say it the rumor is theyre putting the rest of the kids to work the ones who are old enough theyre sending them out on raiding parties into the buildings first places an adult cant or wont go they probably have them washing dishes and emptying latrines and carrying water the things no one else wants to do the slave labor jobs cass felt faint with dismay but the babies who knows cass infirmary or cradle camp or something come on theyre not going to let them starve but you can bet they arent getting much attention probably just enough so they grow up to join the labor pool cass slowed her body going numb with the horror of it but elaine did not slow down after a moment cass had to jog a little to catch up you could be wrong about all of it i mean you yourself said you dont know youre right elaine said i could be wrong you want to take that chance you think any mother here wanted to take that chance thats why we sent the ones away that we could their own children look cass you havent seen the others you wouldnt recognize them you want to know why i got this job why im a trusted member of the team around here the sarcasm in her voice was painful to hear because i didnt fall apart like some of the others the parents do you want to know how many suicides weve had since then noyou dont trust me you dont the convent would only take the girls the families with boys they she shook her head went silent cass walked beside her making almost an entire lap both of them lost to their thoughts the boys went with the rebuilders cass finally said the girls went to the convent yes thats what ive been telling you and you need to be grateful maybe they have to listen to jesus talk morning noon and night maybe they practice witchcraft or worship phases of the moon does it really matter theyre safe theyre safe enough for now cass and thats enough thats all we have anymore but why didnt the parents go with them the mothers at leastif they allow women the convent refused elaine said only the children the convent takes new acolytes sometimes but only the ones they feel are called they wouldnt take the mothers because they said they werent called to join but the girls were still innocents so they could their leader this woman they have she makes all these decisions i dont know maybe she reads tea leaves or whatever but she sent the word down they took eleven girls ruthie was the youngest the oldest was fifteen ruthie given away againhow many times in her short life had she been passed along to strangers cass felt the guilt and grief encroaching and gritted her teeth so hard her head pounded when did they take them almost three weeks ago after the scout camethey took them the next morning who can i talk to them maybe she could find out more about the convent maybe they could tell her how to get in who to talk to how ruthie had done on the journey if she was frightened or sad if someone had been there to take care of heranything anything at all no cass elaine snapped dont you get what a risk im taking just talking to you i just wanted you to know the best thing for everyone is for you to go tomorrow go down to colima be gratefullet them do their experiments and feed you and take care of you and forget all about ruthie her voice broke at the end in a little choked sob and cass put a hand on her arm forcing her to stop elaine shrugged it off yanking her wrist back and rubbing furiously at her eyes what cass demanded what is it nothing elaine mumbled nothing okay only dont you thinkdont you knowcan you really elaine looked wildly around and then cass realized that her old friend longed to bolt to leave cass standing there that only a sense of duty and fears about being watched kept her rooted to the spot she was acting as thougha thought occurred to cass she had been gone two months two months was a long time especially aftertime time enough to grow attached to someone you took care of her didnt you she said softly you took care of ruthie elaine wouldnt meet her eyes someone had to you werent here ohelaine cass said i didnt know im sorry imthank you how can i ever thank youall that time and iif you hadnt been here for heri got here as fast as i could you have to know that but you werent here after it happened after i was attacked i know elaine and i no elaine spat no not you you werent here for her after she was dread bloomed in casss gut oh godno not that when she was attacked god damn it cass dont pretend you dont remember elaine spoke in a furious whisper i saw you watching i saw you screaming when it happened the whole time when they were dragging you offyou were screaming her name and i dont remember cass said half pleading half begging i dont elaine made a sound in her throat a gasp of choked fury how many people are going to suffer for you how many cass what do you mean elaine looked at her for a long moment the anger slowly draining from her face leaving her pale and tired looking what do you mean cass repeated whispering trembling she let go of elaines arm im sorry elaine said after a moment she had resumed the same stoic look that had apparently gotten her through the turbulent weeks past i shouldnt havei know youve suffered too i was out of line she started walking again trudging more slowly than before cass kept pace as they made a second pass around the courtyard please just tell me she begged i swear to you i dont remember anything afterafter i saw them coming after the first one got to me i remember throwing myself on top of ruthie because the beaters had been loping and lurching colliding with each other tripping over each other in their mad rush to reach her and she had covered ruthie as well as she could pushing her down wishing she could send ruthie into the ground where she could be cradled and protected by the earth itself elaine sighed her shoulders slumping well youthey got to you andtook you four of them cass nodded by then the beaters had worked out a system they didnt fall upon their victims in the street anymore they took them back to their nests where they could devour them in peace four beaters each took a persons arm or leg and then they hauled their victim away taking care to keep their quarry from dragging on the ground oblivious to their screams and then there were two left and then bobby came running out bobby cass racked her brain trying to remember elaine at the door with a group of women talking in the sunshine but bobby had he been there he heard you screaming he ran out of the library elaine went on you wouldnt stop screaming ruthies name and he ran to you everyone was yelling at himbut it was like he didnt hear them like he didnt care he was almost all the way to where you were when you i what i what you were being dragged but you were holding on to ruthie and you screamed at him to take her cass widened her eyes incredulous but that means he did he got her elaine said quietly he fought hard he got between them and ruthie even though they werethey bit him he held them off long enough for us to come and get her barbara and me we waited until they were focused on him and then we ran and got her and they took him away no cass he was able to run when the beaters saw us they let go of him for a second and he got away everyone ran we carried ruthie back inside andand bobby ran to the creek to the creek why would he go to the creek he didnt stop there cass he followed it down to the cliffs a sick understanding dawned in casss mind the full horror of what had happened the cliffs a mile down as it wound past the edge of town the creek widened and formed a deep pool rimmed with packeddirt banks and cattails on one side and limestone cliffs on the other they rose hundreds of feet into the air pitted and carved by the elements in the water below lay broken rockstrewn shelves of shale on sunny days cass used to take a beach towel and a pail full of toys and lie on the banks swatting at mosquitoes and watching ruthie try to catch the frogs sunning themselves on the rocks he jumped elaines voice had gone flat they found his body the next day on the rocks he died cass whispered bobby died saving ruthie how many people are going to suffer for you was that why she couldnt remember was it guilt she hadnt been able to save ruthie she hadnt been able to save anyone you said she was attacked she said ruthie did theyi mean bobby got there so fast elaine said she had scratches but they could have come from when you threw her down or from the ground thats what we told ourselves anyway after we lost both you and bobby in one daywell no one wanted to believe we were going to lose her too and then she took a deep breath and looked off into the distance where the sun was starting to climb higher above the tops of the dead trees were out of time she said i need to get you back before group one comes out no cass said tell me the rest you have to tell me the rest fine but im making it quick so dont interruptseriously she started cutting across the center of the courtyard toward the doors back inside the building ruthie was fine for almost a day and then she got the fever and her eyeswell you know some people wanted toyou know put her out but she was just a baby we couldnt do it soi said i would take her i said id stay with her in the mail room because there was a slot in the door a quarantineuntil we could be sure oh elaine cass said elaine held up a palm to stop her dont just let me finish by the next day she was crying around the clock pickingwell the way they do i was carefuli wrapped her in a blanket before i held her and i didnt letyou know her mouth her saliva i was careful but the thing was i knew i was probably dead that it would only take one bite if i fell asleep or looked away at the wrong moment but i didnt care cass waited her heart barely beating imagining elaine in that little dim room as ruthies tiny body grew hot and damp with sweat as her wails escalated to screams of pain and anger as she started to attack herself her tiny fingers scraping at her own flesh as the others steeled themselves against yet another loss as they took the long route to avoid hearing the sounds coming from the mail room that went on for two days and thenwell i guess you know what happened she started to get better i wasnt sure at firsti thought maybe i was going feverish myself that i was delusional but i woke up i was sleeping in fits and starts an hour here and therei woke up and the fever was gone her eyes were glassy and she was like not there i mean she didnt respond when i touched her almost like she was in a coma or something i yelled and yelled to try and yank her out of it and finally a couple of people came and talked to me through the door they had a meeting they wouldnt let us out they brought us food and i tried to get ruthie to eat and sometimes i could get her to drink but she wasshe wasnt right that lasted a few more days some people thought she had died that i had elaine shook her head finally someone got the courage up to come in they saw that the fever was gone her pupils were normal her eyes were so bright like yours and i knew when i saw you you were the same and you know how kids arethey heal so fast her scratches were next to nothing they let us out then sheslike me cass said an outlier i stayed with her around the clock in the conference room and when she woke up i was there they reached the doors and elaine didnt look at her as she pulled the hood tighter around her face and held the door for cass im taking you back to the room remember what i said you need to go to colima and you need to forget cass followed wordlessly watching the rigid set of elaines back at the door of her cell elaine put a hand on her shoulder cass looked into her careworn face cass when she woke up elaine bit her lip looked at the floor her first word was mama then the door shut and cass was alone in the dark time took forever to pass without even a sliver of light under the door the dark was absolute and it started to play tricks on casss mind in her thoughts she saw faces evangelines and the other rebuilders their expressions hard and suspicious she remembered elaine before the way she used to hiccup if she laughed too hard her sadness when she talked about her cats her brother in oakland she remembered other faces from the library some she could put names to others she couldnt she wondered which of them still lived here and what had happened to the rest she thought of ruthie the way shed laughed and laughed when she saw the dandelions in the librarys untended dead lawn tucked here and there among the kaysev she thought of smoke the way hed looked at her in lyles guest bed the night before the way his eyes glinted when she pressed his hand hard against her after what seemed like an entire day had passed someone brought her lunch the door opened and she squinted in the sun bright enough to let her know it was afternoon a tray was set on the floor and the person left before casss eyes had a chance to adjust enough to see who had been there whether it was a man or a woman someone she recognized or a stranger she ate by feel a hard biscuit made from kaysev flour and flavored with rosemary a surprise where had the spice come from was it dried and stored from beforeor had it managed to return scratching out a foothold to renew itself aftertime cass drank the tall bottle of watergritty bitter no doubt boiled stream waterand did several sets of pushups and situps a while later she did more and then more maybe if she did enough if she pushed her body hard enough she would grow tired enough to sleep tomorrow she would be forced to go to colima somehow she had to find a way to escape and far better to escape near the outset than later in the journey since every mile would take her farther and farther away from san pedro and the convent maybe forgetting would be better maybe if she could fill her days with other things with chores and routines and conversations until finally there was no room for all the memories of ruthiemaybe then she could find some peace but cass knew there would never be such a thing for her and though she pushed her body until she was drenched with sweat and collapsed on the thin mattress the desperate need to find ruthie was undimmed and she lay in the dark listening to the pounding of her own heart feeling the ache of what was missing when the tapping started cass thought it was in her imagination it was a soft scratching sound but then there was a snick of a dead bolt turning that was definitely real cass scrambled to her feet as the door opened for a moment cass blinked adjusting to the light and then an unfamiliar man came into the room and quickly closed the door behind them plunging them back into darkness it was not a large room and cass backed up into the corner opposite the mattress feeling for the walls with her hands panic blooming inside her the man was bigger than her by far her brief glimpse gave the impression of a solid build thick arms doughy hands there was nowhere to go and nothing she could use to defend herself but she coiled herself anyway ready to throw everything she had into one fierce jab at the eyes or stomp on the instep whatever it took to hurt him before he hurt her during the siege there came a day when it became clear that the law was a concept that no longer had any meaning coalitions from before were revealed to be more fragile than anyone guessed prisons were opened and sheriffs departments disbanded after the national guard admitted it could no longer call up sufficient numbers to quell riots restraining orders went unenforced predators prowled and bullies sought out the weak plaintiffs awaiting justice ran out of hope defendants quit pleading innocence old animosities based on skin color and native tongue reared their ugly heads once again there were no more good guys in charge no upholders of reason no reason at all the only rule in place was the rule of might and crimes went unpunished as long as the perpetrators were bigger or stronger or more willing to take risks than their victims most people behaved according to the same moral strictures they always had but unexpected acts of violence and heroism stretched the ends of the spectrum some ordinary people discovered a taste for justice and threw themselves into protecting the innocent even when it cost them their lives but at the same time rapes and beatings and murders skyrocketed grudges were consummated in fits of spectacular rage and those who had harbored violent fantasies against neighbors and rivals and even strangers acted on them with impunity so when instead of a body pressing her into the wall cass heard a low voice say dont be afraid she was seized by confusion rather than relief the scream that was on her lips died in a whimper her hands clenched into fists trembled who are you cass managed to whisper a friend my names not important but im on your side im here to help you get out of here elaine said theres been a change of plans we need to get smoke out and the feeling is that you wont be safe here once he goes missing look hes going to take you to the convent and for what its worth we advised him against it do you understand what im saying what would they do to smoke considering that he killed three of the top guys in the rebuilder command im guessing the maximum sentence in what passes for a justice system down there the man said stonily smoke killed them are you sure look no disrespect but we dont have time for this getting you out just compounds the risk for all of us and frankly we probably would let you take your chances with evangeline except smoke wouldnt leave without you he didnt bother to hide his irritation now can you pay attention we dont have time for me to tell you twice okay cass muttered chastened nearly everyones at dinner right now and i have to get back when i open this door ill go create a distraction in the courtyard youll only have a moment run to the east entranceyou know the one you remember yes smoke will meet you there hell have your packs hell know where to go do not talk just follow him cass nodded and only when the man opened the door and let a swath of light in did she notice that he was wearing the khaki shirt of the rebuilders the stranger slipped out as quietly as hed entered cass waited listening hard she heard his footsteps retreating down the hall then nothing she tested the door and found it unlocked but the thought that she would need to run away from the place that had meant safety to her just a short time ago seemed ludicrous how was it possible to find enough to disagree about aftertime that you could fight and kill over it the priorities were so stark live another day protect others if you can eat and drink and sleep care for the children everything elsewashing learning creating lovingwere luxuries rarely indulgedbut they haunted peoples minds still the dream of starting over ran deep at first the rumors flew that the end times had arrived that the planet itself was dying defoliation would kill everyone on the planet in a matter of weeksthat was a popular theory for a while until people figured out that not all of the plants were threatened then the kaysev seeds sprouted and the new panic was that it would choke out all other species and leach all the nutrients from the earth but soon it became obvious that where kaysev grew other plants that had survived the siege returned and flourished over and over the apocalypse theories were proved wrong earth did what she would she chose life if she was indifferent to the fate of humanity she seemed unstoppable in her determination to restore health to her forests and mountains and waters as every new day seemed to bring a sprig or seedling of some species that was thought to be lost or a flash of a silvery fish tail in the stream or the sound of birdsong in the morning and thats when people started talking about a future one in which the planet found a way to host the survivors not everyone looked ahead of course there were those who gave up who believed it was only a matter of time before the beaters prevailed or the blueleaf redoubled or the kaysev fell to winter frosts but the numbers of the hopeful were greater had been anyway people were hungry for leadershipthat was why bobby had risen so quickly and easily no one opposed him everyone was happy to defer to his natural ability to organize and encourage and parcel out tasks and resources and decide disputes but bobby was dead they found his body on the rocks casss heart contracted at the thought and she leaned against the door frame struggling under the weight of her guilt and the pain of yet another loss when she heard the clatter it was muffled but there was definitely the sound of crockery breaking on the floor followed by cursing she didnt wait her feet moved on their own she flew down the hall past the conference room before her thoughts caught up and by then it was too late to do anything but keep running she took the corner fast this was the worst of it the place where she could be spotted by anyone looking in her direction she heard the voices much more clearly now as she flattened herself against the wall and slunk toward the door to the outside when her fingers touched the metal bar of the doors push mechanism she took a chance and looked backward silhouetted against the light pouring into the hall from the door to the courtyard was her rescuer holding a large plastic tub while several people knelt at his feet picking up broken dishes cass took a deep breath and pushed against the door before it would have been electronically armed but without electricity the security system was useless now the door had a bulky padlock but it swung free the arm looped through only one half of the device and the door opened and cass found herself in a pool of lateday sun that made her blink im here come on now smokes voice and then smokes hand seized hers and pulled hard and she was running next to him straining to keep up her eyes adjusted to the light and she saw that they were headed for the alley running behind the library and city hall across the staff parking spaces and the bike rack skirting a row of dead shrubs and abandoned cars halfway down the alley was a low brick building with a flat roof a restaurant of some kind there was still a smell of rotting garbage that lingered even after all these months and casswho had seen and smelled things a thousand times worsefound herself gagging on the smell as smoke pulled her beneath an overhang of wood slats take this he said handing her the pack that elaine had taken from her it was heavier than it had been the night before in the library whats in it supplies rations weapons you can look later for now we need to put as much distance between us and them as we can before they find out were gone and thats going to be just a few minutes i can pretty much guarantee it cass pulled the pack onto her shoulders and shrugged it into place can you handle the weight yes cass broke off when she saw that smoke was holding a compact handgun where the hell did you get that ourbenefactors smoke muttered i wasnt expecting it wish i could say i was confident i could use it you dont know how to shoot ive shot some when i was a kid rifles mostly duck hunting with my uncles i know enough not to shoot myself or you by accident lets put it that way cass thought about what the stranger had told her that smoke had killed three men tried to imagine him staring down the barrel pulling the trigger found that it wasnt that much of a stretch there was something about him some dormant powerful fury that she could sense lurking under the surface to her surprise it didnt frighten her it almost seemedfamiliar a bitter mix of regret and deadly determination cass herself could handle a gun she had learned to shoot her dads on a series of clear cold january mornings when she was ten shed shot magazine pages nailed to trees her father clapping her on the back and laughing whenever she hit one i dont suppose you have another do you sorry smoke said but would you rather be the one to carry it cass raised her eyebrows surprised that he was willing to put his safety in her hands um no thats okay okay well smoke faltered anyway im hoping we wont need it were only going about threequarters of a mile to another shelter no look cass the resistance has gotten pretty organized theyve got resources hidden all over the place up here and they must be pretty keen on getting us out because theyre giving us a motorcycle what i know i know ill believe it when we see it but herkimthe guy who came for youhe told me where to find it and says its gassed up and ready and all we have to do is get there before the beaters get us in daylight in the middle of town smoke touched his hand to the small of her back its sunset he said gently thats not nearly as bad if it was a lie it was a lie told to protect her cass thought about what the stranger had told her in the cell smoke wouldnt leave without you she watched him out of the corner of her eye as they hurried along the alley dodging clumps of garbage and the desiccated remains of cats and rodents flattened by fleeing traffic and left to rot why did he care about her why would he risk his own safety to protect her they turned left toward a water tower in the distance that rose up in the sky over a residential neighborhood were headed for a house near the edge of town the bikes in a shed in the back ive got an address and you know how to get there i memorized it this way a quarter mile right on jackson left on tendrick springs number white house green shutters wow cass said i dont think i could remember my own birthday with everythingyou know just everything they moved in silence cass stayed close to smoke bumping against him from time to time she wasnt used to looking to anyone else for reassurance she wasnt sure how she felt about it but she also wasnt about to question it not now when is it smoke asked as they turned onto jackson road when is what your birthday cass didnt say anything for a moment it was january first she had been the first baby born in contra costa county that year but she hadnt celebrated her birthday in years her mother always sent a card signedin her mothers hand mim and byrn no love nothing but their names shed spent more than a few of her birthdays hung over or drunk by noon on her best days she told herself she would start celebrating again when she got ruthie back she would make a cake they would wear hats made from sheets of newspaper is it a big secret or something smoke asked come on why wont you tell me january january what does it really matter i mean do you think people are still going to be keeping track by then tell you what ifif were still alive ill tell you the date then what she meant was if they were still togethernot together together because it was crazy to imagine such a thing to give their brief acquaintance significance that it didnt have but if after cass got ruthie they ended up sheltering in the same place something like that deal smoke said and slipped his hand around casss and squeezed letting go before she could react and the last of her mistrust of him slipped away smoke had proved himself over and over hed believed in her innocence when she arrived at the school with her blade pressed to a childs neck hed come with her voluntarily to the library now his best course was to run in a different direction to go where the rebuilders wouldnt pursue him but hed come with her anyway and there was the other night in the cool clean sheets at lyles place in the breeze that reminded her of before but that didnt count that couldnt count and cass pushed it from her mind pushed the memory hard into a small corner where it would be protected and preserved still that left last night when hed faced down the rebuilders without hesitation and today when hed waited for her to join him at the back door thank you she said softly for what for coming with me for being here smoke shrugged i cant go back to the school nowi dont want to lead the rebuilders there no matter where i go theyll come after me but if they think im with you at least theyll leave the school alone cass thought she understood the people at the school had been strangers not long ago but now aftertime they were all he had i hope theyre fine she said softly thinking of sammi and her mother of the women at the bath trough of the children playing with the plastic animals of nora with her intense dark eyes and choppy haircut wondered if smoke was thinking about her missing her wishing he could be with her she almost asked him but then she didnt she wasnt sure she wanted to hear the answer so what do you know about the convent she asked instead id heard rumors about it but herkim filled me in smoke said they started the convent a few months ago all women no men allowed set it up in foothill stadium of all places home of the minersyou ever been there cass had with her father in fact when she was eight years old it was a ridiculously balmy tuesday in may when it seemed like it would never rain again and every day would bring some new and splendid surprise because her daddy was home from touring with his band and he wasnt working at the construction sites like he usually did and he wrote a note saying she was sick and she didnt have to go to school they didnt tell her mother who had gone off to work as usual because it was sort of a surprise and her daddy bought her a souvenir pennant and a second bag of peanuts just because she asked and the next week he was gone and she never saw him again no cass mumbled the lie dont think i have well its not the worst place in the world for a bunch of batshit crazy women to hole up i guess theyve sealed off the entrances got some system for figuring out who they let in and out not that theyre coming out much thats for sure and they have ruthie there thats just what someone said you got to be careful here cass you cant go believing everything you hear everyone who talks to you you got to wonder what angle theyre working what you could provide them with that they cant get some other way but it was elaine who said it we were friends okay smoke said sorry im just trying something clattered behind them metal on pavement and cass whirled around smoke turned too his hand tight around hers a block away half a dozen clumsy forms stumbled around a cluster of trash cans tripping and trying to disentangle themselves from each other it was almost impossible to make out any details at this distance now that the sun had slipped behind the horizon and evening had laid down its hazy blue gloom but the moans that started up when they found their footing and sniffed the air and scented cass and smokethose were unmistakable the beaters had found them cass watched the things shove and kick at each other with frustration as they got in each others way one was knocked to the ground where it howled in fury rubbing a crabbed hand at its face as the others stumbled toward cass and smoke smoke raised the gun and fired but the beaters were too far away and the gun kicked in his hand he fired a second time and a third hitting nothing stop cass yelled you only have a few more rounds in the pack smoke seized her hand he knew what she did even if he made every shot he couldnt hit them all and the odds of killing even one were pretty low besides there wasnt time to reload they ran but cass knew they could never outrun the beaters for a while sure cass and smoke were strong and fit and adrenaline would give them a boost but within a quarter mile their pace would drop and the beaters speed would surge the maniacal frenzy of their hunger could not be tempered by any obstacle theyd run across glass across hot coals across this terrible scorched earth that was the end of the world if it meant fresh uninfected flesh they were body eaters after all and that was all they lived for they would close the gap their voices raised in a horrifying chorus of grunts and moans and smokeof course it would be smoke because he would put himself between her and them there was no question in her mind nowsmoke would feel their grasping bonehands on his clothes his back his arms as they took him down long ago before ruthie cass had contemplated dying wondering if it was true what they said that in the final seconds you achieve a kind of peace like that guy in the jack london story slowly freezing to death there would be a numbing a lulling a sense of complacency rightness acceptance would be followed she imagined by something resembling an urge to have done with it a drowning person would accept the water into their lungs a person falling from a great height would reach out for the earth but there was nothing like that for victims of the beaters because they knew what was coming and death was stretched out over a series of manic flashes strips of flesh bites into the skin cass knew so when smoke seized her hand she ran hard she flew like a stone rocketed over a great chasm she pushed off with her feet and willed herself through the air begging fate for another breath another step another second before hell burst upon them white house smoke yelled urging her faster harder than she thought she could go fear did that working miracles on the laws of physics and gravity driving people to do the impossible when they were abreast of the house she understood that it was the one the one with the shed the shed with the motorcycle and when they rounded the corner and smoke plunged toward a dead shrub it took only a split second for her to realize that the shrub was a screen a fake and she tore into the branches with her hands pulling yanking the dead twigs cutting and scraping her skin the deadwood fell away and there it was a sagging barnshaped box of a shedit was badly kept paint peeling off the cheap wood in cracked strips the lock hanging rusted and useless smoke pulled her inside and slammed the door yellow light filtered through a stained and spiderwebbed window illuminating shelves of buckets and jars and garden toolsand a motorcycle it was thereit was really and truly there an incongruously clean and shinedup thing front wheel tilted sportily on the slab floor but behind her the door swung open on creaking hinges and she could hear not far away at all the screaming and grunting it wonttheyll be she protested but smoke was pushing at a long low oblong box trying to block the door with it and cass shut up and helped it was an old freezer a heavy thing but she and smoke threw themselves into the task and bumped and scraped it along the floor a hideous smell rising from it as the lid jostled and fell away meat roasts and chops packed in plastic now moldering and rottenthe stench reaching into her nostrils spoils the scraps that no raiders found ruined when the electricity failed nausea rolled through casss gut as the first of the beaters threw itself against the door they were inches away screaming out their rage and their hunger and cass leaped back smoke caught and held her hard his arms wrapped tight around her from the back calm down now he ordered his lips brushing her ear and there was something in his voice that made her body follow his instructions even as her mind went nearly mad with fear she felt her heart slow her hands unclench only then did smoke release her and take the handlebars of the bike kicking up the kickstand the light glinted off keys that had been left in the ignition he slid onto the seat with an ease that let cass know it was far from the first time hed been on a motorcycle turning the key he revved the engine hard behind me smoke ordered and cass threw a leg over the seat slid her hands around his waist buried her face in the soft cotton of his shirt and closed her eyes because she was too frightened to see what he would do next whatever it was they had one chance only one she felt the reverberation of the bikes powerful motor through smokes body through the warmth of his skin beneath his shirt and she squeezed her eyes shut tighter and she whispered a prayer to whomever that was immediately stolen by the roar of the motor and the screaming and her own heart ruthie and then her entire body was jarred so hard that her teeth clashed in her head and the wind was knocked out of her lungs the bike leaped ahead like an enraged animal loosed from its cage and slammed against the back wall of the shed splintering it sheetrock bursting all around her something struck her ankle knocking her foot loose and she slid sideways on the seat and nearly fell off scrambling to hang on to smoke cass he yelled as the motorcycle chewed through vines and fallen tree limbs toward the alley spinning up gravel and dead leaves and dirt hold on and she did his words again made her hold on for everything she was worth her hands clutched his waist hard enough to bruise and she pulled herself back upright her ankle banging painfully against metal the heat of the engine blowing hard through the fabric of her pants her cheek stung and something warm slid slowly down her chin and she realized she was cut and bleeding she forced her eyes open and saw squat garages racing by they followed the gravel alley to the end of the block where it opened onto a street and smoke took the corner expertly angling so sharply that she had to clutch him tight to avoid spilling even as he accelerated into the turn and the motorcycle leaped onto smoother pavement a flash of movement caught her eye and cass turned to look a horde of them more than shed ever seen in one place beforethere had to be over two dozen jogging unsteadily down the street a block away the ones in front paddled the air with their clutching fingers eyes rolling in the ecstasy of the hunt they followed the sound of the engine turning and stumbling as the motorcycle powered on and cass pressed her face into smokes shirt into the plane between his shoulder blades and breathed shallowly of his scent his warmth for several blocks neither of them said anything they passed cars abandoned at odd angles crumpled into street signs and fire hydrants there was junk in the streetsan overturned armchair sodden clumps of clothes matted to the curbs squashed rats a barbie notebook its shiny pink cover faded by the elements a little tikes cozy coupe in a patch of kaysev overturned its wheels turned toward the sky smoke navigated the obstacles with ease and cass knew that she had underestimated him shed thought him a deliberate man because of the care he took for her safety the way his large hands enveloped hers she had not thought him capable of such quick reflexes but as she slowly uncoiled from her terrified clutch she noticed how he turned his wrist just so to make the motorcycle dip around a downed tree or an abandoned shoe finding smooth stretches of pavement where he pushed the bike as hard as it would go making it scream with exertion after the alley turned to neighborhood and the neighborhood thinned to a house here and there smoke finally pulled back on the gas and they hit a steady clip in the dying sun its nearly night cass noted with surprise because she had been too busy with her terror and her will to survive to notice the setting of the sun or the sweetening of the thick autumnal air it wasnt just the gingery kaysev either there were other undercurrents that she couldnt quite place evergreen of course shed seen the seedlings everyone hadbut something else too something thick and waxy like a camellia or a new guinea impatiens extravagant even before unthinkable now but who was to say who got to dictate really what died and what fought for a foothold and what thrived cass took the measure of the passing scenery a kitschy cabin decor shop the chainsawrendered black bears that once decorated the entrance now cracked and toppled a sporting goods store where shed once shopped the afterseason sale hoping to find a snowsuit that she could pack away for ruthies next winter coming out instead with a pair of fuzzy pink girls boots that would have been inexcusable if they hadnt been so cheap after that there was nothing but the twisting ribbon of the road a pearly shimmer in the darkening evening eventually smoke slowed the bike and eased over onto the shoulder when they came to a stop he took care in settling the kickstand before he dismounted and offered cass his hand her ears were still ringing from the steady roar of the road but she allowed him to help her from the bike they were heading down out of the mountains on the far side the side that cass rarely traveled she did not know this road eventually it led to yosemite she was pretty sure though she couldnt picture the route in her mind night brought its customary chill the kaysev smell here was muted there was clay dust in her nostrils a not unpleasant smell she associated with endless hot afternoons running along sunbaked roads cass smoothed her shirt where the wind had whipped it around her waist and as she looked around the road she saw something astonishing something that made her catch her breath what smoke said sharply whats wrong no noits justlook she said pointing to the tiny seedlings a trio of them that had caught her eye redwoods smoke asked after a moment im pretty sure those are sequoias you knowthe big ones those are the first evergreens ive seen sincebefore cass nodded not trusting her voice to speak without catching shed thought they were gone forever then she noticed something else there was fire here sure enough the trees here were not just dead but charred black it had been difficult to see in the twilight and she hadnt noticed it must have happenedwell if it happened right before or during the attacks what difference would that make when fire destroys a living tree the cones fall and release their seeds so if the timing was just right it could have seeded right before the siege and then the seeds somehow survived and this she toed the road next to the seedlings for emphasis thats smoke seemed at a loss for words but he caught her hand in his and squeezed how do you know so much about plants cass shrugged embarrassed i umi used to think i would that i could study it you know botanylandscape design before she realized that escaping byrns latenight accidental encounters in the hallway his hands on her thighs under the dinner table meant getting out with no diploma and no college and no real plan other than flight for a long time she thought shed save up some money and go back enroll at anza state then one day she looked around her tiny dirty apartment highheeled shoes abandoned by the door empty cans stacked on the table a stranger snoring in her bed and realized she never would cass tugged her hand back and changed the subject that was lucky inin the shed luck how about skill smoke demanded the corners of his mouth curving in a wry smile so says my shelf of dirt bike trophies from junior high i dont think thats a dirt bike cass said pointing to the shiny machine whose engine ticked and popped in the cool night little boys who ride dirt bikes grow up to ride big bikes i had one at my place in tahoe rode a lot on roads like this one along with your waverunner and your snowmobile and your powerboat and all your other toys cass said trying for a light tone yeah i had it all didnt i smoke said there it was again the sadness as he slipped an arm around her shoulders and after hesitating for a moment she laid her cheek against his chest he pulled her closer and rested his chin on the top of her head this is where he tells me it will all be okay cass thought but he didnt and cass who had never let any man stay much longer than the time it took him to put his pants back on suddenly found herself wishing he would she would take that lie finally smoke sighed a deep intake of breath that cass felt against her skin and then pulled gently away from her we can be at the convent before its completely dark as long as we dont run into anythingunexpected the roads have been clear cass said brushing imaginary specks from her sleeves not meeting his eyes it was true there had been fewer junked cars less debris up this far not too populated this far in smoke said most of the logjamming happened nearer the city works for me once we get close to san pedro we might hit a few more though well we dont really have much choice right cass asked she waited until smoke slung his long leg over the bike and then slid on behind him already she found that she had memorized the way they fit together as they roared through the murky evening the bikes headlight tracing a golden path along the road she imagined that they blended together into one dim shape in the descending dark the rest of the trip took less time than they expected someone had come along before them and cleared the way the fire had burned its way downmountain and the road wound through acres of forest studded with the blackened skeletons of trees everywhere there were softfringed little evergreen seedlings even occasionally in the cracks in the road where ordinarily only kaysev grew on a straight gentle incline smoke slowed coming to a stop with the bike balanced against his foot on the ground and gestured toward the bank at the side of the road downed tree limbs and sections of trunk had been pushed out of the way the trunk was massive at least three feet across a tree that had been uprooted during the fire and fallen across the road power saw smoke said pointing at a cylindrical section eight or ten feet long see the marks and look at the roadthey used a front loader or something cass squinted in the last of the evening light sure enough there were broad arcing scrapes in the pavement sawdust and dirt and chipped asphalt dragged in broad swaths but that could have been from ages ago back when all the gas stations were shutting down and people were killing each other to siphon fuel from abandoned cars as the siege dragged on there were fewer and fewer cars on the road each day as though the automobiles themselves were falling to a plague until the very few people who still had gas were too afraid to drive because of the desperate gangs that swarmed cars and dragged drivers out to be beaten and left for dead in the streets smoke shook his head look at that you can smell it thats a fresh cut he was right of course the air carried a pleasant scent of pine a smell that reminded cass of christmas a holiday that she imagined no longer existed for a moment she felt a surge of excitement maybe theyre close by she said maybe well catch up to them if they have gas cars a tractor or whatever cass id lay odds its the rebuilders theyre the only ones capable of something like this anymore at least on this side of the border cass was silent a moment absorbing his words you believe that what evangeline saidabout the rockies you really think theyve cut us off i dont know thats where id do it though i mean if i was trying to keep them outquarantineyeah its the only place that makes sense start up north canadian border ought to be plenty far enough no way beaters have spread up through oregon into washington or idaho yet and besides itll be getting cold up there in a month or so id build a blockade down all the way to where the colorado river empties into the gulf with what cass demanded i dont know but people are resourceful i mean the chinese were able to build a wall seven hundred years bc and all they had was what they could dig up out of the ground mostly rocks and dirt and existing mountain ridges and i dont need to tell you that theres probably a hell of a lot of unemployed and very motivated guys ready to work out east especially if they understand whats going on over here what you said back at lylesabout that guy from ucsf the scientist how he didnt think the beaters could live up north yeah i dont know cass i mean it made sense to me but look how theyre evolving if they can figure out complex strategies learn from their mistakes refine their attacks what are the odds that they cant figure out how to put on a fucking coat cass wondered it was true that the beaters were evolving that their hunger was driving them to adapt to their circumstancesbut they were still so primitive in their responses they couldnt walk ten feet without tripping and stumbling over each other but they hadnt learned to put any distance between them when they went out roving they were like children in their frustration raging and screaming in impotent fury when they were denied when they were hurt they were hypnotized by the sight of their own blood so deeply fascinated that you could come close enough to fire at them pointblank before they remembered you were a threat one thing was sure if a border had been built retreating east was no longer a possibility once she found ruthie and to the south were the rebuilders cass thought of evangeline of her cruel beauty of the effortless power she wielded over the people in the conference room she had no trouble believing that evangeline was capable of using her for researchand other things she couldnt even imagine whats to stop them from coming after us she asked if they have the means to do something like this they didnt know about the motorcycle they dont know about the resistancewell im sure theyre aware that not everyone welcomes their presence at the library but from what herkim told me they dont know whos acting and whos just grumbling they wont know who helped us escape and theyll be forced to assume were out wandering around town my guess is theyll send out a party check with squatters sweep town and when they dont find us figure we were either taken oror i guess maybe that we got incredibly lucky and made it out of town on foot smoke eased the motorcycle forward weaving carefully between the bark and twigs and dirt clods left by whoever had cleared the road when theyd passed the last of it he increased their speed but kept it slower than theyd been going before about twentyfive miles an hour night had nearly descended and the motorcycles headlight lit up an eerie landscape of the black nightmare outlines of stripped and downed trees against a purplegray sky the occasional abandoned or wrecked car loomed like a hunkering ogre the beam glinting off metal and glass maybe it was casss imagination but it seemed to her that smoke sped past these cars as though he couldnt get away from them fast enough before easing back in the long uninterrupted stretches of empty pavement cass held tight to his waist unable to relax her grip afraid theyd hit something afraid shed fall afraid of everything she couldnt see in the shadows of the forest the roar of the bikes motor was the loudest sound cass had heard in a long whileif you didnt count screaming she had grown accustomed to silence aftertime once you took out the sound of traffic and the buzz of streetlights and televisions blaring through open windows and fire engines and police sirens cutting through the night and even the soft hum of everyday electronics it was possible to hear what lay beneaththe sigh of the wind the murmur of water flowing in a creek the calls of the birds that survived and the rustling of species starting their return to the underbrush in her days of walking cass had retuned her ears to these subtle sounds and now the whine of the motor cutting through the night stillness was nearly unbearable winding her nerves tight and keeping her fear simmering the odds of encountering beaters along this unpopulated stretch of road were slim cass held on to that thought and let it calm her as she watched the ribbon of road flashing silver in front of them smoke following the center line the air rushing past was cold and she snuggled into smokes shirt pressing her cheek against the warm fabric after a while she allowed her eyelids to drift slowly closed and breathed deeply of the night kaysev and mountain sage and cool earth cass thought she could ride like this for a long long time clinging to the illusion of safety grateful for someone else taking responsibility for the future smokes soft exclamation put her on instant alert she sat up straight and blinked at lights in the distance a glow highlighting a massive dark structure they had arrived at the edge of san pedro and the black shadows of houses and mailboxes and cars lined the side of the silent road gravel skittering under their tires they narrowly avoided the corpse of a large dog lying stiff and mangled in the middle of the road and smoke corrected by swerving onto the shoulder cursing under his breath when the bike was righted cass was left with adrenaline surging through her body and she had to force herself not to dig her fingers into smokes waist the stadium was lit from behind by a hazy glow the effect was that of a ghost ship on a night ocean as though it had been conjured by her desperation it was even bigger than she remembered and the memory of walking up the curving ramps with her father all those years ago danced at the edge of her heart trying to get in but she pushed it back that longago day it had been bright with banners and advertisements and the big digital scoreboard the bright red and silverminers team colorsworn by the players and fans now the oncecolorful edifice like her memories of that day was washed out and dull when they drew closer cass saw that someone was moving around the edges of the stadium and she felt a combination of excitement and dread in her gut they werent moving like beaters whoever it wasfriend or foeit was a citizen smoke slowed again and they came to a stop several blocks away from the stadium a warehouse of some sort hugged a sprawling fenced lot to their right on the left were apartment buildings lowslung brick sixflats with their firstfloor windows broken out the abandoned buildings could easily house beater nests especially the warehouse which probably had loading bays on the back side of the building cass pressed closer to smoke shouldnt we keep moving she could sense the tension in smokes body i know he muttered onlyi just wish i knew what was ahead i dont like that theyve got people outside like that makes me think theyre armed and id kind of like to know what their agenda is ahead of time here let me have the pack okay cass slid it off her shoulders feeling the pain in her shoulders where the straps had cut into her flesh the pack was too large for hera mans pack smoke dug inside and handed her a water bottle thirsty suddenly she was she twisted off the cap and drank deep barely even minding the silty earthy taste creek water you could never boil the taste out of it she let a little dribble down her chin down her throat wetting the collar of her shirt before holding the bottle out to smoke and saw that he was holding the gun weighing it loosely in his hand he ejected the spent magazine and rooted in the pack for a fresh one sometimes i guess it pays to be famous infamous he corrected himself so where do you think they got them theres stashes he said evasively i know of a few that the resistance set up not all by any means i dont know how strong they are in the library how many peoplebut its got to be pretty organized our friend herkim back there kept this one under wraps bet hes got a few more too probably offsitea house a hole doesnt take much and for now at least the rebuilders cant keep track of everyones comings and goings during the day though im sure thats next he laughed a sound so utterly without humor that cass flinched were you with them from the start she asked theresistance wasnt really anything to be with just those of us who thought it was fucked up that a few assholes wanted to tell everyone else what to do i mean a power grab seemed like an especially bad idea when everything else was still going to hell way i saw it maybe everyone ought to just pitch in and work together until the dust settled know what i mean cass thought about bobby his easy leadership the way everyone had turned to him almost hungry for direction for someone to tell them what to do sometimes someone needs to take charge she said softly hoping her voice didnt betray the ache in her heart left by bobbys death someone just has to pick a direction and go or its chaos i used to think that smoke said grimly until i saw firsthand what happens when the guy with the power heads off in the wrong direction and everyone follows along like a bunch of lemmings throwing themselves over the cliff i wont be a part of that not ever again there was a hardness in smokes voice that surprised cass and under her hands his muscles tensed he revved the engine and she could feel the vibrations traveling up through her body and the combination of the reverberations and being so close to smoke stirred her emotions in another direction entirely there were so many things she didnt know about himnot just what he had done who he had battled and even killed but who he had been before there was a current of darkness running through him a dangerous determination that she didnt understand it made her afraid she didnt know how far he would go when he was committed but she sensed it was all the way that he would go hellbent in whatever direction he chose right now he had chosen to go with her to protect her and cass felt herself pulled almost irresistibly toward the safety he offered it was so tempting to ignore the questions nagging at the edges of her mind the fact that the things she didnt know about him far outweighed the things she did so she said watching him turn the gun over in his hands youre sure you know how to use that yeahim not saying im a crack shot and i panicked back there but i can probably take care of anything that gets in our way between here and the convent tricks going to be shooting before we get shot if it comes down to it you think theres what are you worried about freewalkers rebuilders the conventwho smoke shook his head i dont know nobody was real clear back there herkim says he doesnt think the rebuilders have had much luck getting into the convent so he thinks theyve sort of written it off for now theyre picking off the easy targets at this point and maybe later theyll come back when theyve taken over all the little shelters and the squatters but he also said the convent hasnt exactly been very friendly to the resistance either they keep to themselves no allegiance except their own that kind of shit which was why they had sent the children there cass hoped maybe they were neutral like switzerland the little bud of hope that she kept safe and hidden inside threatened to unfurl and it was too soon too dangerous for that the women in thereare they armed are they dangerous but smoke was moving again keeping to the center of the street following a path straight toward the entrance we didnt exactly have a lot of time to chat back there but i got the impression these ones here are a bunch of zealots you know like a cult they think the siege was the start of the end times or whatever you know the same people who blame every bioattack on islamic extremists probably crazy but harmless at least to us as they came closer the stadium loomed larger until it towered above them stretching out several city blocks in either direction they passed a parking lot with cars still parked in a semblance of order the guard shack splintered and toppled smoke eased off on the gas when they were a few hundred feet away look there he said pointing to an alcove to the left that doesnt look good cass had to search for a moment to see what he was pointing at a figure dressed in loose pants and shirt holding an allbusiness gun a semiautomatic the kind that said gang and mercenary and drug runner to cass images from a hundred stupid latenight movies her heart lurched and she instinctively clutched smoke tighter he reached very slowly and deliberately for the keys and turned off the engine i dont believe ill be wanting to challenge that he said softly you get off first put your hands out so he can see you dont have anything ill follow cass did as smoke suggested taking her time holding her arms out like she was trying to balance on a narrow path she sensed smoke behind her and then he was at her side protecting her as always were unarmed smoke called out rebuilder the voice answered and cass was startled to hear that it was a woman the figure stepped closer and cass could see that she was tall and broadly built and that she moved with confidence no smoke snapped no fucking way you wont mind if i dont take your word for it lie on the ground facedown arms out just so you know if i shoot i wont bother worrying whether you make it through or not im going to search your girlfriend first and unless you want to clean her off the ground i advise you stay very very still im not his girlfriend cass thought as she lay down on cold pavement for the second time in a few days unlike the parking lot in front of the school the concrete here smelled of stale beer and rot but also unlike that day the hands that searched her worked quickly and efficiently a pressure not ungentle moving so fast along her body that there wasnt time for cass to register much more than surprise when the woman finished with her she showed cass the blade she had taken from her pocketand lyles crystal suncatcher glinting in the moonlight cass had forgotten and she caught her breath in dismay thats nothing she said hoping smoke couldnt identify the little trinket good luck charm the woman didnt reply but slipped it into a pocket of her vest fine she muttered before moving on to smoke cass wasnt sure if she meant it was all right to get up so she just turned her head to watch in time to see the guard take the gun from smokes pocket unarmed she said incredulously what the fuck is this then she slipped the gun into another vest pocket and finished the search coming up with the spare magazine and another blade which disappeared into the pocket as well okay time to go see the wizard she said leaning over the bike and taking out the keys whats your name asshole smoke this is cass okay you walk the bike go in front of me you she gestured at cass with the gun behind him ill be right here dont worry about that just keep going she slid the unopened backpack onto her shoulders and smoke touched her arm briefly before starting to push the bike by the handlebars the guard walked behind them their footsteps made an echo on the quiet dark streets in the shadows of the stadium the souvenir stands and bathrooms were mere ruins leaning on their frames ahead were streets restaurants bars a fire station more parking beyond that apartment buildings and houses cass flashed again on the day she had been here with her dad the shouts of the scalpers and men spilling out of a tavern another haggard man selling tshirts and ball caps and pennants her dad bought her a little red teddy bear with a white shirt with miners printed in sparkling silver script and she clutched it close aware that she was too old for a teddy bear but loving it anyway when they rounded the side of the stadium a vast fenced lot appeared ahead lit up with strings of lights and the occasional bright spotlight cass drew in her breath at the sight how were they powering all those lights what was this place clear the woman behind her yelled and from the darkness under the stadium a man called back who you got couple of sheep when are you off two the man replied cass saw him then standing with his legs slightly apart a gun like the other guards slung across his torso rockets yeah i guess im covering for baldy pulled a double the man grunted and they passed by so there were guards ringing the entire stadium cass guessed but a man did this mean that they had been wrong were men in the convent and if so what if it wasnt a cult at all not that men couldnt be in cults but the tone of these twojoking irreverent undeniably toughdidnt strike cass as steeped in religious zealotry and what were they guarding against anyway shed seen no signs of beaters no evidence of nests or recent kills the convent itself was quiet they approached the fenced lot cass blinking in the lights chain link stretched ten a dozen feet high razor wire twisted along the top an entire block lit up and tentstents people milling about sitting around a fire clustered near a makeshift bar drinking dont slow down the guard said behind them plenty of time to look around when you get in what is that cass asked thats civilization sweetheart are the people in there prisoners smoke demanded the guard laughed shortly aint anyone a prisoner she said its just the little place we call home no charge to come on in and you can buy just about anything you want for a price theres people who have more or less than others thats about it dors got the most so its his thing youll meet him soon enough cass wasnt sure she had heard right did you say dor she demanded yeah dor macfall sounds madeup right maybe it is maybe it isnt dor macfall casss mind was suddenly full of the image of sammi that day before she left hope and longing etched on her pretty young features find my dad shed said all i want is for him to know im okay what is he aa mayor of this little squatters town but the guard was done talking when they approached an opening in the fence a complicated gate was opened by a heavy broadfaced woman with hair so short cass thought it must have been buzzed with a razor the guard ignored them and made small talk with the large woman and a second guard a lanky man with long sandy hair she emptied the items shed confiscated from her pockets and handed them over along with the backpack and the gun the man set them on a long bare table then sat down and started sorting through the contents of the pack see you at rockets she said as she turned to go not bothering with goodbyes for cass and smoke im faye park that over here the new guard said as she motioned them in smoke pushed the bike into a corner of the encampment where a small rider tractor was parked next to a halfdozen bicycles yall set here a minute while we inventory all this im going to need some assurance ill be getting that back smoke said as he and cass took seats on a long low picnic bench faye didnt even look up from her task did you know him cass asked smoke dor macfall sammis dad smoke shook his head they split up before it got really bad he moved out back before they cut off the power but that little girl never stopped talking about him she made me promise if i ever saw him id tell him she was all right she made me promise the same thing yeah wellguess now well have the chance what are the odds i mean she said he was in sykes sykes probably doesnt exist anymore smoke said not in any meaningful way anyone with any brains would have got the hell out town that small youre not going to be able to get enough folks together to set up much of a defense yes but why here why not here smoke shrugged once he heard about the conventhes a sharp guy he saw an opportunity he jumped on it knew thered be a lot of traffic through here so he built himself a combination general store and strip club and koa campground is what it looks like with a hell of a security detail sammi said he was a businessman that what she said smoke laughed without humor you know what his business was internet marketing but not the kind the ftc approved ofyou know what im saying the siege was probably the best thing to happen to macfallfrom what his ex told me they were closing in on him he was looking at a few years in prison and now hes like the kingpin around here cass said bitterly even though she knew her disgust was only partly for the man who sammi idolized it had taken her two decades to realize that silver dollar haverford was really never going to come back and be the father shed needed him to be still seems like a coincidence that wed run into him i dont know its a small world now cass faye had lined up their items water bottles kaysev cakes a pair of blades she whistled when she saw the packets of tylenol and two balance bars and separated them out you know how it works right uh no smoke said were new around here which you might have gathered when we drove up on that thing if faye caught the irony in his voice she didnt let on instead she wrote something on a legal pad seriously cass tried all we know is that the conventwell we dont know anything except that im looking for she stopped herself she had been about to say that she was looking for her daughter for ruthie but caution seemed like a good idea and instead she said someone and left it at that someone in the convent or out here the man said in a pleasant enough voice he offered his hand and it was warm and strong im george by the way inside i think he frowned well good luck with that for now the first thing i got to tell you is that youre safe here from beaters anyway cass looked at the chainlink fence doubtfully george followed her line of vision and shook his head no i mean theres no beaters in town anymore you killed them all killed or captured he pointed to the convent they contract with macfall to have it done why the hell would anyone want to capture one of those things smoke demanded youd have to talk to him george shrugged he keeps his business pretty close to the vest though youre saying he trades with the women in the convent cass asked yeah theres a few hundred of em in there and they got power gas stores weapons and crazyass determination thats something you cant buy a few hundred smoke repeated in there once they started the convent women just started showing up from all over i thought thats why you were here he said pointing to cass to join up to join the convent to join the order okay how about you save that for later georgie faye said drawing a decisive line down the center of the page we got business to do what do you mean she gave cass a shrewd cleareyed gaze trading that is if you want to trade if you want to turn around and walk back out minus that ruger youre free to do so course we wouldnt guarantee your safety youre taking my gun smoke said not taking it trading for it or for a small fee holding it for you until such time as you come and get it back theres no arms allowed in here except guards of course youd be compensated with what cass asked changes all the time today we got kerosenewe got baby formula ritalin vicodin cass looked around more carefully a cluster of teenagers stood in a corner passing a bottle a few of them kicking a hackysack back and forth one of them had an arm wrapped in bandages and held in a sling the job looked surprisingly professional when the boy dived for the beanbag cass saw that he also had a scabbed bruise on his leg probably just the result of some ordinary misadventure but where had they found a doctor much less supplies to patch him up in a stand of pepper treesstill thriving from the looks of it though inexpertly pruneda man was lying in a hammock suspended from the branches reading out loud from a book by the light of a headlamp mounted on a baseball cap below him on the ground several people sat crosslegged or leaning into each other listening the smell of kaysev being fried with onions drifted past on the air and cass spotted the sourcea grill set up over coals an aproned man flipping patties in the air and expertly catching them people clustered around chatting waiting for the food to be ready it was like a carnival and a camping trip all rolled up in one and cass realized it had been a long time since she had seen people having fun like this something was out of place something besides the shouts and laughter and cass struggled to place it and then suddenly she got it musicnot loud faroff on the opposite corner past a row of tents an old red hot chili peppers song that her parents used to like thats you use batteries to play music she demanded incredulous it seemed so indulgent so incredibly wasteful when batteries began to run low in the library bobby had made a list of acceptable uses lights for emergencies at night to run the humidifier in the playroom when one of the little boys started having asthma attacks for a pair of walkietalkies the raiders used before they quit working generator actually george said and cass identified the other sound the steady low rumble you can give em a tour in a minute faye said to george suppressing a yawn if they decide to stay but first lemme tell yall what kind of deal i can do for you today the packet of tylenol bought them a night in a twoman tent near the far side of the encampment which everyone simply referred to as the box cass made one other trade with george after smoke left to collect their supplies and find an unoccupied tenta balance bar for an introduction to a woman named gloria who faye assured her knew more about the convent than anyone else in camp having lived there until a week earlier the only catch was that gloria had passed out drunk a while before their arrival and faye advised cass to wait until she woke up in the morning before trying to talk to her now she lives here inthe box cass asked drinking gratefully from the nalgene water bottle faye offered to share faye had loosened up once their business was done and seemed glad for the company producing a folding chair for cass and inviting her to wait there for smoke to return her shift was over and they took their chairs out of the harsh glare of the spotlight wired to the gate to illuminate the entrance fayes job had to be dull sitting here at the gate waiting for people to show up after all how many freewalkers could possibly arrive each day faye laughed honey nobody lives here except us employees and there aint none of us lookin to get rid of our jobs for most folks its too expensive to spend more than a night or two here so they just come around when they have something to trade but where do they go from here faye shrugged where they came from i guess but if theres really no beaters in san pedro then why look around cass faye said she had offered cass a camp chair and they were sitting behind her makeshift counter the gates had been secured for the night but cass spotted guards patrolling both the perimeter of the box and the stadium moving quietly through the darkness what do you see cass looked it was like a giant church campthat was the thought that came to her mind for a while when her father was touring with his band in the summer and her mother was working long shifts over at county they had sent her to one run by saint annes episcopal kids were bused in from all over and it didnt take cass long to figure out it was a camp for kids who didnt want to be there but couldnt afford anywhere else run by people who talked a good game but didnt really seem all that interested in whether or not the kids were having a good time cass remembered sitting at wood picnic tables in ninetydegree heat making crafts involving leaves and glue sticks trying not to cry while the counselors taught them a song about abraham and sarah here people wandered aimlessly from the bonfire set up in the middle of the encampment to the barter tables the little stands where they could trade for deodorant and salted peanuts and baby powder and rubbing alcohol openair bars were set up under popup tents a few were sturdier affairs behind plywood screens the music never stopped though it covered a dizzying range from a haunting piano étude to a remarkably bad cover of sweet child of mine by a tuneless girl band now some endless country song whose chorus rhymes relentlessly droned on a few of the people around the fire seemed to be nodding off to sleep i see a lot of people with nothing better to do she said faye gave her a withering look then youre not looking very hard save the damn riddles cass said exasperated ive been through a lot the last few days and i dont feel like playing games everyone here is wasted faye said drawing out the final word out of their fucking minds well yeah you sell hooch in paper cups cass said shed been surprised and relieved earlier when smelling the cheap wine on the women waiting to use the bathroom she found that it hadnt called out to her with the strength it once had hadnt made her insensible with yearning faye snorted thats nothing they give that shit away for free for the big spenders the pill poppers meth junkiesguarantee theyre lined up back behind rockets right now trading their last can of spaghettios for mg of ritalin or a couple of rocks oh ohhh idiot cass chastised herself earlier the thought had danced through her mind quickly enough that she hadnt bothered to examine it carefully namely that the box didnt make much sense a few months into aftertime it was true that all the easy stuff was taken grocery stores and hardware stores and sporting good stores had long ago been looted of all the valuable items homes had been broken into and all the weapons and canned goods and medicine cleaned out but for the braveand at this point almost every citizen who had managed to stay alive this long fell backward into that category to some extentthere was still more than enough to be found so it stood to reason that the boxs allure would be something even more special as the siege followed its tortuous path each day bringing some new abomination some crippling terror alcohol and drugs were at an astonishing premium more than a few people locked themselves in their houses and proceeded to get as drunk or stoned as they possibly could sometimes they were in search of the courage to shoot or hang themselves sometimes they were trying to drink themselves to death or overdose some were trying to tap into fantasies theyd held secret for a long time from a time when society had a tighter grip on the psyche before long there was nothing left to get numb with except clearly the people running the box had a hell of a stash cass gripped the cheap metal frame of her chair the plastic web cutting into her shoulder blades overwhelmed by the thought of all these people who had survived so much only to try to drown their pain with a temporary high she hadnt been around active users in a long time the thought was a little overwhelming youre an addict faye added offhandedly cass felt her face flush but she forced herself to keep her expression neutral was she corrected faye was was like for how long long enough yeah faye said clearly skeptical so its some kind of accident you showed up here theres nowhere else in the central valley to score and yet here you are because i have to get in the convent i have to get in there i have to findsomeone fayes expression didnt change you want to find someone in there yes sister mother spinster aunt maybe your people jesus folks why is that what the convent is like fundamenta lists i dont know the details i guess you can ask gloria shes happy to talk talks everyones fuckin ears off when shes not wasted but no its not just a jesus thing its like they worship the disease or something what or like its the antichrist and they vanquish it through prayer something fucked up like that i dont know faye shrugged for all i know theyre in there dancing naked under the moon how could the woman not be more curious the convent was the closest thing to a real community that cass had seen since the siege other than the little groups in libraries and schools no one had been able to band together in sufficient numbers to move beyond the demands of subsistence living you two look cozy smokes deep voice rumbled behind cass she twisted in her chair to see him holding a plastic bucket in one hand white towels in the other okay i think thats my cue to shove off faye said im sure ill see you around nice meeting you smoke waited until faye disappeared down the main path through the tents then offered cass a hand how does a shower sound like heaven she let smoke pull her out of her chair and peeked into the bucket there were washcloths along with the rest of the toiletries what did that cost smoke gave her a sly grin theyve got a thriving skin trade going here he said pointing to the end of the box farthest from the stadium it was lit only by a sparkling string of christmas lights that wound from tent to tent in case you havent figured it out thats what the blue tents are for i just you know stopped by and gave the ladies a taste of what they wanted and they showered me with earthly goods ha ha cass smiled at his joke despite herself god im stupid i thought those were first aid tents not stupid only naive or maybe its wishful thinking that you can start a civilization on free trade and have it grow toward an ideal only i doubt that ever works i mean look at the history of any major civilization i dont think im up for a history lesson right now cass said softly though it occurred to her that history was bound to be lost in a generation or two with no one to preserve and teach it if any humans even survived that long besides its not just the you know blue tent thing i didnt get that the whole currency here is based on drugs i just feel like an idiot well not the entire trade maybe i got this stuff and a couple decent singlemalts and a bowl of pretzels that werent completely stale cass whistled not to nag but how are we affording this you didnt trade away our blades did you nah i uh put the bike up to secure a loan the bike yeah i mean its not like we could make much use of it without fuel besides i can get it back theyve got every angle covered its like a pawn shopthey just charge you a holding fee cass shook her head it wasnt for her to say really she knew that the bike the supplies the gunthese had all been given to smoke because of his record with the rebuilders she had no claim on them you coming he said softly i paid for two cant really use the second one myself cass slipped her hand into the crook of his arm and they walked down a path lit by yellow light from a dozen coleman lanterns hung on poles they passed people talking softly in the entrances of tents or bent over bongs and pipes and bottles a man lurched into the path from between two tents with a cutoff grunt he had almost recovered his footing when a second man tackled him and took him down yelling the smell of alcohol and sweat came off the pair as they tumbled and rolled one was trying to stab the other with a butter knife but he was too drunk to do any real damage and the knife fell to the ground cass was about to grab it to prevent further trouble when a third man shoved her out of the way he was dressed in a black tshirt and cargo shorts and a small receiver on his belt broadcast static and voices his belt also held a sap a gun and handcuffs but he ended the scuffle instantly without using any of them by pulling the closer man off the other yanking his arms behind his back and up then pinning him to the ground with a knee the other man whimpered and curled up into a ball but another guard arrived and dragged him roughly to his feet the wouldbe fighters were hustled off the guards mumbling apologies to cass and smoke and the incident was over moments after it started wow cass said thatsimpressive protecting their investment more like smoke said part of what people pay for here is a sense of security theyve got a drunk tank over at the back corner just a big locked pen with a few guys passed out in it this kind of feels like the wild west like you could get away with a lot as long as you dont disturb the peace smoke shrugged maybe thats not such a bad thing as long as you dont hurt other peoplei mean who really cares its not like a thousand little rules are really going to turn this into some sort of model society cass didnt answer at first as the rule of law gave way to the rules of selfpreservation there had been an unfamiliar sense of freedom an untethering from the obligations and habits of before but that freedom was only an illusion at least here where a man who might or might not be sammis father ruled with one hand while he offered temptation with the other maybe it was inevitable this sort of order would impose itself even aftertime cass remembered the helpless anger everyone felt at the government as the siege wore on as one by one the threads connecting communities were broken and people were catapulted into chaos at the time everyone had wished for someone or something new to take charge to make things right and tell them what to do now a few months later someone had several someones only the choices didnt look good there were the rebuilders the box with its promises of numbness and pleasure hundreds of smaller communities with godknowswhat going on behind closed walls and then whatever the convent offered cass wasnt optimistic about finding anything more than a different brand of crazy inside the stadium but if ruthie was there thats where she was going later in the tent cass busied herself with unrolling the flaps that served as a door and snapping them shut only a slim band of lantern light entered at the bottom though not enough to cast any light on the interior of the tent so cass undressed in the dark her skin was soft and warm from the showersan outdoor affair that ran from a heated reservoir and felt better than almost anything shed experienced in recent memory anything that is except for the night in lyles guest room only cass wasnt sure if that was even in the same realm the sensations of that night were enmeshed so completely with emotion that it was impossible to know how much of what she felt came from smokes touch and how much was the momentum of her own needs and fears tumbled together in a firestorm of ecstasy and now she was about to lie down with him for the second time cass knelt on the air mattress felt it shift beneath her weight she ran her hands along the blankets and sheets which were not nearly as finely made or as clean as lyles and when her hands found smokes he took them and wrapped them firmly in his own and pulled her toward him without hesitation get under he commanded and she wriggled into the warmth under the covers and pressed against him for a moment it felt sweet and right a relief a balm an exhalation of a breath caught in anxiety smokes chest was bare he was wearing only boxers and even through the cotton she could feel his heat and undeniably his desire you traded away everything we had today cass chided trying to keep her tone light now weve got no aces up our sleeves nothing to get us out of the next jam we get into didnt give away anything we cant get more of smoke murmured as he put his arms around her his hands careful and tender on her back as they sought to touch only the unhurt places for a moment cass let herself luxuriate in his arms in the promise of safety there but there was whiskey on his breath and the smell worked away at the thin wall shed put up over her promises to herself cass had once loved to kiss a man whod been drinking whiskey the way it tasted like a clue to something hard to find like earth after a rain and like a fire still burning she never drank it herself but there had been a dozen nights that had started with its promise not a promise actually but a trick it was casss best trick and also her only trick the way it worked she would have two shots back to back when she got to the bar vodka was easiest sometimes tequila it helped hone her instincts her senses and when she found the right onebent over a pool table laughing with his friends alone at the bar it didnt matter she always knewthe trick was that for a moment right before one of them spoke everything was possible because he could be the one who turned out to be different he could be the one to see her for who she was to understand that all her toughness wasnt anything but pain to know that she threw herself on the fire over and over again not to satisfy herself but to punish herselfwho would see and know all that and still want her and be strong enough to keep her from hurting herself long enough that she wouldnt have to hurt him just to make herself forget to make herself believe that it meant nothing because that was her dirtiest little secret of allit never really meant nothing she could walk away and walk away and walk away and walk away fuck a thousand men and forget all their names and pretend she didnt remember what they looked like or how their hands felt on her and get up the next day and do it again and again and yet it meant something every single time it meant another failure and another time she wasnt good enough and she wasnt wanted enough but that moment that moment when he first spoke when she caught the whiskey on his breath when he looked her up and down and really took his time when he touched her hand or brushed against her thigh when he told her that her eyes reminded him of someone or that she was the prettiest thing to ever walk into that particular bar she played her one trick and played it well she never lost her taste for the con she worked it every time because this might be the man who would truly know herand want her anyway and she felt it now felt it as she never had before when smoke settled his hand into the curve of her waist and drew her closer against him so she could feel him pressing against her making her hot and liquid and confused he was here with her again just like he was two nights ago he had taken great risks with her brought her gifts lain down with herand she longed to wonder if maybe just maybe this might be the time things would be different but tomorrow she would be going to find gloria and gloria would tell her what she needed to get inside the convent to get to ruthie and whatever she had to do cass would do and she would find ruthie and she would take ruthie back and she needed to save all her energy all her determination for that she could not afford to give up even one bit of her concentration for a man for the game she always played for the way she always punished herself she could not afford to hurt herself or revile herself not now she had to be strong so cass put her hand on smokes chest and with tears stinging her eyes she pushed him away and if she thought his hesitation and his longing might be for who she really was this time she also knew it was only a trick of her damned and fevered mind cass was in the far corner of the dirt lot behind the high timer this was familiar ground and if she wasnt proud exactly to be there backed up against the side of a pickup parked under a sycamore next to the driedup creek she wasnt sorry either no one could make her sorry because she owned this corner of the lot had driven dozens of men to begging and pleading and even crying hot salty tears here the first when she was barely seventeen years old only this one was different she wasnt sure how she got here couldnt conjure up a memory of the drinks he bought her or the songs he picked on the jukebox had he challenged her to pool so many of them did that thinking shed be impressed with their hardcrack breaks or their wily doublebank shots when cass had learned pool from the master himself silver dollar haverford her own daddy who could beat any man from portland down to tijuana or maybe he had danced with her the sly dip and glide of a farm boy with town manners why couldnt she remember she was pressed up against the cold hard door of the pickup and maybe theyd be better off inside the trucks bench seat would be good enough on a night turning cold fast like this one was when chilly air found its way up her skirt and inside her denim jacket she ran her fingers through his hair as he nuzzled her neck found it greasy and lank wondered what shed seen in him but his mouth on the sensitive dip between her collarbones insistent and hungry his beard scraping against her soft flesh only tonight the mans touch wasnt doing what it usually did it wasnt lighting tinder up and down her body setting the scene for a brush fire that would burn out of control until it pushed her into forgetting territory it felt wrong all wrong cass slid her hands between her body and his and shoved and he left off his sucking and biting with a growl of irritation and then she was staring into his face in the sickly light of the streetlamps mounted on galvanized steel poles and what stared back wasnt human its flesh was pocked and torn its lips were chewed to crusts its eyes were unfocused and confused and when it saw the look of fear on her face it crowed with excitement a sound that paralyzed her with unspeakable terror and as it lowered its face to her neck again she knew that this time it meant to tear her skin from the bone to rip it and chew it and swallow it even while she screamed and screamed and screamed except that it clapped a hand over her mouth and she was left gasping for breath and flailing and struggling to get away but the next second the thing became smoke and she realized she was in a tent in a tent in the box on a leaking air mattress with crazy thoughts crowding the dreams from her mind and replacing them with a nightmare made of every fear born in aftertime she stopped screaming and whimpered instead and smoke lifted his hand from her mouth slowly tentatively ready to clamp it back down if she didnt stay quiet she stayed quiet you had another nightmare he murmured she nodded testing the inside of her mouth with her tongue finding it metallic was it a bad one he asked and cass opened her eyes and found that she could see nothing at all in the dark tent and she suddenly wished she could wished she could see smokes face his eyes his mouth a mouth that was a bit too generous but without it his face might have been hard unapproachable instead she realized she had memorized the shape of that mouth and in the dark she reached for him and found his chin rough with stubble his eyelashes against her fingertips and finally his lips she brushed against them gently and he was very still so still she couldnt even feel him breathe theyre all bad she said softly cass if she had expected sympathy she was mistaken his voice was steel he clamped his hand over hers squeezed her fingers together until they hurt i canti dont he didnt want her cass had only been looking for comfort but the knowledge cleaved her anyway he held her hand away from his face as though it was a blade poised to slice through him and cass felt shame flood her like poison rushing through her veins she had wanted comfort but he didnt want her she knew that if she explained if she could find the words to describe the emptiness that could never be filled the chasm edged with cliffs of fear and longing that he would provide comfort after a fashion because he was a good man and only a good man would have come this far with her taken the risks they had taken a good man a prince in fact a damn boy scout in the killing emptiness her last best defense stirred a wrecked and battlehardened thing it had been born long ago when she first discovered what her need demanded when she first recognized her body for what it was that innocent frightened girl had become a temptress a serpentine thing all enticing all willing all temptation and cantsayno years ago she had been clumsy uncertain of her power but realizing she had nothing to lose gave her strength and she learned to twist and beckon and lure and ride until the men she found were all used up until she had sapped them of everything they had to give her which wasnt much after you discounted the terrible convulsions of their bodies and the momentary vulnerability in their glazed eyes other than that small gift they didnt even realize they gave there was nothing but release but shed have it now the angry girl had pushed off the bottom of her heart hurtled through the wavery place where cass had consigned her and crested the surface with a momentous burst of need and cass let her take over smoke had offered her kindness when kindness could kill her he deserved this cass didnt really believe that last conscious thought but she pushed the phrase through her mind nonetheless pushed it through and bit down on it and held it as the need took over he deserved this because he didnt want her after hed let her want him she yanked her hand back and she heard him take in his breath she crawled across the makeshift bed the hard ground through the limp air mattress hurting her knees and shoved the cheap blanket and sheets aside as she straddled his body cass his voice was alarmed but she had set this in motion now and it would not be stopped she bent over him and let the tshirt slide up over her thighs her hips leaving almost nothing between them she pressed herself against him and found him hard fiercely hard and he shuddered involuntarily and seized her wrists cass he said it again through gritted teeth he held her wrists so hard she felt her bones pressed together and sucked in her breath in pain but she didnt fight him he was stronger but she had other ways she let him hold her wrists she gave control of her arms over to him his for the moment but she had the rest of her body and she used it she rubbed herself slowly lightlyto smoke her touch must have felt tentative but it was the farthest thing from tentativeover him feeling the outline of his hard cock through the layers of cotton that might as well have not been there at all she closed her eyes and concentrated on letting everything else fall away because the more she gave herself over to the rush the less of her that was left behind it was a battle for control and the only way for her to control herself to control the chasm with its jagged cliff edges was to control him the man below her the man who she was trying to make into notsmoke to make into a stranger to make into no one because the old equation required a man who was nothing to her but he kept saying her name and that would wreck it god cass he choked out as though she was strangling him with the languid caress of her body against his shut up she commanded and pressed into him harder the shock of the contact between them hard meeting soft sent sensation through her a riveting jolt that emanated through her body but burned itself out long before it could reach her mind her legs her arms shut up please just shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up she ground out the words in time to her movement against him through her anger she felt her need grow and bloom he found her rhythm and moved with her this man beneath her this man who in the dark could be a stranger if she just tried hard enough he could be a stranger she felt his grip on her wrists weaken and she twisted her hands savagely and he let go his reflexes were slow too late he realized shed freed herself and tried to catch her again but she was quicker cass grabbed his hands before he could find her first she held his strong fingers in her hands and pressed them up under her shirt against her and when his fingers spasmed against her she knew it was instinct that guided him and that he would still work against it and so she leaned into his touch arching her back and moving so that her breasts fit themselves to his cupped hands and he had no choice thats what it felt like to her and she knew it must be the same for him that he had no choice as his fingers found her nipples and circled and seized from there there was no thought she plunged her fingers into his hair and lifted him to her so that his face was pressed against her and his mouth and lips and tongue were eager now he didnt fight he was hungry and he gave up any attempts to restrain her and held her to him his hands under her arms she felt his fingers splayed against the bones of her rib cage imagined it expanding with the breaths she sucked in noisy ragged breaths that were not graceful the things he did with his mouth made her writhe harder against him and the ride was no longer orchestrated by her it was a course they both followed because there was no other their hands went to their clothes in the same instant and twined together as they pulled and yanked and tossed aside he let go of her to pull his boxers down over his legs and the loss of his attentioneven for a secondenraged the need in her and she took him in her hand and rubbed him against her hottest wettest folds so that when he gasped and returned his hands to her sides he rocked into her just as she drove herself down on him and there was no hesitation no halfway nothing but trying to make him more inside and him trying to plunge farther she bucked extravagantly knowing it was coming the thunderous crest that could not be stopped now it was as sure as the sun blazing in the morning or thunder after lightning rips the sky she leaned back and put her hands on his legs so that her body tilted away from him if there was any light at all in the tent she knew that he would see her body long and strong and bent back as she rode him hard and that seeing her that way would send him past the point where he had any control at all and knowing thateven in the dark even where they saw nothing where the loss of one sense only heightened the others so it was their sharp breaths on the silent night the slap of sweatslicked flesh the grunting and syllables that were only parts of wordsall of this spiraled tighter and tighter and she squeezed her eyes shut and ground her teeth together and threw herself into the chasm past the treacherous cliffs and over the paindusted edges and into the nothing it was a long and spectacular fall and partway down he met her there and it was like they seized each other midair so that when the final crest splintered into blinding sensation she was aware of him there with her and it was new it was new it was like nothing shed ever felt before a feeling of being out of herself and part of him just for those seconds her energy stretching and flickering and it seemed incredibly dangerous like she might snap and not return to herself but she let it happen anyway and afterward she lay on top of him and waited for the part that had left her to come back and the part that was him to leave her and when it didnt happen right away she began to panic but even her panic wasnt enough to make her lift her body away from his because she lay in a state of such exhaustion and spent and total dissipation that moving was impossible much much later she felt his hands in her hair fingers gentle against her scalp working the strands into tangles and he said theyre applauding and while she tried to make sense of his words she marveled at the feel of his voice the way it formed in his chest and rumbled against her cheek and then she realized that he meant the sounds outside the tent which only now entered her conscious mind a smattering of clapping and laughter and one distinct voice saying thats how its done brother and another saying could everyone shut the fuck up and let the rest of us sleep cass burned with mortification she didnt remember making any soundin those final seconds her hearing seemed to have gone the way of her vision as though the darkness had stolen it toobut she must have cried out she didnt do that ordinarily but she remembered the cry building in her throat right before everything splintered and it must have been loud enough to wake up the people sleeping nearby her greater worrythe fact that the man beneath her was slowly turning back into smokewas too much to think about now she pushed her face into the hollow of his shoulder and willed herself not to think about it when he said very softly sweet dreams cass she said over and over in her mind i do not hear you i do not hear you i do not hear you because you arent really there in the morning she was alone in the tent and she thought smoke is a man who comes and goes quietly and then she thoughtruthie today was the day she would find out how to get inside the convent and she would search for her ruthie do the next right thing pats voicehello my name is pat and im an alcoholicsaid in her head all reasonable insistence the voice of a hundred meetings in the church basement pat listened pat never judged pat was bald except for a silver fringe on the back of his head and looked like he ought to be a grandfather and pat just kept listening what if i dont know the next right thing cass had demandedhad whined really if she were to be honestand pat had said its only one little next right thing cass dont think so hard and the guy with the red hairshe couldnt remember his name now because he didnt last more than a few monthshad muttered man plans and god laughs which had struck cass as funny and kind of clever in context a lot more clever than any of the stupid aa phrasesbut by summer that guy was gone and cass was still there so who was right in the end so she would do the next right thing and that thing was find gloria she took the little bucket of personal supplies to the bathroom and was relieved to find that there was no further charge to use it because smoke had done all their trading and she didnt know how it was done and she didnt feel like letting her ignorance show there was no sign of smoke and cass only saw a few other people trudging between the tents shivering in hoodies and flannel shirts and she realized that it was earlier than shed first thought maybe six or sixthirty on a latesummer morning when she returned to their tent she saw that faye was standing in front of it holding a steaming mug there you are she said with a sly smile sorry i was just at the uh ladies room word is you two put on a bit of a show last night faye said conversationally and cass felt her face redden hey you provided everyone some entertainment around here and you got something that did you good so chill you ready to go meet gloria yeah just let me getsomething she said and poked her head into the tent really she only wanted to see if smoke had returned but nothing looked disturbed the covers were still tangled her pack was where she left it okay im ready faye led her through the camp they passed the merchant stands where people were stacking and arranging their warestheir toothbrushes and playing cards and packets of aspirin and theraflu their paper plates and toilet paper and candles and cans of beans and condensed milk and chef boyardeeand righting overturned camp chairs and cleaning up litter from the night before a fire burned in a grate near where the remains of the bonfire smoldered and coffee boiled in a pot on top and cass felt her stomach growl well maybe later she could ask smoke to buy her a meal and coffeea cup of hot thick coffee but for now she would concentrate on gloria here faye said abruptly veering off to the left past the fencedoff area where the bike smoke had traded was parked next to other motorcycles and a few bicycles and skateboards the cheap seats cass hadnt noticed them the night beforea row of canvas cots lined up next to the fence in nearly all of them motionless forms slept under drab rough blankets a few possessions piled under the ends of the beds cass followed faye to the end of the row trying not to stare at the very end a woman with long gray hair escaping its braid sat with her back to them at the edge of her cot bent over her knees too late cass realized she was throwing up aw shit gloria faye exclaimed here ill clean it up ill clean it up the woman said hastily her voice reedy and frail a girls voice in a middleaged womans body im sorry i think i must have eaten something you mean like a fifth of cheap gin faye growled ill send someone you didnt get it on the bed did you no no i didnt i wouldnt do that okay well i brought you someone who wants to talk to you take a walk with her well have this taken care of when you get back yes yes thank you gloria said she stood and started to walk down the path along the fence not even looking at cass who hurried to catch up youre the girl wants to get in the convent she said when cass fell into step with her stealing a sideways glance as though she was afraid of being found out they told me youd come cass saw pale green eyes in a weathered face lashes bleached by the sun cheekbones that were still regal gloria had once been a beauty but cass saw something else something that was as familiar to her as the chipped heavy mugs at the meetings more regrets than a human being could keep hidden so that they found their way to the surface traced in the faint lines and creases of her skin i do want to get in she said carefully i need your help the corner of glorias mouth twitched a tic that only underscored her anxiety and darted a glance at cass how do i know know what that youre who you say you are that youre not one of theirs one ofwhose glorias tic intensified and she pressed a fist against her mouth pushing hard enough to turn her knuckles white they could have sent you mother cora and the rest to spy on me gloriai dont know who that is cass said trying to contain her impatience i just got here ive never been in there i need your helpplease theyre not supposed to come in here gloria whispered walking with her shoulders hunched its dors rule its his rule the peoplefrom the convent they arent allowed in here in the box they cant come in here but im here they let me in here so i cant be from there right cass felt a little silly trying to reason with gloria but she could tell that the womans fear was real very gently cass touched her thin shoulder gloria startled at the touch but after a moment she sighed and gave cass another sidelong glance pushing at the long gray hair that had come loose and tumbled around her shoulders i wish i had an elastic she said for my hair do you have an elastic no im sorry cass said okay thats how it isanytime you think of something that would actually be useful you can never find it you mean in my house i lived on the first floor of a nice old house you should have seen iti had a collection of tea tins the ones with the pretty designs on them some of them were my mothers oh some of them were very old and i dont know they may have been valuable to someone but i didnt even care about them they were justalways there you know she sketched a shelf in the air with her fingers and cass knew she was seeing the tins in her mind the way they looked in her kitchen cass had done the same thing a thousand times nearly everyone hadremembering the things that were lost but then gloria chopped the air with the hand that had been tracing a memory a harsh gesture followed by a sharper exhalation i never used them they were empty all of them and they sat there and i looked at them all the time and i never took them off the shelf and put anything in them and thenone day in the convent i was on washing me and a woman namedsomething maybe it was alice we were pinning the clothes on the line we had the cheap clothespins a pack of a thousand someone got from the walmart but you know before and they were in this plastic bag and they kept spilling out and we tried to twist the top closed but it just kept opening all those clothespins lying on the ground and i thought my tinsit would have been perfect the clothespins in the tins and i wished right then that i had one of them even one just one i would put the clothespins in the tin and there would be that one perfect thing the one thing that was the way it ought to be you know and the thing was not only did cass know but glorias explanation was deadon shed had the same complicated regret herself over and over the mourning for some small thing not because she missed the object itself but because in that moment everything seemed off all solutions were imperfect solutions and that wasnt a bad thing necessarily because you learned to improvise you learned to make do except for once in a while when it hit you like this i know she said and touched gloria gently gloria looked at her then looked at the arm where cass had touched her and her eyes clouded and she picked at her crusty chapped lip why do you want to go in there its not nice there oh i dont thats not why im here i dont want to join im looking for my daughter ruthie as she said the name the feeling was there again the fear that ruthie was not in the great looming stadium that she was nowhere near here maybe she was nowhere at all anymore gloria put a hand to her cheek and frowned how old is your daughter almost three three in september if anyone was still keeping track by then gloria shook her head theres little ones there but they change all their names when theyre baptized baptized yes into the order in the ceremony where they take their first communion and get their new names there was a note of sympathy in her voice and she fixed her troubled gaze on cass her confusion momentarily lessened tell me about your little girl what does she look like so cass told the hair so pale in the sun that it looked like flashing dimes the rosebud mouth that could crumple into a wobbly frown one moment and lift into a blazing smile the next the fold in her chubby arms where the baby fat was still smooth and soft as she talked cass found herself speeding up panicking with the knowledge that her baby was months older now that the rounded elbows and dimpled knees might have disappeared that her hair would be longer and she would have a dozen new freckles and have learned to do things cass couldnt even imagine cass couldnt know all the ways ruthie would have grown and changed and it felt like a betrayal i dont know gloria said interrupting cass midsentence shaking her head its too hard to know and they change them they mix them up like they mix me up i heard talk what do you mean what kind of talk gloria twisted her mouth into an expression of fury hypocritical talk she spat the kind i cant stand the kind that drove me right back out here right back to the bottleshe didnt say it but it was clear to cass and cass didnt judge she knew how it wasthe filament that wasnt strong enough the way it stretched and stretched before it snapped leaving you hurtling through the air toward devastation still there was hope there were girls in the convent and one of them could be ruthie and she would find out but she needed gloria to focus they approached an old picnic bench set on uneven ground under a dead pepper tree lets sit she suggested sweeping dirt and twigs off the splintered wood and gloria sat her expression troubled and confused what kind of talk did you hear cass pleaded hoping the woman could keep it together a little longer talk talk gloria muttered she found a groove in the weathered wood with her forefinger her hands were surprisingly elegant unlined and narrow with long fingers and neat nails she rubbed at the groove gently seemingly oblivious to the splintered edges they said i didnt have enough faith i said they didnt have enough faith i know what i know i watchedthe sun painted the rocks and i saw god i told them that but they said i didnt have the faith i wouldnt drink the essence so they said i didnt have the faith saw godgloria when did you see god glorias skittering gaze landed on her and stayed like a butterfly on a coneflower skittish matthew before matthewbefore he was gone who was matthew matthew gloria glared at her affronted and cass watched her awareness fade in the eddies and whorls of memory i married himwe went to yosemite i watched god in the mornings the way he painted the rocks with the sun matthew was there we were happy she startled out of her reverie and seemed surprised to find cass there i married him she repeated sternly we were happy they cant tell me i dont have faith her twitching fingers went to her mouth again covering pinching worrying and cass could sense gloria turning inward again who knew what happened to matthewmaybe he was glorias childhood sweetheart dead twenty years in an accident or maybe hed been taken or died of fever only months ago either way gloria wore the loss like an amulet a token against the weight of aftertime im sorry about matthew cass said gently gloria made a sound in her throat and nodded dropping her hands to her lap she only wanted to be heard cass thoughtonly that and for things to be different what anyone wanted but cass needed more from her im so sorry to ask but is there anything else you can tell me about what goes on in there with the babies the little girls how theyre cared for where they end up gloria was shaking her head before cass finished speaking not little girls not she mumbled not little girls anymore what do you mean when theyre done when theyre baptized theyre only vessels theres nothing left inside what cass managed to whisper her throat twisting closed be thou a vessel of innocence gloria chanted softly the skin twitched near her left eye scoured clean of this world they baptized them what else did they do the hair and the dress gloria mumbled all the little dresses white for purity purity for innocence and no talking no no no talking they put them in baptism dresses cass repeated scrambling to make sense of glorias tormented muttering and theres no talking during the ceremony and what happens next scoured clean the phrase raised the hairs along her arm what does that mean gloria theywash or scrub them somehow gloria peeked at cass her darting eyes bright with her fevered thoughts you wont know her she said sadly dont go shes not yours anymore shes innocent now and they hide them ruthie was always innocent cass wanted to scream wanted to make gloria see her the way she had been in her denim overalls and tiny little flowered tshirt falling asleep in casss lap but gloria pushed herself off the bench and started walking again her footsteps unsteady and lurching cass went after her put a hand on her arm gloria yanked away from her touch crossing her arms tightly in front of her shaking her head please cass said justjust tell me what you can anything just help me get in there you cant go in you dont believe i cass stopped herself considered her words the wrong ones would make gloria retreat even further the haze of broken memories and tangled thoughts around gloria seemed to condense and retreat when cass was too direct when she brought up specifics but specifics were what she needed a plan for gaining entry did you believe gloria was silent for a moment she touched her weathered fingertips to the chain link of the fence and let them trail along the metalsurely gloria wasnt the only resident who walked off her nextday ills around this track two ways she finally said if youre a believer thats one it has to show though i was real and it showed god was with me then and it showed everyone could see it you dont have god on you so that wont work cass was surprised that the words stung do you mean that i she struggled to find the right words i dont seem pious enough i can be different i can gloria was shaking her head god comes and goes but hes always there but they dont know that you cant put god on nowhell come back when hes ready but they dont know that but how do iwhat can i do to make them think im you know a believer you have to barter gloria said you can buy your way in but you have to ask the right one the right one you have to ask the right one gloria repeated enunciating with care as though speaking to someone with limited powers of comprehension her breath redolent with rot and withered hope washed over cass and it was all she could do not to turn away please tell me who the right one is now it was gloria who wrapped her sunburned fingers around casss arm and drew her into the shade of a clump of creosote bushes growing from a ditch eroded into the edge of the path cass glanced around no one took note of them they were hidden from the interior of the box by a series of clotheslines strung on poles sheets and pillowcases and towels flapping in the breeze someone was singing on the other side a tuneless wandering melody too distant for cass to make out words the scent of cotton drying in the sun reached her and she inhaled deeply but she caught herself before she could close her eyes and let the smell take her back to before itll cost you there was a shrewdness to gloria now no surprise thirst could conjure thin moments of clarity cass remembered no matter how far gone you got you could always get your shit together enough to go to the allnight liquor store when you ran into the bottom of the bottle how much she asked thinking of the bike smoke had traded the things hed bought for them the merchants with their carnival booths of enticements she hadnt wanted to take from him to shift the balance in the strange and unwelcome ledger of their relationship but what choice did she have i can pay what can you give me glorias words were quick eager hungry i dont know cass hedged if she made it too easy gloria would tell her anything just to get the payoff quicker it depends on what you have to tell me lets get something now just a little glorias voice went high and wheedling and she twisted her lips into a smile that didnt mask her thirst soon cass said but we need to talk first i can talk during you know i can talk and we can share we could share couldnt we her eagerness both repelled cass and tore at her heart it had been hard enough before when she could drink her nights away in the solitude of her trailer when she had a paycheck no matter how paltry to trade for the numbness shed never had to beg like this how have you been getting by she asked gloria softly gloria blinked rapidly and glanced toward the far end of the box her fingertips going to her throat in a nervous protective gesture ido some things cass suddenly understood the blue tentsthe groping in the dark and muffled cries of release a hand job for a sixpack of warm beer ten minutes on your knees to buy a few hours of oblivion and yet gloria seemed to prefer life in the boxdrinking down the wages of cutrate blow jobs sleeping on a cot out in the elements marking time with the level in the bottleto life in the order shed come here thinking of the convent as a place of safety of sanctuary it was well guarded against the threats of aftertimebeaters as well as rebuilders and raiders but gloria was clearly afraid of it and she couldnt even tell cass exactly what had become of ruthie now staring at the tall curved walls lit up with the yellow sun of midmorning cass wondered what waited for her lets just talk cass said gently and then well get you taken care of i promise the sun was high in the sky by the time gloria finished telling her what she knew which guards on which shift traded with the outside which took bribes glorias words wandered and drifted and in the end cass had no names to go by just sketchy descriptions gloria said cass should try in the late afternoon which was the most coveted shift and hence the one that the most powerful guards in the orderthe crooked oneskept for themselves the orders ranks had swelled and they were turning away far more wouldbe members than they accepted even here cunning trumped good intentions had it always been that way sometimes it seemed to cass that the way it had been before the codes and habits of social order were shifting and changing in her memory like a dream she was forgetting but all that mattered now was that the odds of buying her way in were better than talking her way in it wasnt much but at least she could pay it would have to do there was one last thing that cass wanted and gloria knew someone who could take care of it after cass bought her a plastic soda bottle filled with cloudy liquorthe cheapest they had signed for with smokes namegloria led cass through the rows of tents on their way to the boxs only barber sipping from the bottle along the whole way already she was more relaxed the tremors in her fingers disappeared and the deep grooves eased from the corners of her mouth and between her browsalmost making up for the vacancy in her watery eyes near the end of the tents where sleeping quarters gave way to a row of barter stands and shacks a duskyskinned man with a heavy limping gait and chains looped from his belt stepped in front of them hey gloria he said drawing out the syllables of her name suggestively new batch come in this morning young ones guess they went to depaul community college been living in a dorm there lost a couple on the triptheyre a mess better hope none of em decide to stay back here and cut into your business theyre smokin hot know what i mean he pantomimed an obscene bump and grind winking at cass fuck you haskins gloria muttered pushing him out of the way and stumbling past youll be at my door by tonight begging for it just ignore him cass said his laughter following them down the row hell be back gloria muttered cant stay away but as they continued down the path it seemed to cass that she walked with less certainty cass figured she understood the biggest downside to making a living by selling off bits of your soulwhat happened if one day they quit buying but by the time they reached the barber stand gloria seemed to have recovered and when cass tried to give her a hug she slipped away her eyes already focused elsewhere cass watched her go her long silver hair catching the sun despite its knots and snarls and tried not to think about where she was headed a man tilted back in a deck chair under an awning constructed from a tarp feet up on a stump reading a paperback in the shade of a large straw hat elaborate vine tattoos snaked up both arms disappearing into his tshirt he marked his place with a dollar bill and tipped his chair down when he stood and took off his hat cass saw that his hair was shaved into an elaborate spiral pattern at your service he said with an exaggerated bow im vinson can i do something for you today yes ithought you could even it up she touched the jagged ends of her hair selfconsciously it was vanity sheer vanity and she felt her face color at the thought she was doing this for smoke and that was not all right so she forced him out of her mind and focused on her hair it was her one pretty feature according to her mother at eighteen cass had chopped it short and dyed it black anything to further the wedge between her and mim growing her hair out had been a first step back when she started to get better when she started to believe in herself again when she realized that to be good enough for ruthie she had to treat herself as though she was good enough it had taken so long so much hard work to start to believe and her hair had been a small daily reminder to take care of herself now it was ugly again but maybe there was a way to make it all right she looked over the table where the tools of vinsons trade were laid out a straight razor scissors combs mirrors a spray bottle of water small towels were folded and stacked i can pay later if thats okay iwehave credit ah vinson said youre the girl who came in with smoke you know him by reputation only until last night we had a drink together whiskey on his breath the memory of their fevered coupling flooded casss mind and she felt herself flush her veins throbbing with the mad coursing of her blood oh hes hesaround here somewhere this ones on the house then for what he did standing up to the rebuilders times are only going to get harder well need more like him you think theyll come here cass asked all this way theyve already been here make no mistake about that vinson said pulling over a chair and motioning for her to sit just the scouts so far coming around to see what weve got before they send their little army in only i figure your pal smoke mightve given them something to think about he chuckled as he wrapped an old bedsheet around her cape style fastening it with a binder clip he picked up the bottle and started spraying water on her hair lifting it with his fingers the cool mist felt good on her skin and cass relaxed a little you mean because he killed some of them vinson snorted not just anyone either angel he took out tappthe guy who started that whole mess remember when they used to hunt bin laden all over the place before well it was like thattapp was the big leader the figurehead and your buddy smoke blew his head off and left the body twitching like a stuck pig and you can bet the guys he let go ran back to tell the story all over colima cass thought of evangeline her cruel eyes and ruthless smile theyll just keep coming though thats right thats right that crews relentless they aint giving up thats for sure he picked up a welltended clean pair of shears so this was a doityourself job no problem im getting pretty good at cleaning those up cass flinched with the first cut but after that it went smoothly as the shears found a rhythm vinson hummed a tune familiar but also not wandering up and down a minor scale cass closed her eyes and let drowsiness take her over when she felt his hands in her hair brushing out the stray cut pieces she sighed with the pleasure of a moment of luxury how about i throw in a little extra service i dont exactly have customers lined up and its been a while since i got to try anything fun what was it you used to do cass asked as he picked up a plastic tub of boxes and bottles that had been stowed beneath the table tattoos mostly and piercing but dont worry im trained for hair too went to school and all cut hair in a supercuts before i got my shop cass put her fingers to her hair it was short and silky against her fingertips longer in the back than near the front where the new growth blended in no one would know that she had pulled her own hair from her scalp that a scant month or two ago she had been fevered and frantic touching her hair cass realized that for the first time she was able to swallow back the thought without it nearly killing her yes she said softly do it an hour later she smelled faintly of ammonia and her soft brown roots faded to white at the tips vinson waved away her promises to make sure he was paid ill see smoke tonight ill get him to buy me a drink and well call it square she didnt tell him that shed be gone by then she searched for smoke up and down the rows a few daytime drunks lay passed out here and there but guards rousted those in the neat paths and shuffled them off to the area where cass had found gloria earlier cass figured that a cot there was part of the deal for the most hardcore drinkers the ones who wouldnt spend money on a tent when it could instead feed their addiction ormore likelymaybe even these mean accommodations came with a price and those who couldnt pay were tossed out at night she averted her eyes from the bodies lying on the cots limbs splayed over the edges and wondered what kind of man dor must be to send people back out to fend for themselves just because they couldnt afford a cot she didnt find smoke near the front where a handful of travelers were checking in with george going through the ritual of laying out their possessions on the table she searched the stalls ignoring the vendors calling out offers of underwear socks sweaters grooming products packaged food when she couldnt find smoke anywhere in the camp she steeled herself and ducked through a space in the rows to where a makeshift bar gathered a variety of people standing and sitting on plastic chairs they nursed drinks from mugs and plastic cups and smoked down expertly rolled joints in nooks created by blankets hung from poles she saw people shooting up or huddled over pipes but still no smoke the sun had begun to descend in the sky and cass was starting to get nervous gloria had advised her to go before the evening meal while the deacons responsible for reviewing candidates for the order would still be assembled evenings were devoted to prayer and silence as were mornings conversation was allowed only between the morning and evening meals she considered asking around to see if anyone had seen smoke so many people seemed to know about what hed done how hed fought the rebuilders but the mortification of having been caught the night before stopped her there was no way to know who had heard them and who hadnt still she had searched nearly everywhereeverywhere but the line of blue tents and she stared at them for long moments trying to decide a few had their flaps tied back flashes of a bare leg or braceleted wrists visible from the depths where women waited for customers but most of the tents were closed their occupants busy inside gloria was in one of them cass guessed since she hadnt spotted her anywhere else the thought pained her and she wished shed had something more to give gloria but she knew it wouldnt make any difference cass was not in a position to judge and never would be again she turned away there was only one other place she hadnt looked a construction trailer mounted on blocks near the edge of the box that backed up against the stadium its windows were shaded by miniblinds and a guard sat in a chair out front cass had no doubt that this was where dor kept his office it was the only place left that she hadnt looked she deliberated for only a moment before heading for the trailershe could deliver the message from sammi and make one last effort to find smoke and then be on her way up close she could see that the area around the trailer was tended even more meticulously than the rest of the encampment gravel had been raked into neat beds around three sides and edged with brick in a neat row down the middle grew a row of coreopsis young plants with only a few orange buds among the dark green leaves cass looked closer amazed she hadnt seen coreopsis since the second strike the one carried out on a rainy new years day a few hours before the california dawn the missiles had struck all across north america within moments of each other and remarkably no reports of death had surfaced as the weapons struck deserts and plains and mountain gorges and broke apart releasing their toxins some people said they smelled something bitter in the misty air of morning but cass didnt believe it the poisons went to work with the brilliant efficiency that it had taken the worlds scientists a decade to perfect and by dusk of the first day of the new year eighty percent of the plants that survived the first round of strikes began to wither and droop coreopsis was a tough plant weedy and fibrous but that hadnt helped a week into january it lay dead on the ground along with everything else yet here it was like the tiny redwood seedlings theyd seen along the road come back to life electric cords snaked through the flower bed to a generator that hummed off to the side in a canvas chair out front sat a boy too young to know how to use the semiautomatic rifle he held loosely across his lap he watched cass expressionlessly as she approached yeah i was wondering if i could see dor cass said open hours at five oclock cass didnt point out the obvious that she hadnt seen any clocks or watches in the compound other than the one the young guard wore strapped to his wrist i have a message from his daughter the boy narrowed his eyes and his grip on the gun was suddenly not as casual he doesnt have a daughter i say he does look ill wait out here while you ask him i wouldnt risk it if i were you her name is sammi the guard hesitated glancing up the three metal steps to the trailers door just a minute he finally said stay right there when he knocked sharply and entered the trailer cass exhaled a breath she hadnt realized she was holding it took only a moment before the door was flung open and the guard came back out followed by a man who stepped out onto the small platform at the top of the stairs cass squinted into the setting sun and took an involuntary step back dor macfall was not what she expected he was a few inches over six feet tall and broad through the chest his arms tanned dark and bulging with muscle in his plain navy tshirt his nearblack hair was cut in a militarystyle brush cut and cass wondered briefly if vinson was the one who cut it or for that matter if vinson had done any of the ink that snaked up this mans arms the design was clearly aftertime a twisted braid of kaysev leaves and stems done entirely in blueblack small silver hoops studded the cartilage of his ears several on each side he wore no other jewelry no rings not even a belt buckleor for that matter a beltin his canvas pants his boots were wellworn leather work boots suited for hard labor and looking at him it was easy to believe hed done more than his share most alarming were his eyes they would be called blue cass supposed but the pigment was so pale that they looked almost like clouds unlike the beaters though they were centered with large black irises they were fringed by thick black lashes and would have been too pretty for a man if they werent so frighteningly intense the other thing that cass noticed about dor was how close his shave was shaving in aftertime had become an inexact science even disposable blades were used over and over sharpened by hand imperfectly a lot of men had adopted a technique of holding the blade away from their faces so as not to cut themselves and invite infection so they were never free of stubble she herself only the day before had cut herself with the dubious razor included in the tub of supplies smoke had rented for their use but dor stood before her glowering his wide firm jaw perfectly smooth with only the faintest shadow of beard his forehead however was crossed with a scar that stood out against the smooth planes of the rest of his face it started at the hairline and cut across one eyebrow ending at the top of his right cheekbone a relatively recent wound a couple of months old at most still angry and raised maybe hed gotten it fighting the rebuilders but as cass stared into his cold eyes it seemed far more likely that dor was a man who only looked out for himself what do you want he growled his strange eyes flickering i have a message from sammi so im told how do i know youre not lying cass blinked why would i lie i dont know why would you what are you selling im not selling anything his laugh was abrupt and contained not a bit of mirth dont kid yourself everyones selling something some people are just more honest about it but ill tell you what you dont look much like a girl scout to me know what im saying cass felt her skin grow hot as dors gaze traveled down her body he didnt bother to mask his admiration look do you want to hear the message or not i really doubt that she said to tell you she hasnt missed a night the change that came over dor was complete and instant he froze but not before his entire body seemed to release its coiled hostile energy and his crazy eyes lost their hardness after a moment he lifted a hand to the back of his neck and left it there a gesture of defeat as much as uncertainty i dont know what that means cass added she just said to tell you she never forgets and that she wont miss until she sees you again dor stared at her for an uncomfortably long time but cass kept her shoulders squared her chin lifted and stared back it was the least she could do for sammi finally dor dropped the hand from his neck and opened the door to the trailer cass thought he was going to leave her standing outside alone but at the last second he turned i think youd better come inside it took a moment for casss eyes to adjust to the dim interior of the trailer it was orderly and clean but jammed with shelves a desk several office chairs and an object that astonished cass more than anything shed seen yet an enormous flatpanel monitor with an open spreadsheet she hadnt seen a computer in use since the siege and there was smoke sitting in a straightback chair across from the desk long legs splayed out in front of him arms folded across his chest his eyebrows lifted slightly in surprise a slow smile warming his face you know each other dor said not so much sitting as crashing into his desk chair this is the woman im traveling with the one i told you about then weve got a problem dor said one of you isnt telling the truth nice hair smoke remarked ignoring him cass felt herself blush as she sat in the remaining chair her knees brushing against smokes and even that small contact rocked her in the hollow depths where sensation and desire twined together how was it possible that she could feel this way as she prepared for her trip into the convent as she faced yet another round of unknown dangers how could there be room for anything in her mind besides ruthie who was her waking thought and her evening prayer and yet her body longed to touch smoke again and to touch him completely she imagined sliding down onto the floor onto her knees she wanted to bury her face against his hardmuscled stomach wanted him to run his hands over her shorn hair to trace the outlines of her ears to slip his fingers into her mouth and then she wanted him to pull her up onto his lap and she wanted to kiss him hard the one taboo she could never break she could never risk it never take the chance that the disease lived in her saliva that it waited and burned within her longing for a hostnone of that mattered as she thought about what it would be like she wanted to taste his lips and tease them open with her tongue and she wanted him to meet her kiss with his own demanding unyielding his hands in her hair pressing her to him as he we have a problem here dor repeated why would you say that smoke said though his gaze remained on cass you told me you came from sacramento dor addressed smoke and while his tone was calm there was a threat below the surface cass noticed that his scar looked even worse in the glow from the monitor she says shes talked to my daughter my daughters in silva smoke shrugged so what youre an entrepreneur in these times im sure that comes with risks you have tohedge your bets right so i said sacramentoits a small detail unimportant to any business we might do where i come from doesnt matter as you said yourself anything i have to sell will be checked and authenticated before goods change hands smoke had lied then why the answer came to her as he touched the small of her back leaving his hand there weighty and warm a comforting touch he was protecting his own the people of the school they were his people hed said it himself they were all he had and while they had been strangers to him not long ago if it made sense to defend anything at all aftertime he would defend them lets just say it goes to character dor focused his unwavering gaze on cass tell me what you know about sammi all of it so she did leaving out the details of her own arrival at the school she told him that sammi and her mother were healthy and had plenty to eat that the school was wellguarded and stocked she described the courtyard with its communal meals the kids in the sunny room where sammi and her friends led games and activities she told him how sammi had asked her to pass along her message but didnt add that she recognized the hunger in sammis eyes for an absent father the hurt and confusion these things she kept to herself because she knew how fiercely she guarded her own painand she would not betray sammi that way especially because dor did not react while she talked he listened dispassionately jaw set strange eyes heavylidded and inscrutable when she was done he nodded once and turned his attention to the keyboard in front of him he tapped at a couple of keys thank you he said well what are you going to do cass asked do about sammi you said shes doing wellas well as can be expected under the circumstances anyway yes but she wants to see you cass said what good would that do the best way i can help her is by staying away thats not listen dor snapped pardon my bluntness but you dont know one fucking thing about whats best for her if i go to silva now i leave this place unattended my people are goodthe best i can findand they are well trained but they need a leader now aftertime more than ever theres too much at stake between the rebuilders and the thieves and the damn zombies there are people waiting and watching for a weakness and if you dont think theyll move in faster than you can turn around then youre deluding yourself not that i blame you denials the best thing a lot of people have now and you can look around this place and find proof of that at the bottom of every bottle in every pill i sell in the comfort tents i dont judge i provide but i do defend whats mine his fury escalated as he talked and he smacked his palm down flat on the desk for emphasis making a row of pens jump and skitter cass knew he was right the community hed built here was thriving practically teeming with life even if it was tainted and selfdestructive but it couldnt survive on its own energy alone it needed a constant inflow of product and consumers and someone to make sure the wheels of commerce kept turning you could send supplies smoke said he turned to cass the road clearing we sawhes got a hand in that we play a minor part most of its the rebuilders you work with them cass demanded not with but not against i dont take sides dor said im neutral and i intend to stay that way youre not neutral if youre supplying the resistance thats before thinking it doesnt apply anymore how can you say that were still human were never going to stop trying to build societies smoke answered as long as theres anyone left on this planet people are going to be putting communities back together and going to war over them cass watched the interplay between the two men as fascinated as she was repelled an energy oscillated there a sparking electric tension that seemed like it could erupt into violence at the slightest provocation two determined men one passionate about justice the other ruthless and cynical but she had her own quest to think about once she got ruthie she might have the luxury of arguing abstract points about the future of the planet for now she could only afford to be interested in how these two men could help her im going into the convent she said to dor i dont know if smoke told you i need some things personal stuff and something i can trade dor regarded her with renewed interest why would you want to go in there you dont strike me as a believer cass shrugged pretending a calm she didnt feel she wasnt about to tell him about ruthie he seemed like a man who sought to know everyone elses trump card while keeping his own hand hidden i have my reasons fair enough he let his gaze linger on her face its a waste of a damn fine woman if you dont mind me saying maybe i like other women dor laughed wont make any difference if you dothey take vows of celibacy cass raised an eyebrowshe doubted such a vow held much meaning in a world where comforts were so desperately rare it would be impossible to stop people from seeking out the few that remained i dont plan to be there long enough to get that hard up she said about those supplies ill cover her macfall smoke said his hand moved slightly lower on her back his fingers dipping into the waistband of her pants give her what she needs dor considered his scar creasing as he furrowed his brow with thought i can give her an escort someone theyll trust we can get the job doneprovided youre willing to pay a premium i think weve already established that i will the iciness in smokes voice highlighted the tension between the men and sent an unfamiliar thrill through cass there didnt seem to be a limit to the sacrifices smoke was willing to make for her which was exactly what she needed right shed do whatever it tookcheat lie steal from him if need beto get to ruthie only he was giving her everything she needed without being asked and that felt like standing at the edge of a cliff and being tempted to jump cass forced the thought from her mindthere was nothing to be gained from questioning smokes generosity besides this was a drama that held no place for her a negotiation about far more than just her passage into the convent in that case dor said pushing back from the desk and standing i believe our business here is done cass and smoke stood in the shade of a bent pepper tree before it had been one of casss least favorite species with its scabby bark and spiky unadorned branches aftertime it had endeared itself to her merely by surviving ill be out as soon as i can cass said as soon as i find ruthie smoke reached out a roughcallused hand and touched her face drawing a line from her cheek down to her mouth tracing the line of her lower lip i wish i could go with you cass attempted a smile his eyes glinted with worry and frustration but ill be here waiting and if you dont come back soon he didnt finish the thought what could he promise after all the task ahead was up to cass alone others had helped her prepare but once she went inside she was on her own i will come back she said softly smoke stroked her mouth softly with his thumb and it was all she could do not to part her lips and to taste his workrough skin i want to kiss you smoke whispered his face inches from hers his voice rough and dangerous let me kiss you no she shook her head pushed his hand away but he just pressed closer she could feel his hot breath on her face no im not afraid i cant i canti wont be responsible for poisoning him for the chanceno matter how smallthat the disease lived within her in her saliva in her mouth and her throat roiling and festering while she talked and breathed and swallowed she would not take that chance she would not let smoke die because of her like bobby had like ruthie almost had i dont care i do the anger in her voice took them both aback cass pulled away and smoke let her they regarded each other in the golden light of late afternoon a slight breeze carrying the scents of sage and wood smoke the faint strains of someones lazy guitar picking and they might as well have been staring across a chasm a mile wide and deep i care cass repeated and then she ran not looking back straight for the way out of the box and into the convent and the next hard thing she must do she cared a great deal about not destroying anyone else but even worse she cared about smoke and that was even more dangerous the sun was slipping toward the horizon and the smell of food carried on the breeze when cass made her way to the front gate faye was playing chess with the guard on duty a young man with a dirty fedora pulled over his eyes he muttered something that passed for a greeting but barely looked up from the board everything youll need is in here faye said picking up a pack from the barter counter and shaking the contents out onto the table a plastic water bottlenever opened an incredible rarityrolled across the surface there were socks and underwear and kaysev cakes wrapped in cloth napkins there was a folded tshirt and a packet of aspirin i cant give you a weapon if they found it youd be out on your ass or worse cass nodded and faye returned all the supplies to the pack before handing it over back soon charles faye told the other guard as cass slid the straps over her shoulders think hard before you make that next move or ill take you in three cass figured that faye was the best dor had to offer she reminded herself that smoke was paying dearly for her escort to help negotiate entry dor was shrewd but a part of cassthe part that had promised a brave and tenderhearted girl that she would find her fatherhoped there was more to it than that hoped dor cared whether she lived or died faye didnt talk on the short walk to the stadium and cass didnt mind she concentrated on the view trying to fix every detail in her memory the ruins of san pedro seemed far less dangerous now that she was headed into the convent behind them the box was lit up with strings of tiny lightbulbs like a city christmas tree lot before the darkening hills were shrouded with purple nightfall tree skeletons silhouetted in black and the street theyd followed into town only yesterday lined with wrecked and empty shops and apartmentsit all seemed harmless now a stage set of a town the actors and stagehands due back from their break at any moment cass had become a connoisseur of fear had learned to sense its moods its encroachment and retreat yesterday the fear had weighed upon her slunk all around her crushing and smothering and stealing her breath a shapeshifter playing the unknown into a thousand different threats today it was different todays fear was sharp and focused and came from within the stadium beyond the curved windowless walls and it was crafty and cruel a foe that meant to outwit and inveigle cass made a small low humming in her throat gathering her anxiety into a single strand and twisting it out of the way she was so focused on her own fear that she didnt hear the faroff wail for a moment but it escalated sharply and pierced her consciousness sounds like they got one faye said pausing to listen cass looked down the street that angled away from the stadium toward the center of town following fayes lead and thought she saw a bobbing point of light got what a beater theyve got this cart thingits like a dogcatcher van you mean they catch them alive yeah faye laughed softly cmon i told you theyre fucking lunatics in there wait so youre saying the order they dont do it themselves they pay dor and he sends a team out theyve pretty much cleaned out the town but every once in a while youll get a few that wander in usually they can only catch one and have to kill the rest cass edged back a step toward the stadium other people had hunted the beaters back at the beginning but when it became clear how hard it was to kill them most people gave up they were just so relentless an ordinary human would stop if he took a bullet or a face full of acid or in the case of the more resourceful citizens who didnt have access to anything else a thrown hatchet or a rock flung from a sling but beaters when they came close to a potential victim were almost unstoppable they didnt seem to react to pain or injury unless it was mortal and even in their death throes they would keep advancing everyone had a story of a beater with a crushed skull or a severed limb spending its dying moment dragging itself toward its prey too often it bit before it died isnt thatcrazy they have gear faye shrugged protective masks and all shit from the manufacturing plant and if you know dor you know he believes in outgunning the enemy theyre armed from here to sunday but what do they do with them i mean the ones they catch thats their business faye said some crazy ritual shit is what i heard who cares they pay out the ass cass followed faye across the street and along the broad sidewalk that circled the stadium glancing back once but the light had been extinguished and all was silent when faye stopped at a boardedup entrance that looked like every other one and knocked on the naileddown plywood there was a click above their heads cass looked up to see a small window cut into the wall sliding open weapons a female voice demanded faye slid her revolver from its holster just the usual whos with you wannabe shes from mariposa showed up yesterday the story theyd come up with was that cass had worked in a churchrun child care center before and missed the structure and leadership of the church that she hoped to find a faith community from which she could help bring a set of guiding beliefs to aftertime survivors cass had been skeptical that anyone would believe her but faye said most of the women being turned away didnt bother to disguise the fact that they were just looking for shelter they want sheep not opportunists act all pious and hungry for the light and whatever convince them they can mold you and youll be fine i cant believe anyone would sign up for something like that on purpose well people are desperate to believe in something faye said matteroffactly you got a cult situation it dont matter what theyre selling what people are buying is a chance to belong to something for someone to tell them what to do so they dont have to think for themselves just like the fuckers who started this whole mess trying to force their ideologies down other peoples throats and getting everyone killed instead the plywood barrier slid open its soundless smooth glide hinting at welloiled hardware and expert craftsmanship it closed as soon as they stepped inside and they found themselves in a small antechamber that still held the detritus of ball games played long ago redandsilver posters and pennants and a desk inscribed with the miners logo two women waited tensed and ready in the small room a short brunette with a strawberry birthmark on her cheek trained a gun on cass and a wiry young woman with crooked teeth regarded them from the raised platform that had allowed her to look out of the peephole both were dressed simply in longsleeved pink shirts and skirts that hung past their knees their hair pulled back from their faces hey faye said by way of greeting lorrie jennie this is cass take off your belts and packs the guard with the gun ordered ignoring the greeting stand against the wall cass followed fayes lead resisting the temptation to watch as the woman went through her things while the darkhaired guard finished the pack check the blonde frisked cass quickly mostly patting around her pockets and checking her shoes and bra and cass gritted her teeth to keep from reacting when she patted down her scarred back okay you can relax youll get your things back later after your interview this what we asked for the first guard demanded as she hefted a small paperwrapped package that shed taken from fayes pack yes plus a little extra insurance yeah yeah faye nodded check it out after i leave make sure it gets where its going the rest is for you but i couldnt get the menthols just the light s maybe next week the guard nodded and slipped the package into her skirt pocket i appreciate it likewise cigarettes in contrast to the drugs dor moved inside the box the idea seemed almost quaint to cass it was ironic how fiercely california had fought smokers before banning them from every square foot of public space now something that could kill you over decades seemed like a good bet hell maybe she ought to take up smoking herself nowodds were shed be dead long before her lungs could fail her but nothere would be no cigarettes for cass nothing that would build a taste for her addictions nothing that would remind her of those feelings of wanting more and more until wanting became needing in the past shed let her addiction become the thing that mattered most and shed lost ruthie as a result no more even if she had only hours left to live she didnt intend to spend any of them enslaved to anyone or anything she had made it this far this much closer to finding ruthie and she wouldnt do anything to jeopardize their future together thank you for bringing me she said to faye as sweetly as she could manage and god bless you the look the order guards exchanged was laced with cynicism but they said nothing cass was pretending to look for answers and they were pretending they had answers to give her good so far everyone was playing their part beyond the anteroom was a bank of elevators that no longer workedand a stairwell that led up five flights to a hallway that opened onto the skyboxes on one side and offices on the other cass was taken to an office with a view out over the parking lot scattered with wrecked and abandoned cars the door clicked shut behind her and the room was silent as a stonesoundproofed she guessed so some pencil pusher could attend to the details of running the place without distractions there were bookshelves a couple of chairs a corkboard that took up most of one walla drab little room like in any anonymous office building the room where business was consolidated from the sport spectacle of the rest of the stadium when cass had come here as a girl shed been high on the thrill of a stolen day with her dad an adventure just the two of themthe first of many he promised she wasnt about to believe that her mom said tom haverford was about as reliable as a busted clock and hed missed her birthday and easter off touring with the latest surething band hed hooked up with but at least there was this one perfect day the snap of the tickets tearing the shouts of the vendors cooking up sweetsmelling sausages the heartpounding first glimpse of the players in their tight white pants and redandsilver shirts as they ran onto the field sitting close to your dad his arm heavy around your shoulders his highfive slap stinging your palm when hugo hawkins stole second wishing the game would never end two lives later cass knew that baseball was a business just like everything else behind the handsome players and the greengreen field and the cheering crowds were managers bosses arrangers of deliveries and collectors of profits people who hired and fired and balanced budgets and greased palms and traded influence someone like that had worked in this office and because of that the magic of that longago day never seemed more distant than it did now finally the door opened and a woman in a pink skirt and blouse entered she looked like she was somewhere in her thirties with straight dark hair tucked primly behind her ears but her wide smile was welcoming and generous she extended both her hands and cass let her enfold her own in a tight grasp im deacon lily she said softly she had the kind of voice you leaned in to hear welcome to the order you and i are going to have a nice chat and get to know each other and then together we will decide if you are suited for life here among the order if the answer is yes you will join the other neophytes you will stay among them until we determine that you are ready to progress to acolyte status that may take weeks or perhaps months it depends on how quickly you learn and adjust to our ways what if imnot suited cass asked oh lets not worry about that right now besides youve already gotten sister lorries recommendation she can be quite discerning and generally when she sees potential in a seeker there is a good reason cass searched lilys face for sarcasm but found none she was veryallbusiness she said carefully lily waved her hand brushing the thought away the ones who interface with the outside they have a hard job mother cora says they have to steel themselves against the lure of the godless while keeping their hearts open to the possibility of grace which is a very difficult calling that is why only a few are called to be guards dont let her attitude put you off because she is only protecting our sanctum from those who would seek to weaken us now you are inside with us and very soon you will start to see the beautiful truths that guide us cass nodded and smiled as though lilys words made sense wondering if she really believed what she was saying cass was intimately familiar with the many faces of denial from the first whispers that allow you to shade the truth a complexion that suited you to the most desperate and fantastic depths in which you traded your sanity for a version of reality that allowed you to continue to exist another day but contentment even serenity was not a state she associated with any place on the spectrum now why dont you tell me what youve heard about the order lily prompted sitting in the chair behind the desk and taking a yellow pad and pen from a drawer i heard this was a good place when you think you cant go on anymore cass said tremulously then she told the rest of her careful lie one she had built from pieces of the truth i lived with my mother when i was growing up andmy stepfather just saying the hated word caused a bit of the anguish that simmered deep inside to break off and lodge in her heart she felt her face color with shame and grief and blinked hard so she wouldnt cry this was why cass had chosen this story she knew she couldnt tell it without the pain coming to the surface she wouldnt have to fool anyoneher desolation was real and real was the thing she would trade to get inside no matter what it cost her yes lily said softly my stepfather was not a good man cass continued her voice quavering he was alsoinappropriate with me im very very sorry to hear that yes he cass broke off and lily reached into the desk coming up with a box of tissuesa practically new box of real tissues which she slid across the desk cass gratefully took one and dabbed at her eyes i suppose you can guess anyway i was estranged from them but they lived in the same town as i did after the siege i heard through friends that my mother had the fever oh cassandraagain i am so sorry lily said and for a moment cass was drawn into her sympathy tempted to tell her all about mim about her birdlike hands and diet of coffee and melba toast her vanity about her sizesix figure and the high heels she wore until the very end even if she was just going to get the mail about the padded bras she gave cass for her eleventh birthday about the way the bedroom door sounded when she slammed it shut the night cass tried to tell her about what byrn had done to her instead she told the lies she had prepared i loved my mother so much when she was dyingand she was so hot it was as though she was on fire from the inside she couldnt bear to have anything touching her skin and so she lay on the floor on the tile and when i tried to give her water she justshe couldnt keep it down and she was muttering all the timeshe never slept and i couldnt i couldnt tell what she was saying and cass peeked out from her lowered lashes to see how her story was going over in truth she had taken the details from a woman she met in the library cass had listened while the woman told the story of her mothers death in her arms how shed held her until finally the unbearable heat left her wasted body casss own mother had refused to see her even when she was dying of the fever but lily reached across the table and squeezed casss hand gently right now it is natural that you are hurting that you are questioning gods decision to take your mother from you she said but others have found comfort through a deeper understanding of his will and his ways you can find that comfort in faith too cassandra do you believe me cass fluttered her lashes idont know so many of us have lost loved ones to the fever to hunger to senseless violence to the beaters the loss is real of course but the anger it causes is not you think you are angry at god for taking your mother right cass nodded she didnt say that she was no longer the person she used to be before byrn came along he changed her forever when he intercepted her on her way to the bathroom one night after shed stayed up too late studying for a biology test hed traded her trust for a few cheap thrills pretending that his hands on the thin fabric of her nightgown had been in her imagination forcing her to scab over her pain with selfdoubt until it happened the next time and the time after that that personthe old casstruly was dead and the new cass was angry and no newage faithhawker was going to take her rage away but cass took those thoughts and carefully folded them once twice until they fit back into the place where she kept them hidden away their energy though she summoned to feed this lie what if i told you that you can learn to trade your anger for forgiveness lily asked for peace for healing i dont understand yes i know its hard to accept at first here it comes cass thought the hard sell at first there were only a few of us women just like you cassandra we were all hurting we had all lost someone we found our way here and we prayed without ceasing faith was our only reward but what a glorious reward it was mother cora founded the order in this place in the end days of the siege when all the nations of the earth were at war with each other and she prayed until she was exhausted and then slept only long enough to get up and do it again her first acolytes were women who were also looking for answers through faith and they began to pray with her and that allowed her to divide the work of her prayer into shifts now lily swept her hand in an arc toward the interior of the stadium now there are dozens of us praying at every moment of the day and thats not all the enthusiasm in her voice was too bright too brittle the pitch was wellpracticed and cass could understand how easily a woman weakened by grief and fear could fall for it but underneath lilys pious words the pieces didnt fit together cass focused on lilys mouth her bowed pale lips what else tell me cassandra is there room in your heart to forgive ii dont know there is a lesson in the bible one of my favoritesand also one of the simplest in it we learn that our lord expects us to take the traveler into our home the sinner to our bosom she tapped her fingernails on the desk as she recited i say to you what you have done to one of these least ones you have done to me cass knew the passage well from a longago game in church camp the disinterested counselors made the girls form two lines linking hands over their heads to form a tunnel through which they took turns running while everyone sang words like i accept you as you are and there is no bridge we cant cross together cass remembered the game because one of the older girls had tripped her sticking out her foot as cass ran through then she pretended to help her up whispering god hates dirty skanks like you the likelihood of gods affection for her was one of the subjects cass took pains to avoid but lily seemed to be waiting for her to say something i know that one yes yes its a beautiful lesson but now i would like you to let your mind disconnect from what you have learned in the past lily encouraged be open to what you will hear and see in the days to come be open to miraclestrue miracles what do you mean close your eyes for a moment lily said you will do much more work in the days ahead with teachers who are far more gifted than i but i just want to share with you a glimpse of what lies ahead the beauty of forgiveness the glory of letting go of all that is hurting youthe hatred the sorrow the regret the angermost of all the anger which is like a poison inside youletting it all flow away that is the work that we do here in the order cass let her eyes drift shut despite herself she felt herself responding to lilys gentle voice to the soothing rhythms of her words she had a lovely voice cass wondered if she sang probably all these religious types did didnt they thats itnow breathe with me inout inand holdand now very very slowly breathe out for one two threegood cassandra very good lets do that again together cass let lily lead her through the breathing exercise she was really very good much better than elaine who had tried something similar in the impromptu yoga group she started in the library better than the physical therapist who attended casss aa meetings from time to time and came over once or twice with gifts of tea and gingersnaps cass had rejected the help offered by that woman and elaine too shed always been aware of their agendas their desire to lead her through their own personal programs and cass could not follow shed been made a rebel by all the years of trusting the wrong people and she couldnt let go enough to trust elaine and while all the others in the library lay on their backs and stretched their arms over their heads and practiced the three kinds of breathing with great zeal cass faked it and felt her sadness coil all the tighter in her chest but lily was different lilys voice was gilded with hope and delight and it was so tempting to think that such a thing might be possible for cass too if she just followed alongif she let go of the torments that held her backif she opened herself to forgiveness of course it was all ridiculous all part of the brainwashing but would it really hurt anything if she played along if she took this time to rest and relax it had been such a hard journey she had been on alert for so long her body had been through so much just relax cassandra lean back in the chair and let your hands rest loosely at your sidesthats right and now in again and hold cass breathed and she listened and she felt her mind loosen and settle like a bowl of batter that had been stirred it was like sleeping except she could still hear lilys soft words like dreaming except the images in her mind were real things memories of nice things ruthie tucked under the bright quilt she found at a secondhand shop a stray cat the neighbor took in who grew sleek and fathow ruthie loved to pet that cat ruthie the day cass took her back from byrn the dimples when ruthie smiled and laughed and hugged her tightly around her neck ruthie with the dandelions the little yellow blossom under her chin the memory slanted in surprising cass dandelionsyes there had been dandelions growing in the scorched lawn of the library they had all been amazed the day the first one popped up followed by another and another pushing their tough stalks through the matted dead grass defiant in the june sun returning from exile cass had picked them and put them in jars and coffee mugs and still there were more her own flower garden and the morning after she brought ruthie back they went outside to see the sun was up and it was safe and bobby had dragged a playskool plastic kitchen home with the raiding party the night before and they were setting it up in the courtyard theyd seen a sandbox shaped like a turtle and they were planning to go back for it when you looked close at a dandelion you could almost believe the siege had never happened hold it up to your face inhale the sweetbitter fragrance watch clouds drift through the spiky leaves brush the soft petals against your face and you were back before in the world you once knew ruthie found a patch and squealed with delight she began picking them small hands tugging with determination petals dropping to the ground but no matter pull up all the flowerstomorrow there might be no flowers at all cass squatted next to ruthie her hands flat on the brick sidewalk the bricks were cold against her palms but the contrast with the morning sun beating hot against her back was delicious and cass closed her eyes and concentrated with ruthie back she wouldnt feel so dead anymore maybe her senses would wake up again maybe she would be able to taste and smell and hear the world around her again cass concentrated on the sun on her back and the brick under her hands and listened to ruthies laughter and thought that later they might join the other families in the conference room that had been converted to a playroom that the companionship that had eluded her so far might be possible now maybe she would take her turn reading to the children playing hideandseek in the stacks folding origami from paper torn from books there would be conversation and laughter while the little ones napped she would hold bobbys hand when the dinner dishes were done and together they would tuck ruthie in to sleep at night the thought was so tempting that at first cass didnt realize that anything was wrong the sounds didnt penetrate her mind occupied as it was with happier places and as for the reverberations under her hands the thud of footsteps approachingcass had gotten sloppy the caution she had honed so fine lay buried under joy of possibility of having her baby back but then there was a frantic yell from the door where the morningshift guards had been standing and enjoying the sun run they screamed at her but she had to get to ruthie ruthie had wandered to the edge of the lawn where the circular drive met the book drop she had found a clump of yellow blooms she was watching the beaters with wide eyes she didnt budge she didnt know to be afraid and cass had to get her and she threw herself through the air running racing screaming but it was like slow motion like a movie she wasnt fast enough and somewhere in casss mind she knew this was only a memory only a memory and she tried to say no tried to push it back stuff it down cover it over bury it deep deep down in her heart where it couldnt come out but there was ruthie in the sun there was ruthie with her fistful of dandelions her baby her precious and cass screamed and screamed but no sound came out because she wasnt real anymore she was trapped on the inside with the memories and this time no one could help her as the terrible day came back with all its sharp sounds and flashing colors and settled into her senses and played across the wide wide screen of her mind and showed her how she had failed failed failed she was screaming the people at the door were screaming the beaters were snorting and wailingthe world burst with sounds of rage and terror as she ran for ruthie the cold brick and hot sun forgotten she saw the beaters stumblerun toward her down the street over the curb across the library lawn four of them or five it was hard to tell as they crowded and pushed each other like hungry puppies slapping and shoving and making their strange excited voracious sounds and their greedy eyes locked onto ruthie who stood small and alone with the bunch of dandelions in her hand breeze riffling a curl of hair around her chin closer closer lungs tearing arms reaching cass threw her self on top of her daughter flung her small body into the dirt and pressed herself on top ruthies heartbeat rapid as a trapped rabbits fluttered against casss chest as she squeezed her eyes shut and tried to make herself big enormous wide enough to cover ruthie so theyd never find her and then the way the earth beneath them trembled with the footfalls of the beaters the heavy thud of a boot tripping on her legs and then an infuriated scream as the beater went down falling on casss calves hurting her with its weight the smellgod the smell obscene in its bloom of foul rot a beaters hand closed on her forearm and cass jerked it away seeing only the chewed fingers the torn and missing nails the crusted black blood and the oily pink of the most recent wounds on its wrist and forearm the hand was grotesque bone showing in a couple of places a finger hanging loose and uselessbut the grip was surprisingly strong and cass could not free herself someone help get ruthie she screamed she couldnt see anyone because the library was behind her her only opportunity for escape a dozen yards away and even then she knew there was no chance for her at all because the beaters were upon her with their miscalibrated eyes and their lusting feverish mouths their hands scrabbled at her she had expected ripping and tearing and pain but they closed their festering hands on her with singular purposethey would not feed here they would not take their first bite until they had her back in their nest then they would lay her out on her stomach and kneel on her limbs while they feasted but cass did not allow that thought to overtake her yet she squeezed her eyes shut and kept screaming for the others to come for ruthie and fought to make her body large larger she imagined that she was a great weight that would press down on her baby even while the beaters tugged her and tried to rip apart her grip but she couldnt keep them away with her will she felt her hold on ruthie float away as they pulled her in four different directions panic made her stronger and she fought hard and ruthie wriggled and cried out in fright and casss tears ran salty in her mouth cass opened her eyes and looked frantically for something anything that would help and saw only the scattered yellow petals of the dandelions ruthie had dropped already curling in the sun in the dead grass and thenbobbys shoes how had she forgotten this bobbys shoes an incongruously flashy pair of nikes silver appliquéd on black bobby favored army surplus but hed loved these shoes lifted from a routed and wrecked sporting goods shop nothing hed ever wear before but they appealed to his irrepressible sense of irony and hed laced them with glittering silver shoelaces and teased cass that they made him stronger and fasteran aftertime superhero bobbys nikes were in front of her and cass sucked air and screamed ruthies name one last time take ruthie help ruthie let them have me and she saw the shoes hesitate for only a second and then she knew that he knew she was right the beater who held her forearm in his grip was suddenly torn away bobby kicked at it and went for the next one but cass felt herself being dragged by the pair that held her feet their voices crescendoed a mad incoherent cacophony chorded through with fury and her body bumped along the ground but bobby had bought himself a few seconds the beaters who were dragging her away let her fall to the ground at the edge of the lawn and then each seized a hand and a foot she was lifted roughly her spine scraping against the curb and as the beaters carried her away she craned her neck and saw bobby with ruthie in his arms running to the door where others waited with blades ready the beaters in lurching determined pursuit she watched helplessly as bobby raced for the door and threw himself at the entrance never letting go of ruthie who looked so small in his arms cass could not see her face only her blue shoes and white socks and small fist still holding one wilted dandelion bobbys shoes flashed in the sun and then he was inside and maynard that was his name the guard with the shaved headmaynards arm swung wide and one of the beaters went down in a spray of arterial blood and the doors shut with a clang and ruthie was gone and ruthie was safe and inside the library and outside the doors were one bleeding beater distracted by its own blood and one who pounded its body against the door as though it could bend the steel if it tried hard enough ruthie was saved ruthie was saved a prayer a deal doneit took all the energy cass had left and she stopped fighting she lifted her voice to the god she long ago stopped daring to trust hold her safe in your arms love her for me so that was done and she closed her eyes and prayed for death and knew that instead she was headed for something far worse pain and a voice pain above her eye sharp as the jagged edge of awakeand a voice she knew cassandra please dont fight me just let me cass rolled and her shin struck something hard and sharp the pain made her squeeze her eyes shut and she pressed at her temples she was lying on the floor on carpet the air smelled like dust she patted around her found the legs of furniture opened her eyes and saw a frightened face a woman kneeling close hair hanging in her face sister lily cassandra you hit your head when you went down i just want to help you get back up to the chair ive got some cool water id like you to take a drink now the heat it wasnt the heat cass said the words wobbled in her mouth she tasted blood and touched her lip with her tongue shed bit her lip when she hit the table i wasremembering she let lily take her hand and help her up a moment of dizziness passing when she settled back into the chair the light outside seemed to have faded afternoon was passing by that happens sometimes lily said she poured from a pitcher and put a glass in casss hand folded her fingers around it so it wouldnt slip from her grip cass drank lily talked cass listened she drank more the water didnt go down easily her throat felt tight her gut uneasy ghosts of images skittered around her mind like trash on a windy dayruthies eyes wide with wonder the beaters grasping scabby hands the silver swoosh on bobbys nikes it was as though now that it had been loosed the past had slipped through the crack lily made with her kind words and her breathing exercises and now the seal was broken for good a tight schedule what with dinner their wretched hands closed on her shins her arms sebaceous oozing flesh touching hers wiry tendons closed tight as she was lifted bobby clutching ruthie tight and running running running away never knowing shed already been infected tour of our home just a quick one had he watched as she was carried off had he handed ruthie to the others and looked down at his own torn skin and bitten flesh had his heart broken as he realized what he would become as he did what must be done chasing his own death down the path that once wound through agapanthus and lantana and birches along the river cassandra come on now honey lets get up cass allowed lily to help her gently from the chair lily was nice and this was better this would help her stop thinking stop remembering lets get up she echoed softly her tongue feeling thick in her mouth thats right youre going to feel better soon you probably need some food something to settle your stomach how long has it been since you had a good meal she continued talking without waiting for an answer ushering cass out of her office and past the stairwell the guards used down the empty corridor that wound around and around the stadium cass watched the concrete walls go by when they entered the stands blinking in the lateafternoon sun she looked down onto the field and half expected to see the miners there warming up in the afternoon sun the fake turf was still verdant and the field markings were still present in places but in what had once been the outfield an enclosure as big as a suburban ranch house had been erected white tent fabric stretched to make a roof over walls built from twobyfours and plywood and steel braces at the other end of the field dozens of tables were lined up in neat rows along with a variety of chairsfolding chairs plastic outdoor chairs a few aluminum chairs from patio sets walls of wire shelving the kind used for garage storage had been joined to make a larder women in long sleeved shirts and skirts that reached their ankles worked alone and in pairs setting out dishes and stirring pots over cooking fires an entire long side of the field was lined with planters constructed from wood and filled with soil and astonishingly overflowing with a variety of plants from far away cass couldnt tell what they all were but brightly colored flowers tumbled from the planters under small trees and hardylooking shrubs andcould those be pole beans and squash or melons their tendrilous vines overhanging the planters and trailing on the ground the order was cultivating plants she hadnt seen since before like the evergreen seedlings she and smoke saw along the side of the road these plants sprang from seeds and spores that had somehow survived the siege maybe the earth truly did want to be reborn cass followed lily down the stairs between the stands her legs still trembled and she stepped slowly and carefully afraid of falling again lily slowed her own pace to match giving cass an encouraging smile and touching her arm to steady her they passed small groups of women huddled together in the seats praying lily explained theres not much else the stands are good for other than exercise she pointed to an unenthusiastic queue trudging slowly up the steps a dozen yards away the women wore drab beige and gray clothes their leader was dressed in pale lavender when they reached the top they turned and started down again before cass occasionally ended her weekend desert runs in the high school stadium sprinting up and down the stands enjoying the way her footfalls caused the metal benches to shudder and creak it felt dangerous and once when she fell she gashed her shin badly but there was something irresistible about hurtling up and down the stands until the breath burned in her throat until her heartbeat was so strong she could feel it in every part of her body and when she finally collapsed lying on one of the sunwarmed metal benches and staring up at the sky she had the rare satisfaction of being utterly spent if it wasnt joy it was as close as cass ever got once they were on the field lily led cass toward the tables the turf felt nice under her feet springy and resilient and as they drew nearer she could smell the food being cooked and hear the conversation of the women they worked at wooden counters propped on metal legs chopping kaysev and what looked like new potatoes sliding them into pots of water that others carried to a hearth above a crackling fire two women skinned a jackrabbit together chatting as they peeled the pelt away from the meat their knives flashing in the sun cass looked away but not before shed seen them lift the organs from the animals body food she told herself it was only food and besides this meant that the rabbits had continued to multiply which meant that the animals were finding their way back aftertime too the realization brought an emotion that felt suspiciously like hope and cass fought it barely listening as lily chatted on about the meal being prepared there was no place for hope not here not yet not until she found ruthie thenmaybeshe would allow herself to start believing in the future again cass tried to pretend interest in the things that lily was showing her to focus on the water spigot that extended from one of the dugouts but she remembered how the players looked that day broad shoulders in the white jerseys piped in silver ornate red ms embroidered on the front where they had lined up to bat a pair of women dispensed water to others who brought buckets and plastic bottles and large reservoirs on wheeled carts lily explained how they had tapped into the pipeline that ran from the sierras all the way to san francisco and cass accepted a dipper of water letting it trail down her chin and into her neckline cool against her skin there was a laundry area where women stirred clothes in huge vats of cloudy water there were rows and rows of kaysev pods drying on cotton sheets in the sun there were twisted electric cables snaking along the walls connecting strings of lightbulbs to generators lily led her back and forth along the vast field showing cass the inventions and activities and products of the order and though they passed the large tentroofed enclosure several times it was the one thing she never mentioned even though a muffled grunting and snuffling came from behind the wooden walls when a bell clanged from the kitchen area lily made a tsking sound and put a hand to casss back giving her a gentle push wed best hurry she said it wont do to be late to dinner on your first day will it and youll feel so much better once youve eaten something cass had grown accustomed to lilys soft soothing voice and as they walked back toward the tables it was lost in the sound of dozens of other conversations as women appeared from the entrances in the stands and swarmed the field fifty a hundred they kept coming the old and the young the tall and the short the strong and the stooped most wore the bland shades of tan and gray and brown that lily said signified they were acolytes accepted into the congregation but here and there was a woman in bright shades of pink and purple the ordained like lily the leaders the teachers lily led her to a long table near the edge of the gathering where twenty or so women were gathered all of them dressed in white blouses and skirts these are the neophytes lily said like you all of you are new you will live together and study and pray together she guided cass to an open seat near one end of the table next to a young pretty woman with wavy brown hair that fell in her eyes and a solidly built blonde woman in her late forties this is cassandra lily announced as the women gathered at the table fell silent cass lowered herself to a straightbacked chair with a webbedplastic seat and folded her hands on her lap she arrived today and shes still a little weary from traveling please make her feel welcome lily crouched down between cass and the young woman on her left i just know youre going to do fine she said softly in a tone that implied she wasnt entirely sure cass wanted to reassure her to thank her for her kindness but her collapse in lilys office had left her unfocused as well as drained of energy and her head still throbbed with a spiking pain above her eye where she struck the table and she managed only a weak smile this is monica shes been here a week now and adele youll help cass wont you show her around explain things sure the younger woman gave cass a crooked smile especially if it means i dont have to be the newbie any more i need to go to my table lily said giving cass a final pat on her shoulder its almost time for prayer i know youre stillfinding your way cassandra but just have faith and open your heart can you do that lilys smile was so encouraging her touch so welcome that cass found herself nodding along it wasnt so different from the third drink or the fourththe one that untethered her anxious mind from the dark place that was built of anxiety and worry and fear when she used to drink she pursued that moment when the lashings fell free and she drifted when the numbness swirled in and the memories softened into vague shadows and it seemed possible that she might feel nothing at all at least for a while she watched lily go weaving her way back between the tables filling up with women and tried to hold on to the stillness but when she turned back all of the others at the table were watching her and the momentary peace evaporated the neophytes were young suntanned wholesome girls and skinny holloweyed beauties nails chewed to the quick their colored and highlighted hair giving way to several inches of naturalcolored roots but there were a few older women some her mothers age and at least one who looked like she was pushing seventy they fussed over the younger women passing them dishes and refilling their water chiding them to eat to relax to rest cass wondered how many of them had been separated from their own children had lost them to disease or to the beaters welcome cassandra adele said with a smile lifting her glass in a toast monica clinked it with her own and winked before she could lift her own glass to the others there was the squeal of feedback from a loudspeaker and a tall slender silverhaired woman dressed in scarlet approached the platform silence fell quickly the servers paused in their tasks and heads were bowed and hands folded in supplication thats mother cora monica whispered mother cora closed her eyes and tilted up her chin smiling faintly let us pray she said and the sound system picked up her wellmodulated voice and carried it with surprising clarity through the stadium all around her the women joined hands monica and adele held hers and reached across the empty seats to the others mother cora raised her hands slowly above her head in an elegant arc inhaled deeply and began to speak womens soft voices falling in with hers in a low susurration that filled the stadium and echoed back upon itself lord our savior her prayer began we your chosen commend this and every day to thee what followed was not so different from the prayers cass remembered from her occasional forays into church and she stopped paying attention to the words and instead sneaked glances at all the other women who were praying over clasped hands she thought she would see at least a few others who like her were not able to lose themselves in prayer who were not moved those who lacked faith or who had been lost or had turned away from god those whose suffering had changed them at the core stealing pieces of the soul and leaving carvedout shadows in their place but as she searched the neat rows of women they became indistinguishable from one another their variations in shape and size and hair and skin color insignificant forming a whole that was more than the sum of the individuals pulsing with a life of its own all the voices made one voice all the clasped hands formed a chain that stretched from the old to the young the weak to the strong in that moment cass felt the tug of the order the desire to lose herself to become nothing more than another voice sharing in the prayer if only she knew the words you have sent your forsaken that we may forgive you have sent your tainted that we may heal in your glory we celebrate the body and the blood in your name we consecrate ourselves to your holy task amen the echoes of amen rebounded around the vast space now nearly dark except for candles on the tables and a few strings of electric lights mother cora descended the stairs and the spotlight shut off and conversation picked up again hope youre not expecting much monica said as servers placed steaming plates in front of each of them and poured water from pitchers im not really hungry well thats good since everything around heres pretty much inedible dont complain so much adele chided you didnt have to cook it id rather be cooking than suffering through purity lectures monica said seriously cassandra if you havent sworn off sex already listening to sister linda talk about your vessel of virtue will knock the urge right out of you imum you can call me cass it was happening again as it had at the communal bath at the schoolthe kindness of other women the offer of friendship but cass didnt have the energy to engage dont mind monica adele said shes got a good heart shes just not used to following directions im spoiled monica shrugged only child what can i say monicas going to do great things here if she doesnt get herself thrown out first adele said firmly adeles the only one who hasnt given up on me yet monica said i guess im the problem child around here you just need to apply yourself a little adele said and cass saw a woman who needed a child to mothera woman who once had children of her own to dote on and was lost without them are there children here babies little kids she had to know just had to know if ruthie had made it safely she had failed her little girl but bobby had saved her elaine had nursed her and someone else had brought her here cass had failed but ruthie had survived so much already if she was being raised here in the order that would be all right as long as they were keeping her safe there was a pause adeles face draining of life and looking suddenly much older when she spoke her voice was soft and shredded as a tissue that had gone through the wash the innocents have their own quarters we dont see them much after the baptisms ive never seen any since i got here monica said licking the back of a spoon and thats fine with me because i think it would freak me out they dont let them talk can you imagine my nieces and nephews never stopped talking thats just for the ceremony adele murmured but the energy had gone out of her words its all symbolic the way they prepare them its to make them all uniform so theyre like blank slates ready to accept the doctrine monicaim sure they let them just be kids when theyre in their own quarters i wouldnt be so sure monica shrugged im just saying its pretty freaky that they you dont know adele snapped and its best not to speculate its not your place despite her sharp tone cass saw tears welling in her eyes there was a silence as monica ducked her chin in regret im sorry adele she said softly covering the older womans hand with hers adele sighed and dabbed at her eyes with a napkin its all right sugar but you dont need to worry about it the children are being cared for so the rest of us can focus on our own spiritual growth i mean really its better its easier this way without the distractions cass knew when someone was lying to herselfthat was a skill every recovering addict had in spadesand adele was working hard to believe she didnt want to be around children monica was part of that work allowing adele to mother someone while pretending she was indifferent to the youngest members of the order cass could do that too she could convince herself she didnt need to see ruthie to hold her if only she knew that she was being cared for cass didnt deserve any more not after shed been so careless she just needed to know her baby was safe so this isnt too bad right adele asked clearing her throat and forcing a smile i mean for aftertime yeah sure cass said though shed barely touched her food a stirfry of kaysev leaves with a few grains of barley and herbs and bits of jackrabbit meat im justim not that hungry i guess all the excitement and all monica rolled her eyes i know more excitement than a person can stand deacon lily gave you the grand tour right only i bet they didnt show you any of the stuff they dont want you to see monica adele scolded her youve got to stop being so disrespectful youre going to get us all in trouble again monica managed an apologetic smile showing a tiny gap between her front teeth im sorry adele i really am only i dont understand why no one ever stands up to them its not everyone adele said shaking her head in exasperation honey you need to understand that every organization has its bad apples but you still have to show some respect cass it was so ridiculous no one has a sense of humor around here what happened i forgot how this one prayer ended and i kind of made up my own verse in chapel mother cora was not amused and my ladies here all had to attend extra prayers because of me monica inclined her head toward the women at the other end of the table theyre still kind of mad thats why were all alone at the bad girl end of the table well honey we missed tea adele said patting her arm cant get between the ladies and an afternoon snack even if it is dandelion tea and rabbit salad sandwiches she wrinkled her nose in distaste you need to take it more seriously a woman two seats down said cass hadnt realized shed been listening next time its gonna be a reckoning youve already had what like three warnings two monica mumbled okay two the woman said third ones a reckoning whats a reckoning cass asked dont listen to them monica protested all i ever do is say what everyone is already thinking theres no way theyd call a reckoning without more to pin on me than that but whats hush the woman down the table hissed as a deacon in deep lavender walked slowly past their table conversation died down until she was safely out of hearing range damn spy monica muttered like to see where thats in the bible especially when theyre up there preaching faith it would be nice if they had a little faith in this time it was a different woman who interrupted come on monica can we please get through one single meal without you getting us in trouble whyre you even here if youre not a believer another added all the other neophytes were turned toward them now i am a believer monica protested hotly id put my faith up against anyone elses any day i just dont believe in this crazy shit that masquerades as as real faith but she kept quiet until the meal was finished and servers had cleared the dishes cass answered adeles questions with a mixture of the truthher job at the qikgo her love of plants and landscapingand lies and omissions lily had been rightthe food helped and by the time they filed out of the darkened stadium their way lit only by the stars and the strings of tiny lights her head had cleared and the terrifying memories had receded back into the recesses of her mind but in the morning she awoke from the dream of ruthie again ruthie pressed beneath her the snuffling wailing of the beaters coming closer her own screams ringing in her earsshe jerked awake in a twist of sheets sour with her own sweat salt riming her eyelashes so that she knew shed cried in her sleep for a moment she didnt remember where she was the light in the neophyte dorm was ashy filtered through burlap tacked along the top of the enclosure which had been constructed from a length of the stadiums concrete corridor only the neophytes were kept locked in lily who had escorted her to the dorm after dinner explained that once they became acolytes they would join the others groups of women sharing quarters created from what had been restaurants and club rooms and offices and evenfor the ordainedthe skyboxes they would be allowed to keep clothes and personal possessionsbooks keepsakes toiletriesin their rooms but for now everything was common property it builds a sense of community lily explained showing her the shelves of towels and kaysev shoots carved into toothbrushes and the rough soap made from the oily center of kaysev beans no doubt the manufacture of these supplies was part of what kept the convent humming with industry but it served another purpose toopreparing for the day when everything from before ran out as the neophytes lined up for the two crude bathroom enclosures acolytes brought buckets brimming with water and took away tubs heaped with dirty laundry before locking the doors for the night to casss surprise they were allowed to wear whatever they wanted to sleep in everything from giants tshirts to lacy nightgowns but she had nothing but the clothes she was wearing she rubbed sleep from her eyes and looked around the empty room surprised that shed slept through the others departure most of the beds were neatly made her bed was separate from the others tucked into a corner the newcomer bed where lily explained she would sleep for the first few transitional days next to it was a hardback chair and a small table on which a stapled set of pages rested they were wellthumbed the edges curling and they looked as though theyd been typed on an old manual typewriter youll have two days to rest before you join the others for daily chores and study lily had said when she showed them to cass mother cora likes for newcomers to spend time in reflection and reading these there were hundreds of pages singlespaced who wrote all of this the founders mother cora did a lot of it lily looked uncomfortable you can you know skim some of the parts youll take your meals here until youre done just try to think of it as room service on the table next to the pages was a plate holding a thin flat seeded kaysev cake and six almonds and a tall glass of clear water cass put the glass to her lips and drank slowly feeling the water wash down her throat lukewarm but clean the best shed tasted aftertime she ate her breakfast and washed herself as well as she could after that there was nothing left to do but pick up the pages welcome seeker doctrine of the order cass read the first page three times before giving up the words refused to come together in her mind the paragraphs swimming before her eyes somewhere not far away the children of the order were being cared for fed and clothed and sheltered and kept safe that was more than cass had ever accomplished much more than shed managed already and shed only had ruthie back in her care for a single daya day in which shed let her be bitten infected and nearly taken a day that had caused her girl untold pain as she turned then reverted then healed in that small library room cass tossed the pages on the table and lay back in her bed pulling the sheet up over her head her breath fouled the air under the sheet and she pulled her arms and legs in tight and made herself as compact as she could she squeezed her eyes shut and wondered if in here her prayers might actually work the prayer she would say if she allowed herself was the old one and for that reason cass knew it was a bad idea it was the prayer from when she drank on mornings like this in beds not dissimilar cass breathed her own stink and reviled her own body and prayed only for god to let her forgetthe things she had done the things she had lost the things she would do tonight it was not a prayer of hope someone would come eventually she had managed to sleep through the other neophytes washing and dressing and preparing for their day but she would not be so lucky again she would be expected to study to eat to make conversation cass had come here with hope and something even betterwith thoughts of ruthie dancing like diamonds in her mind never far from her thoughts but that was gone now yesterday as lilys kind voice stirred the silt from her memories she had remembered and remembering stole her resolve cass wanted to be ruthies savior but she was the one who had forsaken her she wanted to be ruthies everything but she deserved nothing cass pressed her face to the mattress and felt her tears hot against the cotton she pressed harder harder until she couldnt breathe and wished she could stay that way until the last of her life left her but her body was a traitor and as she willed the air from her lungs and her mind went black at the edges she knew that eventually it would seize deep drafts of air to sustain life a gift she no longer wanted in the end of course she breathed she stared at the pages and ate the food an acolyte brought for lunch and slept and woke and when the others came back at the end of the day she listened to their talk and answered when they spoke to her monica offered her a gift a single sleeping pill wrapped in a page torn from a magazine printed back when there were still celebrities to gossip about cass thanked her and turned her down but she wondered how many times she would say no before she said yes i dont understand any of this she said instead fanning out the typed pages dont worry about it monica sat crosslegged on her bed she was wearing faded pajama pants printed with penguins on skis and a white tank top and her hair was pulled back from her face with a wide band her thin brown shoulders and the bangs that slipped out of the hair band made her look like a teenager though shed told cass she was twentytwo its not like they test you on it or anything its just all of mother coras crazy ideas did you read it all monica laughed nobody reads the whole thing lily just tells cora that you read it after a couple of days then what then nothing really you get to be a neophyte big thrill monicawhy are you here if you dont believe any of it i didnt say i didnt believe any of it i believe the basics know what i was doing before what monica glanced around the room some of the women were already in bed others were reading by the light of the industrial fixtures mounted in the corners of the room no one paid any attention i havent told this to anyone but adele but i was going to go to divinity school down at fuller i wanted to be a minister i mean not like right away butsomeday i was saving up cass remembered herself at twentytwo the account she started at the bank where she was going to put away money for landscape design school the single deposit she madeand the day not long after when she took it out to buy a leather skirt im sorry you didnt get to go she said softly yeah well monica smiled and yawned here i am anyway i like most of the people here even a lot of the ordained arent so bad and three meals a day and a bed sure beats living on the outside its justi dont like it when people think they have all the answers you know especially when they make them up and then want to make you believe the same crazy things early in the evening of the second day there was a knock at the dormitorys single door a key turned in the lock cass expected an acolyte bringing her dinner but it was a grayhaired deacon in a ruby blouse she gave cass a smile that didnt reach all the way to her eyes im hannah sister lily tells me that you have finished studying the doctrine tonight you will join us for dinner and afterward i will give you your new clothes congratulations cassandra following hannah down onto the field cass realized how little she had moved during the two days shed spent confined to the dorm her legs felt tight her heartbeat sluggish it had been days since shed ended her solo journey at the school months since she ran flatout through the sierra foothills she needed to decide whether to make the effort to live or let her ennui spread through her body until it atrophied and withered but even the idea of making a decision sounded like too much effort already she wanted to return to her bed and just go back to sleep hannah led her to the neophyte table where monica and adele had saved her a seat near them ill return for you later she said theres something special planned after dinner but ill be back after that monica waited until she was out of earshot oh goody maybe theres going to be fireworks or jello shots adele sighed you know darn well what it is monica come on dont ruin it for everyone else cass got through the meal as she had got through the past two days she answered when spoken to and forced herself to lift her fork to her lips until most of her meal was gone all the while concentrating on keeping her mind as blank as she could the night settled in as the servers cleared dishes and poured weak kaysev tea and mother cora ascended the platform and took her place at the podium tonight we have something special to celebrate she said there has been further progress with sister ivy she is responding to our prayers on cue the doors to the enclosure at the other end of the field groaned open and a large wheeled cart rolled slowly onto the field its top half a cage with a dark figure inside in the rapidly descending night cass couldnt make out any of its features but the creature made a sound at first it sounded like an engine turning over without success an escalating whine that ended in clattering coughs before it started up again cass listened goose bumps rising along her arms knowing exactly what she was hearing the call of a beater frustrated hungry and lusting for flesh sister ivy sisters mother coras voice rang out like a pristine bell prepare to bless the fallen we have prayed for sister ivy and she is beginning to recover our faith is healing her the cart rolled slowly toward the tables stopping in the cleared space between the tables and the podium the light from the strings of tiny bulbs did little to illuminate the beater it was wearing a longsleeved shirt and a pair of loose pants even shoes and it pulled at the bars of the cart and its cries carried clearly through the stadium cass remembered faye saying that the order paid dor to capture beaters but she had never imagined this was their purpose to pray over them toheal them unless this thing too was an outlier like herwas that possible is it really getting better cass whispered of course not monica whispered back get real they just drag them out here every so often and say theyre getting better so everyone keeps praying i mean you think its an accident they do this after dark hush adele scolded just leave cass alone monica you dont want to get her in trouble on her first night as a neophyte really youre not going to tell her monica demanded just like no one told me come on adele we talked about this you said that was before you got in trouble twice adele hissed you dont have room for any more mistakes prepare for the blessing mother cora commanded servers emerged from the pantries bearing trays with rows of tiny cups in the flickering light from the larder cass saw that the cups bore rubyred wine they were barely bigger than a thimble like dolls cups not this monica muttered not again its not right shut up the woman next to adele whispered furiously im not taking punishment because of you anymore monica just buck up and get through it like the rest of us if you hate it so much here leave another woman added mouth pulled down in anger mother coras healing them all youre doing is getting in the way the servers spread out among the tables setting a tiny cup in front of each woman the moans of the beater quieted but it paced in its cage shaking the bars the effort of ignoring the sounds appeared to be too much for some of the women who pressed their hands over their ears and squeezed their eyes shut when everyone had been served the servers retreated with the last of the cups everyone watched mother cora expectantly her face bore the placidity of the devout a serene smile tilting up the corners of her thin lips prepare to drink she commanded and the women moved as one lifting their cups as though for a toast cass held the tiny cup between a finger and thumb surprised that it was chilled and so we pray mother cora continued and the voices of hundreds of women filled the stadium cass glanced at monica and saw that she alone did not join in a look of disgust and anger on her face dear lord it is our duty and salvation always and everywhere to give you thanks for your sacrifice for our blood is your blood imbued with the healing spirit of life in your name we bless the fallen in your house we welcome them by drinking we proclaim your greatness and implore you to make us whole and so we drink mother cora said two hundred hands brought two hundred tiny cups to waiting lips and cass followed suit but as the cold plastic touched her lips monica suddenly set her cup down hard on the table splashing the wine dont the single word carried on the still night hundreds of eyes turned their way a guard posted at the edge of the tables turned searching for the voice of dissent cass tossed back her wine in a single gulp hoping to distract her and it was on her lips to say something anything so she wouldnt notice the spreading red stain in front of monica but the taste in her mouth was wrong it was all wrong it was metallic and harsh and familiar and unfamiliar she felt her stomach heave and turned to spit on the ground but she caught sight of the deacons angry expression and forced herself to swallow instead swallowing down bile and the bitter filth shed drunk angry whispers erupted at their table monica what did you all you had to this time youve but it was too late guards were headed for their table the first was already dragging monica from her chair monica who struggled her expression both defiant and terrified dont let them make you cass its their blood the beaters blood it isnt blessed it isnt anything before cass could absorb her words the other guards reached monica yanking her arms behind her she kicked at the table crockery falling to the ground and shattering adele rose halfway out of her chair dont adele monica cried as she was dragged from the table dont get in trouble for me im fine ill be fine one of the guards hit her on the side of the head with somethinga stick a club cass couldnt tell in the darkand monicas words were abruptly cut off her head lolling forward all around the table women averted their eyes refusing to watch as monica was dragged away toward one of the dugouts cora began to pray again and in a moment other voices joined in until everyone was chanting and the servers began to spread out among the tables collecting the cups adele sank slowly down into her chair her face pale in the flickering light where are they taking her cass whispered is she going to be all right adele didnt answer her lips quivered and she stared straight ahead but in a moment her eyes drifted closed and she began to chant along softly with the others near cass was a glass with a few inches of tea left in it she reached for it and drank deep wished for another she wanted to kneel in the dirt and push her fingers down her throat until she vomited up not just the blood but everything shed eaten not just tonight but since waking in the field every drop of water every kaysev leaf the food smoke had shared in the school the hoarded delicacies in the box she wanted to purge and purge until everything was gone including her memories not just of ruthie but of smoke and the way hed touched her of monicas thin brown shoulders and ready smile of the beater in the cage and the tiny cups of blood the women gathered in this stadium had all drunk blood blood from a beater blood that ran through the veins of a being that was no longer human no matter what they taught here in the convent cass had seen the creatures feast had seen the ravaged flesh of the beater outside lyles house jerking and twitching in death spasms as the last of its blood spilled into the earth but only monica had protested only monica had rebelled and she was immediately silenced the ranks had closed behind her as though she never existed how long had it taken for the women to become inured to the horror cass wondered how long until the liquid that passed their lips was no more evocative than communal wine how long until they believed mother cora let silence hang in the air at the conclusion of the prayer in the cage even the beater was still lying in a heap on the floor of the cart one hand wrapped around the bars of the cage perhaps it had been drugged so as to appear to be calmed by prayer slowly cora brought her elegant arms down to her sides and then she smiled serenely out at the crowd this concludes our blessing the lords grace be upon all of you sisters and good night cass felt herself beginning to shake as the beater cart was wheeled back into the enclosure and women began to rise from the tables conversation starting up again as though nothing had happened its going to be all right adele leaned in close and whispered im going to tell them monica didnt mean it she wasnt feeling well ill tell them i told her not to drink ill tell them it was my fault i dont have any warnings yet i can afford one one of the other neophytes paused in front of cass and gave her an unconvincing smile its really hard at first i meanfor all of us but youll get used to it i promise and even if that doesnt work the worst theyll give her is solitary time adele continued as though she hadnt heard last time they put her in for a couple hours if theyre mad enough they might make her stay there overnight before cass could respond she felt a hand on her arm and turned to see sister hannah ready cassandra we need to get you your new clothes before you go back to the dorm cass touched adeles shoulder as she followed hannah away but adele seemed not to notice her lips moving soundlessly as she calculated what she could trade for monicas punishment hannah led cass to an office near lilys and set her lantern on a desk where it cast long shadows around the room she opened a metal cabinet that contained a stack of folded white clothes selected a skirt and shirt and shook out the wrinkles before handing them to cass when she reached for them hannah held on as you know neophytes dress only in white you will receive a fresh change of clothes twice a week i will take your old things she let her gaze travel slowly down casss body what size are youa four six cass tugged at the clothes stiff from being line dried and finally hannah let go im not sure anymore where can i change she asked as neutrally as she could trying to keep the panic from her voice right here is fine isnt there i thoughti mean in the dorm we use the changing rooms its all right im ordained besides hannahs smile turned predatory its just us girls here right cass swallowed hard she stood and backed away from the chair and skimmed off her pants keeping her back to the wall she folded them and set them on the chair keeping her eyes lowered she could feel hannahs gaze on her and the blood rushed to her face in both embarrassment and fear she pulled on the white skirt it was baggy on her despite the elasticized waist and came down past her knees cass drew her shirt over her head and then she was standing in front of hannah in only her bra the same plain white one the women had given her at the school you act like youve never undressed in front of anyone before hannah murmured hoarsely and cass hesitated in the middle of unbuttoning the folded blouse hannah was regarding her with frank appraisal her gaze traveling across casss breasts the expanse of smooth taut skin of her torso her hipbones visible above the sagging waistband of the skirt but i bet you have a girl like youi bet you have plenty it wasnt the first time cass had been the subject of a suggestive appraisal it wasnt even the first time from a woman but it was so unexpected here in the convent her heart thudded a panicked rhythm terror of discovery making a metallic taste in her mouth her fingers remained frozen on the buttons of the white blouse turn around so i can see you hannah continued in a silky tone her hand played at the vneckline of her shirt all of you ii cant cass whispered her lips numb with fear she had to keep hannah from seeing her back yes you can hannah encouraged but with an edge because i say you can and what i say goes in here and there it was the relationship that cass had been foolish enough not to consider the powerful and the powerless the hungry and the helpless why should it be any different here where schemes masqueraded as faith where trades made in the shadows fueled devotions pledged in the light how many bosses had tried something like this with cass grabbing her ass in the break room asking her out for a drink to discuss a promotion or a raise and how many times cass remembered her face burning with shame as she twisted the fabric of the blouse in her handshow many times had she simply gone along because going along was easier than resisting no she said frantically trying to figure out a plan i mean iif you just let me get dressed i canwe can a knock at the door silenced her hannahs eyes went wide and startled get dressed she hissed now youre not supposed to but it was too late there was the sound of a key turning in the lock and then the door swung open mother cora stood in the doorway holding a sheet of paper and a ring of keys her gaze took in the scene and her eyes narrowed oh hannah again she sighed heavily i thought after the last time its not what it looks like not this time hannahs tone had turned from domineering to supplication i was onlyhaving her change in here because there was there was someone using the common room mother cora raised an eyebrow and frowned as cass scrambled to jam her arms into the sleeves of the blouse but it was buttoned shut frantically she worked at the buttons with shaking fingers here dear mother cora said taking several steps into the room and reaching for the blouse let me cass backed away and her foot struck something and she tripped she tried to right herself but when her hand came down on the back of a chair it rolled taking her with it and she fell hitting the trash can shed stumbled over and landed on her knees she scrambled to her feet but it was too late oh good lord mother cora exclaimed let me see you child she put a hand on casss shoulder her fingertips cool and her touch light cass flinched but there was nowhere to go hannah do you see silence then tentatively see what dont be afraid mother cora said youre the new girl arent you cass nodded very gently cora took casss arm and turned her so that hannah had an unobstructed view of her back hannah gasped she was attacked mother cora said by the fallen you were attacked werent you dear and yet here you are you found your way here the lord brought you to us cass said nothing there was something chilling in the contrast between mother coras soft gentle voice and the sparking intensity in her eyes despite the kindness of her words cass now felt more afraid of her than she did of hannah you were healed werent you cass didnt dare speak healed through prayer i um dont know what answer would serve her best were others praying over you when you were bitten did they save you i dont remember i dont remember anything after i was attacked until iwoke up mother cora put out a finger and touched it to the edge of one of casss wounds the touch felt strange and uncomfortable but not painful she traced the shape of the wound the skimmedover layers of healing skin sensitive to her touch you woke up mother cora repeated and were people praying then i an idea occurred to her yes it was a reckless idea but if it worked maybe it would let her see ruthie one more time i was in and out of consciousness for a while and when i was awake there were children praying over me young ones they were saying they were chanting something and then i slept and when i woke up again they were gone andand i was healed cora sucked in her breath where she demanded excitement making her voice shrill where did this happen where were the children outside of town in a field cass said desperately hoping she wasnt making a terrible mistake if this worked she would get to see ruthie and thendear god i promisethen she would leave the convent leave ruthie in the hands of women who could at least keep her safe shes lying hannah snapped let me get brenda shell get the truth out of her youll do no such thing mother cora scolded come here hannah i want you to see this here and herethe flesh is rebuilding itself she bent close to casss back cass stood very still the womens scrutiny was a unique and burning mortification but one she would endure she could be contagious hannah protested nonsense shes been prayed back to health isnt it obvious its what ive said since the start we just didnt know about the children we didnt know it had to be children its as it says in psalmslike arrows in the hand of a warrior are the children shes making that upshes oh dear lord this is a day ive been waiting for a day ive prayed for mother cora clasped her hands together and pressed them under her chin beaming cass looked from one woman to the other their disparate expressions magnified by the shadows cast by the lantern light mother coras rapt excitement fear and disbelief on hannahs face reluctantly hannah joined mother cora in examining the wounds cass tried to stay calm despite their proximity barely breathing i need to decide how best to share this news mother cora mused there is so much to do oh cassandra you are such a gift to us a reward for our faith she turned to hannah for tonight i think its best we keep her away from the others i want to make the most of this well convene later and figure out what to do but for now lets keep her in one of the reflection rooms but make her comfortable do you understand me hannah comfortable yes hannah said reluctantly casting a malevolent glare at cass im sorry mother cora said taking casss hand in hers and squeezing it i dont want you to feel like a prisoner herewhen you are so much more oh cassandrayou are going to bring such a great gift to all of us do you know what that is cass shook her head afraid to speak afraid to make the wrong guess faith mother cora whispered and that single word was like a coin tossed its brightburning and dark sides flashing in the air and cass knew that no matter which side the coin landed on something terrible would follow once mother cora left cass finished dressing hannah stared stonily out the window into the night arms crossed biting her lip in barely masked fury when cass was ready hannah opened a desk drawer and took out a gun i know how to use this so dont get any ideas she said slipping it into a pocket of her skirt they walked through the echoing corridor now silent nearly all the women having gone to their rooms for the night they followed the corridor past the entrances onto the field and descended a ramp to the level below the field they passed locker rooms and physical therapy facilities and finally a series of storage rooms and small offices here we are hannah said with fake cheer im sure cora would like me to give you the honeymoon suite seeing as how she thinks youre the second coming and all but she never comes down here so i wouldnt plan on submitting any complaints if you dont like the accommodations she stopped in front of a steel door dont worry hannah said its perfectly adequate at least we dont hear many complaints she pulled the chain from her neck a halfdozen keys jangling but instead of opening the door she balled the keys in her fist and stepped closer to cass look i dont know what happened to you who made those marks on your back and im sure it would be awfully convenient for everyone if you really were miraculously healed but guess whati dont believe you she leaned in so only inches separated them her hot breath on casss face i dont believe you she repeated pausing for emphasis on each word i dont know what your angle is and i dont know how you figure youre going to work it but theres no such thing as healing dont you think that if there was we would have found it i dont know cass shrugged trying to project indifference if all youre doing is standing around praying all day im not sure you would have from what ive seen what youve seen was a whole lot of shit hannah said her face darkening with rage which i guess we both know now but you have no right to judge me no right i didnt shut up hannah said stabbing the bunch of keys into casss sternum sending her stumbling backward shut up unlike you i came here because im a believer and you know what i believe in the future i will do whatever i have to do to build the order into something that works a community a life even if i have to put up with coras insane little beater project but what about me cass demanded figuring she had nothing to lose that parts truei really was healed hannah shook her head lips pressed tight together in fury you dont have any proof so youve got some marks on your backthat could have been anything an accident i dont know some form of mumps or something you caught from your guttertrash boyfriend you didnt get better from prayer you justgot better thats ridiculous cass said you saw me theres no way i could have done that to myself i would haveanyone would be dead from what happened to me unless something changed me unless i was healed but hannah was shaking her head you could have had someone do that to you and its not as bad as it looks as bad as cora wants to think it is its just scratches and scabs its just would you stake your life on that cass demanded her frustration making her belligerent if i bit you would you be willing to bet that i wasnt infected then what if im a carrier what if the blow surprised her coming hard above her left ear sharp enough to stun suddenly she was on the floor warm blood dripping into her ear her head ringing with pain hannah stood above her with her gun in hand shed slammed the butt into her skull thats right i wouldnt get too close to me if i was you cass grunted pulling herself up off the floor she was gratified to see hannah edge backward maybe you ought to start praying after all for insurance you think youre so smart you think you can come here andand suddenly youre the great hope youre coras pet well you might want to think again ive got plans ive got plans for you look i never asked for any of this all i wanted save it i dont really care what you want its about time i start worrying more about what i want after everything ive done for the order for her hannah shook her head with disgust she sorted through the keys then unlocked the door and shoved cass inside nothings going to happen until morning anyway so youll have lots of time to think maybe you can come up with your own little theory so we can all get together and talk about healing cass caught only a brief glimpse of her prison in the second before the door slammed shut enough to know she was in an old weight room with a cot set up in the middle she fumbled her way to the cot in the dark and lay down wondering if monica was locked up somewhere like this nearby after what seemed like hours she fell into a fitful sleep she woke to hannah shining a flashlight in her eyes so coras really going to do it youre the princess i guess last nights fury was gone replaced by a craftiness that was almost worse as they walked back up the stairs to the main level bright morning sun streamed through the walkway and cass smelled food cooking the women were gathered for the morning meal little had changed since the night before except for a wooden pole that now rose from the center of the platform up front and a low table that held a tray covered with a white cloth a drifting feather was lodged near the top of the pole it quivered for a moment in the breeze and then broke free and floated away it was blue a bluebird or blue jay feather cass didnt know she had never bothered to learn anything about birds and now whole species had been lost some sort of small brown undistinguished bird had survived and even flourished and a flock of them chattered from the stands watching and waiting to swoop down for crumbs the birds chatter and the clink of cutlery vied with quiet conversation but both fell silent as she and hannah passed as they neared the platform cass noticed another feature an iron ring bolted to the wood floor the pole was maybe four feet tall with some sort of clamp attached slightly above knee level two metal plates opposed each other they were padded with leather or vinyl and there was about a foot of space between them cass had no idea what the clamps purpose was but it looked ominous she swallowed hardwhat exactly was cora planning hannah directed cass to a chair placed a few feet to the side of the platform two women one in pale pink and the other in red silently stepped away from a nearby table and arrayed themselves behind her cass guessed they were there in case she tried to bolt a murmur started in the back of the assembly and spread forward cass looked out over the crowd shading her eyes from the sun and saw two figures approaching from the field her heart quickened to see that one of them was monica she looked exhausted as though she hadnt slept at all her clothes were wrinkled and soiled her hair was tangled and knotted a woman wearing a gray shirt and white pantsthe only pants cass had seen in the convent other than the ones she wore when she arrivedand a long black braid down her back walked next to her hand on her belt where cass was certain she had a weapon monica passed directly in front of cass without seeming to notice her there were deep purple circles under her eyes and she dragged her feet as she trudged to the platform cass understood now why hannah had been smug whatever cora had planned for cass there was also to be a public punishmentthe reckoning theyd been talking about but what were they going to do to monica the pole that loomed over the platformwas she to be tied to it perhaps beaten the things shed donechallenging the doctrine even refusing to drink the blooddid they really merit a public whipping mother cora appeared from the opening in the stands that led to her quarters elegant in a winecolored tunic and skirt she said a few private words to the deacons gathered at the front table and gave cass a warm smile as she passed the guard was binding monicas hands behind her back and monica shivered frightened and forlorn in the morning chill hannah followed cora to the steps bowing low before going to stand next to the guard behind the low table mother cora regarded monica with an expression that contained more sadness than anger like a teacher whose favorite pupil had disappointed her sister brenda you may begin she said into the microphone and then she bowed her head and went unhurriedly back down the steps to her place at the head of the front table the guard lifted the cloth and fussed with the contents of the tray while hannah seized monica by her dark hair and forced her to her knees bending her head back forcefully so she could see what was coming tears of pain streaming from her eyes sister brenda moved with studied grace lining up objects cass couldnt identify from a distance when she was satisfied she picked up a bowl and a sponge from the tray she dipped the sponge into the bowl drops of water sparkling in the morning sun she crouched in front of monica and dabbed the sponge almost tenderly at her face then squeezed it so that rivulets of water ran down her neck monica sputtered and coughed and brenda returned the bowl and sponge to the table and waited with her hands folded in front of her hannah approached the podium not looking at monica as she spoke sisters her voice boomed through the speaker system echoing off the far corners of the stadium we please our lord with our works and our prayer but we are weak we are flawed each day we stumble on our journey and sometimes we fall and then the lord calls upon us to deliver what is due justice my sisterswe are to serve as the hand of our lord and return to each as she has done we insult our lord if we allow offenses against him to stand we must not invite the weakness to grow and gain a foothold we must smite it with conviction when we do as our lord commands the blemish is lifted the penance is done and we welcome our sister back among us it was all doubletalk no mention of a specific crime no chance for the accused to defend herself sisters hannahs harsh voice rang out as she pointed an accusing finger at monica here before you our sister monica awaits the cleansing of her sin after that things moved quickly brenda picked up a long silver baton from the table and touched it to monicas shoulder when the girl jerked and fell backward hannahs grasp on her hair loosened cass realized the thing was an electric prod the crowd gasped as monica writhed and spasmed on the floor of the platform her eyes rolling back in her head hannah picked her up under the arms and together she and brenda wrestled her into place at the pole in the center of the platform hannah forced monicas head between the padded clamps while brenda spun a wing nut until it no longer turned freely then twisted it manually until her prisoner shrieked in pain held captive by the pressure she fought against the clamps her face red and grotesquely distorted lips pursed and cheeks bulging squeezing up until her eyes almost disappeared sister brenda still the sinning mouth of our sister monica a cry went up as brenda selected objects from the table and bent to her task in one hand was a long curved needle a tail of black thread fluttering in the breeze as brenda leaned in close monica made a keening sound and blood trickled from the clamp where it pinched tightly against her temples the wail escalated to a scream as the needle pierced her flesh but brenda didnt flinch she drew the thread slowly through monicas lips taking care not to let it tangle and then she knotted off the ends as she poked at monicas lower lip with the needle starting the second stitch cass bolted out of her chair and made it almost to the steps she was tackled from behind and went crashing to the ground one of the women who had been posted behind her pinned casss arms and spoke into her ear bad idea she said then she pulled up on casss arms causing white flashes of pain gonna be good cass nodded gritting her teeth as the woman eased up the pressure on her arms and led her back to her chair the assembled crowd could not see the blade the woman held in her palm but cass could feel its cold sharp edge at her neck if she made another attempt to break away the blade could slice through her skin with ease the guards were taking no chancesnot even with her mother coras chosen one brenda had made a couple more stitches tiny red dots of blood bloomed where the needle had gone into the skinless than cass would have expected more shocking to see was the row of neat black xs sealing the outer corner of monicas mouth saliva drooled from her dirty chin as she frantically moaned and struggled for air her breathing was becoming labored as one of her oxygen sources was slowly sealed shut and the sound of her desperately trying to get enough air through her nose was as terrible as her cries of pain unless she calmed down monica was in danger of suffocation of choking on her own vomit or her tongue maybe that would be a kindness the holes made by the needle were bound to become infected there had been no sterilization of the skinor for that matter of the instruments the sharp cold steel at casss neck kept her still even as the last stitches were tied off and monica could only snort desperately for air blood trickling down her grotesquely distorted chin abruptly brenda spun the wing nut counterclockwise the clamps opened and monica fell forward out of the padded restraints she would have hit the floor but hannah caught her and eased her into a seated position bent awkwardly with one leg splayed out in front of her brenda took a key from her neck and worked at the manacle until monicas other leg was freed and then she moved the leg gently into place as though concerned only for monicas comfort she stepped out of the way and her handiwork was on full display monica stared out into the crowd with paindeadened eyes her mouth a ragged row of angry black xs there was a swell of voices among the tables mother cora took to the stage again and held up a hand for silence she waited until the only sound was monicas muffled whimpering sisters the path of the chosen is not easy mother coras imperious voice filled the stadium but you have taken up the yoke because you are strong because you are the ones who are called to act ours is a community of love and the lord never asks more than when he asks us to guide one of our own because the guiding can be harsh today you saw the evidence of that monica swayed as though she was about to faint and brenda stepped forward to steady her but cass wondered how many in attendance noticed they were all focused on mother cora now however it is time for joyous news sister cassandra mother cora called with a regal outstretch of her arm approach the altar cass did so knowing the guards would force her if necessary monica didnt appear to see her though she passed a few feet away sisters this is cassandra who has come to us on a mission from our lord he spoke to sister cassandra and commanded her to come here to us and make of herself a sacrifice our lord promised sister cassandra that when she gives herself to the fallen he will lift her up from their scourge he will heal her fever and her wounds he will make her whole again with the power of our prayers she will join us in an exalted position as a full sister of the order suddenly horrifyingly cass understood what mother cora meant to do she intended to give cass to the beaters to be infected the disease would take root and she would be shown to the others like an exhibit at a zoo her flaming skin and pinpoint irises proof of the disease she would shuffle and babble and slowly lose her awareness and for the second time she would start to pull out her hair and bite her own arms and then at some point the diseasemother cora was counting on itwould reverse itself as it had the first time and cass would be the proof mother cora needed to further strengthen the faith of her congregation mother cora had run out of things to give them safety and sustenance might not always be enoughnot when the women were forced to live under the rule of an unforgiving faith whose punishments were harsh and whose demands were draconian the order could not succeed forever unless it delivered one miracle after another was needed to keep the illusion alive shelter and safety had been miracles enough in the beginning but that had been a long time ago now and the women were hungry for more cass was this womans next miracle and to witness cassandras sacrifice we bring our most precious resource mother cora continued as a small commotion erupted at the back of the assembly cass scanned the field looking for its source the next generation of the order the children down the center aisle between the tables a girl of nine or ten made her way uncertainly she wore a white dress that was too short for her lanky legs and her freckled face was pink with anxiety but most arresting of all was the fact that she had been shaved bald the hair and the dress gloria had said scoured clean of this world some religions demanded the hair be covered the order had taken it away entirely the first girl was followed by another and another each younger than the one beforeand each one bald all of them looked nervous and frightened and they all wore white dresses a child of six sniffled as though she was trying not to cry another little girl wiped her eyes with her fists the younger ones were accompanied by adultstheir teachers their tenders women who looked as nervous as the charges as the smallest children came down the aisle cass searched frantically for ruthie was it that one with the pudgy arms or therebut wasnt she too small wouldnt ruthie have grown taller by now when the last of the children entered the aisle and walked toward the platform cass felt her heart seize with agony where was ruthie a loud rattling came from the direction of the enclosure at the other end of the field and the crowd turned to see the beater cart emerge being pulled by a guard whose face was covered by a white mask inside the beater howled scrambling and stumbling as the cart rolled unevenly along and then at the back of the crowd one more figure hurried into view it was a slender woman with a halo of frizzy brown hairand a child in her arms she was frantically smoothing the little girls dress into place as she tried to catch up to the others cass leaned over the platform as far as she dared craning to see the child wore little black shoes buckled over white socks and she pressed a fist against her mouth as she leaned against the womans shoulder the same way ruthie always had ever since she was an infant ruthie had never sucked her thumb or a pacifier like other children but she would press a fist to her mouth to comfort herself how many times had cass found her that way in her crib sleeping sweetly with her hand curled against her sweet rosebud lips and thereeven with her hair gonecass knew the shape of her babys head a thousand times she had run her hand over ruthies head there were her long eyelashes dark brown with sunlightened tips and there was the faintest reminder of the funny little fold in her pudgy forearm as the minder drew closer the sleepy child yawned and then she opened her eyes and looked directly at cass and in their bright emerald depths cass saw her baby her ruthie and knew that she had been wrong so wrongshe would not leave here without her childshe would die before she ever let her go again ruthies bright green eyes widened and she stiffened in the womans arms then she started to thrash wildly trying to get down but the woman only held her tighter mother coras smile faltered as she watched the struggle she covered the microphone and said something to one of the other women on the platform the adults were guiding the children into a line across the platform but they stepped aside to create a break in the row and ruthies attendant hurried past and disappeared behind the others out of sight but cass had seen and she was sure mother cora leaned back into the microphone i give you the future she murmured her voice amplified to fill the stadium on cue the children clasped each others hands and lifted them into the air and they looked like a chain of paper dolls eerie and silent as stones cass waited for them to pray or sing but they did neither they stood still above the crowd frightened and unmoving no no no talking gloria had warned cass you wont know her the women in the audience held their collective breath they were waiting too both joy and grief reflected in their faces were they remembering other children other times mother cora had bought casss lie that it was children who had healed her so mother cora had no choice but to bring them out now when she was about to sacrifice cass as if reading her thoughts cora stepped forward and slipped a cool hand into casss and led her down the stairs to the beaters cart a few of the smaller children started to cry but they were silent even as tears spilled on their cheeks they had been trainedor threatenedeffectively the beater hung on to the wire sides of the cage moaning softly and snorting its need and its longing in daylight it was clear that there had been no healing at all it was as torn and scabbed and crazed as any cass had ever seen missing several teeth and most of its hair and chunks of its lips great patches of black and red filled in where skin had been torn away cora avoided looking at the beater as she handed cass off to hannah who waited close to the cages door blessings on you cassandra cora said before returning to the podium dont worry it probably wont hurt any more than getting your mouth sewn shut hannah said quietly so that only cass could hear her and then you get that whole euphoria thing thatll be fun dont you think oh you must be so excited the gloved and masked attendant who had wheeled out the cage was gone the beater had managed to jam an oozing and crusted hand through the bars strips of dead skin hung from its arm and its scabbed lips were pulled back in a furious leer the women at the farthest tables scrambled to see what was happening near the stage mounting chairs and tables to get an unobstructed view the guards stationed at the periphery of the crowd moved closer hannah seized casss arm ready cassandra i can guess what you must be thinkingthis is gonna hurt like hell and you know i think you might be right she removed a key from the key chain around her neck you understand that i dont want to get too close not being the chosen one you do the honors cassandraopen up and shut the door behind you and just so you know brendas a hell of a shot cass had only seconds left she scanned the line of silent children one more time searching for ruthie im coming for you she thought and then she took the key from hannahs hand brenda had slipped on a mask and gloves and stepped up to the cage brandishing the shock baton monica had been stunned with stretching out strategically to be as far away as possible from the thing she pushed the baton through the bars and jammed it against the creatures shoulder blades it twitched and screamed and fell to the floor spasming in pain now hannah ordered cass fitted the key to the lock with shaking fingers trying not to look at the form shuddering on the floor of the cart only a few feet away get inside or brenda will shoot but there was one thing that hannah couldnt know in the split second after cass slid the key into the cage doors padlock she whispered ruthies name and all the months of longing and guilt and grief twisted into one fine strand and pulled taut inside her she opened the cage door put one foot inside glanced at the wrecked abomination writhing on the floor and then she did the one thing that even she would never have guessed she was capable of she prayed she called out to god and in one word asked his indulgence asked for one more day one more hour one more minute with her daughter in her arms please and she seized hannahs wrist and she pulled with everything she had and hannah grunted and stumbled and she never saw it coming and she tripped and fell and there was cass cass who had willed herself stronger than five women cass whose body had spurned and rejected disease cass who flung hannah like a used and dirtied rag into the cage and then slammed the door shut and jammed the padlock back into place and flung the key in a spinning sparkling arc through the gilded sun of aftertime until it disappeared far down the field landing in a planter box of golden poppies the likes of which no one ever expected to see again the beater was getting slowly to its hands and feet foam and spit wetting its screaming mouth as it crawled toward hannah cass turned away in time to see brenda swinging the electric prod through the air toward her but she dodged out of the way before she could recover her balance cass slammed into her hard and brenda fell landing on the baton and screaming as it delivered its jolting energy into her body cass stomped on her jerking hand and she screamed harder women shouted and guards fought their way through the crowd toward her and cass knew she had only seconds she scrambled up on stage where the children had stopped singing and were clutching their caregivers and each other in fear monica leaned against the post her eyes rolled up in her head and cass couldnt tell if she was even conscious her mouth swelling into a grotesque clowns visage a guard broke through the front of the crowd and cass steeled herself for the shot but the woman stumbled and went down as the congregation surged around her all the other women trying to get close enough to see the excitement a few rows back those pushing into the aisles surged over each other trampling the ones who fell there was a sound of a gunshot and one of the nearest acolytes fell to the ground a red stain blooming on her shirt the childrens caretakers were trying to herd them down the steps but the growing chaos slowed them down the girls clutching each other in fear and still none of them made a sound cass pushed through the line toward the back of the platform and there she was the woman whod carried ruthie crouched at the back edge as though she was about to jump it was at least a dozen feet down but she looked scared enough to do itbut where was ruthie cass fell to her knees beside the woman grabbed her arm shook her where is she she demanded but the woman fought her scuttling sideways out of reach where the woman jumped the sound of a bone breaking followed by screaming and she lay on her side her leg bent unnaturally a second woman jumped narrowly missing the first though she was luckier she managed to get to her feet and staggered away limping all through the stadium women panicked some crawled under tables some crowded the exits to the stands pushing and shoving to get out the platforms stairs were jammed with children and cass glimpsed a guard trying to find a shot at her between them she glimpsed a hand clawing at the bars of the cage but whether it was hannahs or the beaters she was too far away to tell cass crawled behind the line of children their white dresses making a billowing wall two of the oldest girls picked up the younger ones to carry them to safety and suddenly cass saw ruthie crouched down next to monica her small hand on monicas ruined face as though trying to fix it cass threw herself the last few feet and swept ruthie into her arms monica stirred her eyes rolling back in her head monica you have to move cass screamed hooking her free hand under monicas arm monica stumbled to her feet and nearly fell again cass wrapped an arm around her waist and dragged her toward the stairs the last of the children and the one or two adults who had not abandoned them in the melee were descending the steps leaving them alone and exposed monica stumbling against her as though she was drunk cass scanned the exits knowing that it would be next to impossible to get there in time especially as she saw a guard edging around the beater cage and another sprinting along the edge of the crowd toward her cass froze at the top of the stairs the minute the children were out of the way the guards would shoot and she couldnt risk ruthies lifebut she couldnt leave monica behind either the air cracked with gunfire and monica slumped against her cass looked down to see a jagged hole in monicas throat beginning to fill with blood and knew the impossible decision had been made for her she hitched ruthie up tightly against her as monicas body slumped at her feet im sorry she whispered bending to touch monicas cheek already clammy and lifeless then she ran to the back of the platform hunched low as the guards fired again and again on the ground below the injured woman was curled over her shattered leg rocking with pain but cass didnt hesitate she hit the ground at a tuck and rolled twice shielding ruthie as well as she could with her body the turf scratched and burned her skin and she didnt care and she came up running the move had bought her a mere second or two but she made the most of them joining the crowds rushing for the edge of the field unlike the others who fought to get to the safety of the corridors cass broke away at the last minute and slipped behind the planters lined up along the long side of the field she pried ruthie from her neck and pushed her through the bars separating the stands from the field and then swung herself up arms burning with the effort and levered her body between the bars ruthies eyes shone with unspilled tears she raised her arms to be picked up and cass swung her up and ran her feet pounding the metal benches as she zigzagged her way up the stands eyes on the skyboxes running as fast as she ever had knowing no one could catch her now through the skybox into the stairwell down the stairs careening off the walls rather than slowing to take the turns and then she was in the anteroom she didnt recognize either of the guards who gaped at her and reached for their weapons as she burst into the room the sounds from inside the stadium were muffled here but she could make out voices and screaming and more gunshots theres been an accident cass panted out of breath her arms aching from carrying ruthie the beaters got out and its chaos in there youve got to let us out let me get help what happened the guard at the narrow window demanded she pushed a pair of thicklensed glasses up on her nose a reckoning cass said it went all wrong this child was hurt and she doesnt look hurt the other guard a leatheryfaced woman wearing a thin lavender blouse with heavy black boots hesitated with her hand on her holstered gun a beater got her they shot it like four times it went down but i think it bit her first i need to get her some help in the box the guards exchanged a glance the one wearing glasses backed away from cass what makes you think shes bit the other one demanded is the skin broken you want to take that chance cass demanded i saw it myselfit had its mouth on her listen to me theres beaters running around loose in there you really want to stand around here chatting no one said anything for a moment and cass held her breath if they were true believersif they shared mother coras faiththey would never let cass go theyd just send ruthie back to be prayed better there was no reason for them to believe cass a stranger not even a fullfledged member of the order the first guard backed up even farther keep her away from me she muttered just let us leave cass said edging toward the door im going now you can come with me if you want you might want to think about whats going to happen if things get worse in there across the street they can still lock that shit out she put her weight against the heavy latch pushing it open half expecting one of the guards to stop her ruthies body was sweaty and hot against her but she clung tenaciously the door opened onto a brilliant morning cass staggered out onto the sidewalk and stood blinking in the sun seconds later she heard the sound of the door being bolted shut behind her cass a man broke away from a small group of people gathered across the street and raced toward her smoke he ran as though he didnt intend to stop as though his life depended on it depended on herand then he stopped short seeing that she held ruthie in her arms his hands hung useless at his sides he looked from cass to ruthie and back again eyes wide breathing hard ruthie clung tight she still hadnt made a single sound she pressed her tearstreaked face against casss neck and though cass had barely any feeling left in her arms and her back burned from the strain she gripped her precious child even tighter this is my daughter ruthie ruthie smoke repeated and her daughters name on his lips was to casss surprise a sound she had always wanted to hear hearing smoke say her name ruthie twisted in casss arms and peeked out at him curiously then leaned her head on casss chest and kept on looking at him longlashed eyes wide shes bald i know cass said itll grow back they did it to all the kids symbolized being scoured clean or something i was going to say beautiful those eyestheyre yours cass shook her head thats just from being an outlier the pigment doesnt fade even after you recover no thats not what i meant theyre smoke traced a shape in the air a gentlytilted oval big and turned up at the corners just like yours and she has your nose your chin beautiful like i said oh cass felt warmth creep up the back of her neck what the hell is going on in there it sounds like theyve started a warwe were about to come in after you its moments from the past few days flashed through casss mind like pictures in the viewmaster her daddy gave her when she was a little girl her first glimpse of the field greener than any real lawn ever was mother cora arms lifted in prayer monicas wrecked and bleeding mouth the girls shaved and frightened walking down the aisle like flower girls at a wedding the beater screaming in excitement when hannah fell into the cage cass shook her head unable to speak her whole body starting to shake let me take her smoke said and when he held out his arms sungilded and strong ruthie regarded him for only a moment before she offered him one perfect small hand and allowed him to fold it in his own he lifted her gently and tucked her in the crook of one arm and she reached for his face and touched it with her fingers ruthie was dirty and bald and her dress was torn and one of her shoes was missing and she was the most beautiful thing cass had ever seen casss entire body ached but when smoke circled his free arm around her and drew her close she went without hesitation she breathed in the smell of him salt and soap and worry and when his lips found hers she kissed him thirstily she kissed him as though he was sustenance as though he was life itself we shouldnt she whispered against his mouth but he held her tighter and she pressed herself against him and kissed him again deeper harder hungrier her body was exhausted and spent but somewhere inside the tiny part that refused to give up woke to his touch she had ruthie she had smoke it was enough acknowledgements the existence of this book is a testament to the tenacity and vision of two people my agent barbara poelle who only accepts no when it suits herand my editor adam wilson who gets it and then some in the moments when the story shines its because of them thanks too to the entire harlequin team who made me feel welcome from day one sophie littlefield
