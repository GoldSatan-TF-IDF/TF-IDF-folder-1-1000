mercedes lackey sacred ground to those who were here first mitaque oyasin chapter she poured a dipperful of water over the hot rocks in the heaterbox and steam hissed up in sudden clouds saturating the dimly lit sauna with moisture the smoke of cedar and sweetgrass joined the steam the humidity making both scents so vivid she tasted them in the back of her throat she sat down crosslegged on the wooden floor boards that had been sanded as smooth as satin underneath her bare thighs it didnt matter to heror more importantly to grandfatherthat this sweatlodge was really a commercially made portable sauna that the rocks were heated by electricity and not in a fire that the sweetgrass and cedar smoke were from incense bought at an esoteric bookstore in tulsa or even that the sweatlodge as a place for meditation was more common among the lakotah sioux than the osage grandfather had borrowed judiciously from other nations to remake the ways of the little old men into something that worked again the destination is what matters he had told her a thousand times and the path you take to get there not whether your ritual clothing is of tradecloth or buckskin the water you drink from a streamer a spring or even the kitchen tap sometimes ancient ways are not particularly wise just old so they had this contrivance of the inshtaheh the heavy eyebrows installed in what had been the useless halfbath at the back of the house she and grandfather shared most of the time it served as nothing more esoteric than anyone elses sauna useful for aching muscles and staving off colds sometimes it served purposes the inshtaheh who built it would never have dreamed of she closed her eyes sweat salty on her upper lip and stripped off the layers of her working self the way she had stripped the layers of her working clothing before she had taken her ritual bath and entered the nowsanctified wooden box there were layers to who she was like an onion each layer both hiding the one beneath and keeping the one beneath from reaching outward jennifer talldeer the face that the white world saw ironic name for a woman a shade less than five feet in height doubly ironic considering how tall osage men and women tended to be your mothers genes was what her father said when she asked him why she was the runt of the litter that sneaky cherokee blood you know how they are with no acrimony no one in her family believed in refighting old battles her mother had just smiled private investigator degree in criminology nice little house nice little neighborhood nice little mortgage in one of the older parts of tulsa nice old neighbors who thought it charming of her to take in her aged and infirm ha grandfather that persona was the first to go washed away in the steam next the woman who danced at the powwows engaged in her little hobby of rescuing sacred objects from profane hands another mask just one a little closer to the truth a little deeper to the bone a woman who bore two names one for the earthpeople and one for the skypeople although it was the latter she used hulahtome good eagle woman daughter of hulahshutsy red eagle good eagle was not registered on either side of her family osage or cherokee but she and her family had more right to call themselves native american than plenty who were registered and could speak of no more than a single grandparent of the full blood fly away good eagle gone there wasnt much there anyway jennifer was what she did good eagle was simply an intermediary between what she did and what she was last layer what she was the third osage name a name that was learned and not given kestrelhuntsalone not a normal name for a woman kestrel pupil of a man with three names her grandfather his heavy eyebrows name frank talldeer his second quite out of keeping with the tzisho and a name embodying contradiction kahaska white crow and his thirdembodying even more contradiction than the firstkahameopah mooncrow crows do not fly at night nor are they associated with the moon and those birds that do fly at night are generally the enemies of crows the power of the osage centered on the sun not the moon a man of power should have had a sunname like her fathers contradiction piled on contradiction shamanic apprentice to her grandfather her spiritname was taken from her spiritanimal student as she was in the teaching of one of the little old men of the niukonska the children of the middle waters whom the heavy eyebrows and long knives called osage by birth and by spirit she was gentle tzisho gens the peacemakers and here lay the irony for not only was mooncrow teaching her the peaceful medicine of tzisho he was teaching her the medicine of the warriors the earth people the hunkah and as if that were not enough he was teaching her the special medicines reserved for each of the clans for that she had thought one had to be a medicine chief and not simply a shaman grandfather had never once come out and said that he was then again maybe he was simply living up to his contrary nature he wasnt registered either nor were any of his forefathers and he wouldnt use any of the peyote rituals that had crept into and indeed supplanted most of the osage ways they were like kudzu or mimosa in the redclay soilnot native but once there impossible to get rid of he had certainly been teaching her things no tradition she knew of called for he had adopted the lakotah sacred pipe and he was passing to her the medicines of virtually every osage clan from bear to otter to eagle things she thought were kept as clan secrets that would be like him the man who cheerfully used an electric sauna for a sweatlodge who prepared sacred tobacco in a fruitdryer bought at an exhippies yard sale who purchased his cornmeal for ceremonies at the big chain grocery who taught a woman warriors medicine kestrel realized where her thoughts were leading her and resolutely brought her concentration back where it belonged this seeking was not about mooncrow but about herself about her progress or rather lack of progress there was something holding her back and she did not know what it was mooncrow would not tell her saying only that if there really was something holding up her progress she already knew what it was typical contrary reasoning she wondered where hed gotten that particular mindset it wasnt typical for osage medicine and it certainly made life difficult for his student she could have used a teacher less like coyote and crow and more like buffalo and eagle simpler instruction fewer tricks more straightforward direction fewer riddles hes doing it to me again making her annoyed taking her thoughts off the path to be honest making her angry he had chosen to teach her and how he taught her was his choice not hers it was her duty her privilege to learn if she were failing somewhere it was up to her to find out where and why and correct it only then would she earn her medicinepipe she let her temper cool poured another dipperful of water on the rocks saw that the cedar still burned and started over determined that mooncrow and his contrary ways would not distract her again he was just doing that like the buffalo who did what they pleased when and where they pleased and if it seemed outofseason who would dare to stop them steam wreathed her heat and semidarkness held her and this time she slipped away from herself to fly among the other worlds among the other peoples of water earth and sky it was in the sky she found herself a sky blue and cloudless to the east dark and cloudy to the west with grandfather sun on her back and wings and the heat of thermals off the prairie below bearing her up she flew above the meeting of forest and prairie with the oaks and redbud cottonwood and willow stretching into the east and an endless sea of tallgrass to the west if she had worn human shape there would have been the hot dry scent of grasses carried by the thermal she rode but raptors have no sense of smell and all that came to her through her nares was the heavy drowsy heat she flew in the shape of her spiritanimal the kestrel of her name a good shape one suited to swift travel although if she had hopped like toad or crawled like turtle the results would have been the samethose she needed to have counsel of would have found her if she had not been able to travel swiftly enough to find them that was the way it was the wahkontah saw to it in whatever ways it suited the great mystery to work if however she chose to perch and waitshe would never find those wise counselors and it wasnt a good idea to tempt other smaller mysteries into action against her by being lazy so she flew low over tallgrass prairie until movement below sent her up to hover as only kestrel of all the falcons could rabbit looked up at her from the shadows at the base of the grass his nose twitching with amusement come down little sister he offered come and tell me what you seek out of your world and in mine she stooped and landed beside him claws closing on grass stems as if they were a mouse an answer she said folding her wings with a careful flip to align the feathers properly for a raptors life depends on her feathers what is it that keeps me unworthy to become a pipebearer where have i failed i am not the one to ask said rabbit his pink nose quivered as he tested the air constantly and his graybrown coat blended perfectly with the dead grass of last year you know what my counsel is silence and care and always vigilance i do not think that will help you much but perhaps our cousin in the grasses there can answer you he pointed with his quivering pink nose at a spiderweb strung between three tall grass stems and the outstretched branch of a blackberry bush spider watched her from the center of her web swaying with the breeze a large black and tan orbspider nearly the size of her kestrelhead rabbit accepted her word of thanks and hopped away in a moment he had vanished among the grasses she repeated her question to spider who thought it over for a moment or two as the breeze swayed her web and flies buzzed tantalizingly near you must know that i am going to counsel patience she said for that is my way all things come to my web eventually and break their necks therein kestrel bobbed her head though she did not feel particularly patient that is true she replied but it is more than lack of patiencei must be unready somehow there is something i have not done properly if you feel that strongly then you are unready spider replied agreeing with her i see that you do have great patienceexcept perhaps with your grandfather but he is a capricious little old man and difficult and his tricks do not make you laugh as they did when you were a child i think perhaps i cannot see what it is that makes you unready why not ask one with sharper eyes than mine she wondered for a moment if there was a hidden message in that little speech about her grandfather but if there was she couldnt see it spider pointed to the blue sky above with one of her forelegs and kestrels sharp eyes spotted the tiny dot that could only be prairie falcon soaring high in a thermal her feathers slicked down to her body in reflex for the prairie falcon of the plains of the outer world would quite happily make a meal of a kestrel for that matter if she let fear overcome her prairie falcon of the inner world would happily make a meal of kestrel but that was a lesson she had learned long ago and the tiny atavistic fears of the form she wore were things she had overcome many times she thanked spider who turned her interest back to a dewdrop threatening her web and launched herself into the air she returned to the steamladen sauna with no answers only a load of defeat and the surety that she was not only unready she was unworthy not good enough and she still didnt know why kestrel became good eagle woman good eagle woman assumed the mask of jennifer she opened her eyes and stood carefully feeling for the switch that turned the heaterbox off then finding the door latch and pushing it open releasing the steam into the airconditioned cool of the hall there were old bathrobes hanging beside the sauna she wrapped herself in one and headed for the shower as the hot water sheeted down her body she tried to let it clear her spirit of depression it didnt succeed not entirely she should have been ready by now she should have been good enough she had mastered skills just as difficult in a shorter time frameto save money shed gotten her fouryear degree in three years while continuing to study the shamanic traditions not good enough that hung in her chest a weight on her soul and heart pulling her to the ground when she wanted to fly it was timeit was more than time she had spent years in this apprenticeship she should have been ready by now she should have been good enough how long had she been doing this anyway since i was just a kid she thought trying to remember the very first time her grandfather had singled her out for teaching then it came to her you see rabbit granpa asked her coming up behind her on the whitepainted back porch so quietly he had made no sound but she had known he was there she always knew where he was he was a presence to the heart like a little sun a glow always shining with energy and cheer she had been sitting on the porch for a while just watching the birds at the feeder when the little rabbit had crept cautiously up to help himself to some of the stale bread her mother put out for the crows and grackles he couldnt have been more than two months old no longer dependent on his mother but scarcely half the size of a grown rabbit he never stopped watching all around while he nibbled never stopped swiveling his ears in every direction alert for danger his fur looked very soft softer than her cats and her fingers itched to stroke him but she knew that if she moved he would be off in a moment she nodded not speaking granpa wouldnt frighten the rabbit no matter what he did or said she knew that but she also knew she would it was just a fact like the green grass granpa could walk right up to a wild deer and touch it she wouldnt be able to get within a mile of one no not just this rabbit granpa persisted rabbit she had not puzzled at the statement as virtually any adult and most children would have she heard what he meant not what he said and looked deeper that was when the halfgrown cottontail became rabbit grew to adulthuman size and more sat up and looked at her hello little sister he said politely thank your mother for her bread but ask her if she would put some of the kitchen greens out here for us as well would you carrotends taste just fine to us and bugchewed cabbage leaves or rusty lettuce crow might like a taste of carrot now and again too wideeyed she had nodded noting how modest he was how quiet how he had made his thanks before making his request it came to her then right into her mind how hard life was for himhow everything was his enemy he not only had to flee his ancient foes of hawk and coyote rattlesnake and fire but the new ones brought by humans dog and cat and humans hunted him tooshed eaten rabbit often herself but he survived by being quiet by skill at hiding and running and by being very very fruitful he sired many offspring so that one out of every ten might live to sire or give birth and he did well by being something of an opportunist now that the land had been covered with houses with neat backyards there were alleys full of weeds to eat and hide in and sometimes the kitchen rubbish to eat as well there were spaces between fences and under houses or garages to make into warrens dogs and cats could be dodged by escaping into another yard or under a porch and of the hawks and falcons only kestrels hunted among the houses at all regularly rabbit had adapted to the world created by the heavy eyebrows and now prospered where creatures that had not adapted were not prospering just like us she thought with astonishment just like mommy and daddy and granpa because they lived in a house in the suburbs of claremore because daddy didnt get tribal oil money he had a job as a welder and that was the same for mommy and granpa too there was nothing to show that they were osage and cherokee except their name they lived just like their neighbors went to church every sunday at first presbyterian and mommy even had bridge club on thursday afternoonexcept like rabbit they had a secret life of stories traditions and dances and special ceremonies that none of their neighbors knew about they had their hiding places in between the fences and under the porches of the white ways where they did their osage and cherokee things granpa had laughed and rabbit dwindled and became a halfgrown cottontail who had fled like a windblown leaf into the dark shadows under the honeysuckle that was when he had taken her by the hand led her in to daddy who was finishing his breakfast and said this one that was definitely it the moment she had begun training at grandfathers hands there hadnt been many children her age in their neighborhood and there werent any of them she really cared to hang around with grandfather had taken pains to make the training into games and she hardly missed not having playmates at some point though it had turned serious no longer a game but a responsibility she rinsed her hair with a torrent of hot water wryly congratulating herself on putting in the biggest hotwater tank available a small luxury like the sauna an advantage of being an adult with your own homethough when it came to responsibility she had been an adult for years before she had moved out of her parents home maybe they were both a little environmentally excessive but she was frugal with her energy use in general and she confronted her conscience with the stacks of recycling bins in the kitchen she recycled everything and food leavings went either to the neighbors compost heap or to feed the birds squirrels rabbits and freeloading cats there was no question when that turning point of adult responsibility in her lessons had happened it had been at one of the powwows in the tulsa area and she had been thirteen until tonight the powwow had been a lot of fun dad had won the traditional fancydancer contest but although she had been urged to compete by several of her friends good eagle had remained in the stands during the ladies contests held there by a growing feeling of tension for nowthere was something in the air and not just the hint of the thunderstorm that usually put in an appearance every year during this particular powwow the ponderous heat of august nearly one hundred today had baked the area in and around the grandstands as thoroughly as if they were inside a giant oven the grass lay parched and burned to soft brown limp strands of fiber with only a hint of green near the roots the earth still radiated heat cracked and baked flinthard that was one reason why the adult contests were always held at nightto prevent the participants from passing out with sunstroke and although rain threatened it had not fallen and the arena lights made a haze of the dust raised by hundreds of dancing feet tonight there wasnt even a breeze to clear it away something else weighed heavily tonight besides the heat grandfather felt it too for he was unusually quiet she kept looking around at the stands wondering who or what it could bethen beyond the stands up into the sky where heatlightning nickered orange behind the trees grandfathers hand took hers and she started as a kind of electric charge passed between them it jolted her out of herselfbut not into the other worlds she was still in her own world standing beside her body as grandfather stood beside his to any onlooker they were only an old man and his small granddaughter enraptured by the dancers someone is trying to make trouble kestrel grandfather said two someones i think one of them is white he wants to cause a fight and blame it on the peoples but the other is osage he wants the fight too but he wants it to get power over some of the young hotheads that is what we feel we must deal with both these young men but grandfather how are we to stop this fightlike this she asked puzzled shouldnt the policemen take care of it an innocent question at thirteen she had still trusted the police she had still trusted in white mans justice grandfather had not disabused her of thatbecause he was wise enough to know that sometimes the wrongs were not entirely onesided perhaps that was why she had gone into law in the first place i will deal with the white boys i am more used to this way of things than you are he told her but i need a young warrior to deal with the other his eyes sparkled as he looked at her and she knew that she was the one he meant excitement had made her shiver this was an adult task and grandfather made it clear that she was to deal with this young man without supervision she saw then that he had his own medicinecostume on it looked much like his dancinggear except that he carried his implements openly not hidden in their pouches he is taking peyote grandfather continued a faint note of disgust in his voice he has taken it already thinking it will help him dance better to raise the power he needs to control and impress his friends he has not even done it properly he has not followed either the west moon or east moon church ways he has simply made up some nonsense of his own he will be able to see you you must go and stop him it never entered her head to tell him no grandfather was right this was important there had been trouble at this site before and there were people who came to the powwows purely to harass the participants the only way to get permission to use public land like mohawk park was to make the event open to the public that meant open to troublemakers too liquor was a problem for people often brought strong alcohol with them heat and hot tempers did not help in the least he is down among the dancers there grandfather said and slid down under the grandstand into a shadow what came out of the shadow was not a human but a rangy old coyote who gave her a hangingtongue coyote grin and was gone if her responsibility was down among the dancers milling around the entrance to the arena for the next competition that gave her an advantage she only needed to go down there and walk among them in spirit there was no reason for a woman to be in their company and her target would be the only one who would notice her since she would not be wearing her body no sooner decided than done she dropped down under the grandstand and drifted through the crowd there to the place where the dancers had gathered then she walked among them staring each one in the face they ignored her intent on their preparations unable to see her except perhaps as a ghostly shadow all but one he glared at her and looked ready to speak she saw the peculiarly fixed stare of a peyotetaker and knew that he was the one her grandfather had meant she gave him no opportunity to speak instead she seized him by the wrist and as he started in surprise and tried to resist she stepped off into the other worlds taking his spirit with her as she pulled his spirit from his body she sensed his body collapsing not too surprising for grandfather claimed that the peyotetakers who did not follow the proper ways relied on the drug rather than discipline to walk among the worlds and as a consequence had no control over their bodies when they left them he did not approve of peyote at all really but he would not condemn others for using it if they were properly prepared as this man was not she had transformed herself as she stepped over the threshold now she was no longer a little girl in a buckskin dress but a tall young man modeled after her brother in full warriors gear she sensed that this young man would not listen to anyone except someone he deemed stronger than himself he pulled out of her grip she let him he stood looking about at the open prairie full moon overhead with no sign of humans in any direction he cared to stare slowly his eyes widened as he realized where he must be you meant to cause a fight she said flatly knowing what he had intended without needing to ask him you just wanted to get on television so you could look important to your friends you tell them that youre a big civilrights activist but all you want is to look like a big shot youve been telling them that youre a medicine person a shaman but you arent a shaman youre just a phony a faker and everything you do is just tricks and drugs if her accusations surprised him with their accuracy he wasnt going to admit it he simply crossed his arms over his chest and she sensed he was going to try to bluff his way out of this while youre pretending to have medicine powers all youve done is have a couple of sweatlodges and taken a lot of peyote she continued sternly you didnt even do the sweatlodges right and you might just as well have gone to a health club instead he needs to learn a lesson she thought that is what grandfather wants me to dosee that he gets it he cares more for himself and what he can make people do than whether or not it is good for them that was when she realized who should deliver the lesson and what it should be as he regained his courage and turned a frowning face to try to bully her she stepped back a pace and transformed again this time she wore the semblance of the shewolf and she raised her nose to the moon to summon the pack howls answered her from all sides and before the young man could blink he found himself surrounded by the wolves of the pack both the great gray timber wolves and their smaller cousins of the prairie and even one or two of the rangy red wolves that were long gone from her world they all stared at him with great yellow eyes fur tipped with silver from the moon above you called the pack sister said the pack leader gravely she bowed her head to him as a female she need not bare her throat in submission to a male i did brother she replied this is one who leads his pack into danger for the sake of his own ambition and prestige and does not care what will befall them so long as his power is increased so said the leader turning his golden gaze on the young man who shrank away you think perhaps i should challenge his right to lead then again she bowed her head as you wish pack leader she replied humbly i am but a young female i only know this one needs discipline the leader grinned toothily then discipline he shall have in a moment there was a young wolf where the young man had stood another moment passed while he trembled with shock and surprise then the lead wolf was on him treating him as he would any young fool who dared to challenge him for the right to lead the pack there would be no killingoh no but before this one was sent back to his body by the contemptuous fling of a pair of lupine jaws he would be certain he was about to be killed not once but a hundred times over likely he would not again dare to reach for medicine powers he was not entitled to with the help of peyote not after this experience satisfied that the lead wolf had the situation well in hand she stepped back across the threshold and into her own body just in time to see the competition begin paramedics were taking the young man who had collapsed to the i firstaid tent they were probably assuming heatstroke he would wake up soonand with no more thoughts of causing trouble tonight at least grandfathers hand tightened around hers and she looked up into his wrinkled smiling face well done he whispered that was all he never told her what he had done but later her father told them a story hed gotten from one of the tulsa county sheriffs about a dog that had spooked the normally steady horse ridden by one of the mounted officers the rangy dogreportedly a german shepherdhad driven the horse right down a trail away from the powwow and into a gathering of young white boys who were carrying bats and chains were drunk and were obviously out to start a fight the officer had rounded them up with the help of his suddenly cooperative horse and had seen they were escorted out of the parkand had arrested the most aggressive for public intoxication damnest thing theyd ever seen her father had said with a curious glance at grandfather those crowdcontrol ponies just dont spook and to head in the right direction like that grandfather hadnt said anything and neither had jennifer but from that moment the games ended and the serious work began from then on shed applied herself with the same determination that shed given to her studies there hadnt been much room in her life for anything else particularly not once she started her sideline of finding the first time it had been by accident shed been working on a case that had taken her up to indiana tracing the movements of a childsupport dodger shed found herself in a tiny town with four hours to kill and had in desperation followed a sign that pointed the way to a county museum museum wasnt exactly what she would have called it it looked more like the leavings of the attics for miles around for the past several generations there was an attempt at outlining the county history in the first room but after that it had been dusty glass case after case full of mostly unlabeled flotsam without a doubt some of it was genuine and valuable the civil war artifacts for instance but right beside war diaries that screamed for proper preservation were stuffed squirrels stuffed birds stuffed fish a mummified mermaid a shrunken head someones collection of jelly jars and the relics she nearly doubled over with nausea she couldnt even bear to touch the case scalps medicine bags articles of clothing weapons and three or four dozen skulls all of them crying out to her of death bloody horrible death kestrel had come very near to starting a mourning keen until the jennifer persona took over she staggered to the front of the museum and managed to ask about that particular case the attendant a girl who was obviously trying to do her best first described the terrible problem she was having trying to preserve the things worth preserving with no money she carried on at length about the importance of the papers and belongings of the settlers gradually it dawned on jennifer that this girl never said a word about the indians so far as she was concerned the history of the area began and ended with the white settlers when she finally got the girl to tell her about the case of bones and artifacts the girl shrugged dismissively mound builders of some kind she said abram vanderzandt found them when he arrived looking for a place to homestead and they were all dead probably some other tribe killed them and he could have taken credit and turned in the scalps for bounty but he was an honest man and he just collected a few souvenirs the girl continued apparently blithely unawareor uncaringthat jennifer was native american that she had dismissed the taking of souvenirs from the victims of the massacre as casually as if they had been nothing more important than the stuffed squirrels for a moment jennifer was outrageduntil the girl continued and it became clear that she attached sanctity to no ones dead and would have happily looted every graveyard in the county if she thought she could get any kind of information from the graves and it was her attitude that only those who had left written accounts of themselvesthe white settlerswere i worthy of attention that gave jennifer an idea well the reason i asked about that particular case she said interrupting a plaint of how the civil war relics were falling to pieces is that i collect indian relics i dont suppose youd be able to sell me those would you the girl gaped at her then stammered something about county property jennifer nodded and said so whos in charge of county property the assessor or the county commissioner it took several phone calls before it was established that the county commissioner did have the authority to sell property deeded to the museum jennifer was not going to let this opportunity slip through her fingers and the volunteer was not about to lose a chance at some funding for her pet project so when jennifer urged lets go ask him the girl led the march straight to the tiny office on the fourth floor she had the feeling that she could have bought half the museum if shed wanted the commissioner was overjoyed to sell something the girl assured him was worthless he was probably very tired of her pleas for money now she had some and maybe shed leave him alone for a while jennifer was fairly certain that the sale was only quasilegal at best and she hadnt cared it was doubtful that anyone would pursue her it had taken every ounce of determination to take the box of relics smile and thank them the place where the settler in question had discovered the massacre was now in the middle of a state park that made things easier whatever the tribes rites had been no one knew them now jennifer could only inter them near where they had died trying to recreate a rite as best she could from her own intuition and medicine knowledge as well as from things she had learned about the peoples who had once lived in the area gleaned hastily from the county library she found a place she thought would be undisturbed one of the lesser less interesting mounds near what had been the village and spent most of the day digging into the side at sunset she had laid them to rest as best she could then she covered her tracks and went back to the job she was being paid to do but that had given her an idea there were hundreds if not thousands of artifacts in profane hands all over i the country not just museums but in the hands of people like private collectors and in the hands of the descendants of indian agents some agents had been good wellintentioned if woefully judeochristiancentered people but some had been thieves who took anything they could get their hands on and others had felt the only way to pacify the indians was to destroy their culture most of those artifacts didnt matter muchbut some for some it would be as if collectors had robbed the tomb of abraham lincoln for the sake of the bones or stolen the relics of catholic saints out of their shrines as if some museum knowingly bought the black stone after it was stolen from the shrine at mecca the remains of ancestors deserved a proper intermentand medicine objects deserved to go back to the hands that cherished them that was when she had decided that she would do something about the situation tracking these objects down and returning them to the appropriate hands there were plenty of people at work on the major museums using publicity and lawyers to regain lost artifacts and remains she would concentrate on getting the things back in the hands of private individuals grandfather had approved and that was all she had needed it took time but she had timeand what else was she doing with her life anyway certainly there were no men in it she might as well do something useful with her free time now im getting depressedno im depressing myself on purpose she decided this is ridiculous what i need right now is a good nights sleep she turned off the water and wrapped her dripping hair in a towel bundling herself back up in a robe a big glass of orange juice then bed the living room was dark the house locked up grandfather had gone off to bed himself already she shook her head at the time she hadnt realized it was that late but as she slipped in between the cool cotton sheets she felt a familiar tingling that told her that her seeking hadnt ended in the sweatlodge she barely had time to settle herself before she found herself out in the worlds again but this was no world she knew the place was grim and frightening calling up a feeling of disturbance inside her that made her feel a little sick beneath a gray overcast sky a dead chemicalladen wind stirred the branches of withered trees planted in little sterile circles of hardbaked earth except for those tiny circles of dead ground the rest was concrete as far as the eye could see she turned slowly and saw nothing else nothing but leafless trees and lifeless eartha parking lot for the damned then beneath one of the trees she saw with an internal shock the desiccated corpse of a bird hesitantly with her stomach churning she approached it in a moment she saw that it had been a bald eagle it lay sprawled ungracefully on the bare gray concrete lying in a way that suggested it had dropped deadperhaps from poisonrather than being shot or knocked out of the sky the harsh breeze stirred its feathers as she stared down at it something about the eagle jarred a memoryhadnt there been something about that mallproject on the arkansas river near the eagles nesting site she looked up suddenly and realized what this world symbolized ive been concentrating so much of my attention internally that ive been ignoring my connections to my own world and whats going on around me maybe thats whats been holding me back as if she had somehow satisfied somethingor someonewith that thought she found herself moving out of that world and back into her own she started to relax then something dark shapeless and completely evil loomed up interposing itself between her and the way back it looked at her for a moment while she tried to shrink into something so small she could evade its gaze the ploy didnt work it reached for her with eager greedy interest fear overcame her she turned and fled chapter two i dunno larry bushyhead said staring meditatively at the raw red earth of the site of the new riverside mall about half the site had been roughcleared of brush a quarter of the whole site leveled out flat and even so the yuppies wouldnt have to park their cars on an incline the scrub oak and cottonwood weeds and tallgrass might not look like anything worth saving to a towndweller used to manicured lawns and landscaped shrubbery but larry was a hunter they saw weeds he saw habitat for rabbit quail squirrel and meadowlark and hunting territory for hawks and even bald eagles habitat going under the bulldozer blade his baloney sandwich dangled from his fingers momentarily forgotten i dunno johnny i took the job a guys gotta work but im still not sure i like this larry leaned against his bulldozer which served as an impromptu perch for half a dozen of his fellow workers i know what you mean rich blackfox one of the other dozer operators nodded agreement as he swirled the coke around in the bottom of his can its not just another damn yuppie mall going up its this site the elders of most of the tribes around here didnt like itsutton didnt like it either sutton who asked someone else on the other side of the dozer a white guy none of the three knew very well in the usual hotweather uniform of sweatsoaked tshirt and work jeans his hard hat had cliff stenciled on it whos sutton whats not to like about a mall he lit up a cigarette my wife cant wait for this one to go up so she can go run up the charge cards sutton avian research center over to bartlesville rich told him you know the eagle people the ones that run the tours up by the dam in february oh yeah the man brightened and he grinned yeah i went up there this spring watchin the birds fish saw that little gal from sutton with the tame one boy shes got guts i wouldnt let anything with a beak like that anywhere near my face he took another drag on his cigarette then discarded it so what is it they dont like rich stared upriver squinting against the sunlight the arkansas was at a low point after three weeks without rain in fact it looked as if you could walk across it with sandbars rising out of the water all across the basin sutton says were too close to the places those eagles are nesting they say were gonna drive em away and there just arent enough good places for em to go especially where people wont take potshots at em my tribal elders say the same thing huh the other man followed richs stare as if he expected to see one of the birds right then and there how many of them are there eight pairs at last count larry put in thats the most nests in fifty years he sighed here they got a pretty good chancesomeplace else they got odds of ending up in some scumbags trunk even cliff nodded at that eaglepoaching had made the headlines again a poacher had been caught during a routine trafficstop with his trunk full of dead birds there hadnt been a man or woman on the crew that hadnt been outraged by the discovery larry shrugged but fish and game says theyll stay says theyre used to us now and we wont scare them off i dunno he looked around the site again if you ask me whoever decided to plant a mall here is dumber than dirt what happens the next time we get one of those hundredyear storms and the army corps of engineers has to open the floodgates upriver we get bigtime flood sales down here laughed the other man seems like weve been getting those hundredyear storms of yours about every three or six months lately larry nodded you got it dumb as dirt man the placid arkansas river with sandbars rising out of the yellowbrown water like the backs of a pod of beached dolphins and lower than it had been all year hardly looked like a candidate for flooding but before the army corps of engineers had put in their floodcontrol program parts of tulsa had suffered more than one disaster and it could happen again if there was too much rain floodgates would have to be opened and the arkansas could turn into the raging devil some old stories painted it when it didnot if but whenthis mall could well be underwater so why put it here that was what larry didnt understand there had to be a dozen sites that were better candidates especially given the proximity of this one to the eagles that particular fight had cost the developers plenty in extra studies and court costs hed had a bad feeling about this place ever since hed set foot on itbut he knew better than to say anything about that he got enough ribbing from the guys on the crew about being a superstitious indian just because he had a medicine wheel his daughter had made him dangling from the rearview mirror in place of the fuzzy dice from his streetrodder days he didnt need to give them any more ammo still there was something creepy about this placeand the boss rod calligan didnt fit the profile somehow larry had seen a lot of developers in his time some were slimy scum some were just guys but rod was a different breed of cat all right or maybe snake the man was cold he had a way of looking at you that made you think he was totaling up your entire net worth right there on the spot but he was smart real smart he could gauge the amount of time a crew would have to spend clearing a particular site right down to the hour and he had a penalty clause built into the contract that kicked in unless the cause for delay was weather that he said was too bad to work in basically he had to come down to the site agree that the weather was too rough and let them go homethen he would go up to the site office and make a note on the contract extending the due date he sure seemed too sharp to have made the mistake of putting a mall on a floodplain larry glanced at his watch and finished his sandwich in a couple of bites lunch was about over and you never knew when calligan and his beemer were likely to show up bad feeling or no bad feeling there was more ground to clear before quitting time he shooed the rest of the guys off his dozer and started the engine wondering where he ought to take her when this job was over the powerful engine roared to life drowning any other sounds and filling the air with diesel fumes the seat vibrated and rocked as he sent the dozer over the little hillocks they hadnt smoothed down yet there were rumors that rogers college was thinking of putting up another buildingbut weighed against rumors of a job around town was the certainty of work on the turnpike up around miami way he swung the dozer around to the place hed quit engaged the blade and put her in motion it sure was hot out here he was more or less used to it but he figured he must go through a couple of gallons of water a day it kind of made him mad to be plowing up trees just so a bunch of yuppies from tulsa had more places to spend their money suddenly the uneasy feeling hed had built to a crescendo there was something wrong with the way the earth felt under the blade he braked and killed the motorand looked down and froze for the treads had stopped a mere inch away from a skull a human skull it must have been at least ninetyfive out in the sun but larry still felt cold chilled right down to his gut which was in knots hed backed the dozer off you bet and damn fast when hed turned up those bones for one horrible moment hed been certain hed uncovered some kind of dumping place for the victims of a serial killer or something like the guy in ok city the other guys had come at his yell of surprise andyes fear they clustered around the dozer and the place where the blade had stopped there were more bones there more skulls only a closer look showed that the bones were old really old and what was more there were broken pots and things mixed in with them it was keith pryor another osage who said out loud what had been trying to break out of larrys own muddy thoughts its a burial ground keith said flatly weve been digging up sacred ground that was when larry realized that he had known from the moment hed seen them what those artifacts were they were osage hed been digging up the graves of his own ancestors old tales flitted through his mind there were terrible things that happened to those who desecrated graves oh man he said unhappily wondering if old man talldeer could be talked into an emergency ceremony not that he believed the little people were going to take revenge for this and it wasnt as if hed done it deliberately but but he didnt care he was osage and the osage honored their ancestors he needed someone like shaman talldeer to let the ancestors and the little people know that he meant no disrespect no sacrilege and then to kill the trail from this desecrated site back to him one part of his mind was wondering how the hell you purified a dozer while the rest of him stood back and watched the ruckus spread about half the crew was indianor native american as some of the activists liked to sayosage creek and cherokee blood mostly whatever they were all indian enough to be mad as hops about being asked to plow up a burial ground the foreman was aswhite as you got though except for his red neck and he was ready to fire the lot of them rich was right in the center of it nosetonose with the foreman giving him hell look you cant make us doze that lot over he yelled his foghorn voice carrying over everyones even the foremans thatd be like asking tagliono there to plow up the vaticanor at least the graveyard at st josephs that shut them upat least for a minute and larry felt some of the chill leaving him as he saw that with that single sentence rich had managed to get some of the white guys over on their side because the graveyard at st josephs church had been under threat for a while back in the early eighties and the boomtown days of highpriced oil and tagliono and some of the other guys on the crew had been picketing the skelly building for wanting to dig up their grandparents and transplant them so they could put up an office complex transplant them to a city cemetery riot a catholic one a cemetery without the blessings that oldfashioned people thought absolutely necessary for their rest to be in holy soil way to go rich he congratulated silently as the dynamics shifted and some of the white guys tagliono in particular took the couple of steps necessary to put them on the other side of the invisible line separating the foreman and the whites from the indians and when tagliono came over so eventually did everyone but the company suckups the foreman knew when he was outgunned with a muttered curse he stalked over to his truck and picked up his cellular phone larry drifted over to the rest whats next he asked no one in particular five to two hes callin calligan tagliono said and spat off to one side larry nodded i figured he said question is whats calligan gonna do about it silence for a moment traffic noise from the highway nearby warred with the piercing wails of killdeers overhead then one of the dump truck operators spoke up i was on a project that hit somethin like this he offered feds made em close down permanently tagliono asked the man shook his head naw just long enough for some college guys to get in there and dig the stuff up like on tv he scratched his head meditatively but that was like some old fort or something i dunno what theyd do about somethin like this neither did anyone else it appeared the foreman was deep in conversation on his phone and the rest of them were at something of a loss not for the first time larry regretted that he hadnt popped for the cost of one of those phones hed have liked to put in a couple of callsto the osage principal chief for one and to old man talldeer for another but he didnt dare leave the site because right now from the dirty looks he was getting it looked like the foreman would be willing to use any excuse to fire him the foreman shoved the phone back into his car and stalked back the look on his face boding no good for anyone who got in his way the boss says that he wants us to dig the stuff up and trash itburn it or throw it in the river or bury it or something he said shortly otherwise the feds are gonna get in here drag in the college people and start holding things up while they screw around that was when larry decided that no amount of money was worth violating a burial site he got on his dozer with a silent apology to those buried there and backed up carefully doing his best not to disturb things any more than he already had the dozer was a cranky old bitch and he used his long familiarity with her to kill her and flood her carburetor she coughed and died he made some elaborate attempts to restart her then held up his hands sorry he said face carefully blank i guess she needs some work the foremans face turned tomatored but there wasnt anything he could do if the dozer had stalled no matter what the cause the way he was glaring at larry boded no good for the future but he had no choice but to order a second piece of equipment forward he chose one of the dozers leased directly to the construction company unfortunately for discipline he chose the machine normally driven by bobby whitehorse bobby was youngbut bobby lived at home with his parents he was single his car was paid for in short bobby could afford to get fired no effin way man bobby said putting the machine in idle and sitting back on the seat arms folded over his chest im not diggin up nobodys ancestors larry got down off his dozer for now that the center of conflict had switched from himself to bobby he thought he just might be able to sneak away and call someone though he wasnt quite sure just who to call if theyd uncovered a nesting site for least terns it would have been fish and game but who would you call to get a staying order on a gravesite maybe if he just called the cops and pretended he didnt know these were ancient bones by the time they figured it out thered be media here lots of publicity and the right people would know about it and hed have a chance to get in touch with the tribal elders the nearest phone was the cellular in the foremans truck not a good idea next nearest was the one in the officetrailer on the side of the site maybe not such a good idea either there was a quiktrip down riverside larry moved a little farther away as the foreman climbed up on the machine getting right into bobbys face and screaming at him bobby was screaming right back no one seemed to notice that larry was defecting then he heard something a highpitched whistle exactly like one of those sonic garagedoor openers or motiondetectors that people werent supposed to be able to hear but he heard all the time he didnt even get a chance to wonder what it was because at that moment the dozer exploded the machine rose three feet into the air on a pillar of flame and smoke then came apart sending shrapnel everywhere larrys instincts were still those of a combat vet he hit the ground and covered his head and neck things rained down out of the air onto him dirt and debris pieces the size of a handball and smaller he kept his head covered while they slammed into his back shuddering under the impact feeling the sting of cutssomething came down on his head knocking him out for a second it was the pain of his smashed fingers that brought him around he looked up it looked like something out of a war movie the dozer had broken in two and both halves were on fire his machine was on her side there were bloody bodies everywhere some moving some not of bobby and the foreman there was no sign larry had been the farthest from the dozer when it went up he was the least injured he shoved off from the ground and sprinted for the foremans truck ignoring his throbbing head and useless right hand it only took one finger to push even on a cellular phone rod calligan took pains to seem perfectly cooperative to the detective hed gone over every inch of ground with them and had answered every question civilly many men would not have gone that far the total was four deadtwo of them the ones who had actually been on the bulldozer were hardly more than assorted body partsand a dozen injured he rubbed his temple anxiously trying to figure out if these would be workmans comp cases or notif the police proved sabotage did that let him off the hook on the other hand if he fought the cases the local media might pick up the story bleedingheart liberals they could make him look very bad better not mr calligan the detective said as if he had asked rod a question what rod said automatically im sorry i was kind of preoccupied what did you say i asked you if you thought there was any reason why someone would try to sabotage your operation here the detectives face was bland but rod had seen the forensics and explosives people swarming over the wreck of the bulldozer and he was fairly certain he had also seen them carrying something off the tulsa police department for all their internal troubles and the incompetence of some of their patrol officers was no halfbaked and slipshod operation when it came to forensics they had the use of some very sophisticated lab facilities rod had no intention of underestimating them my foreman called some time before the explosion he said carefully it was on his cellular phone so im sure you can find out exactly when that was he said that the crew had uncovered some kind of indian remains bones or something and that the indians on the crew were rather upset about it and refused to go back to work but that was only a few minutes before the explosion the detective replied dubiously there wouldnt have been any time for anyone to get a bomb in place perhaps not rod replied watching the detectives expression very carefully but this isnt the first time ive had trouble with indians on my crew here they he paused and selected his words very carefully they have what i would call a flexible idea about time and workschedules and i am a very precise man i dont tolerate unnecessary overtime or goofing off on the job the detectives lips tightened just a little and he squinted in the hot sun it occurred to rod that the polyester suit he wore must have been like wearing a sauna but rod wasnt much more comfortable in the linen blazer he used as summerwear rod wasnt about to take it off though despite the sweat that trickled down his back tickling him he wasnt going to sacrifice an iota of his edge in dealing with the police police respected a man in a suit hed learned that lesson quite completely over the years they would treat a man in a suit a hundred times better than a man in blue jeans and they were significantly more likely to listen to him than a man in shirtsleeves why would a troublemaker indian or not go and blow up his own people the detective asked finally why do terrorists do anything rod countered ive never seen a fanatic who wasnt willing to sacrifice a few of his own to get the enemy whats more if you take out a few people it tends to make others take you seriously when you make a threat in the future slowly the detective nodded sounds like youve studied the situation rod let a tiny hint of a smile creep onto his face you know what they say know your enemy these days a developer never knows who is going to decide hes oppressing them animalrights nuts ecology freaks specialinterest groupswed already had some problems before we started clearing this land troubles with the ecofreaks and the indians over the eagles and what have you maybe this is just an extension of that kind of thing the detective didnt look as if he was convinced i cant see where a bunch of backtonature nuts is much of a threatand i cant imagine why theyd plant a bomb in a bulldozer there hed let it slip they had found the remains of the bomb rod schooled his face not to let his satisfaction show you should ask loggers about that he replied allowing himself to look and act a little heated ask them about the treefreaks driving railroad spikes into trees theyre about to cut you know what happens when a logginggrade chain saw hits one of those spikes evidently the detective had handled a chain saw or two in his lifetime he winced but a bomb he persisted i wouldnt actually put my money on ecology nuts rod said with a sigh i dont know what it is but those indians have it in for me i think maybe this was their way of saying id better watch my step he let his smile turn bitter funny thing about people who claim they want equal rightsthey dont not really what they want is superior treatment not equal and they squawk if they dont get it sometimes they do more than squawk all pigs are equal but some pigs are more equal than others the detective quoted in a kind of mutter he made a few more notes in his book and flipped the cover closed all right mr calligan i think that will be all for now thank you for being so cooperative thank you rod calligan replied automatically keep me posted on what you find out will you sure thing the detective replied he wouldnt calligan knew that as he knew they both had to go through the motions but as the detective headed for his sedan and calligan for the cool interior of his airconditioned bmw he was still a most contented man the seed had been sown now to nurture it and make it grow jennifer tucked the phone between her shoulder and cheek and waited for ron sinors secretary to see if he was in for her meanwhile with one hand she grabbed the stacked sheets of paper off the printer and with the other she reached for a tamperproof tyvek envelope im putting you through to his office now the secretary said and there was a click and a short ring picked up almost immediately miss talldeer glad to hear from you ron said cautiously you should be even gladder when i tell you that the background checks you asked me to run took less time than i estimated she replied evening the edges of the pile of papers and slipping them neatly into the tyvek envelope theyre done do you want me to send them by regular mail or would you rather i called a messenger service or dropped them over myself how eyes only are they ron asked cautiously depends on how you feel about alcoholics she said personally i wouldnt want one writing my software sometimes i suspect that was what was wrong with the last release of my wordprocessing package ron chuckled he could afford to since his company wrote oilfield analysis software not wordprocessing programs overnight mail and make it registered too he replied decisively that way only judy and i will see it done and done jennifer slipped the tamperproof envelope into a bigger priority mail bag and grabbed a ballpoint pen to fill out the adhesive waybill one advantage of having an office a half block from a local post office the bills in there too good thank you for being so quick sinor sounded genuinely pleased a couple of those people looked really good on their resumes and i didnt want someone else to hire them out from under meor find out that they were only good on paper lets hope one of the ones he wanted isnt the guy who drinks his breakfast she thought but didnt say thank the modern computer environment she said instead if id had to type this the old way youd still be waiting for it he laughed and they said their goodbyes jennifer put the envelope in a stack of mail to go to the post office by three her watch read that gave her just enough time to call claremore and the old homestead while she sorted receipts claremore was a good forty minutes away from tulsa if there was anything someone needed she could bring it out when she and grandfather came over for saturday dinner the phone only rang twice yo said a familiar young male voice yo yourself creep she replied cheerfully to her youngest brother when did you get back from the lake bout fifteen minutes ago robert talldeer said and paused to gulp something didnt take as long as we thought it would never recharged the ac on an rv before those things dont take more than a pound so whats up in the life of nancy drew same song different verse little brother she said with a yawn grandfather is fine although im afraid one of the neighbor kids addicted him to tetris at least its better than soap operas but i suspect hes beating the kids out of their allowance money thought id catch up on family gossip before i went to the post awful i could get to like recharging airconditioners robert said and paused before adding scornfully not then be glad youve got a job to pay for college wayne she told him making neat little stacks of receipts youll make a better engineer than a heating and ac specialist hows dads ostrichfence project coming robert laughed although she wasnt sure why she sorted out a couple more gas tabs then he explained twice as many of the eggs hatched out as the guy thought would he had to get a guy in from tulsa to build more shelters and dads gonna have to weld twice as many fence lines jennifer shook her head and laid a mcdonalds receipt on the rest of the business meals at least no one can claim im trying to deduct booze and steak running aflat perhour rate may be a pain when it comes to accounting but its what got me a lot of clients pretty quickly glad mom thought of it this ostrich thing was surely one of the wilder getrich schemes shed ever run across he hasnt talked dad into investing not a chance pop thinks the whole ostrich boom is gonna bust in a couple of years every chick this guy raises is going out to a new breeder once you run out of people who want to be breedershow many feathers hides and fivepound eggs can you sell those things die at the drop of a hat and they eat like a mule or maybe a goat theyll eat anything thatll fit down their throats whether or not its really edible by the time you get one big enough to be worth something youve lost six more jennifer was relieved it looked like everyone had seen the fallacy in this ostrich thing at least in her family shed been half afraid her father would get talked into investing shed seen this breeder on the news and he was very persuasive he was making a lot of moneyquite enough to pay her father for his work up front all at once she had been concerned because it looked good on papernow like the guy in claremore whod tried to sell concrete dome housesthe idea looked good in theory and they were certainly tornadoproof but the reaction of most people in oklahoma had been maggie thats weird and the poor guy had lost his shirt she should have known better than to worry the talldeer were sensible people and not easy to talk into something well most of us are anyway present company excepted she dropped a bill for dry cleaning down on the stack of miscellaneous and noted on it removal of clients blood from silk blouse not that it had been anything serious like a murder mariannes husband had beaten her up that was all and she had gotten the blood all over her blouse taking the woman to the emergency room but it should shock the hell out of any auditors she loved writing little notes like that if the irs ever decided to doublecheck her theyd certainly have an interesting time well it was a good thing her father hadnt gotten wrapped up in the ostrich scheme besides according to everything shed heard the damn things were not only stupid they were vicious like sixfoot turkeys with an attitude one of her clients had said there were already enough things with attitudes in their lives the talldeer family didnt need to cope with giant birds too mom has a hot prospect for that white elephantthe earthsheltered place in mannford robert continued an artist told her to show him everything weird so long as it had land a view and privacy sounds good but is an artist likely to go for that she asked dubiously you think hes ready for a onelane gravel road with a twenty percent grade he picked mom up to go look at it in a bronco with a lot of mud on it robert said id say so he was wearing snakeboots too i think he knows what hes going to go see that sounded promising maybe all artists werent crazy shed seen the place it had an impressive view and with the addition of a windmill for electricity it could be completely selfsufficient maybe that wouldnt be such a bad thing for an artist morgage twenty percent office space shed thought about the place too wonderful view and for someone with her interests it would make the perfect place to detox from the modern world with ten acres she could have had a dozen real sweatlodges out in the woods and no one would ever know but it was no place for someone who had to make a living in the city at least an hour away in good weather and during the january and february ice storms you wouldnt be able to get out without a land rover and chains listen robert said mom left a note in case you called and she wasnt home can you pick up some of those good glass crowbeads and the porcupine quills at lyons downtown dads adding to his dance gear again whos going to mess with the quilling she asked aghast porcupinequill embroidery was not quite a lost art but it was one even their ancestors had gladly abandoned in favor of using glass beads not mom nope he is says hell just have to put on a dress and do it himself that was the perennial joke when her father wanted something particularly difficult done for his costume and her mother swore she didnt have the time or inclination her father then said hed have to put on a dress to do womens work he isnt really going to do it this time is he she asked giggling remember the time he got as far as moms closet naw auntie red bird is holding a quillembroidery class and she said shed do his costume stuff as the demonstration so hes saved again robert snickered one of these days mom is going to call his bluff and im gonna be there with a camcorder do that and i get the popcorn concession she replied so what does he want for this piece of osage haute monde robert read the list and she made careful notes on the back of a plea for money from a televangelist she always saved her junk mail to use for notepaper especially the stuff from televangelists she figured that it ought to serve some use before she recycled it okay young buck is there anything more i need to know the last of the receipts went into the it might be deductible but im not going to take it pilethe one she intended to present to the irs with all the rest if that audit ever came the way she had it figured theyd probably end up owing her money for the entertainment value alone not a thing dont talk to strange men sis im talking to the strangest one i know right now she countered ill pick the stuff up some time tomorrow okay thatll be great watch your back i will she said and only after shed hung up did she wonder why robert the least disturbed about her job of any of the family had chosen to say that chapter three it wasnt exactly an appointment but jennifer wanted to catch both of the ambersons home according to her research ralph amberson usually arrived home at about his wife gail who had a parttime job with an advertising firm got home just before her children did if she didnt catch them before dinner she might not be able to get them to answer the door the neighbors said that ralph was something of a martinet and insisted that the phone be unplugged and the doorbell ignored at dinnertime and after dinnerwell the neighbors said that only business would pry ralph out of his home office it was gail who most interested jennifer for gails maiden name had been gentry that was not an unusual name but it was of particular interest to jennifer it had been an abraham gentry who had served as one of the government agents on the lakotah reservation from to during that time period any number of interesting things happened between the lakotahs in question and the agents who were supposed to be protecting their interests no few of them reprehensible by anyones standards but the one that concerned jennifer was the disappearanceafter confiscationof several sacred lakotah religious items the policy at the time was to civilizewhich meant christianizeevery native american on the continent native ceremonies were often outlawed altogether on the flimsiest of excuses children were taken from their parents custody and sent away to boarding schools where they were forbidden to speak their own languages or to worship in their own ways freedom of speech and religion were not an option for anyone who accepted the beneficent guidance of the united states government so much for land of the free jennifer grimaced partially at her own bitterness partially at those longdead officials exactly what these particular objects had been she did not know the inventory was sketchy at best and did not describe much that a shamanintraining would recognize as a specific relic the objects disappeared about the time that abraham gentry took his generous government pension and whatever else hed managed to scam out of his post and retired to oklahoma none of the other leads jennifer had followed had produced any information but abrahams private papers available at the osage county museum indicated that he was the one who had taken them into custody and there was no indication that he had ever given them over to anyone else either privately or publicly abraham had a penchant for taking souvenirs that was obvious from the inventory of his personal possessions made for his will some of those souvenirs of his posts on various reservations were in the museum but most were not now came genealogical research abraham had one child a boy thomas robert that boy had inherited all of abrahams possessions gave some to the museum sold the family farm and moved to tulsa one step ahead of the dust bowl thomas robert had married and had a single male child who had married and had a single female child that girl was gail gentry now gail amberson and according to jennifers research she had recently inherited a number of things from her recently deceased grandfather among those things jennifer had deduced were the lakotah relics memorabilia from abraham gentrys estate was how the will had read if they were in the amberson residenceand jennifer would know the moment she came anywhere near the house if they were in the ambersons possessionshe hoped she would be able to persuade the couple to let her have them granted they had a certain value as artifacts but their value to the lakotah went far beyond that these would probably not even rate very highly as artworks at that point in their history the lakotah were not spending a great deal of energy on making things of power pretty instead they were purposeful and often unornamented the better to focus their intent unless someone knew their history they would not be valued according to their true worth with luck and the will of wahkontah no one would know that history she would send the relics to the lakotah elders if she could get her hands on them if she couldnt well she had the paper trail leading to this house this family that was enough to get a restraining order and to start a lawsuit legally the situation was the same as if gail gentry had inherited a stolen painting before the ambersons could sell any of relics they would have to admit they had themand at that point there would be lawyers ready to take them to court over their right to possession it would be a long and drawnout court battle and even if the ambersons won it they would lose far more than they could ever realize in the sale of the relics simply defending their right to have them at all only a major museum could afford to fight a legal battle like that most of the people jennifer had turned in capitulated when it became obvious that a court case would involve far more than they wanted to commit often when the first suit was filed they capitulatedespecially if the lakotah could offer them some token payment in return for the relics usually they did not offer the payment first even though that would seem to be the easiest route experience had shown that offering payment generally led to a bidding war and legitimized the claim of the possessor it was better to file the suit first to establish exactly what the situation was she hoped as she steered her battered little subaru brat through the winding streets and past the manicured lawns of yet another middleclass suburb that this would be one of the easy ones a couple of cases had ended nastily in one instance of dog in the manger the person who had the relics had destroyed them rather than give them up she still felt rotten about that one even though it had been out of her hands by then still from a shamanic point of view sometimes it was better for those items to be destroyed rather than be in profane hands artifacts of any kind of power could generate some pretty bad medicine just by being in the hands of the enemy the little old ones had known that making the protection of their shrines for the sacred hawk the wahhopeh of paramount importance during warfare certainly many of the ancestors of other nations would have agreed with that assessment that was what the seminoles had said when they told her the artifacts had been lost to them permanently she parked the brat a block away from the ambersons address and the moment she stepped out of the trucks airconditioned cab and into the hot evening air she felt as if she had been hit with a double blowone to the body and one to the spirit the hot muggy air slugged her even though the sun was halfway to the horizon and the blow to her spirit was just as formidable she knew with no room for doubt that not only were the objects in question in the ambersons possession but that she had to obtain them by whatever means it took for this particular set of relics she might consider almost anything to get hold of them from a block away even though their power had not been renewed for nearly a century it struck her hard enough to stagger her whatever it was that abraham gentry had taken as his private memorabilia of the lakotah was strong enough for her to feel its influence with a strength she had not expected she closed her eyes against the sense of terrible pressure as if there was a tremendous thunderstorm just over the horizon she couldnt remember a time when she had ever felt something from this far away except when the objects in question were in the custody of practicing shamans she steadied herself against the pressure and walked as briskly as the heat allowed toward the amberson residence in a moment or two the sense of pressure eased as if something out there recognized her and her intent and had acted accordingly perhaps something like that had happened shamanistic regalia tended to develop a spirit of its own she walked along the curb watching for traffic although there was very little of it in this sheltered culdesac ralphs relatively lowpriced bmw was in the driveway through the stillopen garage door jennifer caught sight of the rear of gails minivan good that means they re both home this was not the first time she had been here but she appraised it with the eye of the daughter of a successful realestate agent with a view to assessing the mental state of those within it the house was just like every other house in this neighborhood which rather annoyed her truth be told a house should have character these had none clearly built in the late seventies or early eighties it was a splitlevel with the requisite stoneandcedar exterior recessed front door attached garage sixfoot cedar privacy fence the backyard was probably shortshorn grass with a tiny bordering of garden and a few hanging plants on the patio the manicured front lawn with two evergreens and two maple trees was just like the neighbors every house here had an energywasting cathedral ceiling in the living room to give it an air of spaciousness yet the attic would be all but useless and the three bedrooms barely big enough for a bed and a little furniture jennifer appraised it with a knowing eye at the time it had been built during the oil boom it probably had sold for between and nowif the ambersons could find a buyer with so many companies laying off middlemanagement or moving their personnel elsewhereit might sell for as little as half that there was no sign on the front lawn but that did not mean they had not tried to sell in the near past the depreciation of their dreamhome would have come as a dreadful surprise if they have any brains theyii get the place reassessed and have the property taxes refigured on that basis she thought to herself it was advice her mother had given many a potential client trying desperately to unload a house that he could no longer afford at least lowering the property taxes a little gave a feeling of illusory relief the neighborhood itself was too new to have any of the character of her own neighborhood the houses were clearly built by the same company to one of three plans they were crowded quite closely together by the standards of the older neighborhoods with barely five feet to the property line the backyards would be half the size of hers and the treesexcept in the few cases where the homeowners had planted fastgrowing cottonwoods or other softwoodshad not attained enough growth to really shade the houses the sun beat down without mercy here and with fully half the front yard of each house taken up by its driveway the heat was terrific if she hadnt been so used to it by now shed have felt as limp as a wilted leaf of lettuce there werent even any children playing out here today the heat was too much even for them although it was possible given this area that the children were at some carefully structured afterschool activity where nothing as frivolous as playing ever occurred there were no sidewalks in this subdivision when these houses were built it was presumed that everyone would drive everywhere and that the kids would play only in their own or their friends backyards out of sight sequestered like little animals in their exercise wheels jennifer often thought of those builders whenever she saw a subdivision like this one no one in tulsa in the seventies and eighties had ever given thought to oil shortages or pollution high enough on windless summer days to be dangerous no one in tulsathencould even conceive of a day when someone might want toor need towalk somewhere everyone had a car then everyone the absence of road salt extended the lives of cars so much that back in the fifties and even the sixties it had been a common practice to simply drive an unwanted old car into a field somewhere and abandon it even if it still worked life had been generous to those living high on the profits of scarce oil if you wanted to work back then you had a job guaranteed and with a job came the requisite car the only way to get to that job nor could those longago tulsans imagine that anyone who lived in a subdivision like this one would be caught dead on mass transportation the old streetcar system was gone the bus system totally inadequate for a city half the size of tulsa and it wouldnt come within a half mile of a neighborhood like this one jennifer had occasionally tailed people using the bus every time it was a nightmare every few years there was some talk of a monorail a barttype train that would link the downtown with its industrial centers and outlying apartment complexes and malls it came up whenever the mayor didnt have anything else to talk about but now that the days of high employment and major oil and beef money were over the tulsa monorail was about as likely as a tulsa space shuttle access to the house was from the driveway which had so slight a degree of slope that it barely qualified jennifer got into the scanty shade provided by the overhang on the tiny square of cement that called itself a front porch and rang the doorbell in front of her was a fake wroughtiron stormdoor with doublepane glass on the other side of the metal it looked protective and the ambersons probably thought it was jennifer could have jimmied it open in about thirty seconds she was hoping for gail amberson but instead she found herself confronted by the suspicious face of her husband ralph when he opened the inner wooden door it was not a good omen he was still wearing his tie although he had removed his suitcoat and even in the supposedly relaxed atmosphere of his own house he was as stiff as a catalog model his brown hair was cut in the clonal businessmans style his brown eyes were as expressionless as mud and his nondescript face matched any one of a thousand other men his suitpants were gray his shoes shiny black his tie a solid bluegray it was held in place with a plain gold pin jennifer wished she could look that anonymous camouflage like his might have saved her a time or two whatever youre selling we dont want any he said stiffly completely ignoring the fact that she wasnt carrying anything other than a very slim briefcase and ignoring the fact that she was not wearing either a doortodoor sales permit or a solicitors badge and i give through united way at the office he started to close the door in her face she stopped him with a single sentence and by flashing the badgeholder containing her pi badge and license it looked impressive enough not quite coplike but enough to intimidate a little if youre mr ralph amberson she said quickly and clearly my client is very interested in some property you have she did not say may have although she probably should have ethically speaking it had been her experience in the past that those who genuinely did not know what she was talking about showed it immediately and those who had the relics showed that as well besides she knew the ambersons had the stuff there was no point in not showing this card and throwing ralph offbalance by letting him know she knew it the word client caught his attention and he opened the door again there was a touch of cautious greed about him and a hint of unease now there was only the stormdoor between them but that was still a psychological barrier she could have done without what property he asked what client is this who are you anyway good questions all of them and perfectly reasonable she could not take offense at the words but the way he had said them made her tense her jaw and count to ten his implication was that not only did he not believe her but he felt the only reason someone like jennifer talldeer should be in his neighborhood would be as a maid she took a deep breath he radiated hostility and she had the feeling that she wasnt going to get very far with him he had her pegged for a minority and she was already a woman two strikes against her on the empowerment scale someone as lowstatus as she was could safely be brushed off still she had to try im jennifer talldeer and im a private investigator representing the lakotah sioux she said briskly trying to put as much authority into her voice and the somewhat exaggerated relationship with her clients as she could my clients have traced a number of lakotah artifacts to your possession siror rather to your wifes possession these articles were illegally obtained by her greatgrandfather from tribal hands they would like them returned to tribal hands with someone friendly she might have added other things that there would be no reprisals and no adverse publicity that the lakotah would consider anyone who returned these objects voluntarily a friend not with this man he was the enemy and he had made himself into the enemy from the moment she knocked on his door so she would act as if she had more authority than she really did and give him only the barest of the facts there that was it now he would either admit he had the things and hand them over or well that was about as likely as pigs flying he looked more than ready to give her a fight he must have had someone tell him that the artifacts his wife had inherited were worth a lot of money to a collector she saw gail amberson peeking over her husbands shoulder and pitched her voice so that the woman would be sure to hear what she was saying even through the doublepane glass of the stormdoor she could not see gail well enough to read her expression but her husbands was a mixture of guilt and anger just a flash of it the same kind of expression she saw on the faces of people who had bought hot merchandise then it changed turning first calculating then complacent ive handled your type before bimbo she all but read you re just a woman and a stupid indian you cant prove i have the stuff you cant prove anything i hold all the cards here and you dont even have a bluff hand but he kept tight control over his manner his voice held a world of haughty disdain that she knew she was meant to hear im afraid you have the wrong information miss he said clearly and precisely i havent the slightest idea of what youre talking about he was using his height race and male authority to try to intimidate her but sometimes an equal show of authority would make someone like ralph back down it was worth a try im talking about some lakotah artifacts your wife mrs gail amberson just inherited from her grandfather thomas robert gentry jennifer persisted taking slow deep breaths of the stifling air and fully aware that this man was not going to allow her inside his house where he stood in airconditioned comfort those artifacts were obtained illegally and and even if i knew what you were talking about you have no way of proving that ralph interrupted then he smirkedwhich she was also meant to see she found herself pitying any woman who worked for him sometimes intimidation was worse than harassment for it left the victim feeling utterly worthless his tone hardened now i suggest that you take yourself back to whatever reservation you came from youre trespassing on my property and im fully within my rights to call the police if you dont leave and with that he shut the door in her face and only the air pressure between the inner door and the storm door prevented him from slamming it she counted rapidly to ten in osage then in cherokee for good measure fine jerkface she muttered to the closed door then well see you in court hope you enjoy spending money on lawyers then she turned on her heel and marched back down his driveway carefully avoiding stepping on his precious grass so as to escape any destruction of private property charges she was fully aware that he was watching her and probably would call the police if she didnt leave not that theyd come she wasnt wearing her gun he had no reason to say that she had threatened him in any way she was totally within her rights so far and in the eyes of the law she was no more than a minor nuisance the tulsa pd was too shorthanded to send anyone out on a nuisance call but he might correctly remember her name and it would be a royal pain to have her name on the police log for something like this the next time her license came up for renewal some people on the licensing board werent happy with a native pi some others were incensed at a woman doing a mans job her only defense was her spotless record well mostly spotless and she had never been caught she would see him in court as soon as she got back to the office she would be calling one of the local tribal lawyers she worked with and he would file a restraining order on ralph preventing him from selling anything until a licensed appraiser had a chance to look at it and right now she was going to ask him to word it in such a way that ralph would be violating the law if his wife took something to a garage sale the lawyer would also see to it that the appropriate legitimate buyers of artifacts were notified that ralph amberson was trying to dispose of the artifacts that were illegally obtained then hed consult with the lakotah elders and so would she after she told the lakotah shaman what she had sensed the upshot would probably be a lawsuit of course ralph could dispose of the artifacts on the black market but jennifer wasnt terribly worried about that someone like ralph with all the appropriate yuppified attributes had never done anything more illegal than cheating on his taxes or pilfering from the office the odds were high that he wouldnt have the kinds of contacts he needed to get rid of the relics and it would take him time to find them by then the number of buyers would have decreased to a handful and although the relics had power they probably were not of a rarity sufficient to interest the few buyers who would be willing to purchase something they could never display something from one of the famous chiefs perhapsor something of tremendous artistic value or a oneofakind itembut not what was in ambersons hands nothing she sensed led her to believe that the lakotah items were of that nature while jennifer had heard rumors of another sort of buyerthe kind more interested in the power of artifacts rather than their rarityshe had never encountered one of those and she figured it was unlikely that she would this time if we were talking about the holy grail the shroud of turin sitting bulls coupstick or littleeaglewhogetswhathewants fetishshield maybe but not this time i think these things were made in secret and charged with power to protect their people from what was to come then confiscated before they were used then she noticed something else the objects were moving damn him hes jumping the gun and getting them out of the house she wanted to turn around and go right back but she had better sense than that a confrontation would only cost her her anger made her walk faster than she had before she was halfway down the block lost in her own plans when she snapped to attention alerted by the sound of someone running after her someone wearing sneakers or other softsoled shoes definitely chasing her there was no doubt in jennifers mind she stopped and turned ready to defend herself if she needed toand gail amberson wearing a highfashion jogging suit matched pinkandwhite spandex shorts shirt and sweatbands nearly collided with her excuse jennifer gasped gail backed up a little worry lines creasing her lovely wellscrubbed face and shoved a dusty cardboard box brittle with age at her here the woman said glancing back over her shoulder furtively her ashblond hair cut in a shag style flared a little with the nervous movement this is what you want take it please jennifer accepted the box reflexively and the moment it touched her hands she felt something very akin to an electrical shock whatever she was about to say was driven right out of her head the sensation unnerved her enough that she lost the sense of what she had been thinking lost even her previous anger but she stammered awkwardly i dont she glanced instinctively down at the package in her hands the paper felt like dried leaves and smelled of mildew now she saw that the box itself was wrapped in yellowed newspapers the date on one page was may it looked as if no one had touched this parcel for the past ninety years ralph is having an appraiser in to look over everything grandfather left me gail interrupted babbling her explanation her brown eyes narrowed against the sun glaring down in both of them but he doesnt have any idea of what is in all those boxes or even how many boxes there arehes so neat he hates dust and dirt and you couldnt get him to handle the stuff himself for any amount of money i had to unpack the crate myself she laughed nervously and looked back over her shoulder again hes so afraid of germsbut some friend of his told him what indian things are going for these days and that just started him up hes sure what weve got is worth a lot of money and the minute that appraiser tells him anything hell be sure its worth twice or three times what the appraiser says his brothers a lawyer suing him wouldnt do anything to get what you want anybody whos ever sued him has gotten tied up in countersuits until they gave up but jennifer said again still mentally dazzled by the throb of power coming from the box in her hands wont he know you gave me something gail shook her head violently no no i promise right now though he doesnt have any idea this box exists and its what you want i know it is gail continued on a rising note of strain whatever is in there has been giving me nightmares since the crate arrived her eyes widened with something very like fear as she glanced down at the box and away again you have to take itjust take it and go jennifer cradled the box protectively against her chest and the fear left gails eyes thanks jennifer managed dont thank me gail amberson shuddered and now her eyes looked more haunted than frightened jennifer wondered what kind of dreams the box had given her i may never be able to watch another western for the rest of my life and with that she wiped her hands convulsively on the legs of her running shorts as if to rid them of something unpleasant and jogged off down the street jennifer stared after her watching until gail turned a corner and vanished into the heart of the subdivision she must have used running as an excuse to leave the house one part of jennifers mind admired the woman for her quick thinking while the rest of her vibrated on the very edge of trance just from being in contact with what was inside that innocuous cardboard container and gail amberson had been absolutely correctthis was what she had come after and there was nothing more back in that expensive paean to suburban living that she was even remotely interested in nothing there was not even a whisper of power in the amberson house now and ralph could have whatever pots and beadwork tomahawks and rifles that were left with her blessing and what was in the box was now purring with content that it was back in something approximating appropriate hands there was no doubt in her mind that it knew who and what she was just as she knew what at least one of the relics in the box was and a good thing it was happy with her too the lakotah and the osage were nearenough relativesand jennifer had more than enough of the proper trainingthat the artifacts in there were evidently content to rest until they were back in tribal custody jennifer wasnt surprised that gail amberson had been having nightmares anyone with any degree of sensitivity would have especially with that working at him a derisive caw made her look up there was a raven watching her from atop a streetlight an old one by the dusty feathers the wear on his beak and the way he was tilted a little to one side as if one of his legs was weaker than the other when the bird saw that she had seen him he cawed again but did not seem inclined to move not that she figured he would all things considered well if i stand around out here theres always a chance that dear hubby amberson is going to spot me with a box in my hands and want to know where i got it and while a rap of robbery would be easy enough to beat since she hadnt gone anywhere inside the amberson house she didnt think it was polite to get gail amberson in trouble with her spouse after she had gone out of her way to smuggle the box out to jennifer talldeer she ignored the heat and sprinted to the brat she hadnt bothered to lock the doors not here and not since she really hadnt thought shed be away from the truck for that long she carefully and reverently placed the box on the floorboards started the engine and drove away as quickly as the speed limit allowed and didnt even take the time to reach over to turn on the air conditioning until she was six blocks away and although the box was content now that did not mean it was any less powerful it still throbbed pulsating through jennifer as if she were seated in a drum circle and it certainly was not comfortable cargo to have aboard its like sitting next to an unexploded bomb she thought as the box decided to make its contents known to her in a flash of insight as clear and distinct as a polaroid the vision of the lakotah shamans creating their instruments of power colorful and as vivid as the real world interposed itself between her eyes and the road for an instant and it was a good thing that she was half prepared for something like that to happen or she might have run into a ditch its fedex for you my friend she told the box i am not having you in my presence for one minute longer than i can help you just might take a notion to recall the days when the osage and your people were something less than brothers fortunately there was a federal express pickup booth not that far from the ambersons subdivision with the dry cool air from the airconditioning vents blowing onto her face and drying the sweat and now that she was well out of ralph ambersons reach she felt a little calmer the box still throbbed at her but its contents seemed to understand what she intended to do about them and unless she was terribly mistaken they might even be closing themselves back in it would be a real good idea to go quiescent while fedex has you she thought at the box silently the less you rouse people the more likely you are to make it home safe thank goodness she had her address book with her she would be able to ship this thing directly into the hands of one of her lakotah contacts without even having to call grandfather to read the address off the rolodex in the office the girl minding the fedex desk didnt show any particular interest as she packed the box by nesting it in progressively larger containers then secured the final box with strapping tape she did sit up and take notice when jennifer insured the contents for the maximum allowed amount you havent got jewelry in there have you she asked suspiciously that insurance doesnt cover jewelry archeological artifacts jennifer said shortly the girl pursed her lips and looked through her book but evidently couldnt find any exclusions for archeological artifacts which was precisely why jennifer had chosen than particular description of the contents this wasnt the first time a shipment had gone out from her under that heading an archeological artifact wasnt something that would tempt theft eitheralthough by insuring the package for that much she had redflagged it so far as wouldbe thieves were concerned the company would be keeping its electronic eyes on this little parcel she didnt breathe easily until the girl took the box into the back to join the rest of the packages leaving tonight by ten tomorrow morning jay spotted eagle would have a littlesurprise and at that point it was his worry not hers she left the chill of the fedex office for the humid heat of late afternoon she didnt even look up as a mocking caw from the roof of the office behind her greeted her exit she knew what was there the raven called three or four times before giving up and flapping down to land on the roof of her brat for a moment he cocked his head to one side and stared at her with one bright black eye she stared right back at him refusing to drop her gaze challenging him finally she took another step toward the brat her keys out still watching the bird the raven opened his sharp black beak and made a series of noises that sounded like barks then took off he shoved off the top of the truck and flapped his wings clumsily in the heavy still air with that typical corvine rowing motion dropping down to within a foot of the ground before finally getting up enough speed to fly to the wires behind the parking lot she unlocked the brat got in and headed straight for home it had been a long day grandfather was waiting in the living room sitting crosslegged on the couch across from the television set with the nintendo joystick in his strong agewrinkled hands he hit the pause button as soon as she entered the room and dropped her purse on the floor beside her favorite chair he grinned showing a strong set of white teeth and looked up at her he was a tall man like her father and brothers and still held himself straight as a man decades his junior sometimes he reminded her of jacques cousteau he had that same tough resiliency like a weathered blackjack oakand although age had weathered him it had not twisted him he wore his irongray hair long in a single tight braid though forty or fifty years ago he had sported a crewcut like everyone else in his neighborhood he had been an aircraft mechanic first with the army air corps then the air force then at the smallaircraft side of the tulsa airport no one who knew the family casually would have guessed then that he was osage no one who knew the family intimately would have ever thought otherwise but there had been few who knew the talldeer intimately and they were all to be trusted with the secret that could have instigated discrimination now he wore his heritage openly much to the delight of the neighbors children and grandchildren he told them stories taught them simple things got involved in their ecology projects all things their parents had no time to do things that their grandparents who might be half a continent away could not do half the neighborhood called him grandfather and he tricked the children as well teaching them with his tricks that the world was not a universally friendly place for a child teaching them in ways that would not hurt them to be careful even with people they knew that was not traditional teaching although it grew out of osage tradition it was teaching adapted to the modern world the neighborhood kids learned osage legendsbut the lessons were to respect and protect nature they learned how to defend themselves against the adults who would hurt or even kill them they learned that native americans far from being ignorant savages had knowledge and information and a wisdom no different from their schoolteachers grandfather often pointed out the success of the sparrow hawk as an examplethe sparrow hawk who like the rabbit had moved out of the meadows and into the suburbs that was not the original way of the osage who had been more apt to construct deeper and more complicated layers of ritual around the core of their traditions when those traditions failed them grandfatherand she suspected his father before him and his own grandfatherhad changed that they had begun to change to move as quietly into the world of the heavy eyebrows as they once had through their beloved forests to hide themselves under the camouflage of jeans and workshirts of square wooden houses and neat yards with that change they had changed the medicine until it began to work well again as it had worked when it was concerned with hunting and fishing stealing horses and averting danger winning brides and conquering enemies adapting the medicine had worked with other tribesbut the heavy eyebrows were different so different that an adaptation would not work it had to be change much as the little old men disliked change that had been what grandfather had said at any rate when she had asked him well he said looking up at her his bright black eyes shining with some secret amusement she didnt pretend not to know what he was talking about you know very well i got it grandfather she sighed theres no point in pretending you dont know i might have believed that a raven cawing at me from the wires was just coincidence but not one that landed on the roof of my truck and stared me in the face then laughed at me grandfather shook his head mockingly damn he replied i must be slipping i shouldnt have tipped my hand that way so why were you following me she asked kicking off her shoes and reveling in the feeling of soft wellvarnished and blessedly cool wood under her bare soles she walked around the living room picking up the little bits of popcorn and empty cups that told her hed had the kids inside today probably during the afternoon he seldom let them into the house in the morning teaching them instead the osage games his father had taught him and running the fat of too much television watching off them but even he agreed that when the temperature climbed above ninety there was no point in courting heatstroke these were kids raised in air conditioning born to parents with health insurance not tough little osage brats who never saw a doctor and ran around mostly naked in the oklahoma heat toughening took time and required the parents cooperation and participationperhaps when the children were older he might teach them the way of the warrior if not warriors medicine grandfather agreed the seed was planted and he took the long view of any of the gentle tzisho gens let the seed sprout and mature in its own time these children would at the very least be a little less credulous a little less inclined to let others run things for them a little less prone to give up and go with the system a little more likely to fight for themselves and their world and of course they would not be content to accept the stereotype of the lazy drunken ignorant indian for him that was quite enough why were you so afraid of what you recovered grandfather counteredand before she could dodge out of his way those strong brown fingers had slipped off the joystick and she yelped as he pinched her rear and when are you going to start being nice to me he continued with a meaningful leer a pretty girl like you should know an old man like me needs oh so hes in that mood should have guessed that a strong dose of respectable elder was going to bring out the old reprobate as soon as i got home an old man like you needs a good whack upside the head she countered skittering past him before those fingers could pinch the other cheek dont you know youre supposed to be senile by now youre supposed to be drooling and in diapers so i can keep you in your bed and you wouldnt be able to get into any more trouble he chuckled and shook his head at her she finished her cleanup and dropped the popcorn bits in the paper bag she kept for bird scraps the grackles would love the popcorn hows the garden doing how many kids did you bilk out of their allowances today their handeye coordination is improving he told her serenely theyre starting to tie me when they start to beat me ill start them on target shooting i made five bows that should be cured up and ready about now she straightened abruptly so thats why you wanted me to get you that nintendo is it his eyes practically disappeared in a nest of wrinkles as he smiled the garden is doing well the corn will be ready to pick in a day or two she gave up and collapsed into her chair he restarted his game and only then said casually oh i almost forgot someone from romulus insurance called she sat straight up in her chair and stared at him he continued as calmly as if he hadnt almost forgotten a potential clientand an important one the man said they want you to investigate some trouble at a construction site i think he mentioned a mall make that a real client and an insurance agency insurance agency cases often meant lots of time and time was money she launched herself out of the chair and sprinted down the hall to her office there was the pad beside the phone with what was presumably the romulus phone number noted on it in grandfathers handwriting and a name mark sleighbow presumably the man whod called if they found someone elseif ive lost this one she wasnt sure what shed do maybe it was time to get a phone service grandfather occasionally forgot accidentally on purposewhen he thought that a job wasnt right for her id prefer to make that determination for myself particularly when the mortgage payment is due and right now with that backgroundcheck job over she needed another piece of steady work anything for an insurance company was bound to be steady she dialed the number quickly and waited while the phone rang glancing at the clock on her desk and hoping mark sleighbow hadnt gone home for the day it wasnt quite fivewhere is this area code anyway if it was just in this time zone or even west someone picked up mr sleighbow she asked trying to sound businesslike and brisk this is jennifer talldeer returning your call mooncrow concentrated his outer awareness on the video gamethe only one he ever played something involving small oddshaped blocks dropping down from the top of the screenand pondered the many problems his beloved granddaughter was coping with he watched her constantly and he was well aware how she must be feeling right now after all he had gone through his own version of her particular balancing act that must be exactly what she felt like as if she were a tightrope dancer when one was very young the balancing between life among the heavy eyebrows and life as a shaman was not particularly difficult there simply were not many points of intersection and no real points of conflict that could not be resolved by appeal to a parent to intercede with authority outside the family but as one became older the responsibilities became greater and the number of conflicts increased and there was no one to intervene on an adults behalf no one could remain forever in the spirit world not even in the longago days the little old men had also hunted and taken the war trail raided and planted until they grew too old then they remained behind to guard the village when younger men went on the hunt but they did not sit always in the lodge of mystery speaking to the spirits they had their outer lives as well as their inner ones but in these days it was much more difficult to balance the secular life with the sacred perhaps more so even for kestrel than it had been for him he had been a man with a simple job one which began at seven in the morning and ended at three in the afternoon it did not follow him home disturb him in the sweatlodge ring his phone at odd hours he understood her better than she knew she must pay for this house she must earn the money for food and clothing she was the hunter and the quarry was far more capricious than any buffalo and yet she must also be the shamanintraining the clock must drive her and yet she must learn to let things come at their own time to ignore the clock and the calendar and the demands they made on her concentration when he had been her age he had not had this particular crisis he had been far too busy dodging the bullets of japanese fighters as they strafed the runways of the strange pacific islands he had been stationed on he had been concerned with his own survival the survival of his fellow indians the survival of his fellow americans he had been a warrior and the only medicine he had needed to practice had been warriors medicine for the hawk had fallen with his head to the west and as in the old days it had been from the west that the enemy had come for all that they called themselves men of the rising sun his medicine pouches had been tucked into little corners of the corsairs he had serviced and he had been proud when his planes and pilots returned beating the odds no his crisis had come later when he was a man of peace again and he had a home a wife and a small son to provide for that was when he had felt the pressing of the heavy eyebrows world of the clock against the medicine world of the seasons he had often felt as if he were juggling knives she must feel as if she too were juggling knives and the nature of her job meant she might also be tossed a redhot poker at any time but she was a warrior he had known all along that she would be a warrior the path of the warriorshaman was that much harder the balances more complicated her blood was of the peacemakers her path of the fighters the dance she danced was no traditional one but an intricate weaving of steps that would leave a fancy dancer exhausted akin to the skill needed for hoop dancing he half closed his eyes and his thumbs danced upon the control buttons and the little blocks fell and fell falling into place not always neatly but he kept ahead of them that was the object after allto keep moving keep ahead of the falling blocks kestrel had another sort of problem for she had always been a very earnest and responsible child one of the heavy eyebrows words for what she was he suspected was overachiever she always wished to do everything perfectly quickly greeting each new conquest with the need to do more this was partly his fault he thought he should not have permitted her to take on any of the internal paths of the heavy eyebrows he had allowed her to become contaminated in her thinking now that was not right he had not taught her to put that part of her that dealt with the heavy eyebrows world into a box that was what he had done ultimatelyand when that part of him was in the box he did not allow it to touch his inner self in the past two years or so he had noted a tendency in her to wish to control things to direct them rather than simply permitting them to happen and then dealing with the results those knives she was juggling would in fact juggle themselvesif only she would learn to trust in them in the spirit world and in herself that was the reason why he continued to tease her about sex the little old men of the past had sequestered their virgins until a husband chose them or the husbands family chose her for himor until she found a man to her liking and an uncle to broker the match that was one of the customs that made no sense in these days for there was no way to learn the world while being sequestered and besides as a shaman it made no sense for her to be a sequestered virgin for how could she understand the powerful medicines that sex created between man and woman if she knew nothing of them herself not that kestrel was a virginhe was perfectly well aware what she had been up to and while she might have thought it was her mother who had put the condoms in her underwear drawer when she was sixteen still in some ways he might just as well have sequestered her away for the past two years at least she had been living like a heavy eyebrows nun no men not even a suggestion of a manno nor a woman either that was unfortunate one needed to take care these days but abstinence was doing nothing for her it seemed to him that she needed some sort of outlet for the tension inside her and that sex would be a perfectly good release it would certainly help her to balance herself it would be the best of good medicine with the right man she needed to find herself another youngster and rediscover one of the simple things she would discover by giving up control of herself to a sensation how many of her problems could be dealt with by giving up an attempt at control and letting them happen this thing this obsession of hers with earning the pipe receiving a sacred pipe would signal the next level of her achievement as a shaman would in fact mean that she was no longer his apprentice but his equal the trouble was that she was so certain that it was time for that to happen as if things in the spirit world were punched in on some kind of celestial time clock it was the control thing that was holding her back and she could not see it nor could he tell her she must see it for herself he was trying to lead her in that direction by being suggestive a dirty old man using the shock to send her to find a more appropriate partner and so to see what it was she needed to see yet for all his hinting and suggestions she was so intent on time on control on outer world responsibilities that she could not seem to see past his joking with her to his serious intentions or else she didnt want to admit that she could actually need or learn from something as simple as sex he sighed he could only continue to do as he had been doing and hope that sooner or later he would find another path or she would find one until that happened kestrel was certainly a bitch to be around im glad you called miss talldeer the tinny voice did not sound terribly glad but that could have been either corporate manner or simply the bad speaker in her phone you caught me just before i left for the day i was out on a case she said simply hoping that it was either of those two i called as soon as i got your message there was something about an investigation of trouble at a construction site i hope you havent found someone else she pulled pad and pencil to take notes within easy reach both lay in a patch of late sunlight on the warm worn wood of her desk she hoped that the answer to her question would be no no we havent sleighbow said and she stifled a sigh of relief there arent many people with your particular qualifications certainly not in the tulsa area qualifications that was an odd thing to say and something shed better check out before she took this job im not certain what you mean she replied cautiously there are certainly plenty of competent private investigators in this area im sure there are many youve worked with before has one of my former clients referred you to me not exactly he temporized it took a good ten minutes of verbal songanddance before she finally got sleighbow to cough up his reason for calling her and no one else yes she had come highly recommended by former clientswhich was pleasant to hear but not enlightening yes her record was quite good yes he was pleased that she had a good relationshipor at least she didnt have a bad relationshipwith the local police none of those were the reason why he had called her nor the reason why romulus did not particularly want to use one of their usual firms and he wouldnt tell her exactly what the job was he kept asking her questions she was usually pretty good about figuring out which interview questions were loaded but this guy was slick shed have to have a voicestress analyzer to get anything useful out of some of the things he asked her does this have anything to do with the fact that im female she hazarded a little impatient with the man or that im aahminority if this is a bow toward tokenism ill take your job only if im really suited to doing it otherwise i would be very happy to recommend someone else who can handle it better and youll have made your federally mandated attempt shed taken a token job a few times in the past they had always turned out to be unmitigated disasters now even if she needed the money she always turned them down there was a pita factor pain in the assthat only very generous pay could compensate for it has everything to do with the fact that you are native american miss talldeer sleighbow replied relief quite obvious in his voice and no there is no one who is better qualified and it has nothing to do with federal mandates all right she said feeling that this time he was coming straight with her if youve got time ive got time why dont you start at the beginning and ill sit and listen chapter four are you familiar with the riverside mall project miss talldeer sleighbow asked his tone didnt tell her much but her instincts told her to be careful rod calligan is the developer there vaguely she replied with caution not a good idea to tell him she had been among the protesters when the area had first been proposed for development he might take a dim view of that not that it mattered much anymore really she and everyone but a few diehards had finally given up on stopping the project when it became painfully clear that the developer had everyone from the feds on down firmly in his back pocket there was no other way to explain why so many issues she and the others had raised had been so neatly taken care of but there had been no way to prove corruption so she had dropped out as had most of the others thered been some trouble with native american protesters back when the site was first selected sleighbow continued his tone completely noncommittal when calligan came to us he presented us with a package that indicated that every objection had been taken care of frankly we thought his presentation was a good one and when the developer made a point of hiring as many native americans as he could far beyond the point of governmentah recommendations our specialists assured us that there would be no further problems from that angle that was why we agreed to insure him romulus does not specialize in highrisk insurance the last was said with a certain emphasis and agreed with everything she had heard about his company she noticed two things he said native americans with no sign of selfconsciousness or irony and he had avoided the taboo word quotas interesting she thought she detected a little more relaxation in his voice as well she relaxed a little further and let her instincts talk to her for a moment her feeling after a few seconds was that since he had decided to come straight with her he was being quite open and honest i take it there seems to be a problem at the site then she asked it seemed an obvious question and she wondered how big the problem was and why the insurance company was now involved had there been some property damaged he sighed i take it that you havent seen the news tonight she felt her eyebrows rising no actually i havent ah he paused a moment then let me lead you up to this carefully so that you get everything in order according to rod calliganand mind you he only came to us with these allegations after the incident todayhes been threatened and harassed by native americans phone calls threatening letters nuisance sabotage at the site that sort of thing no real property damage or threats that came to anything he did not report any of this to the police he says he didnt want to alarm his family or trigger anything worse by starting a police investigation he had a number of native americans quit he hinted that the threats might have been coming from them oh she replied noncommittally interesting he was taking his own sweet time to get to the incident but she had the feeling that everything he was telling her now was important she had learned enough from grandfathers teachingstories not to rush him past information she might need we thought the same his tone was full of irony and she sensed that he found these stories just a little too pat still that doesnt change what happened today if there really were threats it went beyond them to action and this is what was on the news she asked and will probably make cnn he confirmed its ugly miss talldeer and ive got some small experience in sabotage theres no way to soften thissomeone blew up a bulldozer and killed four people including the foreman there are a half dozen more workers in the hospital or who were treated and released he paused for a moment to let that sink in it came as a shock still that was the kind of thing you expected to hear about in greece or the mideast or even new york not in your own backyard my god she said finally what happened preliminary investigation indicates that there was an explosive device planted somewhere on the bulldozer one that was triggered by an electronic detonator he took a deep breath but it did not cover the anger in his voice he was outraged by this personally as well he should be it was probably something like a garagedoor opener the analytical part of her mind was the first to recover not easy to trace she made notes rapidly as things occurred to her first and foremost this was a job for the police not a private investigator true given that there are several hundred thousand of them in the tulsa area alone but that is not what we want you to look into the police can handle the criminal investigation sleighbow was firm on that and she appreciated it she was not a magnum pi shed never handled anything worse than a spousebeater before this and she really didnt want to start butting in on police territory now thats their job and we are willing to let them do it he continued itll be murder charges before this is over and an insurance company does not need to handle a potato as hot as that what romulus wants you to do is to look into who or what is behind this is it a conspiracy and if it is did the developer try to defraud us by concealing it or was this simply an isolated act of a single disgruntled employee thats what we want to know was there fraud going on was the developer deliberately misleading us i can live with that she told him much relieved more thats something i can do it would not be the first fraud case she had handled although it was certainly the biggest and potentially the nastiest now why me because im native american and you figure the crew and the protesters will talk to me where they wont talk to the police to her surprise sleighbow chuckled that and because you are by all accounts a very attractive and small woman construction workers are less likely to think youre a threat she answered his chuckle with one of her own youre figuring out all my secrets but youre putting me between a rock and a hard place you know if i find out there was a conspiracy thats all we need to know we dont need to know if the conspiracy actually performed the sabotage i want you to understand that from the beginning in other words she said dryly no nancy drew right he sounded relieved that she understood all we need to know is that there really were threats previous to the explosion that there was a reason to think that the risk was greater than we had been informed and that because of that this developer went into the contract with the intent to defraud us sleighbows sincerity came through even over the bad speaker on the phone if you uncover anything else you know what you have to do i would turn anything suspicious over to the police and i think you will too but im not going to dictate to your conscience and romulus will not be doublechecking on you in the words of rhett butler frankly scarlett uh huh she couldnt fault him or the company really criminality was not their business and he was evidently quite conscious of the fact that he was hiring her to find information that might prove to be harmful to her people this was the best compromise he could offer yeah i know what i have to doturn the evidence or even the suspicions over to the police this is murder my duty lies with those who were killed even as an osage shamanor at least the kind of shaman grandfather has taught me to be but that doesn t make doing that duty any easier still how many times had grandfather made it clear that the time for purely tribal loyalties was gone that her tribe was humanity besides there were plenty of pis in tulsa who would be very happy to find him the proof of conspiracy he wantedeven if it wasnt there theyd at least be getting a fair shake with her in charge and there were those pesky bills to pay well mr sleighbow i guess youve just hired yourself a pi she said slowly id rather it was me than someone with a prejudicial axe to grind so would we miss talldeer yes that was relief in his voice too this way no one can be accused of not giving the native americans under suspicion the benefit of the doubt send your invoices to me directly he dictated an address which she noted down while this seemed to be a perfectly legitimate job she would be taking no chances shed be checking both the job and sleighbow tonight and tomorrow before she actually did anything at all on the case there had been cases of people pretending to an authority they did not have there had been hoaxes perpetrated on pis too they both made polite if hurried goodbyes and she hung up the phone but she did not return to the living room instead she remained at the desk thinking hard absently doodling on her notepad dust danced in the golden light coming in through the miniblinds at her office window and there was a pair of blue jays pigging out at the feeder just outside she had to think this thing through very carefully she had to be absolutely sure of her own feelings and motivations before she found herself tangled in something she was not prepared to handle emotionally and mentally if there was a conspiracyif it was activists her own people possibly a cause she had been involved in herself one she was emotionally supporting i still have to turn them in this was murder terrorism i cant play cute little semantics games and call them freedom fighters yes that was it there was a line that had to be drawn what was the old saying the freedom to swing your fist ends at my nose the freedom to be passionate about a cause ended when people could be hurt because of that passion people who murder innocent people in the name of a cause are still terrorists no matter how noble that cause is she had drawn that line for herself now she must stick to it i hate terrorists i hate them and everything they are theyre cowards who wont face the enemy honorably they re like the cowards who used to scalp women and claim they had taken warriors scalpslike the ones who attacked villages when the men were on the buffalo hunts that was another line of demarcation the line between warrior and terrorist a warrior was one who fought an enemy who knew he was the enemywho fought other warriors openly there had been times in osage warfare when coups were not even counted by taking a warriors scalp but by merely touching him and getting away again that was the purest form of warfare but there had been times when the enemy did not abide by the rules when he too became a terrorist there was a site not that far from her home in claremore where that had happened where a band of mixed heavy eyebrows scum renegade cherokee and rejects from other tribes had overrun an osage village killing torturing and raping the women old men and children left behind claremore mound it was called now she could never come near the site without feeling rage overcome her a rage triggered by all that helpless blood spilledby the powerful grief and fear and pain left behind by the victims anyone who sets bombs in bulldozers is no warrior and he deserves to die like a poisoned dog without honor without a way for wahkontah to recognize him so that his spirit joins the miahluschka and he wanders forever she felt that old rage building in her and stifled it you cant just condemn an entire race for things people who werent even their ancestors did that was why she had broken with the more ardent activists back in college you cant shove everyone into the same pile just because of their bloodlines she wanted her rights and the rights for all of the native peoples just as much as any of them didtheyd all been cheated and lied to for too long deprived of homes of religion of heritage even her family who had only kept their ways at the cost of hiding them who had not until her fathers generation been able to be osage openly but she could not take those rights like a thief and an assassin not at the cost of murder not at the cost of the lives of people who had nothing to do with the problem because you couldnt put all heavy eyebrows into the same category any more than you could every indian or even and this could get her in a world of trouble from some of her own people or those of other nations who had their own little sets of prejudices every member of a nation or tribe pawnees werent osage who werent cherokee who werent apache who werent algonquin who werent mohawk there were people of every type in every nation no one was noble and honorable just because he or she was native american there were people from nations traditionally her enemies that she would trust to cover her in a lifeordeath situation and people of her own nation she wouldnt trust as far as she could throw them you couldnt even pigeonhole people by their professions for not every indian made a living on the reservation weaving blankets and making jewelry there were mohawks who couldnt stand heights navaho physicists and algonquin computer programmers there were people like gail who had tried in her way to right the wrong that had been done by her ancestors and people like her husband whose ancestors had never seen an indian who had been quite prepared to continue that wrong so just because someones grandfather did something awful to my grandfather that doesnt make him responsible unless he decides to continue the wrong yeah better me in charge here than someone else seems to me that occasionally it was one of the duties of the shaman to play judge and executioneror at least cop you still didnt tell me why you were afraid of the box grandfathers voice behind her made her jump she hadnt heard him come up behind her and she hadnt heard the door to her office open either she pushed off from the desk turning her chair to face him he stood there with his teaching face on which meant that he wasnt going to leave until she said out loud what it was that had so troubled her because there was a sacred pipe in there thats why she frowned at him angry at being forced to admit her own weakness and her own deficiencies not just any pipe either but a powerful one created by and for a lakotah shamans use dammit grandfather you know im not a pipebearer you know why too you know im not strong enough im not good enough to handle it safely if it had remembered that the lakotah and the osage werent exactly best buddies and decided i was a threat she stared him straight in the eyes all her bitterness there for him to see for himself youve told me that often enough and you know you have but grandfather did not seem in the least disturbed not by her halfaccusations nor by her bitterness ive told you that youll be ready only when you stop thinking you should be ready you should listen to what i say not what you think you hear and with that he calmly turned and went back into the living room back to his nintendo no doubt she counted to ten slowly in english osage and cherokee useful to have three languages to do it in four if you counted her rudimentary spanishso for good measure she did it in spanish too well now that hed gotten that out of the way hed probably leave her alone about it sometimes she wondered just what he thought he was doing when he asked her things like that no he knows what hes doing i just dont understand it she sighed and picked up the little tablefetish one of her clients had sent her as a gift bear and she wasnt bear clanand zuni and she wasnt zunibut the thought had been kindly and the gift had meaning because of that she cradled it in her hand a lovely cool piece of soapstone comforting to hold because of its gentle curves she had been the only one in the family to have medicine power she would be the only one he had time to train before he died was he feeling frustrated too having to work with a flawed tool after all hed been teaching her so many things that she was not by tradition permitted to know the medicine of all the other gentes for instance and mens medicine as well as womansand warriors medicine well hes always been pretty contrarywhat do the lakotah call it heyoka i think part of that comes with the territory i suppose and part of it comes with being a changer and not just a traditionalist still you put what you have in the only pot you have i guess even if the pot is flawed and you hope the flaw isnt going to be a fatal one oh yes part of the shamanic training was to be able to put yourself in the place of another to see if you could understand what he must be going through and she could understand it but why couldnt he understand her why couldnt he just tell her what it was that was holding her back kestrel still hadnt heard him although she had listened to him she had paid no heed to what he had said she had only heard what she expected to hear mooncrow reminded himself not to grind his teeth it made his jaw ache afterwards that girl that incredibly stubborn girl for all of his years and patience there were times there would have been times with any pupil but it was all the more frustrating with his granddaughter she had not been the only choice to be his successor in the familyno there had been others including a cousin or two but after he had seen her with rabbit and had seen how fearlessly and effortlessly she had dealt with the spirit world there had not been anyone else in the running she was in fact the best apprentice he had seen in all of his life and she had no idea just how good she really was things it had taken him until late in adulthood to master she had achieved in her early twenties but he would not tell her that it would not help her to know that and might harm her it would certainly reinforce her certainty that she was ready to be a pipebearer and that would do her no good at all it might also harm her to know just how strong she was for that might either frighten her or make her try even harder for control she would command more power than he ever had once she loosened up a little and got over this current fixation of hers with how she must be the one who held the reins and guided everything as he contemplated his own frustration in dealing with kestrel he closed his eyes and told himself to relax he remembered a carenthusiast friend of his seething with a similar frustration during a televised race when mooncrow had asked why the friend had explained how the power of the particular car he favored had been deliberately lessened by restrictive devices placed on it by rules now mooncrow understood that frustration watching kestrel flounder all that potentialand until she stopped making up the rules that restricted her power the potential would never be fully freed no matter how he tried to tell her this she simply did not understand because she would not understand to understand what he was trying to tell her would mean that she must give up some of her control and put herself in the hands of wahkontah and all the mysteries she wanted things concrete thingsif a then b and cnot times and places where there were no rules or where she would have to find the new ones and he could only relieve his frustration by stacking little electronic blocks jennifer had succumbed to the cable temptation some time ago mostly for the news but also to give grandfather a little more choice in what he watched interestingly what he watched was in order cnn discovery and mtv sleighbow had been right it was a relatively slow news day and the explosion not only made the local news it made the networks as well as cnn in fact the national coverage was better than the local probably because the big guys were a bit less squeamish about gore than the three local stations not that she blamed the local folk the pictures even sanitized for general viewing were pretty ugly and the local news people knew that there would be friends and relatives watching tonight the local anchors hadnt gotten around to listing the victims yet cnn had and one thing hit her immediately when she heard the namesmost of the victims had been indians presumably the ones who hadnt quit not whites that made her sit back in her chair and stare at the screen ignoring the flashflood story from arizona that followed most of the victims were our people would an activist even a fanatic have planted an explosive then triggered it under conditions where most of the victims were his own people you killed the enemy not your own warriors you killed the man not the presumed victims of his oppression it didnt make sense it didnt even make sense if you figured in the possibility that he might have counted anyone working for this developer as a traitor he would know how other indians would feel about deaths in their own ranks especially very insular types who still harbored prejudices against any indian from another nation shed heard enough stories about treacherous blackfeet andfrom her own folktraitorous cherokees to know that an incident like this would not foster solidarity it would create divisions no no this was not adding up this made no sense whatsoever time to call home again dads got the best grapevine in the county maybe hes heard something if he hasnt and i ask him to keep his ear to the ground he might she dialed the familiar number without even looking at the buttons and waited it was picked up on the first ring this time talldeer residence sarah talldeer speaking can i help you jennifer grinned to herself and replied in cherokee beloved mother you are going to get yourself stolen by a marauding japanese sellerofgoods if you continue to answer the telephone that way we shall have to go on the war trail in order to steal you back and you know the japanese have no good horses to take how shall we get your worth in raiding with no horses to carry off jennie darling you are going to confuse the hell out of the nice fbi man tapping the phone if you keep speaking foreign languages her mother countered this time in english she laughed and so did jennie that was a family joke although at one point there probably had been a tap on the phone either because of jennifers activism or because of her current occupation there might be again oddly enough no one in the family really cared sarah talldeers attitude was that since no one in her family had anything to hide there was no reason to worry jennifer although she would have been outraged when she had been in college was now fairly philosophical about it and both her brothers and her father took a kind of puckish pleasure in the idea that some poor fool might be listening in sarah thought the whole idea of a phone tap was rather stupid if someone really wanted to listen to long conversations with her real estate clients or the trials and tribulations of the adolescent and collegeage talldeers they were welcome so far as she was concerned and heaven help them if they werent also fluent in osage and cherokee the family used all three languages as they had all their lives to make certain that their children were fluent in the tongues of their heritage by now they probably have translators jennifer told her then in osage she made an indecent suggestion about what could be done with the late fbi founders body just in case someone was listening if your grandfather taught you that one i dont think i want that translated honey sarah replied serenely it has to be something obscene poor mr hoover he must be spinning in his grave like a highspeed lathe your brother told me youd called has something come up sort of she licked her lips she might as well come straight to the point have you ah seen the news yet any news although sarah was not strictly a medicine woman grandfather had hinted that at least part of kestrels ability might have come from her mothers side of the family kestrel didnt doubt that at all for sarah had an uncanny ability to cut straight to the subject someone wanted to discuss whether or not it had even been mentioned that ability did not fail her this time you mean the explosion the one where the bulldozer blew up and all those poor men were killed her voice sharpened with anxiety isnt that a police thing how did you get involved obliquely dont worry im not going to get underfoot with the cops i dont think quickly she explained as much as she could without betraying client confidentiality then continued basically i need to know if dads heard anything that might apply you know young hotheads shooting their mouths off just before they shoot themselves in the foot or if the principal chief has hang on a moment ive got my real estate books and mortgage calculation sheets spread out all over the table and i want to write all this down so i get it right she listened to the background sound of paper shuffling for a moment as her mother restacked her work and reached for something she could take notes in all right would you take it from the top for me jennifer repeated it all carefully sarah had been a secretary and kept her shorthand up a skill she had taught jennifer it had come in useful in college and both of them still used it although jennifer had augmented her notetaking with a microcassette recorder dear this developercan you tell me his name i might get something if i nose around a little sarahs offer came as something of a surprise and jennifer found herself staring at the wall with her eyebrows lifted she hadnt considered her mother as a possible information source but sarah was rightif it had anything to do with land real estate agents heard about it and they talked she could have hit herself for not thinking of it too normally she was a bit better at thinking of the obvious mother that would be fabulous she said honestly and yes i can tell you since its pretty well public knowledge theyll probably say something about it on the ten oclock news they might even have an interview with him its a fellow named rod calligan and i would love to hear every juicy little rumor you have on him i can tell you right now that he hasnt made any friends in this business sarah said immediately if you asked someone in tulsa they would probably talk your ear off but even out in claremore we know about him hes cutthroat and they say hes cutrate anything he builds never meets more than the absolute minimum standards and whenever he can he builds outside municipal boundaries so he doesnt have to meet city codes interesting that wasnt illegalbut it was cheesy by some standards and someone who built things that way might be tempted into something just as cheesy or maybe not he might not think he was doing anything cheesyhe might think he was simply being a good businessman he might not even consider shading the truth to get cheaper insurance to be fraud shed have to have more information and she said as much to her mother well i can get it for you honey sarah said cheerfully i think marge had some dealings with him and you know how marge loves to talk only too well she cornered me at your last company picnic jennifer groaned i thought my ear was going to fall off jeni hope you know i worry about you but i wouldnt ask you to stop what youre doing sarah sounded hesitant but jennifer knew why theyd had this little talk before i know mom you cant help worrying im your kid youd worry about any of the guys too jennifer couldnt help smiling you also know how good a shot i am and that im pretty good at martial arts and i dont think that being a shaman hurts i know all that i also know that people have a breaking pointand that if you push them too hard sometimes they get ugly sarah did not sound like a nagging mother she sounded like a concerned one not worried but cautious i dont like what ive heard about this calligan man he sounds like hes used to getting his own way and if you cross him she did not complete the sentence but jennifer did it for her if i cross him he is very likely to react badly so ill do my best not to cross him she hoped the slight smile she wore now crept into her voice if i can manage it i wont be more than another reporter ill try not to let him know what my job really is if i have to talk to him ill try to make him think im just a dumb indian babe now her tone turned ironic sometimes a prejudice can work for you thats my smart daughter sarah chuckled ill give this to your father as soon as he comes in if you call back tomorrow hell probably have a little something for you if theres anything at all to know thanks mom jennifer said now whats all this about quill embroidery they talked of ordinary things for a while longer then jennifer hung up when she heard the call waiting click on her mothers side of the line besides she still had some more work to do before she gave up for the night she had two lines one for the phone and one for her computer she wasnt the only pi in tulsa using a computer but she thought she might be one of the few to use it to its full potential there were a lot of databases available to people who knew how to get into them all of them quite legal to access so long as you knew how a little crosschecking proved that sleighbows number was indeed one of the romulus internal numbers a little more crosschecking showed that romulus like many other companies had voice mail and since sleighbow had said he was going home she reached for her phone and dialed his number again after the fourth ring there was a pickup she listened as the voicemail service told her she had indeed reached sleighbows number and told her how to leave a voicemail message she hung up without leaving anything but she had learned that sleighbow worked for who he said he worked for now to find out if he had the authority to hire her she looked through the database for the number of the live internal operator and dialed that after a moment a real person answered do you have the number for the accounting department she asked the operator was perfectly happy to give it to her and then somewhat to her surprise added since its monthend there are probably a lot of people still down there would you like me to put you through now yes please jennifer replied trying not to sound as surprised as she felt if she could confirm sleighbows authority to hire her she could be on this case tonight a few more hours to chalk up to the romulus account wouldnt hurt the phone rang through and someone picked it up jennifer explained who she was and why she was calling and the young man at the other end replied im just a programmer man but hold on a sec ill get the supervisor this was going better than she had any reason to expect five minutes later she hung up the phone still blinking in pleased surprise not only had she confirmed that she had been hired by someone with the authority to do so but the supervisor of accounting had laughed and told her hed seen the account with her name on it opened just before quitting time she pinched herself just to make certain this wasnt some kind of dream then again she sobered suddenly there were usually reasons for things going this well early in a case it meant that the case itself was going to be a bitch well if its going to be that bad id better get on it tomorrow early while my luck is still running she closed down computer and modem picked up her purse and headed back out and meanwhile id better make a good grocery run because i bet i wont have time for one once this heats up as she passed him in the living room grandfather looked up and gave her one of his patented inscrutable expressions now what in the hell was that all about she wondered with him it could be anything from toilet paper on my shoe to the fact that im about to walk into a trap and he doesnt feel like telling me about it as she closed the front door behind her and headed for the truck the shrill kleekleeklee of a bird screamed out above her head she looked up there was her spirit animal a kestrel sitting on the phone line above her head the little falcon a female by her markings stared down at jennifer and screamed again thats easy for you to say jennifer retorted inserting her key into the lock you dont have to live with him chapter five rod calligan had not expected so many reporters to show up he would have thought by now after a day had passed that the explosion was old news he managed to send the last of the reporters packing turned away to his car and straightened his tie just in case there was a camera still operating somewhere around this was a hell of a way to spend a hot afternoon standing out in the direct sunlight courting a sunstroke one of the advantages of being the boss was setting your own hours and he liked to take his afternoons off it was well past the time hed usually have been home and he was damned tired of nosy reporters demanding answers to questions they had no right to ask what did his wife have to do with this anyway he was angry but he hoped he had not showed anything other than contempt for the reporter in question this had not been in the plan and he had not been prepared to face all those inquisitors still he thought hed handled it all pretty well hed managed to field their questions cautiously and carefully and he thought he might have succeeded in planting the idea that the explosion had been the fault of terrorists he hadnt actually come out and said that terrorists did it but hed talked about the vandalism and sabotage at laboratories that used animals and the spiking of trees in logging areas hed even managed to work in the supposed trouble with indians in almost the same sentence so without actually coming out and accusing anyone he figured plenty of people would put two and two together for themselves with luck one or two of them would be reporters there was a rightwing regional rag that would probably report things that way there were plenty of people around here who thought indians were trash theyd be only too happy to believe anything bad about them the neonazis and skinheads would probably start rumors for him the jerk at romulus had sure been a pain though his regular man had been away from his desk when hed called in the bombing and that sleighbow was a suspicious bastard he had as many questions as the reporters why didnt you say anything about these threats before and when exactly did you start getting phone calls did you save the letters why didnt you report this to the police he thought hed gotten through that all right but hed better make sure before he headed home maybe hed better check up on the state of things at romulus it didnt do to have loose cannon rolling around on the deck he got into his car started it and the ac and dialed the contact number on his cellular phone savoring the cool sterility of the airconditioned breeze coming from the vents this time his man was in calligan let out a sigh of relief although if john hadnt been there this time he could simply have hung up there had been a certain amount of urgency about getting the explosion reported to romulus now he could afford to take things the way he had planned them he explained what had happened quickly i got assigned to a guy named sleighbow a real company man he gave me some trouble whats he doing about this call me from your office the man said ill have to check his desk i saw him leave so that shouldnt be a problem just let it ring until i pick up there was a click and calligan hung up quickly no use paying for minutes of cellular for nothing but an open line calligan stared out the windshield at the remains of the bulldozer a little smile on his face then drove the short distance to the site office a portable trailer he had an auxiliary office and phone in there hed be alone the secretary was long gone since hed sent everyone at this site home early there would be no problems with being overheard he wouldnt have that security at home the window in his office looked out over the same area of course though from a different angle there were still police swarming all over the remains of the dozer but it looked to him as if they had gotten everything they were going to after all theyd had all night and all this morning to glean clues and there were a couple of cars and trucks parked off on the shoulder their occupants peering out the windows at all the activity bunch of ghouls he thought with contempt they were no better than the bloodsucking reporters who wanted to know how extensive the injuries were he allowed his smile to become a grin now that there was no one to see it the explosion had worked perfectly all according to plan the dynamite came from the company stores a shed most of the construction workers had access to the detonator came from there too and the garagedoor opener came from kmart there was nothing to trace back to him that couldnt lead back to anyone on the crew as well his hand went to his inside jacket pocket and he took out a palmsized bundle of what seemed to be soft mahoganybrown leather it was wrapped around other things bones feathers who knew what old brittle and dark with age he put it on the blotter and fondled it as he picked up the phone with his other hand he left it alone just long enough to dial the number of his contact and then went back to caressing it his goodluck piece he thought and grinned again it had been a real piece of good luck finding this thing although it was not the sort of object he would normally have touched much less picked up and taken with him after acquiring it hed visited one of the indian museums to try and identify it he thought it might be a fetish bundle it looked like the ones in the museum whatever it was finding it had given him the key to making this whole scheme work he still remembered clear as day when hed found it he had come across it right after the flood on mingo creekthe one his mingo development had caused not that hed ever told anyone he hadnt really expected any problems at least not that soon just because hed paid off the team doing the environmentalimpact statement to ignore that little drainage problem that sunnyvale was going to produce of course they hadnt dared admit that or theyd have been in just as much trouble as he would so everybody had kept their mouths shut and the worst thing that had happened was that a bridge had gotten washed out along with some creek bank and the army corps had extended their floodcontrol project on mingo to go a bit above owasso no big deal too bad that bridge was gonethere wasnt enough money in the county budget to cover replacing it so the hicks in the sticks would just have to do without it it didnt make a lot of difference to him theyd said that a big chunk of land had gotten washed out that mingo had temporarily changed its course and the army corps had to put in a fair amount of work to get it to go back to its bed well that was baloney rivers and streams changed their beds all the time in oklahoma they couldnt point the finger at him or at anybody it just happened but hed had to take a stroll down there himself when it had happened just to make sure that there was nothing that could point to him and his development as the cause that was when hed found his goodluck charm the little fetish bundle was simply lying on the ground beside the nowshrunken stream in the middle of a flat patch of sand as if it was waiting for him god only knew where it came from it was as clean as it was now he picked it up and he still didnt know why but ever since that moment things had been going all his way even then the riverside mall project was sinking like a lead boat there were no stores signed up and no prospect of any it was a combination of the abysmal economy and the fact that there was no one who was fool enough to sign up for a site that was inevitably going to flood some time in the next twenty years tulsa summers were getting wetter not drier hundredyear floods were happening every couple of years he had a choice at that point close the project down and take a loss or keep going and chance a bigger one but the rest of the investors in the project would demand their money back and that would be a disaster until he picked up the bundleand john smith at romulus insurance gave him that fateful little call his name wasnt smith of course but that was how rod was told to refer to him from the time of that conversation it started badly with john smith telling him hed been checking into the riverside mall project for romulus and that it didnt look good that he didnt see how romulus could possibly insure a project that was going to go under at any moment rod tried to bluff john smith wasnt having any but then the conversation took an abrupt uturn smith suggested that he might forget some of the things hed uncovered in his report for a price but that wasnt all smith had in mind youre a good businessman mr calligan smith had said let me make you a proposition john suggested that there might possibly be a way to close down the project and still turn a profitif he could find a way to get some kind of extremists or terrorists to close the project down for him because of sabotage he was holding the bundle at the time and that was when the entire plan sprang into his mind as if it had been placed there he and smith had most of the details worked out between them before hed hung up first he would go to a remote indian burial ground on private land a place he knew existed because he had camped and hunted there as a young boy the place was supposed to be haunted and none of his friends would stay there overnight or take any of the artifacts that occasionally surfaced in the area now he was glad he knew it existed because it was going to be the key to his plan he would dig up some of those graves take the bones and artifacts and seed his own site with them he would wait until his men uncovered the planted gravesand being superstitious indians they would of course raise a fuss probably they would even refuse to continue working there certainly they would refuse to work until he brought in some kind of witch doctor he would order them to continue digging and to burn what they foundand if they were not already refusing to work that would ensure that they walked off the job then he would arrange a terrorist bombing that he could blame on the indian activists while he was setting all this up he would be siphoning development money into a fund at romulus probably some kind of investment fund that he and john smith had access to he would invoice things he had not purchased and put the cash into the fund he could blame the indians for stealing the supplies too once the first bombing took place he would have a scapegoat indian activists he could then stage several more accidents giving credence to the idea that indian activists had turned to terrorism then he would complete the plan with a final bombing that would destroy the office his office computers and all the records covering his embezzlement at that point he could even declare bankruptcy it was about time to get out of the development game in oklahoma anyway the gravy train had run out a long time ago and the economy of this region was not likely to get better until the year he wasnt prepared to wait around working on piddly shit until that happened he could try something else ostrich farming maybe there would be good money in it for a while whether or not he declared bankruptcy was secondary anyway hed also be able to collect insurance money from romulus so he would have his secret nest egg shared with john smith and his insurance payment well right now hed worry about phase one making sure all the blame for the bombings and other sabotage fell on the damn indians with any luck he could make himself look really goodmake a big point about how hed gone out of his way to get them jobs and carry on about ingratitude and superstition hed have to wait until the press came out and asked him if the rumors of indian terrorists were true but the way he figured it that should happen some time later in the week certainly it would happen as soon as the second bomb went off the phone rang on periodically rod would hang up and hit the redial button just to end the monotony smith picked up his phone finally and as always calligan activated the tape recorder he had all kinds of recordings and paper trails just in case it always paid to have insurance calligan i got to the records we have a problem rod frowned hed gotten to know the subtle cues in smiths voice over the past few weeks and smith was nervous so whats the problem he asked cautiously sleighbow hired a private investigator to make sure you didnt know there was real trouble before the bombing smith said hes looking for conspiracy to commit fraud thats not just civil thats criminal rod didnt see the problem whats the big deal he asked theres nothing to find there wasnt any conspiracy remember we made it all up yeah and thats the problemthat there isnt anything you dont have any way to substantiate this terrorism shit smith definitely was nervous if there isnt anything there the pi just might look deeper and find some of our tracks or else clue the cops in no problem rod had dealt with smalltimers a lot he knew how to handle them we just wait until he doesnt find anything slip him some change under the table to quit right there and the big deal is the pi he hired smith interrupted for starters this one isnt on the take shes as clean as they come its a woman a local and shes likely to know what to look for and shes indian so you can bet shes going to be looking for things that will clear her people ive got a file on her right hereromulus hasnt ever done work with her before but one of the companies we bought out not too long ago did according to this she not only refused a payoff she had herself wired by a security firm and reported the bribe with the tape as evidence she got some olympia people fired over that one shes straight and she could be trouble but the moment smith revealed his oppositions sex rod knew he had the situation sewed up indian and female uneducated unthinking relying on instincts no way was this chick going to give him a hard time no woman is going to be trouble rod said arrogantly i havent seen a bitch yet i havent been able to outclass and outthink but i need more informationi need to know where i can get some leverage on her see what you can dig up for me and see if you can have someone at your end throw her a red herring get somebody to tell her there really was trouble with indians before the explosion smith snorted he was clearly not that confident but then he didnt know rod did he all right he said reluctantly but its your funeral if you screw up then he hung up abruptly leaving rod with a dial tone rod dropped the receiver into its cradle frowning and killed his recording this was stupid smith was spooking over nothing one insignificant female pi indian or not wasnt going to ruin the plan all he needed was a little more information a way to get a handle on her and that would be it was smith a weak link in this he might be and rod needed to think about a way to protect himself from his ally finally he got up and tucked his fetishbundle back into his jacket pocket it was time to be heading home before another stupid reporter decided to track him down he was not ready to deal with them yet he needed to think out everything he was going to say and do before he confronted another reporter he needed to control them he could not let them take the situation out of his hands again he locked up the office and at last took refuge in his car only when he was speeding down the broken arrow expressway heading for home did he feel secure he would plan every day from now on prepared to confront reporters prepared to get control and keep control of every situation but as for the pismith was overreacting he was far more worried about the reporters uncovering something because of some slip of his own tongue no there was no female in the world that was a match for him hed plow this bitch under like he plowed under brush shed be just another weed in his path but still the conversation left a bad taste in his mouth one that lasted through the rest of the evening jennifer pulled the brat up to the edge of the cyclone fence surrounding the construction site she parked there and waited until the police were gone even though she had no intention of getting onto the property yet there were a half dozen other cars here full of people watching the police avidly they were good camouflage for her finally calligan left the site office and drove off in his ridiculously expensive sedan then the last of the cops packed up and left and when they drove off so did the sensationhungry observers leaving her alone the place was deserted now yards of yellow police linedo not cross tape all around the area of the explosion flapping in the breeze it looked like any other construction site shed ever seen yards of plowedup and leveled dirt heavy equipment scattered aroundthe river in the background low nowheat rising in waves from the open areas but there was something really wrong here something that had nothing to do with the yellow police tape and the spilled blood that cried out to her for justice something that lay deeper than that buried under the raw earth she had checked on all the permits and they were clear calligan had not stepped one inch outside the law she had spoken to other contractors and no one was willing to say anything against him nevertheless there was something wrong here something permits did not cover it was more than just the plowing up of land she had last seen alive and covered with native grasses and cottonwoodsalthough that disturbed her on a deep level the level that saw waste and pillage and wanted to strike out at the author of that wastage there were several things obviously wrong beginning with the sort of thing anyone could see first was simply the area itself she hadnt quite remembered what the site had looked like before she got here for it had been too long since the last protestnow she was struck by the complete inappropriateness of the land for anything much less a mall there were no really major arteries coming anywhere near here so traffic was going to be a bitch but most of all this was floodplain granted the army corps had been doing a lot since the floods following the monster in on memorial day but when it came right down to it they were playing a game of catchup there was a lot more rainfall around here than there had ever been before but that was not all there were more recreational lakes and waterretention projects than ever before and that meant that there would be a little more water in the local ecosystem with every passing year that meant more danger of flooding the army corps only fixed something after the floods not before and if they had to order a water release further upstream there would be nothing that would save this place from the rising waters i sure wouldn t want to buy anything built herenot unless it was on a barge or came with a flotation collar and it was a lot closer to the eaglenesting area than she remembered too true eagles were even nesting on golf courses in florida but florida golf courses supported a lively little ecosystem of their own what with bunnies in the rough and fish in the water hazards there was food on the golf courses what would the eagles eat here big macs maybe i gave in too quickly maybe i should have used some of my outofstate connections to put some pressure on the county boys i know they had to be on the takemaybe i should have done a little legwork and found a way to prove it she had watched rod calligan handle the reporters dive into his office then drive away in his yuppiemobile all without bothering to make contact she hadnt left him alone just because hed looked like he was in a hurry either there had been something really offkilter about him something that just plain didnt fit his public face it was as if hed been wearing chromeyellow socks and purple nikes with that armani suit of his although it was something that did not show on the surface something that didnt match that yuppierthanthou exterior abruptly she realized what it was bad medicine it had been all over him an aura perhaps only she could have detected shed done a little checking with karen miles a reporter friend of hers for channel three who had interviewed him for the early news yesterday mr calligan had not made a good impression on karenoffensive arrogant and chauvinistic were the kindest things that karen had to say about him that had been another reason to put off confronting him facetoface jennifer had not felt up to dealing with a pain in the behind just yet she might not have to meet with him at all the job required investigating him and it might be better if he didnt know she existed for a moment she toyed with the idea that he might simply be putting her back up because his attitudes were so ingrained that they tainted everything around him but she had to deal with offensive white males all the time her obvious racial heritage and sex often counted against her in oklahoma in fact there had been a time or two when patience and doing a damn fine job had turned a couple of those guys into allies no this was all bad medicine the real thing the feeling of hate of a grudge or even a curse it was as if rod calligan had been tagged by something something unseen something malevolent and it wasnt just because he had desecrated a burial ground although that was part of it that would bear looking into as well but the bad medicine that raised her hackles right now was something bigger and it involved his cooperation what was even odder she hadnt noticed it until hed come out of that office as if something he had done in there had activated it she filed that away for future thought and for a possible discussion with grandfather how could a whiterthanwhite guy get involved with malevolent medicine well she wasnt going to get any more answers standing around hereand if she lingered much longer there might be a cop along to find out if she was just a morbidaccident groupie a chick who was stupidly curious or someone who might know something the truism that criminals always returned to the scene was just that and if she didnt want to become a suspect herself she had better get out of here time to get moving with that list she got from calligans personnel girl the best time to catch people was when they were home for supper supper would there be time to get something well maybe shed better just grab an apple and some cheese from the fridge there was a derisive caw from above her head she looked up above her on the telephone pole was a huge raven one with a worn beak and who listed a little to one side still watching me hmm she suppressed an urge to stick her tongue out at it instead she looked directly up at it and said dont you dare order a pizza while im gone you know its bad for your heart the raven cawed again this time a series of short croaks that sounded like someone laughing and it flew off wings pumping hard to get any kind of lift out of the hot heavy air she looked around guiltily to see if there was anyone who might have heard her talking to a bird yeah and who might call the folks down at the home to find out if they d had any escapees but there was no one in sight and with a sigh of relief she started the truck and drove off interviews not her favorite part of the job although as a shaman she had a betterthanaverage chance at knowing when someone was lying to her home first though and grab something to hold until she could get a real meal lunch had been an apple and some yogurt someone else might have calledor her father might have gotten back with some information that would help when she talked to the construction guys who quit every little bit of leverage was useful on a case like this one where no one was going to want to talk to anyone else sometimes it was useful to be going the opposite direction of everyone else rush hour around here began at three when the plants and factories let out she made pretty good time getting back homewhile the sides of the streets heading out into the suburbs were still congested the sides going into town were pretty empty she pulled up into the driveway dashed into the house and poked her head into the living room feeling a bit more cheerful than when she had left anybody call she asked mooncrow who was up to some obscene level on tetris one call he said never taking his eyes off the screen i left the number on the pad in the kitchen the man would only say that he was calling about native americans would that be sleighbow calling to see if shed gotten started on the case surely not surely he would not be that impatient in her experience insurance people didnt understand the meaning of the word fast she tucked herself into the tiny kitchen barely big enough for one older houses usually had enormous kitchens but this house must have been built for a woman who hated to cook because you couldnt open the oven and refrigerator doors at the same time the number on the pad had an area code that seemed familiar but the number wasnt sleighbows it occurred to her that it might be fedex about the package shed just sent or even one of the lakotah calling to see if shed made any progress no wait its not an number so it must be the lakotah i did tell them i was going to know by today whether or not the relics were where i thought they were maybe my contact wasnt home and whoever got the box doesnt know what it is she dialed the number then dug into the fridge for an apple and string cheese while it rang she was short on time short on energy and short on fuel this is jennifer talldeer i sent the box already she said checking her watch as soon as someone picked up on the other end make this fast and get on the road she thought absently she needed to bolt this and get out of here she felt a growing irritability maybe even a little lightheadedness the apple was wearing thin you should have gotten it before ten this morning silence for a moment then the person on the other end said what box the relics youi mean the lakotah elderswanted me to track down she replied rattling on quickly and thinking she must be talking to a younger relative who was not privy to what the elders had been doing just tell charlie wapiti i got them and i sent them this afternoon iuh miss talldeer i did call you but it wasnt about lakotah relics the man on the other end of the line said im franklin morse im with morse construction in kansas and i was told by a mr sleighbow you might want to talk to me about rod calligan oh good grief she exclaimed exasperated with herself and blushing mr morse i am sorryi have more than one case going at a time and i just assumed you were calling about one i just wrapped up yes i would like to ask you about rod calligan if theres anything at all you can tell me but i dont have a lot of time shoot thats all right it is your nickel morse replied just what are you looking for information about the way he operates she said with caution im a private investigator and im looking into an accident on one of his sites that was ambiguous enough nothing that calligan could take exception to if he got word she was asking around about him huh morse was silent for a moment i go headtohead with calligan on a lot of bids and i do have to tell you miss that hes a sharp one never makes a bad move businesswise even when it looks like hes making a mistake it always turns out he made the right move interesting especially in light of all the realestate failures lately what about his crews do you have any idea how he gets along with his employees silence for a moment rides his boys pretty hard makes sure every minute on the clock is a minute of work i can meet and match his bids though and i can guarantee i dont have the kind of labor problems he does labor problems she asked trying to prompt him without sounding like she was doing so whove you been talking to morse countered i could tell you better if i knew a shrewd man she had the notion that he wanted to know if anything he said could get him into trouble some of his employees she said absently trying to get down the apple without sounding like she was eating i may talk to some other people who arent working for him right now well miss like i said hes kinda hard theres some folks that just dont like him being that tight on the clock and they kinda got a problem with that are you working with that fella name of sleighbow that called me she decided she might as well loosen up a little if sleighbow had sent this man to her it was probably safe to be a little less obtuse yes actually she replied well i got some of calligans people here theyre indiansthey dont think too highly of the man they said hes got an attitude about things they feel pretty strong about he sounded as if he was feeling her out pardon my asking miss but are you indian yes she said figuring it wouldnt do any harm why silence again i talked to them trying to figure out why they left they said it was because they figure hes disrespectful of the earth and if you was indian too i reckoned youd know what they meant the man sounded puzzled i dont get it but they feel pretty strong they say hes disrespectful of the ancestors too the way they carry on sometimes youd think he was out there every day bulldozin down churches or something well i think i can understand how they feel she replied trying to think of a way to give this apparently wellmeaning fellow some insight imagine how youd feel if some punks got into the graveyard where your grandparents are buried and wrote graffiti all over the gravemarkers i guess id get pretty hot about it morse admitted i guess they are too then could be she checked her watch again mr morse thank you if you have anything more specific to tell me call me collect all right thatll be fine he said cheerfully glad i could help gnight miss talldeer thank you mr morse she hung up unfortunately the man hadnt told her anything she hadnt already heard from sleighbow getting steamed about something and doing anything about it were two different things and this still sounded more like a terrorist action than something concocted by a disgruntled employee people who hated your guts came after you personally with a gun they didnt blow up a bulldozer and take out only fellow employees well it had been a long day and it was likely to get a lot longer shed better get on the road again the phone rang just as the calligans were halfway through dinner toni calligan started her hazel eyes going wide and pushed away from the table to grab it before it disturbed her husband but rod waved her back to her seat before she could get up im expecting a call he said go ahead and eat this wont take long he left his dinner on the table knowing that if it did take longer than he thought it would toni would automatically take his halffinished plate off to the kitchen to rewarm it he had her well trained he picked up the phone on the extension in his office just as it got to the fourth ring calligan he said shortly if this was a siding salesman smith said the voice on the other end you wanted more information i got it for you rod took down notes as smith rattled off a short biography of this jennifer talldeer who had been assigned to him mother father brothers grandfather living with herthere didnt seem to be a lot of leverage there except for strongarm tactics and it wasnt at that level yet then he got to the interesting tidbit seems like she takes on some nopay cases on her own time smith said she goes after indian bones and artifacts and sends them back to the tribes they came from she just shipped off a box of stuff like that within the week in fact if shes doing this for nothing id say shes pretty motivated about it oh really rod calligans hand moved of itself to his goodluck charm in his pants pocket but his eyes moved to the boxes of loot from that indian graveyard artifacts that had looked like they might be worth something and which he hadnt used to salt the construction site he smiled what do you mean by that smith demanded testily rods smile widened only he replied softly that i think i can promise i know how to pull her strings chapter six this had been her first full day on the case by now sunset was only a memory and jennifer was just grateful she knew the entire tulsa metroplex like her own backyard otherwise it would have been impossible to find all these addresses some of these little suburban areas had streets that wound around through them with no plan that she could make out this was one of them and it took her fifteen minutes to find the right ridley for there was a ridley street a ridley way a ridley court and a ridley place all within blocks of one another she pulled the brat up in front of the third house on her list only to find it dark with no signs of vehicles anywhere not in the garage nor the driveway nor the street outside what is this bingo night its too early in the year for softball league and too late for bowling this was ridiculous there hadnt been a single soul home so far who was on her list of calligans exemployees it was beginning to feel like an episode of the twilight zone well no point in sticking around here there was some traffic on the road but not much she waited until the car behind her had pulled around her parking place then got back on the street again surely someone was going to be home the fourth name on her list was a guy who lived out in sand springs not tulsa with any luck whatever it was that had pulled everyone out of their houses here in town would not be something that someone in sand springs would want to drive all the way into tulsa for at the end of a long workday a twentyminute drive could seem much too long unless its a garth brooks concert or something nothing too much to go through for a garth brooks concert that was a facetious thought of course if there had been anything that big in town shed have known about it weeks ago the drive out to the springs was uneventful sunset brought cooler temperatures and she was able to roll the windows down instead of using the ac heat lightning flickered in the clouds overhead illuminating them for a brief moment in a flash of orange the color always made her think of orange sherbet a childhood hangover from nights spent sitting out on the porch watching the lightning and the lightning bugs and sharing a bowl with one of the cats her next target lived a little out of town on a county road and as she neared the house she knew that this man at least was not off somewhere his driveway was full of cars and trucks and his yard held the overflow the little white frame house was lit up inside and out and it was clear that the owner expected all this company as she pulled into the driveway and parked her car behind the last one in the line a red pickup she had a sinking feeling that now she knew where everyone on her list was someone had gotten wind of trouble and this was how they were dealing with it too bad her father hadnt heard about this it would have been nice to have had some warning looks like ive walked right into a meeting she thought grimly and i dont think its the kiwanis or the tulsa pow wow club she turned off her car lights and as she did so she noticed the curtains at one of the lighted windows move id say ive just been spotted mani wish id had some warning about this though i guess if some of my buddies got blown up and people were looking for scapegoats id get together with everyone else too so ive got what two dozen hostile people waiting in there the prospect was not one she enjoyed stillon the bright side it would save having to run them all down and she could get all her rejections over with at once aw guys it would be so nice if youd cooperate it would look so much better on the report if youd just play nice she squared her shoulders put on her best professional manner and opened the truck door as she came up the walkway and into the light from the porch lamps she saw the curtains at the window move again and a shadow move toward the door here comes the welcoming committee just as she reached the porch someone opened the door and walked out to intercept her for a moment a shock of recognition froze her he leaned up against the doorframe and crossed his arms a sardonic expressionnot quite a sneeron his face she unfroze took two more steps and stopped one foot on the low wooden porch hello david she said evenly i hope its nice to see you again wish i could say the same it depends on whose side youre on impossible to pretend she didnt know david spotted horse not when he was the first guy shed ever slept with the guy her folks had thought for sure she was going to marry and the last guy shed ever been at all serious about as far as that went im not on anyones side david she replied keeping her voice even and not betraying what she was really feeling you ought to know that if you pretend to know anything about me her stomach was one tight knot her heart fluttering rival feelings warred for possession of her body it figures that hed be here a possible incident building involving native americans and right in his own stomping grounds they must still be scrubbing the marks off the driveway where he peeled out of there there being north dakota and they being the activist group hed joined in college right before hed dropped out and right before theyd had that screaming fight that ended in a breakup she still couldnt figure out why hed bailed out of college when he dropped out he was scuttling a promising career in law and the powers knew the native american movement needed lawyers but he said it was a waste of time she stayed to graduate his decision to bail had been only one of the reasons why theyd broken up he was posed right under one of the porch lights and she couldnt help but make mental comparisons with the guy she used to know the guy she used to know wouldnt have posed like that making a macho bodylanguage statement clearly blocking her way the old david would have stood a little to one side to give her a chance to push past him so he was used to blocking the way to forcing a confrontation whether or not the other party was prepared for one the years had improved him that was for sure gone was the conservative haircut his hair was almost as long as hers now parted in the middle and tied back with a thong decorated with a beaded redtail feather she had no doubt hed earned it had no doubt that hed probably earned eagle by now and just chose not to wear it every day hed put on muscle the open collar of his blue workshirt showed the strong throat encircled by a hairpipe collar and it was pretty obvious from the straining seams across his shoulders and chest that hed been exercising more than rhetoric since hed been gone she guessed he was actually wearing a size smaller jeans than he had in college at least in the waist the silver and leather concha belt buckled over his hips was new and with that and the soft blue jeans he looked good enough to be in the movies the chiseled face and dark farseeing eyes could still make her heart beat a little faster if she ignored the sullen and challenging expression there that expression helped her get herself back under some semblance of control yeah hes a babefest all right but the years havent improved his manners any she grinned but only mentally or his command of body language inscrutable warrior my ass he might as well be writing his intentions on a blackboard he was taking the offensive and aggressive path right from the start and her efforts at keeping nonconfrontational werent working hed already made up his mind about her and she didnt think he was going to listen to anything she said still she had to try if youre not on our side jennifer youre on the enemys side he replied angrily and giving enemy the emphasis that put a capital e on the word thats the way it is and youd better get that through your head right now you may think you arent on anyones side but you were hired by the enemy and youre the enemys shill whether you know it or not right i thought that kind of thinking went out in the sixties she kept her expression calm although she was anything but first of all david its none of your business who hired me but that hardly matters since secondly you cant possibly know who hired me or what they want me to find out because that kind of information hasnt made it out on the street yet and believe me id know if it had and thirdly youre right out of line because you havent the faintest idea of what youre talking about she tried not to sound anything other than logical and cool but nothing she said or did was going to penetrate that thick and ridiculously attractive head he sneered he actually sneered she hadnt thought anyone used that particular expression outside of bad movies and worse tv shows i know more than enough he replied i know how you were when i dumped you that you figured you could get along with the man i know thats shorthand for selling out youre still letting wasichu tell you what to do what to say what to think you havent changed jennifer you dumped me yeah fer sure and im a blond she didnt know whether to laugh at him or herself oh david like you arent a tool of the man whether or not you admit it the man manipulates you just by being for something even if it was good for you youd be against it and dont think that smart people arent able to figure that out after talking with you for two minutes but she didnt say anything she just sighed after a long moment look i have a job to do and it happens to be for our people are you going to get out of the way theres nothing in there for you jennifer he said not moving theres no one in there who wants to talk to you since he obviously hadnt asked anyone in the meeting if they were willing to talk to her that patent untruth made her lose her patience id like to hear that for myself thank you and id like to get a chance to talk to someone who just might know something that could help all of us instead of a fool who acts like a white man and makes assumptions without waiting to hear the facts she could have slapped herself for calling him a fool but it was too late to take it back he didnt move he just stood there with that scowl on his face in what had to be an unconscious reflection of a james dean poster thats what this meeting is all about he said abruptly were making up our minds about what were going to do about this situation there are at least some people here who have the sense to talk to experts instead of waiting to get trapped by smart cops we she raised her eyebrow which so far was the only change shed made in her expression at least she could take comfort in the fact that she had more control over her body language than he had over his i hadnt noticed you driving any bulldozers lately or have you suddenly turned into a construction worker in the past week he ignored the remark im here to advise these people before they get into something too deep to pull out of were going to vote on whether we should talk to anybody at allwhether we should take everything straight into the courts as a minorities harassment case that way we get protection and bypass all the bullshit a harassment case she was incredulous there was blood spilled out on that site some of his people and hers were dead how could he possibly be thinking of something so petty how dare he reduce this situation to trivialities that was when her temper went the way of her patience this was not a lawclass exercise this was the real world and there were real people who were really dead dammit david she snarled theres more than just a harassment case going on when youve got a body count you jerkoff theres dead people involved here kids whose daddies arent coming home and somebodys responsible for their deaths thats murder in my book and not some twobit legal sideshow she dug into her pocket and came up with a handful of business cards she shoved the cards at him feeling her blood pressure rise with every second when you and the boys get tired of playing indians and cavalry give me a call she said sarcastically maybe then we can start getting things settled and maybe together we can find out whos responsible he didnt take the cards they dropped to the ground at his feet she turned on her heel and walked off so angry she could hardly see she stalked stiffkneed and stiffspined all the way back to the truck threw herself inside started it up and backed out with a spinning of tires and spitting of gravel this time she left tire marks on the road but at the crossroads her temper cooled she pulled over and beat her hands on the steering wheel she wanted to beat her head on itbut that would leave bruises and a bruised forehead would be hard to explain to the folks oh i just ran into david spotted horse and i started beating my head against a wall then again theyd probably accept that good job talldeer she muttered under her breath really good job congratulations you really made your point didnt you damn damn damn why did he have to be there why couldnt it have been some other macho asshole from the rights movement she could have handled a stranger she wouldnt have lost her temper shed handled every flavor and color of macho jerk there was including those of her own people who had accused her openly or veiled of selling out to the white man of being an applered on the outside white on the inside shed done it successfully too if it had just been a stranger but it wasnt a stranger it was him all the old memories all the old attractionall the old baggage if he wasnt such a jerk the hormones gave her another thrill along her nerve endings they didnt care if he was a macho idiot all they knew was that he had been cute and now he was a hunkarama right in the same style and league as some of the gorgeous guys whod been making beautiful scenery in last of the mohicans and dances with wolves yeah it was all still there if he wasnt such a jerk youd be in bed with him in a new york minute she said aloud scolding herself jennifer you are such a pushover jennifer you are such a dope the minute david shows up youve got helium heels she put her head down in her hands and tried to think around the hormones and the anger i was yelling loud enough to be heard in the next county im sure they heard me inside if im lucky someone in there will pick up one of those cards or make david give him one if im really lucky it ii be someone with the sense wahkontah gave a gnat and heii call me if im not lucky im going to have to try and talk one of these guys into hearing me out before he pitches me out on my butt well there was one man who would not be at that meeting at least one of the men whod been injured was still in the hospital and not so drugged up that he couldnt talk larry bushyhead had had something fall on him when the dozer exploded from the tally at the hospital the injuries were cracked ribs and broken ringers but not much else if she left now she could make it before visiting hours were over he wasnt an exemployee either he was a witness to everything that had happened before the explosion he could have some valuable information about the guys whod quit and about what had happened that day and at least he wouldnt be someone who made her hormones prance around like performing dogs the hospital corridor was empty most of the patients on this floor were drugged into happyor at least painfree oblivion theyd turned the corridor lights down for the benefit of those who wanted to sleep i really hate hospitals she thought absently the places always smelled like disinfectant and dead flowers and they were always too cold no wonder the nurses wore sweaters on duty she listened to her own footsteps and the mingled sounds of a dozen tv and radio stations as she walked the empty corridor to a room halfway along its length hi she said cautiously poking her head around the doorframe larry was in a double but there wasnt anyone in the other bed and the nurse on duty said that his wife was out looking for some dinner it was the usual hospital semiprivate larry was in the bed nearest the window and the bathroom hillcrest had their bathrooms on the outside wall rather than the inside the curtains were closed and the tv was off with only the light over his bed still burning this was a good time to talk to him heck it was a great time to talk to him if he felt like talking to her he wouldnt be inhibited by the presence of a roommate or his wife hi he said looking up from the paper he was trying to read from the way hed been squinting at it he wasnt having much luck with it what can i do for you he looked interested at least and not like she was imposing on him she took another step that put her in the doorway now that she was closer there was no doubt of his osage blood tall rangy with dark brown hair and mild eyes that were probably deceptive he looked enough like her father to be a cousin hed gotten someone to bring him real pajamas which was just as well because she figured that tall as he was the hospital gown was just long enough to save him from technical exposure im jennifer talldeer and the insurance company that covers rod calligan hired me to ask some questions she said carefully i promise im not from workmans comp and nothing you tell me will have any effect on your hospitalization do you feel like answering them if you dont ill be happy to leave you in peace but if you do it might clear up a lot of things i feel like just about anything other than watching a rerun or trying to read this paper he said giving her a wan but friendly grin they gave me a little stuff for the pain and it makes fine print damn hard to read just dont make me laugh or ask me to shake hands okay as he put the paper down she saw that three of the fingers on his right hand were splinted and bandaged so i got lucky davidwise either he doesnt like being bossed around by anyone whether or not theyre an activist or they just havent gotten to him yet encouraged she entered his room and took a seat beside the bed id like to start with some questions about some of the guys who quit she said was there bad blood between them and their boss bushyhead thought about her question for a moment then shook his head not really a couple of them got better offers from the state a couple got longterm offers from a road crew and a couple of them just couldnt stomach plowing up good animal habitat for a stupid mall and went off to see if anyone else had a job opening but i didnt ever hear any of them badmouthing him they all got other work and i hang out with most of them off and on so there were no threats against the company that you know of she asked threats his surprise was genuine hell no not that i ever heard of definitely not from the guys that quit what about outsiders she asked you know there were a lot of protests over the choice of site he nodded i signed the petition but once the county signed off there was never anything seriously said or done no threats and thats for sure or id have heard about that too she gave him a skeptical look and he grinned i sweettalk the secretary get her lunch sometimes so shell let me know when somethings up she gets the mail first if there were threats id have knownthese days you cant be too careful i worked on a site that got bomb threats once and once was enough for me the wildlife people kept trying to post injunctions but they never went through and that is all i ever heard of you know what with some of the crazies that are out there theres a couple of us thatd think twice about working a site with somebody making threats around he could be bluffinghe could simply be ignorant of what was going on but she didnt think so he had no reason to lie and every reason to tell the truth besides all of her instincts were telling her he was divulging everything he knew she decided to try a different angle do you think you can remember exactly what happened just before all hell broke loose it had occurred to her that he might have noticed something that would tell her what kind of hand had been behind this yeah i think so he nodded i went over this for the cops though im not likely to get access to that she pointed out was there anyone hanging around the site that you noticed no and we kind of watch for that he told her weve had some problems with people pilfering stuff in fact the guys told me this afternoon that the dynamite inventory doesnt match the stores bet thats where the explosives came from did anything odd happen that day she persisted uhi didnt tell the cops this but yeah he was frowning and she asked why well something really bad happened right before the explosion only it wasnt the kind of thing the cops would consider bad he hesitated a moment then gave her a sharp look can i ask you a question first about your family sure she said wondering what had caused the look but getting the feeling in her bones that he was about to tell her something very important i dont see why not is your grandfather the talldeer thats the medicine man despite being fogged by drugs he was watching her very closelyand the question startled her a little and increased the feeling of urgency well yes actually she wondered where hed heard of her grandfather and if she should say anything else but he said itfor her so youre the medicine woman the kid hes been teaching he sighed and looked relieved okay youll understand then you know if this had happened the day before the dozer suicided id have been sure somebody had planted a bomb because of itbut it couldnt have been more than a few minutes before he was rambling possibly nerves possibly the drugs probably both but in the ramblings there were important clues suddenly this wasnt just an insurance job she suddenly felt like a hunter who has just heard the warning caw of a crow she stiffened so what did happen she prompted wewe dug up bones he swallowed old bones pots you know what i mean youre saying you found a burial ground i mean one of our grounds she said trying to control the feeling of danger that made her skin crawl there it was out in the open not just some old graveyard from around the land rush days yeah at least thats what we all think he shook his head it really spooked us even the white guys the stuff looked like it might be real old and you know what digging up sacred ground means he was getting more and more agitated the more he thought about it yes she told him i do can i help he brightened at that yeah if you get a chance would you ask your grandfather to come do a cleansing on me not that im superstitious but but youve already had enough trouble no problem she replied mentally hitting a reset button and looking at the situation in a whole new light now it definitely was no longer just an insurance job she had a real soulstake in finding out what had happened and too bad if the cops didnt like her poking around so youahdisturbed relics then what happened we backed off pretty quick you betand we told the foreman we werent gonna dig there he got hot called the boss on the cellular the boss said we by god were gonna dig and what was more we were gonna burn the stuff we found or throw it in the river and not say anything about it he gritted his teeth and it didnt take a shaman to sense his anger he said if we told anybody thered be people from the college and everything coming in and stopping work she grimaced and you were mad i wasnt the only one he said we started arguing and we even got the white guys on our side i was just about to see if i couldnt sneak off and like call the college or something just to delay things when he shrugged she sat silent for a moment so what do you think happened to cause that she asked cautiously welli thought it was just faulty equipment but the guys said it was sabotage my brains say somebody probably planted a bomb in the dozer and god only knows why he shook his head nut cases who can tell with them but my gut she noticed he was sweating and she knew why you know i am really glad youre the medicine woman and all he said and he sounded genuinely grateful anybody else would laugh at me for this butmy gut says it happened because the little people are after his ass and they kind of got us because we were involved you know how they are she did indeed know how they were miahluschka had a mixed reputation vindictive vicious at times you didnt hear anyowlsdid you she asked just before the explosion the miahluschka the little people often took the form of owls not that id noticed but i wasnt noticing a lot except the fight between the foreman and the other dozer driver he sighed thats why id really appreciate it if your grandfather could get on over here you know oh i know she assured him uhwait a minute let me check on something she dug into her purse vaguely remembering that trip to lyons and the one to peace of mind earlier this afternoon some things she always had with her of course but others she didnt necessarily take with her all the time shed picked up some herbs for herself and grandfather as well as the goodies for her father had she taken the packages out of her purse yet no would you accept a medicine woman instead of a medicine man she asked him carefully i wont be offended if youd rather it was grandfather you mean youve got stuff with you bushyhead looked ready to kiss her and a little lightheaded with relief i dont mind telling you with the full moon coming up ive been kind of nervous about sleeping a cleansing was one of the easiest ceremonies to perform there was just one precaution she was going to have to take she took a quick glance into the hallway made certain that the nurse was still deep in her paperwork and closed the door then she climbed up on a chair and stuffed facial tissue into all the openings of the smoke detector ten minutes later the ventilator in the bathroom was clearing out the last of the tobaccoredbudandcedar smoke and the nurse was none the wiser larry bushyhead looked much happier and jennifer was back in her chair her implements neatly stowed back in her purse just as if she hadnt been chanting and wafting smoke around with a redtail feather a few minutes ago if it makes any difference i didnt feel as if they had tagged you she told him but if i were in your shoes id have wanted someone to do the same ii dont suppose you got any kind of a look at what was dug up did you enough to really honestly recognize whose ancestors you were messing with he hesitated frowning im not an expert he said after a long moment and you know how much swapping around there was between the nations even a long time before the white guys took over a guess she urged wellit wasnt cherokee or seminole and it wasnt cado if i was guessingid guess it was our people osage thats what i thought at the time he licked his lips as if theyd gone dry but thats just a guess coulda been sac and fox couldabeen creek or potawatami do you have any idea what happened to those relics she asked because no one has mentioned themand youd think with cops crawling all over the site somebody would have i got two guesses he told her the stuff we first dug up was either blown to bits or buried again and the stuff that didnt get blown to bits calligan probably snuck in and got rid of if he hasnt yet im betting he will all he needs to do is bring in a bunch of white guys who dont give a shit as soon as the cops clear out she nodded thoughtfully and looked at her watch oh hell visiting hours for us nonfamily types are up and right on cue the nurse showed up at the door to remind her of that fact she stood up swinging her purse over her shoulder and gave him her best smile thanks larryyou were a really big help he grinned so were you jennifer she made her way out of the hospital and down to the parking lot only half aware of her surroundings a burial groundwell that certainly explained the trouble sleighbow had mentioned and why she had the feeling that there had been something there the problem was there wasnt supposed to be one there that may not mean anything we havent charted all the old burial sites yet not by a long shot the arkansas wandered around a lot before the floodcontrol and irrigation programs settled it in one bed with all the dredging and dams butright on the riverbank is an awfully odd place to put a burial site especially an old one and there should have been cairns not underground burials the old ones hated underground burials shoot they wouldnt even build the cairns until months after the wind and weather had their way with the dearly departed the ancestors had tried not to put burial grounds anywhere near the arkansas or any other river for just that reasonthere was no telling when it would change its course and wash out the site still if its really old like when the osage got forced down here from the north and they didnt know the arkansas tended to wanderand if it got buried by some accident or other without actually seeing any of the artifacts she had no way of telling how old it was and if that was a possibility with a start she realized that she had reached her truck she opened the door and got in reflexively locking her door again but she didnt move she was still thinking things through really old grounds that had been lost were being rediscovered all the time in the course of development some were even uncovered by digging deeper under a building that had just been demolishedthat was how theyd found that bat statue in mexico not long ago since there hadnt been anything built on that site before maybe it wasnt surprising that no one knew anything about it but that felt wrong somehow it matched the few facts as she knew them but not the feel of the place it felt as if there had been some very powerful very old relics therebut the feeling wastransitory i guess as if they hadnt been there long but that wasnt consistent with the idea of it being a burial ground one thing it did explain though was the definite scent of bad medicine about rod calligan if hed violated sacred ground and then destroyed bones and relics he had definitely incurred the anger of the little people but an osage burial sitethereit just didnt add up maybe if someone ripped the stuff off from another site and cached it there but who and why would they have chosen that place to leave the loot and why didnt they come back for it could there be more caches around the site again if she found anything she would know right away if it was a cache or a graveand that would at least put one question to rest maybe id better go run a quick check on the construction area again and maybe id better go check some of the old burial grounds too the ones out in the boonies one thing was for sure that feeling she got with just her brief glance at rod calligan meant that the little people were after his hideand given how vindictive they could be the hides of everyone else connected with him she shivered at the thought that was not a position that she would want even her worst enemy to be in chapter seven it was a good thing that the traffic was light because she had most of her attention on the possibilities of the miahluschka being involved in all of this the prospect was not one she would have guessed when she took this job miahluschka the little peopledifferent from the other kind of little people the little mysteries that stole breath and made people sickwere not something she wanted to get involved with particularly not if they were very old and very powerful little people and if this burial ground was old enough that her people had even forgotten it existed jeez i cant even talk about this to anyone but grandfather without them thinking ive been drinking too much irish whiskey little people i dont even know what other nations call them id sound like a refugee from a st patricks day parade little people was a poor translation of miahluschka when all was said and done they were spirits some of them were the spirits of those who had not been recognized by wahkontah who had died without paint or been buried in such a way that wahkontah could not see themor worst of all had perished in a way that kept their spirits earthbound executed murdered died in cowardice buried without the proper rites without paint not happy spirits she had seen them once on claremore mound grandfather had sent her there specifically to see them it was part of the trials of becoming a shaman to recognize spirits on sight to face down spirits and learn to deal with them that time they had been mannerly but then she was a woman and it was mostly men who had trouble with the miahluschka of claremore mound who had perished quite horribly at the hands of a band of renegade scum even though they had met her gravely and had not even played any relatively harmless tricks on her she had sensed the power and the possible menace in them and had been glad to accept the token that would tell grandfather she had passed this trial so that she could get back to safer territory according to grandfather there were other kinds of miahluschka too that had never been human but she had never seen any of that kind sometimes miahluschka were only lonelysometimes they were just interested in making trouble of a harmless kind but only sometimes real jekyllandhyde types she knew far too many stories about the little people for her own comfort especially the ones that ended up with someone dead or driven mad but were there ever any stories withohmodern weapons like blowing up bulldozers first time ive ever heard of them planting dynamite on something well what if they were active around the site but not responsible directly for the explosion or what if they were working through someone using a person or persons who already had a grudge against calligan pushing that person over the edge enough to make him commit murder it could happen the one thing she had on her side was that it was very difficult for them to work in the daytime and the time they worked best was during the full moon that would give her some margin of safety to go check the site out a little more closely she pulled up at a traffic light and began tapping her fingers on the steering wheel in a drum pattern the little people would be handicapped if they were operating against someone who not only was not osage but wasnt even a native american still if this particular lot was very old and very powerful they might be able to work right through that nonbeliever resistance and every time they succeeded in pulling something off it would make the next strike easier and potentially a lot more deadly if this line of reasoning was true wellit meant that the explosion was not the end but was only the beginning there would be more incidents unless she could pacify them more things for which mortal humans might be blamed now she was very glad shed smudged larry bushyhead down if the miahluschka were on the trail of his boss they might be inclined to take out believer targets first if they had picked up the magicalscent of calligan when the first dozer unearthed the relics they would not let go of the trail his workers his wife his family they would all be fair game they would have his scent as well and as arbitrary as they were sometimes the little people might just start sniping at random honking behind her jarred her out of her reverie the light had changed and she was still sitting there like a dope flushing furiously she tapped the accelerator and moved into the intersection shoot the little people could be causing all kinds of accidents that i dont even know about things likemaking a driver see a green light when its actually red or wahkontah give me patience sending david here to get those poor guys into more trouble by thinking hes getting them out of it that would be like the miahluschka too she thought sourly get everyone entangled in a big mess what would be worse going to jail for something you didnt door getting flattened at an intersection and which would those construction workers pick me id prefer to get flattened the idea of a prison cell gives me the creeps she turned down her own street several blocks earlier than she usually did the stop signs were all facing her direction along here and if she was going to go all fogbrained better to go along here than on the busier street small brickandframe houses lined both sides of the street set back under trees that dated back to the thirties the street looked very safe and suburban without the sterility of the modern subdivisions little porch lights gleamed warmly down on curved sidewalks and small porches with a chair or porch swing waiting no kids out tonight just as well given her inattentiveness right now if i want to see if theres little people out there on that sitedamn it all im going to have to go out there at night i dont want to see but i have to find out i might as well go tonight or tomorrow before the full moon if they catch me while they are not at full power i can probably convince them im on their side but she had no intentions of prowling around a place where the little people had any chance of appearing without some special preparations momma didnt raise any stupid children oh no besides what was the use of being the student of a medicine man if you couldnt ask his advice the driveway loomed up much faster than she had expected it to and she overshot she backed up slowly making certain there werent any kids playing in the street before doing so and pulled the truck in as neatly as she could the unmistakable scent of pizza greeted her nose as soon as she opened the door dont try to hide it i already smelled it she shouted closing the door behind her and walking into the living room as she had expected grandfather sat in front of the television watching cnn a dominos box in front of him and a halfeaten slice of pepperoni still in his hand he looked up at her with his beady black eyes and grinned without a trace of guilt you know very well that my cholesterol count was fine the last time we had it checked he said and besides i was hungry and you werent here to fix me anything as if you arent a better cook than i am she retorted then threw up her hands in defeat all right i give up i just hope you saved me some of that he smiled again affectionately i knew youd be hungry too the past two days you havent had a single proper meal you work too much and eat too little he picked up the first box to reveal a second and opened it up tilting it to show her another intact pizza mushrooms and black olives your favorite all for you and i made apple cobbler for later youre never going to find a husband if you look like a stick she helped herself to napkins and a fat slice he was right she was starving and right now she would have eaten the cardboard if thered been cheese on it what are you jewish now she jibed and mimicked a thick new york accent eat eat eat youre too thin how you gonna get a husband you so thin so maybe theyve got the right idea about some things he chuckled and put another couple of slices on a paper plate for her theres french vanilla ice cream to go with that cobbler jennifer suppressed a groan she was never going to be able to resist that combination she had been even hungrier than she had thought she inhaled the first slice and looked longingly at the rest before licking her fingers clean and opening the mail it was a good mail day two checks one from a divorce case and one from a client whose steakhouse was being pilfered that would take care of a couple of bills while she worked this thing this thing she picked up her second piece of pizza and cleared her throat and grandfather looked up quickly the insurance case she began you smudged someone he replied before she could find the right words i smelled it on your clothes when you came in so it isnt justan insurance thing anymore right now its a medicine thing too she sighed with relief he had gone completely serious on her every inch the shaman right exactly let me give it to you as i got it so you can see the path i was following he kept quiet as she related the entire story from the beginning only pursing his lips from time to time without interrupting her so he sat quietly thinking for a moment i have to admit that i have never heard of that particular place being a burial site before of course i dont know everything and there have been plenty of things lost to us besides the locations of burial grounds still i think youre right i think that this business with the relics is very bad and i would not be in the least surprised to find that the miahluschka have been aroused oh hell i was afraid youd say that she finished her meal and wiped her fingers clean before settling back in the chair i wish i knew what else to make of this half the facts i have make calligan look like a bad guy and the other half make him look like some bozo who was just doing something stupid and incredibly selfish stupidity on one persons part shouldnt be punished by blowing up other people selfishness is generally its own punishment sooner or later on the whole if calligan did plow up a burial ground and order the relics destroyed i think a hefty fine from some kind of government agency and a bad mark on his record would do everyone a lot more good than setting the little people on him and where the devil did that bomb come from the little people never went around planting bombs before that i ever heard of grandfather shook his head i dont know what to make of that either if you are thinking that you need to get deeply involved in this because of the blood spilled thoughwell you are right it is your duty and not only to your own people murder must be balanced he tilted his head to one side and continued very gently this time i am afraid that you made some very serious mistakes in the way you handled young david though little bird you may have made an enemy out of him you certainly shamed him before the other young men he was never very good at dealing with blows to his pride before and i doubt that he has improved with the passage of time the young men he has taken as his mentors have the towering pride of most young hotheads and it bruises easily i didnt make him my enemy she said rather sourly he did that all by himself hed already made up his mind before i ever got there and he never was one to let facts get in the way of a good opinion true mooncrow nodded i suspect that you are going to have to go to this construction site yourself either tonight or tomorrow night to see if the miahluschka really are out there i would suggest tomorrow night very very strongly you will need a ceremony to prepare and protect you and it will take more time than we really have tonight i think that tonight you should simply cleanse yourself you have had many stresses today and you are not thinking clearly he had been very serious right up until that moment but suddenly the impish twinkle in his eye warned her that he was about to zing her you know i could show you the osage blanket ritual he leered it would help you the way you are right now thank you o wise one o wisest of the little old men she said with heavy irony just like a man suggesting that the cure for all my problems is a good medicinal fuck in a way she had hoped to shock him a little with the vulgarity she was doomed to disappointment he chuckled and continued to chuckle as she made her way back to her room just as she reached it the phone rang she reached for it automatically before mooncrows warning its david could stop her in time to let the machine get it talldeer she said in as neutral a voice as she could she didnt bother to wonder how grandfather had known who it was that was why he was the shaman and she was the apprentice home already david said in a voice dripping with sarcasm or couldnt you find anyone whod fink for you grow the hell up david she replied wearily and hung up before he could launch into a tirade or a threat she sat down heavily on the side of her bed and took the phone off the hook for a moment while she thought he was not going to leave her alone maybe he had to keep coming at her until she conceded defeat maybe it was more than just pride maybe hed do anything just to renew the contact maybe the hormones were getting to him as badly as they were her and maybe monkeys will fly out of my butt she muttered still she knew that he was not going to give up tonight shed rattled his cage and he was going to have to try to reassert his masculine superiority he was either going to keep calling until hed delivered his threats or he was going to come over in person to deliver them probably on the front lawn at the top of his lungs if she wouldnt let him in the house all right you jerk ill force your hand if youre going to play games youre going to do it on my turf she replaced the phone in its cradle then dialed one of her clients quickly this was a childsupport case and while she didnt strictly have to call angela with the information shed gotten two days ago since shed already turned it over to the states attorney and to angelas own legaleagle it would make angela feel better to hear it from the source besides angela was a regular onewoman talk show she was good for tying up the line for at least fortyfive minutes hello angela she said as her client came on after being pulled away from the golden girls by her daughter listen this is just a followup but i thought i should let you know what i dug up on harry so you can go bug your attorney and the state about this okay yeah i sent the copies to them yesterday so tomorrow or the next day at the latest they should have all the files just as she had figured angela was only too pleased to have someone to talk to there were at least six call waiting beeps as someonedavidtried to ring through she ignored them gleefully finally when there hadnt been any more beeps for at least ten minutes she exited the conversation gracefully reminding angela that they both had to work in the morning and hung up she glanced over at the clock on the nightstand it was she watched the minutehand move at the doorbell rang she got up but only went as far as the living room grandfather gave her an inquiring look and went to answer the door at her nod they both knew who it was david was being david so hard that the walls might just as well have not been there sofirst get him offbalance by having grandfather meet him the bunch of activists he was working with at least had respect for the elders drummed into them three times a day by their leaders seeing grandfather here would probably set him back a peg or two he wouldnt want to be rude around mooncrow and he wouldnt know why mooncrow was living with her when he was obviously ablebodied enough to be on his own she hadnt told david anything about her medicinetraining shed been very reluctant to talk about it for a long timeand then when he might have been interested or at least impressed it had been too late to tell him mooncrow led david into the living room playing the herald with every iota of his dignity and power wrapped around him like an invisible blanket from the odd look on davids face she knew that their first trick had worked he had been startled to find grandfather here he had been even more impressed by mooncrows aura of authority his posture and the way he moved told jennifer that grandfather had asserted himself without saying a single word david spotted horse is here to see you jennifer mooncrow said formally then moved around behind her leaving david standing on his own at the entrance to the hallway as mooncrow faced away from david he gave her a slight wink she took her cue from that and used her own power to augment her presence just as he was doing then grandfather was behind her deferring to her which should have told david that he was walking on dangerous ground but he seemed oblivious to the nuances or else he had made up his mind and was resisting anything that might change it he took another pose scowling trying to intimidate her on my own ground i dont think so i think you said everything you needed to earlier this evening david she said calmly before he could start in on whatever speech hed memorized unless of course you are here to apologize for misjudging me that triggered an explosion of temper the scowl turned into a glare and the warrior lost his cool apologize for what look womani came here to give you one warning she pulled her head up and stopped him with a look behind her she sensed her grandfather doing the same but this was her show most of the power was coming from her what mooncrow was doing was only enough to show solidarity and later when david thought all this over that might shake him up some too enough to make him really think not likely but ill have given him his chance first of all she said into the heavy silence i am not the enemy i do not know what is going on over there thats what i was hired to find out i am neither judge nor jury i am impartial investigator if the men working for calligan are innocent they have nothing to lose and everything to gain by talking to me i am trained in investigationyou arent and neither are they i may see or hear something with their help that will allow us to find whoever did cause that explosion whats more you seem to be operating under some assumption that im working for the police or some other investigative organization im not the insurance company that hired me doesnt care if those men are innocent or guilty all they want to know is if rod calligan concealed evidence that his company had been threatened before any of this happened that obviously took david aback they dont care theyi get it if calligan was concealing threats it would invalidate his claim right jennifer had to give him credit david could pick up on things quickly if he chose to exactly but there are plenty of people in tulsa who would like to get an easy conviction and if those workers are innocent i might be able to convince some of the cops who are on the case that calligans men had nothing to do with it davids face hardened at that if she let her own face assume the mask of the warrior just what i said if because if theyre not innocent theyd better truck their asses out of town as fast as they can because sooner or later either ill find out what happened or the cops willand if its me ill turn them in i wont lie to you david ill turn in anyone else who uses terrorist tactics and death to make a point his eyes narrowed and his teeth clenched as his temper rose again that makes you a traitor in my book she cut him off this time using the power to choke the words in his throat his mouth worked without anything coming out he was however so angry that he hardly seemed to notice her own temper had reached the snapping point just who the hell am i being a traitor to david spotted horse she snarled she couldnt help but think perhaps with some conceit that her temper was the trained warhorseand his the wild mustang why dont you go take a quick trip over to the morgue before you start on me so far there are four people dead go look at whats left of the damn bodies if you have so much courage i did a fair share of those dead bodies are our people and red or white their blood demands retribution he continued to fight her control of him she released her hold on his words before he really did choke he spluttered for a few minutes before coming out with something coherent your problem is that youve forgotten that youre indian she choked him down again reined in her temper to a walk and gave him a mooncrow look from halflidded eyes oh no i havent forgotten but your problem david spotted horse is that you have forgotten the words of the greatest spiritual leaders of all our nations you have forgotten that we are all human you are cherokee first then indian then human she finally let her temper show just a little it was enough to make him back up an involuntary step when you get your goddamn priorities straight and figure out that it should be the other way around you can talk to me until thenshe gathered her power and sensed mooncrow following her lead get out of my house she pointed and grandfather mirrored her both of them using their power to send david away david tried to fight them his muscles tensed and his face writhed as he tried to stand where he was and continue the argument but it was no use not against the combined force of jennifers anger and mooncrows sheer ability he found himself walking out of the door down the steps and to his car at the edge of their property as a final touch grandfather made the door slam shut behind him she stayed where she was listening for the sounds of his car starting up and pulling away when they finally came she let her temper and her power go taking deep breaths to help her release her anger letting it all run away into the ground then she yelped in outrage as mooncrow pinched her rear she pivoted to see him several steps away too far away to have touched her physically the old goat with his arms folded grinning like a coyote about that blanket ritual he prompted puckishly when i can take you on a genuine osage snipe hunt she snorted then he laughed and she headed back to her room to finish cooling off for the next hour or so she sat quietly in the middle of her room relaxing every muscle and nerve trying to get rid of that incredible buildup of tension there was more there than she had guessed was david making her that angry or was it something deeper than that and along with the anger she was having to deal with a very sexual electricity a force that had sprang up between them even while she was facing him down as if he were an enemy which might just be the reason why grandfather had made that jab odd when i was really small grandfather was very open about everything never avoided any subject then when i hit puberty and i was feeling touchy and shaky about anything sexual he kept things very lowkey and very clinical and never brought it up unless i did he never said anything about david or saul or even ridge and i thought for sure hed have a few choice comments about ridge but now especially lately its like living with a new york street crew hes flinging innuendoes at me all the time why is it because i can handle it now or is he trying to tell me something like maybe i could use a good therapeutic she shook her head and bit her lip no it cant be that simple mooncrow had not said or done anything simple for the past four or five years whatever he was trying to tell her it must be something else entirely she shook her head loosening her neck muscles maybe hes trying to tell me i should become a nun she thought wryly shoot i might as well for all the action ive had lately the safest sex there isnone now she was feeling sorry for herself any more and shed start playing morrissey records sauna then shower just sauna simple steaming out of nerves and anger no sweatlodge stuff then ill see if i cant get some direction in dreams the sauna made her relax in spite of her tension and the shower turned to massage setting pounded out every muscle in her neck shoulders and back she concentrated on making everything that was bothering her wash out with the water and run down the drain in one of the oldest cleansing rituals there was her people had always been ones for cleansing by water both spiritually and physically that was one reason why they always tried to camp beside running water even in the dead of winter osages would bathe breaking the ice to take a bath glad im not living back then id never survive a winter the missionaries had been appalled they had been certain that so much bathing was immoral she came out of the steamy bathroom to find that mooncrow had anticipated her needs and had left a hot cup ofwell tea wasnt exactly the right word for what was on her bureau it was black so dark it looked like strong coffee redolent with two or three dozen different herbs and plants it was without a doubt exactly what she would need for a minor visionquest among her dreams she lifted the cup in an ironic salute to the electronic beeping in the living room and downed it in as few swallows as she could manage as expected it was absolutely vile with no honey in it to cover the taste grandfather had never believed in disguising bitterness either in medicine or in truth which is why we are so much alike and probably why we get on each others nerves lights out she did not exactly fall asleep but the kind of trance she achieved was much deeper than the kind she had in the sweatlodge this time instead of looking for an answer within herself she took form as an owl rather than a kestrel she needed the senses of a nightflyer she was going to be looking at a world only a little removed from the real in this shape she soared into a sky that was an analog of the real sky over oklahoma the buildings of tulsa loomed beneath her and she kited on the thermals rising from hot asphalt where should i look next that was the question she needed answered she framed her problems carefully in her mind first where should she go for clues not the siteshe already knew she would have to make a careful examination there but where else should she look somewhere out there was evidenceand it might not be in obvious places brothers sisters show me the places that are not obvious i have a shattered jar and only a few of the pieces show me the places where some of the pieces might be although in the real world it was still night dawnred crept into the eastern sky without thinking she shifted from owl to kestrel for now she was completely in the spirit world and now she did not need the special nightvision of an owl she widened the circle of her hunt below her the landscape blurred and shifted her prayer had been heard movement below her caught her eye a pair of redtail hawks crying out over a despoiled nest in this world there were always deeper meanings to things that seemed obvious there was a deeper meaning to this than a hawk pair who had lost their nest to some interfering human and the redtail was above all other birds the sacred bird to the osage it was the redtail whose skin went into the sacred wahhopeh shrine the redtail whose tail feathers were as red as the sun at dawn and sunset and the redtail who told the osage when it was to be war or peace soshe folded her wings and dropped lower the hawks faded the nest became a shrine one of the sacred wahhopeh shrines of woven grass that housed the hawk that guided her people the shrine had been broken into and the pieces scattered she kited closer the broken shrine became landscape roads and hills that she recognized a house and several barns a place up near rose a burial ground that was on private property a place she recognized with a feeling of personal violation her ancestors were buried here most of the osage in the area knew about this place though no one was likely to talk about it to an outsider she wasnt certain whether to curse or be perversely pleased this probably meant that the relics that had been bulldozed up had not been buried there originally which meant that this might be a case of two crimes and two criminals one graverobber and one terrorist or another thought what if the graverobber had cached his stolen relics and had blown up the dozer to prevent them from being uncovered the idea had enough merit that even if it wasnt true she might be able to get the cops to take an interest in it and take some of the heat off the construction workers and the local activists at least for a while she beat her wings rapidly to take her up into the sky again and resumed her quest she might get more answers she might not but in either case now she had another place to start looking and she had until morning to keep asking brothers sisters where should i look next chapter eight toni calligan kept glancing apprehensively at the closed door of rods office every time she went past it going between the kitchen the utility room and the kids rooms and not only glancing at it but hurrying past it as quickly as she could without actually running it gave her the creepiest feeling as if there was something lurking behind the door listening to her waiting for her to turn her back on it its the boxes she thought burdened with an armload of clothing from the hamper in jills room wishing that rod had never brought the things in the house its whatevers in those boxes i keep having bad dreams about them i feel like im in a grade b horror movie and rod is the evil scientist whos brought his work home with him ever since he dragged those boxes home i keep getting the feeling that there is something in his office that is watching me laughing at me waiting for me to walk in there so it can get me this was not rational and she knew it there was probably nothing in those boxes but old papers if she told rod how she felt hed laugh at her in that way that made her feel about ten years old she began sorting laundry with one ear listening for rod or if hes had a bad day he ii have a fit and chew me out until i feel as if i was six years old and mentally retarded to boot it would depend on how he felt well everything depended on how rod felt rod was the center of this little household universe and everything revolved around him that was why toni didnt have a job although she had been a good executive secretary and had enjoyed the work rod had been so masterful he had taken her out for dates never accepting no for an answer he had proposed and made all the wedding plans he had insisted she quit her job immediately and for a while she had enjoyed feeling dependent leaving all the decisions to him now she simply endured it because that was the way it was and rod was a good provider he always bought the best for her and the kids he never raised a hand to any of them independence was a small price to pay for that kind of security and if he was kind of finicky about thingsif he was kind of demandingwell he had earned it hadnt he look at all the good things he provided for them so what if every moment of her waking hours was spent literally serving him if she had to be available for whatever rod might need whether it be secretarial services dinner or whatever else he might require her job rod had explained very carefully many times until toni could recite the entire lecture by heart was him even the kids were secondary since they were only extensions of him this is a cutthroat business i have to be like a surgeon i have to know that an instrument is there waiting for me when i put out my hand for it you have to be the nurse that hands me the instruments things have to be perfect at home so i can keep my mind on my work or the work wont get done its your job your fulltime job to keep them perfect how could she argue with that he worked hard and it was a cutthroat business all kinds of things could be problems for him things she hadnt even dreamed of you married the business when you married me she must be sure that neither she nor the kids were anything other than a credit to him that they didnt ever embarrass him that people would look at him and envy him because in the construction business an impression was everything and the impression she and the kids made could gain or lose him a job he had to know that if he brought a client home unexpectedly the house would be spotless the yard picked up and trimmed the dinner ready and waiting the kids well behaved and quiet always there was no room for weakness no vacations no timeouts if the kids were sick they must be out of the way where they wouldnt interfere with business if she was sick she must not show it not that he had ever brought home a client unexpectedly there was usually so much fuss over a clients appearance that anyone would think he never she were visiting royalty and his office must be twice as perfect as the house itself everything must be squeaky clean dusted and polished every paper filed every note attached to every file he must be able to put his hands on anything he needed at any time so why had he brought home those four filthy cardboard boxesand why was he keeping them in his office no client was going to be impressed with them in there smelling all musty stained with oil and dirt and looking as if he had pulled them out of some farmers chicken coop not that she wanted to get near them even to clean ever since hed brought the things home shed cleaned around them shed even been afraid to let the vacuum touch them she hated to open the office door but left it open during the day because she hated the feeling that something was hiding behind the door even more and now the kids had started getting bad dreams too not so much rod junior but the youngest two ryan and jill in particular had been waking up in the middle of the night for the past three nights running they couldnt even describe their dreams but if they had been anything like hers there wasnt much to describejust dark shapes looming up out of the dark to grab and a feeling of absolute terror and despair but they did keep mentioning the boxes and she knew she hadnt said anything about the boxes in the office so there had to be some other explanation for why the three of them felt so uneasy around the things maybe its just that theyre so much like me she thought trying to keep her mind on sorting the laundry properly one time shed gotten a single red sock mixed up with the whites and had spent the rest of the day with a bowl of color remover bleaching out each article carefully so that nothing was damaged maybe theyre just picking it all up from me it was true enough that there was no doubt whose kids the two youngest were they looked so much like toni that it was uncanny maybe theyre just good at reading my body language and im jumpy so theyre getting jumpy certainly rod junior who looked as much like his dad as ryan and jill looked like toni hadnt had any nightmares lately maybe it was all her imagination maybe she was letting her nerves run away with her it was easier to believe that than to believe there was some kind of malevolent force penned up in those boxes in rods office cant say anything it all sounds so stupid and the one thing that rod absolutely would not forgive was any hint of what he called nerves he wouldnt even say the words nervous breakdown he didnt believe in any such thinglike the old british generals who had men shot in world war i for showing fear if she ever gave him a reason to think that she was suffering from nerves well she didnt know what hed do certainly there would be no visits to psychiatrists or helpful prescriptions of drugs he hated and despised psychiatrists and loathed the very idea of medicating what should be taken care of by willpower alone at least that was what he told her she had one ear cocked for her morning signals and heard the bathroom door open and shut again she dropped the tshirt shed picked up and hurried back into the kitchen past the door then with a sigh of relief she reached the safe haven of the kitchen itself quickly she broke eggs into a pan started the toaster heated precooked bacon in the microwave as rod settled into his chair paper in one hand she put a cup of coffee into his free hand and slid the plate of bacon eggs and toast onto the table in front of him hed eaten exactly the same breakfast every morning for the past twelve years two fried eggs four strips of bacon two pieces of buttered toast one cup of black coffee he had not noticed when she had substituted the precooked bacon for his freshly cooked bacon so that saved her one step at least he read the paper steadily eating and drinking with one hand oblivious to her orseemingly oblivious if she had done something wrong had made scrambled eggs instead of fried or burned the toast he would have delivered a lecture on her job her duty that was as bad as a beating while she stood there flushing with shame rod didnt cut himself or anyone else any slack as he always pointed out at the end of the lecture the three kids slid quietly into their chairs while rod ate and read ryan got his wheaties jill her frosted flakes and rod junior his breakfast identical in every way to his fathers except for the coffee all three kids got orange juice and milk by rods orders but this morning ryan and jill seemed fidgety all three ate in silence until rod finally put down the paper but the two youngest were obviously waiting for the few seconds when rod would give them his attention before he went off to work suddenly it occurred to her what they might want to ask him about oh nothey arent going to ask him about the boxes in the office are they i should have warned them but it was too late now uhdad ryan said hesitantly dad is there something in your office something bad for a moment toni would have sworn that rod was startled but the next minute she thought she must have been seeing things he wore the same bored impatient look he always wore when he had to deal with ryan or jill no he said shortly there is nothing in my office bad or otherwise what makes you say something that stupid ryan winced but continued bravely on its just that jill and me jill and i toni corrected automatically ryan gave her an oh mom look but corrected himself jill and i weve been getting nightmares about something in your office something awful she suppressed a wince knowing what was going to happen when the kids said or did something outoftime it always came back to her and as expected rod rounded on toni frowning what the hell have you been telling these kids he asked accusingly she shook her head helplessly and spread her hands placatingly nothing she protested weakly nothing at all i dont then youve been letting them watch too damn many horror movies on cable he interrupted irritably stephen king dracula aliens christ almighty no wonder the kids are having nightmares every time i turn on the tv theres a bucket of blood spilling across the screen dont you ever check to see what theyre watching what kind of a mother are you anyway it was no use to protest that the kids only watched what he approved that he himself was the one who selected the programs hed simply accuse her of letting them watch things behind his back and she had no way to prove that she wasnt doing anything of the kind thats it he said slamming his hand down on the tabletop making them all jump no more cable tv unless im here to supervise what youre watching jill opened her mouth to protest but fortunately toni managed to silence her with a look poor jill no more afterschool nickelodeon what are we allowed ryan began timidly rod hit his head with the heel of his hand do i have to tell you kids everything you can go outside and play dammit you kids spend too much time in front of that thing anyway you can play nintendo if its bad you can even watch a movie from your special cabinet his voice became heavy with irony you might even actually read a bookor fun i know that may sound impossible but people do read for fun but no matter what no more cable tv unless im here to supervise toni carefully refrained from pointing out that there were horror books too and it was hardly fair to take that tone with ryan who if not a bookworm was certainly a good reader she just bowed her head submissively and murmured something conciliatory rod junior kept right on with his breakfast ignoring the whole thing rod finally turned to him after a moment and asked and what about you son any stupid nightmares rod looked up first at her then at his younger siblings and shook his head nightmares are for babies he said contemptuously polishing off the last of his eggs rod gave her a there you see kind of triumphant glance as if that had proved something presumably that she should have somehow trained the younger kids out of nightmares by now weaned them away from bad dreams as if she were toilettraining them all it proves is that rod is his fathers child and that rod junior knew how to say the things that his father wanted to hear young rod was rods unconcealed favorite he succeeded at the things rod senior thought were important he had learned how to parrot every opinion his father had whether he understood it or not but most of all it proved that he hadnt a gram of imagination of course he doesn t have nightmares he doesnt have enough imagination to produce them but she could hardly say that to rod who spoiled the boy something awful or even if she didimagination wasnt the kind of thing that rod valued guts smarts brains gumptionall those mattered not sensitivity or imagination she wondered what that little i dont believe in nightmares remark was going to earn rod junior this time every time he came up with some comment that showed how much like his father he was he generally got a reward by the end of the day probably the cd player hed been wanting not that the other two had any real use for a cd player but rod juniors room was stuffed full of the toys and treats his father brought him every time he said something his father considered clever or in other words proved himself to be a copy of rod it happened at least once a week and it wasnt fair to the other two she sighed though strictly internally but life isnt fair theyre just learning that a little early i think its time to change the subject before he starts in on ryan and jill rod i hate to bother youshe always began her requests with that phrasebut the dryer is getting unreliable id really like to call a repairman to come and look at is it still running he asked folding his paper neatly next he would get up put on his suit jacket and tuck the paper in the inside pocket then head for the office she made a little grimace of doubt well yes it is but is it making any noises he continued standing up his own face reflecting his impatience again she hesitated well no butlast night i thought i smelled you didnt smell anything he said interrupting impatiently you imagined it i was right here last night and i didnt smell anything if i didnt smell anything then neither did you or if you did it was probably just some lint overheating clean the lintcatcher once in a while ill look at it later yes rod she sighed as he shrugged on his coat and headed out the door a moment later he pulled his car out of the garage down the driveway and was gone she began picking up the breakfast dishes and setting them into the dishwasher school had only been out for about a week but already the kids had established their summer routines jill wandered back down the hall to her room rod junior went out to ride his bike ryan stayed with her to help she smiled at him and hugged him comfortingly he still looked disturbed and unhappy and not just from his fathers unkind words but her mind was on other things now its a good thing i turned off the dryer last night when i thought i smelled something burning and remembered to unplug it first thing this morning she thought closing the dishwasher and starting it with an electric dryer you cant always be sure its off unless you unplug it i guess ill just have to dry clothes on the line outside until he gets around to looking at it i wish hed let me call a repairman actually she wished hed let her buy a new dryer one with some of those special settings for delicate things like rods silk shirts and a door rack for the kids sneakers there was always enough money for new suits but never anything for a new dryer probably because he didnt have anything to do with the dryer mommy she jumped as if shocked the shriek was jills and it was full of terror mommy fire her heart bounded into her throat she came out of her trance of shock dropped the butterdish shed been holding and ran for the utility room but ryan streaked past her and into the hall something large and red in his hands the fire extinguisher from the kitchen under the sink hed been closest to it the smoke alarm went off shrilling in her ears galvanizing her with fear as jill broke into a wail of her own momeeeeeeeeeeee her mind was stuck on hold but her hands and body acted without any direction from her gibbering mind as she reached the utility room and grabbed the extinguisher beside the door ryan was already emptying his own extinguisher on the blaze eating into the wallboard behind the dryer jill wailed in terror plastered against the back wall of the utility room clutching her stuffed bunny thats right the bunny was still in the dryer my god she could have been electrocuted toni joined her son playing the chemicals from the extinguisher on the blaze amazed that her hands and his were so steady doubly amazed that he had such enormous presence of mind for a tenyearold if he had just been a little taller he could have reached over the dryer as she was doing and sprayed down behind it from the looks of things hed actually tried then given up keeping his spray on the areas he could reach but he had given her the extra few seconds she needed confining the fire to the area in back of the dryer keeping it from spreading any further until she could really put it out the last of the flames died the plug still in the wall socket spat a spark she dropped her now empty extinguisher wrapped a rubber glove around the cord and yanked pulling it free of the wall then she fell to her knees gathered both her precious babies in her arms and the three of them laughed and cried in fear and relief then she called the fire department told them what had happened and had them send a truck over to make certain that the fire hadnt somehow gotten in between the walls it made for quite a bit of excitement in the normally quiet neighborhood rod junior came streaking in on his bike after the truck and was nearly beside himself when he realized it was coming to his house the first thing he wanted to know was if his room was all right and predictably by the time the truck left rod junior had usurped ryans place in the tale of how the fire had been extinguished at least where his peers were concerned it was only after the firemen had checked and found the house safe only after they had made certain that it was the dryer plug and not the outlet that had shorted out and only after she had called and left a message with rods service about the accident that she had time to think and remember she had pulled the plug out of the wall this morning just before she started sorting laundry rod never went into the utility room and the kids couldnt possibly have reached it to plug it back in she had pulled the plug out of the wall she had made absolutely certain to do so in case one of the kids might go swimming at the neighbors and throw a wet bathing suit into the dryer before she got a chance to stop them so who had plugged it back in jennifer loved driving in the early morning at this time of the year mornings in june were just warm enough to be comfortable and not so hot that you needed the air conditioner in julyin july you would the temperature often didnt drop below eighty and sometimes stayed in the nineties until two or three in the morning but in junethe air was full of flower scent and bird song scissortailed flycatchers were performing wild acrobatic maneuvers in pursuit of bugs and mockingbirds informed the rest of the universe that they knew every birds song there was cows grazed placidly kneedeep in ridiculously green grass with adorable calves frisking alongside in june the entire state looked like a travel brochure or scenes from green grow the lilacs not from the musical oklahoma that came from the play though the musical had been filmed by people who knew nothing about oklahoma and had perpetuated the myth of oklahoma land of flat and treeless where did they think all the wood came from to build all those wooden farmhouses anyway hollywood im surprised they didn t film lawrence of arabia in the middle of the serengeti plain it was going to be such a nice day that she had packed a lunch half a dozen apples and some cheese not only was this part of oklahoma anything but flat and treeless once jennifer got outside the city limits of tulsa the landscape looked a lot more like brown county in indiana than anything in oklahoma the movie long rolling hills high sandstone ridges topped with blackjack oaks redtail hawks soaring above the highway looking for roadkill she tuned her radio to something she could sing along with and resolutely enjoyed the drive because she was probably not going to enjoy the march across country to get to the burial ground the farther north of tulsa she got the more rugged the country became and the fewer the inhabited farmhouses a lot of farmers had given up in the last ten or twenty years had sold out to bigger ranchers or just let the land go to the bank this kind of land was no good for anything but cattle really full of stones hard to clear hard to plow and utterly unforgiving in the years without much rain selfishly she was pleased the cattle could graze under the blackjacks without disturbing the general balance of nature too much the land was going back to the kind of territory her people had known and roamed there seemed to be more redtails this spring than ever before she saw them perched every mile or so on top of telephone poles or in the tops of snags the old dead blackjacks that simply hadnt fallen down yet this was not farmland as people in the north or east or even south were used to thinking of farming land even during the dust bowl this part of oklahoma had not been affected much because it had not been cleared much this was almost all grazing land wild and hilly overgrown with poison ivy sumac tangles of wild blackberry vines and wild plum thickets with thorns as long as a thumb the blackjack oak reigned supreme here a tree that was as tough and hard to kill as the osage that used to call this land their home blackjacks seldom grew tall enough to attract lightning except on the sandstone ridges their thick rutted bark resisted penetration and the tannin in their leaves and bark discouraged insects their allies were the woodpeckers redbellied and downy who probed their bark for boring insects persistent enough to stomach a bellyful of bitter tannin in return they sheltered birds of all kinds all through the winter with leaves that turned brown but didnt fall until they were pushed off in the spring by new growth and branches that bent down toward the ground in a prickly snarled tangle that left protected predatorfree spaces around the trunks it was hard to penetrate country like this on foot jennifer wished she knew someone out here with a horse unfortunately the owner of the property didnt have one if groves of blackjacks didnt block your way in the open spaces between the groves huge thickets of wild plum made it impossible to pass and where they didnt grow vines of honeysuckle waited to trip you and wild blackberry bushes were perfectly prepared to act like tangles of barbed wire it looked lovely from the car but jennifer was not looking forward to forcing her way in to where the burial ground lay in all probability if it had been raided the farmer on whose land it lay would not know out here people often didnt bother checking over rough parts of their wooded pasturage on foot unless there was an animal missing and even thenwell ranchers and farmers werent dumb they quickly adopted every technological aid they could afford and get their hands on and these days there were plenty of folks who checked over their herds from treetop level in ultralight aircraft you could even do some limited herding with an ultralight shed been told the cattle didnt much like their noisy twostroke engines and would often move away from a circling farmer ask at the house she thought with resignation as she approached the tiny village of rose population less than one hundred hut hell probably just tell me id better check for myself tom ware was home and getting ready to clean out his henhouse and spray for mites when she pulled into his driveway and he said exactly what she thought hed say shoot havent been anywhere near that section since deer season he replied his eyes crinkling up with worry he pushed his hat back with his thumb and squinted in the direction of the burial ground grimacing i didnt put any cows out there this year figured id let the ground rest for a year shoot the ancestors arent gonna like it if someones been gettin in there ware was osage although his family had long since adopted christianity but even though he didnt follow the old ways he respected them and respected jennifer and mooncrow part of the reason hed bought the ridge when it came up for sale years ago was to protect the old burial ground while jennifer shrugged and made an answering grimace he seemed to be making up his mind about something look he said finally its not easy gettin back in there i just broke a ridin mule last fall for deer huntin you want to saddle her up and use her i reckon she could use the exercise well that was going to make her job a hundred times easier thanks tom i would really appreciate that she said gratefully just tell me where the tack is im not so green i cant round her up and saddle her myself toms eyes crinkled up again but this time with amusement i dunno about that miz talldeer he said clearly holding in chuckles at the idea of her bringing in his mule she hasnt been under saddle much since fall she went ahead and laughed but im my grandfathers granddaughter she pointed out ill save you some work if i can and if she wont behave i promise at least that i wont spook her and send her into the next county still looking amused and dubious tom ware showed her where he kept the saddle blanket and bridle then went on with his planned work jennifer took only the bridle with her when she went out into the field where the mule stood ears up under a tree watching her from the middle of a cluster of very pregnant nanny goats jennifer looked fixedly at the mules tailit being bad manners to stare any animal directly in the eyesand relaxed putting her mind in that peculiar state where she saw not only the mule but mule sister she thought when mule flicked her ears in acknowledgement of kestrels presence sister will you help me i need this younger sisters strong back and thick skin to get to the sacred ground mule considered this for a moment will there be an apple she asked finally on behalf of toms realworld mule practical like all mules two apples jennifer promised upping the ante mules jaw worked at the thought yes mule replied after time to think about the effort involved in terms of reward that was after all how mules operated and why they had such a reputation for stubbornness as mule walked forward out of the herd of goats she dwindled and became tom wares old riding mule responding to jennifers whistling and coaxing she bent her head to take the bridle and even accepted the bit with good graces as jennifer led her to the shed that held the rest of the tack tom ware came out of the chicken coop and his eyes widened well ill be he said with admiration you are the old mans granddaughter never could see a critter that could resist him i just promised her apples jennifer replied laughing good thing i brought some with me the mule remained well mannered mindful of the promised apples and didnt even blow herself up to keep the girth loosean alltoocommon trick mules and horses alike liked to play on inexperienced riders within ten minutes jennifer was in the saddle guiding the mule in the general direction of the ridge but letting her pick her own way mules were better at avoiding tangles than any human and had more experience threading their way through dense undergrowth ask anyone whos tried to catch one that didnt want to be caught it was just a good thing that since time immemorial mule never could resist a bribe she had more than enough to worry about at the moment because there was one particular section of this burial land that only she and grandfather knew about there was only one very ancient cairn thereand even someone who knew about this site would probably not know about this particular grave her vision had not been specific last night it had only indicated that resting places had been looted and not whose she was hoping against hope that this one had not been found it was a very special cairn covering a very special person mohshonahketa watchesovertheland her ancestor from the days when heavy eyebrows first came up the river the shaman who had a vision of things to come that was not believed or if you used kestrels interpretation the shaman who had seen so far forward in time that no one believed what he had seen simply because their visions had not been of a future so distant and so wide watchesovertheland had seen something of what was to come and what was currently happening far to the east the encroachment of the heavy eyebrows and long knives driving other peoples before them the loss of territory the plagues of smallpox and typhoid further loss of territory the end of the great buffalo herds on which the osage way of life depended and worst of allthat the old medicine ways would no longer protect the children of the middle waters at first he himself had not believed these things at that time the heavy eyebrows came as admiring postulants seeking furs and protection from the tall osage warriors there were no other peoples who could stand against them when they met in warbands of two or more gentes and they roamed a territory that stretched from what became illinois right down to the texas border and from arkansas to almost colorado how could people who regularly defeated the sac and fox whom they called the hardtokillpeople warriors who drove the cado right down into texas ever be defeated but the visions came again and again and more terrible in detail each time he determined to do two things first that he would learn all the medicine ways of the osage in order to save as much as he could and second that his children and theirs would learn to hide among the heavy eyebrows as easily as he hid among the trees so he sent out his son watseta to the heavy eyebrows traders to learn of them the one trade that all heavy eyebrows needed so that they would not scorn to bring money and work to a redskin so watseta became both mohsenumpa iron necklace and tom deer blacksmith he let his roach grow out and hid his features under a bluffpaint of soot and he learned two trades that of the smith and that of the shaman as quickly as watchesovertheland learned the medicines of a clan and gente so quickly did tom deer his son until as many of the medicines as could be learned were learned both had become medicine chiefs and watchesovertheland left his land and people for the other country tom deer taught his sons both trades his son james deer saw the warning signs that his grandfather had spoken of and took his family out into the world of the heavy eyebrows for a time when they returned the whites thought that he was one of them he settled on the reservation as an outsider and only the osage themselves knew that he was not when the time came to register he did not nor did any of his descendants all of whom were sunday christians and practiced their osage ways in secret as a result they lost their share of the oil money that finally came in belated payment for all of the land that had been stolen the brothers and sisters slaughtered for hides and poor compensation for an entire way of life lost that was not in jamess time but kestrel doubted he would have cared the money was not enough not nearly enough apologies at least would have been in order and were still not forthcoming from the government that had robbed so many of so much last night mooncrow had imparted another bit of tradition to his granddaughter it seemed that james deer had also begun another project mandated by watchesovertheland he was the one who had begun changing the medicine ways he had learned until once again they began to work that was not the traditional path of the osage the osage way was not to change but to add to a medicine path like a spider adding to a web making it ever more complex but watchesovertheland had seen that this would not serve and had charged his family with finding new ways borrowing from other peoples but keeping the osage ways as the center james was the first mooncrow the latest to follow that mandate instead of spinning a tighter and tighter web the talldeer spiders had descended from the web becoming hunting spiders and yet remaining in all important ways still spiders still osage if other medicine people had received the same visions as watchesovertheland they had not acted on those visions at least not so far as kestrel knew of course i cant claim to know everything even if grandfather would like me to believe that he does there could be plenty more people like me in other nations and like me they are next thing to invisible that was moot the important part was that watchesovertheland had been one of the most powerful medicine men of his time perhaps of any time certainly right up there with wovoka also called crazy horse or any of the other great medicine chiefs he however had chosen rabbits way to hide and be silent in order to preserve things for future generations many of his medicine objects had been laid to rest with him if his resting place had been looted the mule picked her way delicately through a mess of blackberry vines that would have snared jennifer and kept her tangled up for fifteen or twenty minutes she glanced at her watch and was surprised at how little time had passed next time we have to come up here if toms mule isnt available ill find a way to borrow horses or mules from someone else this beats thrashing through the brush all to heck as the mule rounded a stand of blackjacks the ridge jennifer wanted loomed right up in front of them mostly tallgrasscovered slope persimmons grew at the foot young blackjack saplings dotted the slope and the older trees crowned the ridge the slope itself faced west that was what made it perfect for a burial ground especially an old one the osage of the past exposed their dead to the sky and wahkontahfor at least a season to give the spirits time to rise afterwards what was left was placed under a cairn of rocks that was one reason why this ridge was covered with a rubble of small stones over time a lot of soil had settled here some of it blown in from the rest of the state during the dust bowl burying the remains of the cairns and what they protected nature and not man had given these graves a covering of earth the burial site looked no different from any other brushcovered ridge out here and if she hadnt known what it was she would never have been able to pick it out normally she halted the mule and squinted up at the ridge shading her eyes with her hand the damage was obvious as soon as she was able to pick out what was shadow and what was disturbed ground oh hell she nudged her mount forward and up the slope to the site of the looting then pulled the mule up groundtied her and dismounted it was no better at second viewing the shallow graves piled high with crude cairns of rocks were lying open there were a few signs that the looter or looters had been in a hurry still lying about in the form of odd beads broken pottery crumbling baskets everything portable had been taken down to the bones the bones theft of possessions would not have riled the little people theft of remains however some five or six graves had been looted from the grass sprouting in the turned earth and the amount washed back into the holes it looked as if it had happened right around april damn damn damn this was more than kestrel could handle easily she wanted to start a mourning keen right here and now but a mourning keen would not help not now so she put on her jennifer mask and persona invoked her experience as a pi and began collecting what little evidence there was she had two cameras with her a polaroid and a mm clinically dispassionately she began to fire off polaroids then took a full roll of mm film for later development meanwhile she went mentally through all the possibilities for some sort of official investigation i could call in the cops but this is the county and they re overworked the only way theyii catch whoever did this is if they come back or start boasting even if they caught whoever did this what could they do if we were lucky the perps would get the standard slaponthewrist for graveyard desecration lucky because this isnt a registered official county graveyard which might mean that the law wouldnt even allow us that much what is the law about graveyards on private land i dont even know that its never come up before she hung both cameras over the saddle horn by their neck straps once she had all the evidence there was to get then biting her lip a little in apprehension she went farther up the ridge to the very top right where the sun lingered the longest and the view was the best right where the remains of a cairn were the most obvious to someone who knew what to look for and where a hastilydug hole in the ground was equally obvious once you got past the bushes that screened the place from below oh shit watchesoverthelands resting place was as empty as the other six graves the strictly physical was easy to take care of so long as she kept her jennifer persona in place there was absolutely no point in trying to sort out whose bits belonged to whom and really even for the medicine it didnt much matter the spirits of those left here had long since gone into the west and what had happened here would not materially affect that unless of course the person who had taken the bones had been some kind of magician or medicine person himself then he could use the relics to draw those spirits back against their will imprisoning them in this world making miahluschka out of them which might very well be why the feeling of dark anger lay over this hillside dimming the sunlight she picked the deepest of the holes gathered everything that was scattered and carefully laid it all on the bottom covering it over with loose dirt and rocks she hadnt brought a shovel so she used her hands when she finished and straightened she already knew it wasnt enough the air vibrated with the rage of the little people exactly as if she stood in the middle of a swarm of angry bees the menace was there not for her but for whoever had done this and there was a sense of frustration and bafflement too as if the miahluschka had somehow been prevented from tracking this person or that he was protected in some way from their vengeance which argued even more for it being some kind of medicine practitioner well there was one thing she could do provided that none of the ancestors had been drawn back that is she could invoke the fire of wahkontah and burn away all connection between those spirits and their remains this was not something her own ancestors would have known how to do it was another of the innovations of the deertalldeer family an innovation made necessary by the number of heavy eyebrows stealing from gravesites not only for museums and collectors but for darker purposes or even purposes they didnt realize were dark how many turnofthecentury spiritualists had unwittingly called back spirits to be their indian guides to the afterlife using stolen bones probably quite a few judging by the old papers of the spiritualist society there was sage on the hillside and sweetgrass redbud along the creek bed the blue mud for paint everything she needed was here maybe this was all that was needed for the little people to settle down maybe the sunlight seemed thinner on the hillside she hadnt even worked up a sweat reburying the remains and although she did get hot and sweaty collecting her redbud and sweetgrass when she returned to the site it was like walking into a shadow not a good sign she started her fire and her little smudge of smoke painted her face with the charred end of a redbud twig then stood tall and straight in the eyes of grandfather sun she closed her eyes and raised her face the warmth of the sunlight full against her cheeks steadied her breathing until she reached a still calm center and filled herself with power let it begin the creek was safe enough to wash in although she would not have tried drinking it she splashed cold water all over her face and arms flushing off the paint scrubbing away the dirt shed accumulated she glanced back over her shoulder at the hillside glad enough to be down off the site the anger up there had diminished a bit but it was still a potent force and she would not want to go up there after dark and although she had a certain level of calmafter all she had at least done somethingthere was also a corresponding level of frustration some force was working against both the little people and her own attempts to discover just who was responsible here something was clouding the trail yes this site had been robbed yes it was possible that the relics had been taken from here and cached at calligans development site but the trail had been broken and muddied past all retracing and there was no way of knowing for certain unless she could actually get her hands on an artifact from the development it was just as possible that whoever had robbed this site had no connection with calligan at alleven though the vision quest she had undertaken had seemed to imply a connection medicine worked the way it wanted to sometimes and that vision quest could simply have been telling her that job is not importanthere is something you should be doing something about there were seldom any blackandwhite answers in medicine at least as mooncrow taught it it took a while to get the dirt out from under her fingernails but if there was one thing she hatedand one thing that gave people a really bad impressionit was dirty fingernails by the time she finished she was starving so she took just long enough to share her lunch with the mule while she tried to think of something she had left undone or anything else she could do finally she shook her head and swung herself back up into the mules saddle it was going to be an uneasy ride home chapter nine jennifer drove back to tulsa with the radio off her thoughts full of thunder thirsting for revenge and in no mood to appreciate the lovely weather she had put as much back into the vandalized graves as she had been able to find and at least the bones could no longer be used for bad medicine but most of the resident spiritsand more importantly the little peoplehad not been in any mood to settle the feeling of the place was as bad as anything she had ever felt on claremore mound and it was as plain to her as the blackjacks on the ridge that the miahluschka were out for blood arid nothing less would satisfy them she didnt blame them and in fact she would normally be more than pleased to let them have their way the trouble was that wouldnt get back the medicine objects that had been taken from watchesoverthelands graveand if someone who knew how to use them got hold of them or worse yet if someone who didnt know how but was open and vulnerable got hold of them some poor fool trying to get in touch with his roots or at least the onetenth of his roots that were some kind of native americanoh the miahluschka would have a wonderful time with someone like that true hed be a bonehead to buy artifacts from someone who wasnt a reputable dealer but being a bonehead didnt necessarily warrant the kind of trouble the miahluschka would visit on him they might even succeed in killing him and meanwhilemeanwhile there was the very real possibility that the things looted from tom wares ranch were the same ones plowed up by rod calligans men and if that was the case the little people would be after every man on that crew like flies on a deer carcass they certainly didnt deserve retribution the miahluschka might even be indirectly responsible for the dozer explosion that meant theyd already killed blood fed them there would be more killings and the little people were definitely of the kill them all and let wahkontah sort them out philosophy she rubbed the back of her neck and stared at the road ahead trying to think in practical terms first she needed to have someone alerted to the desecration so if the relics came on the legitimate market they could be confiscated let me think nobody on either side of my family is registered with the bi a so theres no way i can lodge a formal complaint either with the bi a or with the principal chief here was where the flip side of not being registered came up there were ways in which jennifer was handicapped in dealing with government authorities registration was a touchy point with a lot of native americans and definitely with the bureau of indian affairs it was a touchy point with the bia precisely because of the whole reason the bia had been created in the first place to control native americans the bureau had theoretical control over tribal lands tribal moneys over the stipends that whites thought were welfare and were really nothing more or less than the pittances the united states government owed indians for the lands that had been taken away from them stipends paid out over so long a period of time that even some indians didnt really know what they were for we take away your hunting grounds we take away your lands we take your children and your traditions and in return we will give you the food and shelter you need that was how the treaties read when you cut out the bullshit and fancy language how the bureau had carried them out was something else entirely jennifer was already angry the inevitable recollections of what the bureau had done to every native nation only made her angrier she gripped the steering wheel as if it had become a weapon all right better just let the anger run its course and not let it fester she let the associated memories of longago wrongs play through more often than not the bureau read the treaties as an excuse to kidnap indian children from their parents and lock them up in boarding schools where they were forbidden to speak their own language practice their own customs or worship anything but the white christian god the father almighty and people wonder why so many of us became alcoholics the last treaties had been written with the understanding that the indian was a vanishing creature to follow after the buffalo and the great white father would simply look after him in his decline and move in to take the little that had been left when he was gone and in the case of some nations that was precisely what had happened o for a time machine and a gunpowder and rifle factory and registration was a touchy subject now with many native americans because it was easy for someone to claim to be a nonregistered indian and attempt to cash in on the stipends and the native arts movement or even to claim medicine power and set up as a new age shaman crystals and all there was a life and a spirit to indian art that was hard to find elsewhere and an ability to tune into nature that many people wanted just proving how hard we are to kill either in body or in spirit as a result there was money to be made in everything from jewelry to finearts oil paintings there were quite a few artists jennifer knew who resented white people muscling in on that market and a whole lot more folk who resented the new age movement hauling their crystal vibrations into traditions that white folks had tried to destroy not that long ago rightfully in many ways but not being registered was going to make reporting the desecration a good bit more roundabout than jennifer liked well thats the way it has to be having brought the anger around to the end of its course she was able to let it go what was past was past it was time to take care of the present there was a slightly more direct route to authority through her father and mother he was good friends with the principal chief on the osage side and mom used to go to school with cherokee principal chief wilma mankiller before wilma and her folks went off to california but id rather deal with this from the osage side its our burial site and besides wilma has more than enough on her plate as it is she briefly considered bringing in mooncrow he packed a lot of clout when he cared to use itmostly he didnt she knew why he was saving that clout for a real emergency this wasnt not yet anyway burial sites were looted all the time there was no proof that this one had been looted with malice and intent she pulled onto the interstate behind a longhaul trucker and settled in to let him set the pace clout is only good so many times grandfather is right its attacking rather than persuading wed better save it for when we need it given that on impulse she took the claremore turnoff with luck dad would be home for lunch it felt kind of odd to be back here sitting across from her father at the kitchen table blt in both hands windows wide open to the light breeze the house had been built in the days when a lot of things went on in the kitchen most of the social life of the family in fact the kitchen was one of the largest rooms in the house big enough that one corner of it had been set up as her mothers office with a phone a fax machine and a computer and there was still plenty of room left over the kitchen table stood under one of the windows and it was nearly as old as the house big enough to seat eight comfortably a real farmhouse table right now she and her father were the only ones occupying it every time she came home she got hit with nostalgia of eating peanutbutterandjelly sandwiches with her brothers of family holidays all around the big table some of which did not correspond with things like thanksgiving christmas and easter you ought to eat that instead of staring at it her father said after a few minutes of staring off into nowhere on her part your grandfather says you dont eat enough to keep a bird alive she started and grinned ruefully grandfather doesnt see me hitting the fastfood stands either she admitted man does not live by yogurt alone there are also frisco burgers rex chicken and frybread and honey dad laughed and she obliged him by starting in on her own sandwich mom had redecorated the kitchen with new miniblinds on the windows and refinished the old kitchen table and the cabinets taking them down to the natural wood so while it held a boatload of memories at least it didnt look the way it had when she was a kid shed told dad everything she knewwhich wasnt muchconcentrating on the desecration and looting of the burial ground and trying to keep speculation to a minimum she showed him the polaroids and left the mm film to give to the principal chief he in his turn had told her hed asked around and no one no one had heard anything about threats being made or even hinted at against rod calligan either by hotheads or activists before the explosion that had been the reason for staring off into space while moms favorite mockingbird sang wildly from the tree in the backyard thinking over what he had told her it did not jive with the information calligan had given the media or the situation the insurance company had suspected if no one had been threatening him why had he told the media and the insurance company that they had been unless he was deliberately constructing a scapegoat but in that case who had planted the bomb and above all why suddenly she had come to a dead end she hadnt expected and a whole pile of loose ends that didnt match up with anything else she chewed thoughtfully dad made a darned good sandwichthe bacon was from a halfhog they bought every year and the tomatoes were fresh from the garden she had given her father half the polaroids as well as the film he had promised to give both to the principal chief who would tell a little white lie and claim to have taken them himself so at least officialdom would be notified and if this was simply a coincidence not likely the looting would be registered and the legitimate market tightened up she noticed that her father was watching her with a little frown line between his eyebrows although he was usually as hard to read as his arcwelder when he continued to stare at her that way she finally put the sandwich down and returned the stare he was not easy in his mind and although she suspected she knew the reason she decided to get it over with all right dad she said youre worried about something cough it up he cleared his throat selfconsciously i always worry about you jen he temporized she noticed that more of his hair had gone gray at the temples and that there were a few new wrinkles at the corners of his eyes you know that you picked a tough profession tough even for a guy and a whiteyou being a woman and not wellits tougher that wasnt it and she knew it but it was a place to start im paying the bills she pointed out and you know darn well i can take care of myself between marksmanship and martial arts im not too badand overtrained for chasing philandering hubbies and deadbeat daddies she chuckled and he finally joined her i know he admitted i know the only reason you didnt qualify for state trooper was because of your height and whose fault is that she asked archly deciding to try and inject a little more humor into the conversation youre the one who wasted all those good osage heightgenes on my brothers and left me the runt of the litter i call that unfair she made a face when he laughed and went back to the original subject look dad as a pi i can get things done that need to be done sometimes i can actually do more than the cops can theres no one watching over my shoulder to make sure i have probable cause telling me i cant bodyguard someone because her nutcase boyfriend hasnt already done something and right now well i can do a lot for our people my hands arent tied theres no one telling me i have to find a quick set of suspects because cnn is watching and the mayor is embarrassed she rubbed the side of her nose in fact if i drop some hints to the cops theyre likelier to start watching their step because they know me they know im honest and they know im watching he reached up and scratched his temple making a slight grimace i know all that he said uncertainly but honey this job is different now i know i told you that there wasnt anything going on with the young bucks before the explosionbutwell there is now she sat straight up sandwich forgotten outside a blue jay called alarm what she demanded tell me he sighed and looked pained but this time she could tell the frown was not for her ive been checking around some more especially after i heard that david was in town and getting himself into thiswell i heard some things for one thing i heard rod calligan has been pointing a finger right at the indians on his crews course in some ways i cant blame him since david seems to be so set on making himself a target he shook his head but if youd figured that calligan and the cops would really like to pin this one on our people well youre right i heard theyve been getting pretty heavyhanded with some of the guys involved and that they arent looking real hard for any other suspects she put the sandwich down all appetite gone it was one thing to speculate it was another to hear your worst mundane fears confirmed have you heard anything else yeah the worry line came back i heard that david and his buddies were likely to play rough with anybody that gets in their way like he left the sentence unfinished but she finished it for him like me she snarled and ill break his skull for him dad if you have a way to hear from him messages can go the other way you let that bunch of overgrown adolescents know that theres a lot more going on here than he thinksand thats not from jennifer talldeer pi its from kestrelhuntsalone mooncrows designated apprentice i think at least some of his friends will get the message and back off a little i hope if they donti am not going to place myself between them and a bunch of angry miahluschka and thats my word on the subject she sniffed disdainfully as her father winced at the mention of the little people that wont stop david of course hes probably gotten so damn sophisticated that he doesnt believe in anything anymore her father was quiet for a long moment wellthat was the otherthe real reason i was worried i may not have the medicine but ive seen it at work this is old and powerful stuff youre messing with you werent making any inferences but i can read between the lines somehow this looting and the explosion are related watchesovertheland was an unusually gifted man the medicine stirred up against someone who stole his bones is going to be pretty severe i dont want you standing between the little people and anybody i knew the job was dangerous when i took it dad she replied flippantly but then sobered and smiled at him reassuringly remember i have mooncrow hes a horny old coot but when things get seriouswell hes as good as they get if we cant handle this together no one can finally her fathers expression of concern faded i guess youre right and i really cant make any good assessment itd be like you trying to figure out a weld you know what youre doing honey and you know what you need to do so does the old man as far as that goes though sometimes i wonder how you put up with him living with you she shrugged secretly pleased that her father had given her the ultimate accolade of an adultyou know what youre doing maybe im more than a little contrary myself she admitted after all its mans medicine that im learning her father sighed now you know i wouldnt be a good parent and a good osage if i didnt worry about that too she tilted her head to one side giving her reply a lot of thought this was the first time he had actually come out and said that and it deserved a decent reply i can understand that but please remember that he is the teacher i was the one he chose it wasnt the other way around not using this power she shook her head no i couldnt let it just lie there it would beit would be denying a responsibility as if i had all the ability of a great artist and refused to draw no thats not right either she considered for a moment more its a demand on me in my heart its more than that because its not just something for me its something for my family my clan my gente my nation its more as if i got elected president and refused to serve i kind of got elected to this so it really would be the wrong thing not to do whats right with the power she let her voice trail off he looked into her eyes and finally nodded i think i understand you know the old man told me once that the only time i really touch the power is when im dancingand i know what you mean about it being a demand on your heart when im dancing even in competitions i feel like im doing something something important even if i dont understand what that is i wouldnt give up dancing even if they quit having competitions even if only women danced even if it were illegal the way it was in his fathers day she held his eyes and smiled feeling a wonderful warmth and relaxation come over her oh he would still worry because he was a parent it came with the territory but now he understood thank you she said softly that means a lot then she cleared her throat and took a more normal tone look dad if you can just pass on what i told you all right it might at least keep some of those poor construction workers out of the line of fire and see if the law will move its fat ass about the vandalism she sighed not that i have much hopebut since theres a county election coming up in september maybe the sheriffs department will feel some pressure especially if it comes from the principal chief osage oil stipends are still a major source of county income up there he nodded ill try he replied youve got a good point about the stipends i sure wish david spotted horse would be a little moremore sensible she supplied doing her best not to sound too snide or catty reasonable thoughtful im afraid those are pretty foreign concepts to mister spotted horse i learned that the hard way his way is to overreact to everything and his overreaction is one of the reasons we broke up she got a sudden suspicion from the way her fathers eyes narrowed that he was about to bring in personal matters she wasnt mistaken you know he said carefullyand a little hopefully your mother and i always kind of hoped youd get a little more serious about david she dashed his hopes by groaning puhlease he was way too busy being the big man in the movement after a moment of consideration she decided to let him in on a little personal secret that had finally stopped hurting i never told you what it was that finally precipitated my breaking up with him he quoted huey long at me huey long dad replied puzzled wasnt he a black panther or something what was the quote how could that break you two up youll know how when i tell you she cleared her throat i was trying to point out why bailing out of college was a bad idea especially for someone who claimed he wanted to do some good for our people i even pointed out how much good i could do being both in criminal investigation and in the movement he said word for word the only place for a woman in the movement is on her back her father stared at her for a moment and his face spasmed i dont imagine you put up with that he choked trying not to laugh she shrugged for his pains i egged him into trying to shove me around then i put him on histo let him get an idea of how it felt that was too much for her father he broke up laughing and she grinned feeling just a little smug now that the confrontation was old old news it had hurt at the time what had hurt even more was that she had known then and now that it was meant to david had an uncanny ability to pick the most hurtful words possible and use them well he thought the reason i was taking tai chi was just to keep the fat off my hips and make me a good dancer boy did he get a surprise her father chuckled ill bet he did and id be the last person to tell you he didnt have it coming after a crack like that she shook her head needless to say when i told him as much he called me a flinthearted bitchamong other thingsi called him a male chauvinist pigamong a lot of other thingsand we called it quits her father picked up a napkin and wiped his eyes thats my daughter if you hadnt and id found out about it id have disowned you myself she picked up her sandwich again and stared at it before taking a pensive bite you know dad she said after swallowing it it isnt easy being a flinthearted bitch it takes a lot of work to her surprise he reached across the table and patted her free hand you mean he said quietly but firmly that it isnt easy being a warrior that is what you are and only a foolish young man with no experience and unable to get past his own ego would fail to see it she looked up at him in complete shock he nodded and gave her a smile warm and bright with approval just promise me this watch your back very closely not because you need to but to please your old man who probably worries too much about the girl he remembers as a baby in his arms she blinked and agreed good he said with satisfaction that is all i have any right to ask you nowcan i force some strawberry cobbler on you he arched his eyebrows at the refrigerator theres fresh homemade ice cream to go with it he continued temptingly all she could do was laugh and agree she was thinking about the conversation as she made notes in her office after she got back it had been a very enlightening and surprising little talk on a lot of levels sometimes it would be easier not to be such a rebel grandfather said from behind her making her jump easier on you as well as your parents but sometimes it is something that you must be she swiveled her chair around there he was standing in the door to her office looking inscrutable are you eavesdropping on my brain again she asked shaking a fist at his ear dirty old men shouldnt eavesdrop on ladies thoughts he ducked and chuckled at her waggling an admonitory finger at her no respect he chided you kids have no respect for the elderly and wise it was hard to stay even annoyed with him for more than a minute when he was in this mood if you were either i might she retorted youre an oversexed sixteenyearold contrary an osage heyoka and there isnt any such thing and youre just disguised as a wise old medicine man youve got my real grandfather tied up in a closet somewhere youre coyote thats what you are and not mooncrow at all his eyes crinkled up as he grinned could be could be he replied but i was just reading the thoughtful look on your face when you came in and put it together with the pan of your mothers famous cobbler in the fridge that meant you stopped to see my son and since you brought the cobbler home he must have let you know hes worried because youre so different but since you arent annoyed he told you he knows you can take care of yourself hmm she shook her head i am never going to be able to do that you sound just like sherlock holmes and i feel as stupid as watson she sighed then hooked a chair with her toe and kicked it over to him sit mooncrow my teacher i am troubled and in need of counsel we have a lot of problems that should fit together and dont i need your help little old man he took the chair losing his smile when she called him thatwhich was a title of high honor among their people he knew the situation was more than simply serious and he knew that she would not ask him for help unless she really was out of her depth she told him what she had told her father but with more details particularly the medicine details although he was wearing his very best stoneface as befit a little old man she thought that he became alarmed when she told him about watchesoverthelands looted grave he began to ask her some specific questions about what graves in particular had been looted where and she had to confess that she had been so upset that she couldnt remember precise details thats why i took these she said pulling out the polaroids and handing them to him each set is from a specific grave see i put a number on a note right in the middle of each one so you can tell which was which i put everything back that i could but with the bones gone i got the feeling that my ceremonies were about as effective as blowing smoke into the wind i did at least break the spiritual connection to the bones but the miahluschka are looking for blood payment he leafed through them carefully his face gone stony and cold finally when he came to the last set he took a quick intake of breath that was all but it was enough to tell her that he was as upset as she had ever seen him he closed his eyes for a moment simply holding the photographs in his hands when he finally opened his eyes again though he did not look the way she had expected he was angry but that wasnt all he was disturbed and perhaps a little frightened something had happened that he had not expected you are correct in remembering that this was watchesoverthelands resting place he said after a long silence as i have told you he was a medicine chief and a very great one he paused and she waited he would tell her what he knew but he was clearly thinking this through as he spoke there is something wrongbesides this vandalism he said after that long pause i am looking at these pictures and there is more malice in the last looting than in the rest there are no bits of pottery or beads left there absolutely everything was taken further no one but you or i or some other immediate ancestor should have been able to find that grave not simply because it iswashard to find because they should not have been able to see it because it was protected she nodded slowly and then with vigor of course that was what the back of my mind was trying to tell me of course the place would be protectedhow could it not have been with a son who was a medicine chief himself seeing to the cairn and with every descendant since watching over the site magics like that were only supposed to grow stronger with time not weaker and now she knew what mooncrow had been up to each time they had visited the place he had been reinforcing those protections so what had gone wrong so something has gone wrong he said echoing her thoughts something has gone very wrong with all of the protections that we tried to keep in place he pondered again for a moment so here is something new to add to your equation a new story for you and it is one of ill omen one i would have told you when i taught you the rituals to protect our ancestor there was aa thingthat watchesovertheland defeated this was later after his visions or he would not have been strong enough to defeat it it was something evil and he defeated the evil man that created it as well killed him and buried him with all his evil things watchesovertheland told his son that he had seen another set of visions visions that showed that if he did not defeat this man and his evil object the osage would go the way of the hardtokillpeople and disappear and lose all that they had to the long knives like the thingonitsheadpeople did the osage disappearing like the sac and fox where i dont think theres a single pureblooded member of the tribes left and losing literally everything like the cherokee who were driven out of the lands in the south had homes and farms and businesses stolen from them by government order he said this evil man meant to get power by helping the long knives and that he would have done terrible things to the land itself grandfather shook his head and his eyes were very troubled that is why watchesovertheland had to try to defeat him and his thing it was like a wahhopeh the sacred hawkbundle but it wasnt it was like an evil wahhopeh meant to destroy everything that was sacred to contaminate everything that was good that evil man would know where watchesovertheland was resting he would see through all the protections for he is very powerful and he would take great pleasure in seeing the sacred things stolen the bones taken mooncrows voice trailed off and he narrowed his eyes his attention no longer really on her abruptly he stood up i must think on this he said and left without another word leaving her to stare at the chair he had sat in this does not give me a warm and fuzzy feeling of confidence she thought unhappily she particularly was not fond of the way that grandfather had spoken of this evil man as if he were still alive or at least able to act of course if he was that powerful he would be able to act he would not leave this earth he would not be at all interested in going into the west if he left the earth he would be weighed by wahkontah who would not be very pleased with his actions so it would be in his best interest to stick around and see if he could break the bindings that my ancestor placed on him then find someone to act through if from the look of things he had and some of the pieces of the puzzle were beginning to fit together to form a very nasty pattern in the past the evil one had worked against the osage and with the whites even if the whites had not been aware of it and in the present in the present there had been relics plowed up a terrible explosion in which mostly indians had been killed for which indians were being blamed by whites some indians were being stirred up against her the ancestor of the evil ones great enemy the two patterns matched too well far far too well chapter ten david spotted horse stifled a yawn wishing he hadnt stopped smoking a cigarette would at least have given him something to do with his hands the gathering in the back room of somebodys cousins smoke shop was not going the way hed planned he wanted to warn the guys from calligans construction site not to talk to jennie no matter what they heard on the grapevine he hadnt called this meeting to hear about superstitious crap but that was what he was getting especially from the osage he couldnt believe they were wasting a single moment of time on this he leaned back against a stack of heavy cardboard cartons and crossed his arms over his chest trying to at least keep his face straight first jennie and her cute little stagetricks making the door slam on me and now this and if i dont at least listen to them they wont listen to me the guys on calligans construction project had all gone back to work the day before yesterdayagainst his advicewhen calligan had promised to cordon off the particular corner of the property that seemed to be sacred ground now that the cops were done playing at evidencegathering hed been dead set against them going back on the grounds that they were playing right into calligans hands but some guy named rick had said stubbornly that if they didnt go back to work it would pretty well prove that calligan was right about one of them being in cahoots with terrorists the best way we can prove were innocent is to act like were innocent he had said over and over until the rest agreed with him but now from all the stories being told here as soon as they went back everything started to go bad again not just heat from calligan either although the bastard was there every minute of every damned day supervising everything himself probably making certain nobody slacked off although the guys said he told them he was watching for more sabotage no it seemed like every time somebody turned around there was one accident after another weird stuff too stuff that couldnt have been like the dozer explosion holes opened up right in the path of equipment big ones and equipment would fall in and have to get hauled out wasting time a load of steel pipe broke its straps and came down right on one guy who was lucky to get off with a broken leg every piece of heavy machinery was out of commission by the end of today with gaskets blown fuel lines leaking hydraulics shot piston arms broken something had gotten into the dynamite shed and chewed on every single stick letting in dampwhich made them likely to be unstable and useless the only thing stupid enough to chew on dynamite was a possum but there werent any holes under the shed or in the roof big enough to let a possum get inside and it was a good thing that the guy going after the dynamite had looked it over good or the bad sticks could have killed someone he hadnt heard such a litany of woes since hurricane andrew and of course every single one of those accidents was proof that the little people were angry that there was a curse on the project how can people who are so smart be so gullible he asked himself for the thousandth time these guys aren t stupid it takes a lot of brains to horse one of those rigs around i should look on the bright side when they stop jawing i can probably talk them into staying off the job now but how can guys who laugh at people whore afraid of black cats turn around and believe in the little people he used to believe in all that nonsensewell maybe not little people since that was an osage thing and not cherokee but in spirits and totemic animals visionquests and all the rest of it medicine stuff that got all the new age danceswithcreditcards crowd so mistyeyed newage rhymes with sewage and the same watereddown crap he suppressed a smile at his own cleverness he had more sense than that now it was just one more way for people to delude themselves look what had happened to wovoka and the ghost dance movement more of the people had been shot down because they believed that those stupid white shirts would keep them bulletproof peyote and too much imagination thats all right if youre making a painting or writing a poem but were trying to keep some people out of jail here oh he went to various rituals even peyote ceremonies although he wouldnt go so far as chewing the stuff himself partially because he didnt like giving up control to anything he liked knowing he was always completely in control of his mind and all his senses but he went because his mentors pointed out it was important to gopolitically correct as it were it would look bad if he didnt participate as if his spirit wasnt in helping his people and he did believe that there was something sacred out there that there were special places that had a special power for the peoples hell even white people had places like that places where powerful things happened like lourdes mecca and jerusalem it only made sense that there were places like that for everyone and the earth itself was sacred if only because it was the only place to live that humans had and when they didnt treat it like it was sacred they messed it up and theres something out there thats for us all the peoples something that doesnt fit the white idea of god the caucasian father that only makes sense too the judeochristians dont have a lock on truth any more than anyone else does but he just couldnt handle all this superstitious stuff he believed in the power of lawyers not little people of media pressure and not medicine you could smoke a sacred pipe till you choked it wasnt gonna do you a damn bit of good against a bunch of us marshals with guns id rather have a restraining order on my side than all the eagles in the country overhead when im facing the feds he sighed and continued to listen to the latest story the way he had it pegged the mystics were deluding themselves confusing the symbols of power with the real thing but if it makes them get their act together to save their tribal identity and maybe do something so that the whites are forced to get their act together well fine and despite jennies accusations he had a larger goal in mind too the way he saw it the native movement should be taking a larger role in ecological matters since so many of the ecofreaks were looking to the indians for spiritual guidance the peoples had damned well ought to give it to them we have to do something to save the world from poison if it takes talking to crystals its all right with me as long as they start cleaning up the air and water too we all have to live here the whites arent going away and thats reality so the best we can do is get as much back as we can and shame them into cleaning up the rest at least jennie has that part right he frowned a little and caught himself he took a quick look to seeif the latest speaker had seen the faint grimace but the guy was so wrapped up in his own story that david could probably have stuck his tongue out without the man noticing the smell of tobacco back here was overpowering made him really sorry hed given up smoking but damned if he was going to let a stick of dried weeds rule his life but that made him think of jennie again since shed been on him all the time to quit and that just reminded him of that last confrontation he was really glad none of the guys here had known anything about that how the hell had she managed to get him to leave when he hadnt wanted to the door trick that was easy to figure out but not the rest hed still had plenty to say to herbut somehow he hadnt been able to get the words out of his mouth and hed found himself walking right out the door on top of that that crazy old man her grandfather was with her too shit he used to be able to do some weird things back when we were kids hell now im starting it that stuff the old man did it wasnt anything more than sleight of hand and the suggestibility of kids what was the old man doing living with her anyway that only complicated matters especially since a lot of the guys here held the old man in pretty high esteem weve got to talk to old man talldeer thats what the guy holding the floor was saying and to davids dismay there was a murmur of approval even from some of the guys who werent osage it was obvious from that it wasnt just some of the guys but all of these guys had respect for the old man hell that was all he needed maybe we oughta talk to jennie talldeer too said another larry did he said shes got the right stuff last time i asked the old man for a blessing he had jennie do my work for me and shes good old man talldeers training her right another murmur of agreement she showed up at the first meeting said someone else giving david an oblique glance spotted horse wouldnt let her in he said she was there for calligan but what if she was trying to give us some medicine help what if the old man sent her oh shit now how was he going to convince them not to go to her when she had the old man in her corner so far none of them had gotten wind of the message shed sent to him by way of the osage principal chief if they did thered be no keeping them away from her or her grandfather and he wasnt sure if what shed sent him was a trick or if she really believed it herself but the message had been couched in no uncertain terms that there was bad medicine involved in this calligan mess and that hed better butt out or get involved in some constructive manner how can she believe that stuff she went to college how had she forced him out of her house when he didnt want to leave and how come ever since then any time he dialed her number no matter what phone it was from he always got the your call did not go through message she hadnt changed her number and it happened even when he went through the operator the operator had been just as confused and had muttered something about a short in the line on the whole for the last day or so things had not been happening according to davids idea of a logical and predictable universe in a perverse sense he would have liked to blame it all on jennie but he doubted that she had gone out and dug holes in calligans land for equipment to fall into short of ascribing supernatural powers to her dammit and what the hell do they mean by old man talldeers training her right now that he thought about it hadnt her message said something about being her grandfathers apprentice shit maybe she did believe all that crap the entire bunch was looking at him now waiting for him to say something he almost grimaced and covered it in time no matter what he said he lost in some way if he told them not to talk to jennie or the old man hed lose them completely they had that shaky panicked kind of look about them then theyd go do whatever jennie told them to do well he said slowly keeping his expression just a shade on the dubious side you can talk to the talldeer girl if you want if youre really going to insist on it but if you do dont be surprised if everything you tell her shows up as evidence on calligans side when he takes you all to court you know shes a private eye and none of us know who hired her but id bet on calligan before id bet on anyone else and anything she hears if it has any bearing on the explosion she has to tell the cops i wouldnt but she will little people my ass whats she gonna tell him the man asked scornfully that we think the jerks got a curse on him she already knows that and so does he we told him to his face more than once and last time i looked curses werent admissible in court ah hell i have lost them bitch they turned their backs on him and began deciding who was going to approach the talldeers and whether they were going to go straight for the old man or work through the girl first he finally got up and left it was obvious that hed lost this round time for round two he pushed through the stockroom door and passed through the front of the smoke shop empty except for the cousin at the counter the cousin kind of grunted good night he returned the courtesy and walked out into the earlier dusk his car was off to one side of the tiny parking lot under a cottonwood he hadnt meant to start clandestine operations this soon but it looked as though he wasnt going to have any choice whether or not jennie was working with calligan was moot if she waswell he was about to show these guys how stupid they were being if she wasnt then at least hed have collected some other evidence people always left paper trails they couldnt help it there would be something in that office he would be able to use if only byleaking it to the press he had the document camera the rubber gloves and the lockpick set all hidden in the side panel of the front door of his jeep tonight would be a good night to go raid the office at the site the cops had all gone away and with the workers back on the job calligan had no reason to be nervous and no one with any sense broke into a site office there was never anything worthwhile there not even pawnshops took electric typewriters anymore that and oversized calculators and beatup old office furniture was all anyone ever kept at a site office and of course records not that ive ever been caught he thought not bothering to hide a smirk since he was halfway to his car and there wasnt anyone to see it damn im good well just see if theres something in those records at the site that leads back to jennieor anything else that can be used against calligan himself kestrelhuntsalone was on the huntarmed to the teeth metaphorically and spiritually speakingcrouched at the edge of the fence surrounding calligans construction site it was very dark out here with no moon and only the light of the stars and very distant streetlights but she wasnt depending entirely on her night vision she had already spent some time here before sundown memorizing the positions of bits of cover planning the route she would take to get to the ground that had held the relies both she and mooncrow had decided that it was time to do a little more investigation after dark during the little peoples most active hours this time mooncrow had armored her to the best of his ability and she had layered on her own protections and assurances on top of his at best the little people would recognize her as an ally against the real enemy at worst she had enough defenses that she would not need to fear their anger she hoped there was only one way to be sure however and that was to test it all under fire in the field no one had plowed anything else up since the explosion but that was because calligan had put off digging any further into the disputed corner until after the forensics and university people got done checking the area out calligan was pretending to cooperate at least she thought it was pretense despite his claim that he had contacted people at ou to come check out the disputed area of course he could have assumed that the explosion had powdered every relic left he could be assumingprobably correctlythat ou was too short on money to send anyone to do a real archeological investigation or he could have come in on his own and removed everythingit would have been a little harder with the cops here but it could have happened one thing was certain if she could rely on her own medicine senses this place was not a real burial site she had sought visions here both while in her car and crouched at the edge of the fence as near to that corner as she could get there simply werent any of the appropriate signs or the proper feel to the place there had been a faint echo that something had been kept there brieflyand there seemed to be a bright point as if there was still some kind of relic out there but it was all in one place not spread out as it would be if this really were a burial ground but there was nothing more and she was not going to go into a full medicine trance in a place where she was so physically vulnerable sothat probably meant that what had already been dug up was a cache of some kind as she had guessed and she needed to find out now if there were any more caches out here or if that point of power meant only a relic or two still intact after all the turmoil even one object would tell her if what had been dug up had actually come from the osage cairns the only way she could do that was now at night when there would be no one around to interfereor try to blow her away for uncovering their stash she slipped under the wire fenceridiculously easy to do since it wasnt anchored very firmly and it was obviously there just to define the area of construction and not to form any kind of protection didnt larry tell me that thered been some missing supplies im not surprised if this is the level of their security an amateur could break in here she froze for a moment scanning the area then scuttled silently to another patch of cover a stack of something with a tarp over it working her way carefully across the site moving from shadow to shadow occupied all of her attention she did not bother to watch for little people if they wanted her they would be able to ambush her without any difficulty they were spirits after all and it was rather difficult to keep a spirit from materializing in front of you if it wanted to she had gotten halfway to the forbidden corner when she realized that she was not alone and whoever was out here was at least as good at being invisible as she was or she would have noticed him her long before this in fact the only reason she had spotted the other invader was because he had run in front of a lightcolored piece of equipment just as she looked at it oh shit it occurred to her then as she cowered in the shadow of a huge bulldozer and watched for some sign that she had been spotted that she just might have run into the original looter if there was an original looter the signs sure pointed to one and if sohe would also be the most likely candidate for saboteur trying to wreck the equipment before it dug up his cache just what i needed for my birthday the guy who wired a dozer with dynamite and killed four people not likely hes going to play nice and surrender if i catch him not likely hes going to congratulate me on my expertise if he catches me assuming this person was human at all that was not a good assumption really the little people could take on all the attributes of a fleshandblood human when they chose and there were other spirits that could do the same this might not be a looter a saboteur this might be something much worse she was afraid to move lest she be spotted and afraid not to move she certainly couldnt stay here forever she strained her eyes against the darkness but she couldnt make out much more than a darker shadow against a pile of sand or gravel if she hadnt seen him move there she wouldnt have known he was in that blotch of darkness shed never have guessed that the shadow was alive if she hadnt seen it in action then it moved again so quickly that her heart jumped up into her throat it was spooky maybe a couple of pieces of gravel fell but otherwise the lurker was silent it was heading over in the direction of the ropedoff corner so does that mean its the looter another wouldbe scavenger one of the little people or somebody else altogether she followed heart pounding palms sweating and wishing she had a nightscope then it occurred to her that she did have a kind of nightscope after all the only problem was that it was hard to move if she went into the kind of mental state where she could see things see the purely physical and see medicine things if this other lurker was something other than human he would really betray himself at that point but she would be severely handicapped thats why youre a medicine woman stupid hard doesnt mean impossible just try not to move too fast when youre doublesighted or youll trip over something she froze for a moment putting herself in the right frame of reference she knew shed matched it when instead of only the shadow of a human lurking over by the dirt dug up by the newwrecked dozer she saw not only the stranger but a stag standing beside him interesting so her unknown had a medicineanimal self at least that meant he wasnt one of the little people they didnt have medicineanimals spirittotems since they were spirits and it meant he was indeed a heit was a stag after all and not a doeand that he probably wasnt white although she had met white people who had medicinecreatures there werent many of them in the tulsa area he didnt fit the profile of someone who would be graverobbing either a medicineanimal would have left him if hed done something as appalling as that no one she knew had a stag for a medicineanimal but he didnt seem aware of his medicineanimal at least he paid no attention to it staring instead very fixedly at something lying just inside the ropedoff area that was really odd how could he not know he had a spiritguardian and for one to appear to try to force him to become aware of it he had to be in some kind of danger the stag was very agitated frantic surely he had to feel somethingl even if he was only marginally in touch with his spiritual self he had to feel it the stag kept alternating between threatening gestures with its horns toward the mans right and pawing at the earth threatening something there where the man was looking she concentrated a little more and narrowed her focus whatever this is its very smalland i think its in that area where i spotted something earlier finally something clicked and she saw it or rather save the medicineself that was the echo of its physical self it was a single artifact a small one a medicinepouch hardly bigger than the palm of her hand she had missed seeing exactly what it was the first time because she had beer looking for a mass of relics not a single piece a real physical light flashed on startlingly bright in all the darkness the other person had a penlight and was shining it on the object and she cursed him mentally for a fool showing any kind of light out here at night anybody driving by would see it anybody keeping watch for saboteurs or troublemakers would see it how could he be so stupid thats the same kind of dumb trick david would pull whoever the idiot was he didnt act as if hed expected to find the pouch there and she wondered how he had spotted it in the first place maybe he was marginally sensitive maybe pigs sing arias he probably saw something reflective he was studying it carefully although it was too much to hope for that hed leave it there dammit that alone would have told me if it was from one of the looted graves but i wont know that unless i can get my hands on it and get the feel of it to see if it matches the feel of any of the gravesites the stag feinted toward the right again and this time movement there movement in the spirit world made her focus her attention in that direction oh hell oh no little people lots of them in human form in the dress of her people from the time of the first french traders but with faces too wild and too hungry to ever pass for human waiting and watching avidly their eyes glowing with a feral anticipatory light that made her shiver they crouched in a group making her think of a waiting pack of coyotes or a mob of crows waiting for dinner to kill itself watching some supremely stupid young creature who was just a heartbeat away from doing something fatal fatal she turned her newly sharpened spiritsight back toward the medicinepouch following the gaze of the little people yes that was what they were watching it looked as if they had been waiting for this man to find it fatal she strained her abilities to the limit and prayed a little for good measureand knew suddenly and completely what it was that was fatal about the pouch it was the bait to a very mundane trapit was wired to a bomb she didnt stop to think she just acted she flung herself across the intervening space hurled herself at him tackled him and rolled him sideways just as he started to reach out to pick it up together they rolled right into the crowd of little people who flowed about them in confused eddies momentarily deflected from their purpose she felt their anger hot on her skin their rage at being cheated of their rightful victim and she looked up to see them surrounding both her and the stranger david had intended to head straight for the portable office on the site but something made him take a little detour instead a feeling that there was something out in the forbidden area that he really should know about he hadnt been certain about the hunch but it was too strong to be denied but hed stopped right by a pile of dirt feeling a little stupid at following a hunch and played his penlight over the area a flash of pale blue caught the light and he aimed the circle of illumination there expecting to see nothing more than half an old plastic cup instead the light shone on the deep reds and blues of really old beadwork surrounded by the remains of quill work all set into what had to be a truly ancient medicine pouch he stared at it transfixed unable to look away he forgot what he had come for in the first place after a few moments the fascination turned to something else desire he had to have this thing it was meant for him it had called him to take it called to him out of the darkness he must take it he reached out for it slowly with his free hand and something hit him from the side knocking all the breath right out of him sending him sprawling he had not been ready he had not even been close to ready he hit his head on the hard ground as he toppled over and that partially stunned him on top of that his attacker had knocked the breath out of his lungs with the blow something that hadnt happened since the last time hed been suckerpunched in grade school he and his assailant rolled over and over in the dirt finally coming to a halt a few feet away from where hed been hiding he tried to suck in air flailing around for balance or to put up a pretense of defense all he could manage was a vague idea that his attacker must have been one of calligans hired stooges a rentacop or something but he was too busy trying to force a breath into his lungs which burned with pain and felt as if theyd collapsed his attacker ignored him and scrambled to his feet finally after a terrible muscle spasm his chest unclenched and he sucked in a long and painful breath in something close to a sob a breath that hurt so much that his eyes watered he looked up through tearing eyes to see who had hit him jennie what the hell she stood over him her face set in a tight fierce mask a shewolf defending her cub that was when he looked at what she was looking at and nearly stopped breathing all over again his mind babbled that he wasnt seeing thishe couldnt be seeing thisthat it was all a hallucination no oh noim going crazy im seeing delusions im still knocked out but shaking his head didnt make them go away and despite all his rational thinking college learning and disbelief they were still there the osage little people he knew what they were old man talldeer had spun a tale or two for him and the rest of the neighborhood kids back when he and jennie were both in grade school and any indian kid in claremore knew about claremore mound the little people there the things that would happen to males who were stupid enough to climb it boys used to dare each other to go up on it and none of them ever would yeah he knew what the little people were supposed to look like and they had to be spirits for one thing they were transparent and for another no osage had dressed the way they were dressed for the last hundred years or so wearing only gypsumrubbed deerskin leggings with roaches of deertail hair and turkeygobbler beard attached to the long roaches of their own hair which had been shaved in the style that the whites called a mohawk they surrounded him and jennie their eyes gleaming with mingled rage and hunger their eyes glowed and one other thing told him that they were little people and not ordinary spirits no feathers no face paint each of them should have been wearing an eagle feather in his roach either a soft undertail covert if he was of the tzisho or a full tailfeather if he was hunkah the little people wore neither nor were they painted if they had once been human they had died in such a way that they had no honor and must go through a strange afterlife stuck here on earth and not in the summer country existing without paint or eagle feathers just as old man talldeer had whispered to them on those longago october nights they are hungry for blood they search for prey if they had once been human they could have been killed by his people in the raids that left no one in an entire villageevery man dead every woman and child made a slave to die a slaveto die in a sneak attack and rot where you fell without paint or ceremonythat would leave your spirit wandering at any other time than the night of the dark of the moon you might be able to talk them into sparing you they might even content themselves with simply pulling a trick on you but during the dark of the moon they became pretty singleminded killing machines david did not need to scan the sky he knew it was the dark of the moon hed planned on that when hed decided to make his little raid tonight the little people were ignoring jennie for the most part staring avidly down at him whatever was going on she seemed to have some kind of protection from them he didnt im dead he thought his mouth going dry with a terror so profound it couldnt even be called fear then jennie pulled something out of the inside of her jacket a beaded featherno two feathers eagletail and eaglecovert bound together with beadwork like a peyotefan but different in a way that felt important she held it before her like a shield he blinked to clear his eyes of the strange triple vision that suddenly came over him but the vision remained there was jennie legs braced slightly apart the jennie he knew in blue jeans and a beatup jacket decorated with osage ribbonwork embroidery and ribbonweaving and jennie in full osage regalia but with some additions a kind of shell necklace he knew was only supposed to be worn by men a beaded tzisho eagle feather braided into the hair on one side of her head and a beaded hunkah feather on the other a modified warriors roach and some other things that she didnt wear to the powwows and over all that a bird a kestrel and the second and third images were a lot stronger than the real one the little people slowly raised their eyes and stared instead at jennie and david began to hope that maybe he wasnt going to die after all one of the little people straightened up from his crouch he stood much taller than jennie he must have been at least six feet in height and towered over her but she didnt seem the least intimidated he said something in what david recognized as osage he didnt know much of the language but it was siouan in derivation and he knew lakotah he understood just enough to get the basics you have interfered with our hunt this is our rightful prey she shook her head and replied in the same tongue david didnt understand any of what she said and it was a fairly long speech the rest of the little people straightened and surrounded her looking down at her ignoring him oh please dont make them mad jennie i dont think kung fu or whatever it is you know works on them finally she finished with something he vaguely understood sorry about this but hes with me hes a little stupid please forgive him he didnt know whether to kiss or kick her maybe hed better not do either they might not like it the leader looked down at her taking her measure looked down at david and there was no mistaking the contempt in his eyes finally he raised his chin in agreement though it was obvious that he did so grudgingly the glitter in his eyes spoke volumes here was a man saved by a woman who was more warrior than he was at least in the estimation of the little people david felt his ears reddening the leader folded his arms across his chest and slowly faded from view the rest of the little people followed him a heartbeat later and the strange triple vision of jennie faded as well leaving only the jennie he knew david finally remembered to breathe he thought that jennie would say something probably scathing but she ignored him instead she tucked her feathers back into her coat and returned to the place where hed been crouching and dropped down to sit on her heels and stare at the medicinepouch hed found which was no longer so desirable in fact he didnt want it at all anymore his earlier lust for it made him a little nauseous she stayed there for an awfully long time as he slowly picked himself up out of the dirt and assessed the damages not bad really a couple of bruised ribs some other bumps and bruises and scrapes she didnt seem the least interested in him anymore and he was torn between being fawningly grateful and really pissed off if there was a death worse than fatewell shed just saved him from it if the little people had gotten hold of me theyd have killed me and theyd have taken their time about it not only that but id have had to join them he shuddered and his nausea increased an eternity of hunger and frustration never being able to leave the earth never doing anything constructive and he could just imagine the reaction calligan and the press would have had to finding him colddead on calligans property calligan would have had a field day and david probably would have inadvertently taken a lot of innocent people down with him not an hour ago hed scoffed at the little people as being no more than superstitious drivel oh he was a believer now jennie continued to ignore him he decided not to say anything in a strange way he was actually afraid of her where had she gotten that kind of power maybe the stuff she had done the night hed come over wasnt all stagemagic crap after all maybe get real spotted horse shes got it whatever it is you should be glad she just shoved you out of her house instead of a million other things she could have done to you for talking to her like that in his mind she took on a kind of mythic status a kind of great mother like spider woman or changing woman he wondered if he should just try to slip away before she noticed him again then she spoke and the sarcastic tone and completely ordinary words shredded his building mental image of her to rags you blow your own mouth off often enough she said quietly you happen to know anything about bombs bombs he blinked suppressed an automatic and equally sarcastic reply and walked over to join her she had his penlight in her hand evidently hed dropped it when she hit him she had it focused on the medicinepouch and she had moved some of the dirt from around it now he saw the trip wires leading to itand now he knew why the little people had been waiting for him they hadnt been planning on killing him themselves they were going to let him blow himself to pieces happens i do he said carefully at least i do know about things that are this primitive we had to learn how to look for bombs in our cars and booby traps people would set up in barricades she glanced at him sideways but didnt comment she didnt have to it was all there in her glance he took a deep breath to calm himself hed earned that particular doubtful glance honest he said with complete truthfulness jennie i can swear to you that i have never set a bomb in my life and i only took apart bombs that whites set on native property okay she nodded okay so how about if i hold the light and you deal with this one he was still wearing his rubber gloves she couldnt possibly have missed that but she didnt say anything about it the bomb was ridiculously simple to take apart leaving them with a potentially dangerous device and a device that was probably equally dangerous in another direction entirely now what he asked now we take this sucker back to my car to store as evidence she said you carry it youve got the gloves and if there are any latent prints i dont want them messed up id let you take it but since youre a known activist if anyone got probable cause to search you and your property yeah she was right dammit why not just leave it here for the cops to find she tucked the medicinepouch inside her jacket and dusted her hands off before answering him because im afraid it wont be here in the morning she finally said im afraid its going to mysteriously disappear it was meant for me you just happened to fall over it he didnt quite snort at what he would have considered an outrageous statement a few hours ago he simply amended it you or anyone else who might have recognized it for what it was there are supposed to be some ou people here sooner or later it would really look bad to blow one of them up she held one hand over the lump in her jacket where the medicinepouch was and nodded slowly thats true and i cant explain it but i know it was meant for me and i would probably have done just what you started to do if you hadnt gotten there first and sprung the trap i wasnt looking for a trap like that he thought about the sudden avarice that had overcome him at the sight of the pouch and his mouth went dry again this was getting to be a lot more than he had bargained for she continued gesturing for him to pick up the remains of the bomb i didnt even see the bomb until after i spotted you and iahlets just say i used medicine to find out who and what you were he let out his breath in a sigh and shook his head if i say im confusedits been a strange night he gathered up the explosives and the rest of the component parts and followed her presumably shed parked her truck somewhere nearby strange night hell ive been figuring she was just pushing buttons and here she is talking about and using medicine like it was part of her maybe it is yeah that was all she said but it sounded if not conciliatory at least a little less hostile apologize spotted horse get it over with he gritted his teeth then unclenched his jaw and calmed himself enough that the words wouldnt sound forced or false jennie im sorry ive said a lot of stuff that was out of line i think maybe we are on the same side maybe we ought to start at least talking a little more she made a little skeptical sound but she didnt tell him to go jump a cactus finally as they reached a looming shape that turned out to be her little brat she answered put that stuff on the floorboards and follow me home she said sounding more tired than brusque we need to talk chapter eleven jennifer finally sent david back to his motel at about three in the morning after she realized she had begun to repeat herself her eyes felt swollen and they had begun to burn with fatiguealthough grandfather was still wide awake and perfectly prepared to sit in on the discussion if it carried on till dawn at least they were friends againor as much friends as she wary and watching would permit grandfather had helped with that so had the fact that david had apologized david hinted he wouldnt mind staying she ignored the hints he gave her a mournful look as she opened the door for himin the normal fashion this time she blithely waved goodbye and shut the door as soon as he was on the sidewalk she rested her back against the door for a moment then locked it and walked back through the house to her bedroom turning off lights as she went grandfather was already in his room as she passed his door light shone from the crack underneath it just as well she wasnt up to any more deep discussions at the moment at least she and david had achieved a truce if not precisely a reconciliation and at this point she wasnt certain she wanted a reconciliation with all the emotional baggage that came with one she wasnt even certain she wanted a relationship that didnt involve a reconciliation it wasnt as if she didnt have her hands full full in more ways than one she still had the mundane investigation for the insurance company a couple loose ends to wrap up for other clients and her own private investigation of calligan and the looting of the burial ground to deal with the last thing she needed at the moment was david spotted horse on her doorstep or in my bed even if he had completely changed his ways there were still certain demands to be met when one had a lover she closed her bedroom door and shook her head no she said aloud i dont think so not with what grandfather had taken to his room to complicate an already complicated situation david had turned the trap bait and all over to her with only minimal argument the medicinepouch was osage was from one of the plundered cairns and there was no way to tell how it had gotten there or even how long it had been there she had turned it over to grandfather after determining where it had come from handling it was not her concern at the moment there was another car in the back driveit was mooncrows and he was a perfectly good driver he could very easily take the pouch back and reinter it if that was what was needed she shook her head and went straight to bed wondering if she would ever learn anything more than that unfortunately the bomb wasnt likely to tell her much of anything the trigger had been a simple one a trip wire the explosives could be found at any construction site where blasting might be needed including any of calligans in the morning she would dust the bomb for prints but even if she found them unless the owner of said fingerprints had a criminal record it wasnt likely shed find a match her request for a match check would go into a long queue of other similar requests from private agentswhich had a lower priority than the requests from lawenforcement agencies so even if she found prints and the bombmaker did have a criminal record she might never get an id until i after the case was solved or something forced her off of it mooncrow couldnt make anything more of the pouch than she could except to assure her that although watchesovertheland had made it it had not belonged to him in a way that was both reassuring and disappointing it would i have been good to recover at least one of her ancestors looted possessions but she wasnt certain she had whatever it took to handle something once belonging to a shaman as powerful as her forefather had been in the end when she looked at the clock in her headboard and saw the time she realized that all she was going to do now was think in circles almost four in the morning and she knew very well she was completely exhausted she stripped and climbed into bed but once she turned off the lights she stared up at the ceiling unable to go to sleep well i can force myself she thought i can make myself relax if i want to but do i want to obviously theres still something bothering my subconscious i suppose if i dont deal with it it ii be showing up in my dreams i sure as hell dont need that it wasnt hard to figure out what that something was david spotted horse thatswhat hed come back like the proverbial tomcat though tonight hed probably lost one of his nine lives from fright alone hed had a good scare thrown into him by the little people but now that she thought about it she wasnt entirely certain that he had been in real danger after she knocked him on his ass a scare might have been all they intended after that moment they were so unpredictable they were perfectly capable of changing their minds within a few seconds they re almost as contrary as mooncrow hard to tell what they intend from one moment to the next certainly the leader had been willing to listen to her and although he had given in it had been without much of a protest much less a fight was that due to the effectiveness of her protections to her own ability or to the fact that they had decided not to bother with david anymore and accept that she was protecting him there was no way to tell besides asking them and no guarantee that theyd tell the truth if she did oh if david had managed to get himself killed theyd have taken him all right he fit right into the category of those condemned to roam the earth out of the sight of wahkontah there wouldnt have been enough left of him to paint if the bomb had gone off in his face hed have been lawful prey messing with stolen osage relics dying without paint being buried without paintshe had the feeling theyd have had him even if hed been white granted he was a cherokee and normally osage of her forefathers time hadnt much use for the thingonitshead people but these were miahluschka and they were a law unto themselves it didnt take much to wind up swelling their ranks if they decided to take you but after she had saved him from blowing himself to bloody bits and had confronted them they had truly seemed less angry than resigned there hadnt even been any serious argument when she claimed david was already under her protection and implied that he was acting on her behalf they did make certain he saw every single one of them though and they took a great deal of glee in his obvious fear it was probably the first time he had seen something not of the physical world but of the medicine world at least as an adult it had obviously come as quite a shock and she had to admit she had taken just as much enjoyment in his fear as the little people had maybe they knew that maybe that was why they hadnt given her much of a fight so now he was a believerin the little people at least and she thought he might have seen her two spiritechoes as well her medicine womanself and her kestrelself the way he kept giving her strange looks when he thought she wasnt watching was proof enough that he had seen something odd about her grandfather had hinted obliquely at something of the kind and david had gotten a queasy look david hadnt wanted to believe he was one of those for whom the old legends were wonderful but hardly applicable to modern times odd she should have been the one with that attitude she was the one living in the heavy eyebrows world making her living their way she was the one who actually fit into that world at least outwardly he was the activist the rebel who wanted at least a partial return to the old ways but that wasnt the oddest thing shed had to deal with lately on the face of it she was as contrary as mooncrow at least davids experiences had made him a lot more tractable when it came to persuading him that there was a lot more going on with this situation than what appeared on the surface after talking with him for four hours she had to concede that he had changed some over the years he wasnt as much of a chauvinistic brat as he had been he wasnt as narrowminded as shed assumed either he still wasnt going to i win the nobel peace prize by any means but he wasnt as bad as he had been he could compromise he could be flexible when he chose he might even be a useful ally in this mess he could go places she couldnt and calligans men were already talking to him she could get information back to them he could be very useful really she grimaced into the darkness face it jennie you want more than an ally you really didn t want to send him off to his motel tonight not when theres a nice bed in here quite big enough for two well she had wanted to send him away and at the same time she hadnt she hadbecause it gave her a lot of satisfaction to prove to him that not only was he not the hot stud he thought he was but she could resist his blandishments with ridiculous ease as goodlooking as he was he probably had no problem getting all the women he wanted he wasnt used to being turned down particularly not by a woman he thought was already broke to his saddle the brief look of incredulous shock as she closed the door had been worth it the trouble was she had to admit to herself that it had been very difficult to resist him it would have been nice to be able to say that she was going to sleep tonight without any desires more carnal than a yearning for a bowl of the chocolatefudgebrownie ice cream in the freezerbut not even a bowl of ice cream was going to make her forget the way the lamplight gleamed on his hair or the broad shoulders under that black turtleneck or the warmth in his eyes when he looked at her ice cream was no substitute for what she really craved nope youre not a pushover talldeer but youre really going to have to watch your step with him it would have been all too easy to suggest he spend the night instead of driving back across town and then it would have been even easier to suggest that he save his money and move in with her until until what he didnt have any particular place he called home hed made that very clear his folks were uncomfortable with his kind of activism and he was doing his best to keep them out of it by keeping clear of them he had no regular job and everything he owned fit in the trunk of his car so why should he move out again once hed moved in oh no that was too easy a trap to fall into and it was a mistake she didnt intend to make if david spotted horse moved back into her life hed better be prepared to take her as an equal and hed better get a clean bill of health before he does it i dont know where hes beenand i wouldnt even take mooncrows word on the subject of hiv without a test so there and she would want to be certain that he understood all the rules as clearly as she did before anything got any further than colleague still davidmy equal in medicine matters he isnt even in the running she scolded herself he hasnt even got both feet on the path yet oh no if i get involved with him again he had better have it clear that in medicine if i say something im the expert and in pi work too maybe he knows the legal system better than i do but i have my own areas of expertise he has got to understand that and accept it and all the veiled compliments and broad shoulders in the world werent going to change that still finally her libido decided it wasnt going to win the argument with her brain and gave up and she got to sleep calligan had hoped to be called to the mall site by the police some time during the night he was certain his trap would be sprung and the explosion would wake up everyone within a mile of the river when the alarm went off without emergency call he woke feeling vaguely disappointed hed been so positive that the talldeer girl would take the bait hed never been so certain of anything in his life well if not tonight then maybe tomorrow he told himself she cant stay away forever and she cant resist an artifact i left the thing right where anyone prowling would be certain to see itand she would have been looking for exactly that kind of object she just didnt show up thats all no big problem she wont stay away forever probably shes making certain i dont have a night guard on the site ill get her when she finally does show so even though his wife seemed a bit jumpy this morning he ignored her nerves she hadnt slept well for the past several nights and he couldnt get her to take a pill maybe he ought to tell her to go to the doctor except that her restlessness hadnt disturbed his sleep any no no point in making her see a doctor doctor visits were expensive especially for things as intangible as nerves it was probably just hormones anyway women were slaves to their bodies and half the time he thought they enjoyed it that way it gave them excuses to become hysterical he ignored the slight shaking of her hands and the dark circles under her eyes if he ignored this nonsense shed probably drop it no point in reinforcing bad behavior by giving her attention for it he timed his arrival at the site so that he got there a good fifteen minutes before any of the men would that would give him enough time to dismantle the trap and hide it away before anyone got there and became curious hed thought about leaving it in placebut some fool was only too likely to spot the pouch and try to pick it up or worse than a fool a kid messing around where he shouldnt be no it was better to get rid of it during the day he could hide the whole setup easily enough then put it back after everyone was gone that wouldnt be hard the men left the site at quitting time fast the goldbrickers not a minute of unpaid overtime on their sheets but when he got to the ropedoff area and looked down he got a severe jolt the pouch was gone so was the bomb not buried as he thought in his first burst of incredulous thought but completely gone the first thing he thought of was that some stupid critter had decided to mess with it he looked for signs of animal tracks or other disturbances certain that something must have carried the trap off somewhere how an animal would have done that without being blown to bits he had no ideabut mice carried bait off out of traps all the time without springing them and maybe a possum or raccoon had found the pouch and carried the pouch and explosives off maybe a dog had gone after it maybe a cat thought it looked tasty nothing only the signs of enough digging to free the tripwire and bomb and footprints of common sneakers all around his next indignant thought wasthey stole it the bastards stole it im calling the calling who the cops and do what report that an illegal booby trap baited with stolen artifacts had in turn been stolen oh that would be just brilliant now he was glad hed set the thing up wearing gloves if talldeer had taken it well of course she took the pouch who else would have but how in hell did she know it was wired he was absolutely furious his neck and face burned for a moment with rage how had she known and how dared she take his trap and bait another thought occurred to him then as he stared at the place where the bomb had been if she had found it she must want to know who had set it so far he thought he had managed to keep his trail clean the cops didnt consider him enough of a suspect to watch but what about talldeer could she be watching now he got to his feet and dusted his hands off then moved to another area of the ropedoff section trying to look as if he were checking the entire corner for artifacts that might have turned up as the soil settled or something he even brushed at the surface a bit as if he were looking for something the coarse sandy soil came apart as he touched it breaking down into dust hed have a hell of a time getting the stuff off his pants at least she wouldnt be getting any prints off the pouch or the bomb while he didnt exactly have a criminal record he didnt want to take a chance on finding out his prints were on file somewhere the government had files on everybody and with all the computers around these days they were probably doing searches via computer there was always a chance someone somewhere in some lawenforcement agency had filed a set of his prints away hell the local cops might even have them theyd certainly taken a set of prints after theyd dusted the remains of the dozer after the explosion would she get access to that file she might if she had friends in the department after taking his time with his bogus examination he rose to his feet brushed as much of the dust off his pants as he could and finally headed back to the site office as the first of the men arrived lunchpails in hand he nodded to them as they came in just enough that they knew he recognized them not enough to encourage familiarity he retired to his office and sat down at his desk drumming his fingers restlessly on the blotter he watched the men arrive and listened to the phone ring in the secretarys room she was certainly fielding a lot of calls this morning he was annoyed to say the least the talldeer bitch was smarter than he had given her credit for and what was she going to do with his little surprise obviously she was smart enough to disarm it and then take it away presumably to check for prints was she smart enough to realize that it could be used as evidence without prints on it he hoped not or did she take it because she thought some of her own people might have set it and she didnt want to leave any more evidence of sabotage for the law to find or did she take it just so that he couldnt reset it with more bait and a better hiding place like the mice taking the cheese and then running off with the trap so it couldnt be used again hard to say but whichever it was he would have to work to see that she didnt suspect him he had feelers out and none of the information he was getting made him think that the cops thought of him as a likely suspect he had to see to it that talldeer eliminated him from her list too the secretary tapped timidly on his door jarring his concentration come in he said wondering what the problem could be this early in the day and a little irritated with the secretary as well why did she have to slink around like a timid little chipmunk mr calligan sir she said with an air of someone who was bearing bad news almost half the men have called in sick they all say theyre having dizzy spells and their doctors told them not to operate heavy machinery while theyre dizzy she paused a moment then added worriedly they dont know when theyll be back their doctors all want to run tests this is definitely going to put off the completion deadline sir i understand that he snapped as if he were angry glad to finally have one legitimate outlet for his irritation ill deal with it you put an ad in the paper then contact the state employment service and see if you can get me some replacements we need them now if those goldbricks think they can coast and find their jobs waiting for them theyre i going to get a big surprise and theyd better not file for workmans comp either she wouldnt find any experienced men of course after all the bad luck that had been hitting this project only a fool would risk himself or his machinery of course if she did come up with anyone hed find something wrong with most of them hed be conducting the interviews and making the hiring decisions himself but she didnt know that he would be rejecting everyone she found of course she winced away from his obvious anger and retreated back to the safety of her own little cubicle hastily leaving him alone behind his closed door she would have been very surprised to see that he was smiling a moment later so the plan was working the little accidents he had arranged continued to mount up althoughhe frowned there were some things happening that he hadnt arranged things that had no business occurring like those sinkholes opening up under equipment it was almost as though there really was a curse at work no that was stupid thinking shit happened sinkholes opened up all the time and possums would eat almost anything especially if it was greasy no big deal now the workers were calling in sick and some of them were staying off the job he would have to put in some extra work to make certain the roster stayed empty and at the same time put up a convincing show of trying to replace the men gone absent it would take a lot of time going through the motions in order to keep his tracks covered but with any luck the time of year would work for him this late in the building season virtually every heavyequipment operator was booked for the rest of the year those who couldnt make a living here had moved on to other climes surely he could find a way to disqualify everyone who applied he pulled the medicinepouch out of his pocket and stroked it then grinned as the perfect answer occurred to him easy enoughjust get into the records at night and change the phone numbers of those who applied then when shirley gave them their callback shed get wrong numbers noanswers or disconnected messages and if the workers attributed that to the curse as well who cared it would only reinforce what he wanted that would put the project into a delaydelays would continue to mount until it was at least a year behind schedule that shouldnt take long with half the workers already gone he had doubled the time it would take to complete this thingif it even could be completed if anyone from ou ever did get down here that in itself might shut the project down while they sifted dirt in search of nonexistent artifacts then as things looked to be at their worst he would set fire to the office one night within a month or two he would be able to declare bankruptcy and with no records left to betray where the money had all gone he would walk out of there completely clean the indians would get the blame for everything from setting the fires and explosions to breaking the back of the company by walking out on the job the local economy was in pisspoor shape that wouldnt win them any friends in the media two birds with one stone and no one would be likely to be sympathetic to complaints about curses and other superstitious bull when a multimilliondollar project had just gone bellyup people were far more likely to figure statements like that to be halfassed excuses than anything worth a moment of time and consideration and his good buddy at the insurance company would pocket his slice of the pie and pass calligans share on to him a foolproof scheme all he had to do was to stay cool keep his brains about him and get rid of the talldeer woman permanent would be best but it was a dangerous goal now that his initial trap had been sprung he didnt think she suspected him but if he made any more blatant attempts at taking her out the chances of her putting him on her list increased with every try there was no telling what shed told her boss by now he had to make certain she took a fall and that the blame fell on her own people then he could spread some rumors that it had been to silence her that she had been on the verge of discovering an indian gang out here one selling peyote and other drugs to guys on the construction crews yeah that would work hed get her and the people she was trying to protect all at once now that was a sweet scenario and it was one he could even put into motion now his hand went to the desk in front of him and he stroked the old medicinebundle while he thought things through maybe it was already time to plant some of those rumors he picked up the phone and dialed a particular regional talkshow host who was known for his flamboyant nearyellow journalism and his willingness to say anything about anyone so long as it was bad one also known for being something of a bigoted jerk as well whod made his feelings known quite strongly on the subject of indian activism and indianrun highstakes bingo and other gambling he was no friend to the red man arid that would put him right where calligan wanted him the rumors would be flying soon they might even spur some legitimate news investigations that would make things difficult for the talldeer woman and whoever was egging his workers on now well see who the smart one is hi is this bob anger this is rod calligan of calligan construction ive got a story you might be interested in now at last days too late so far as she was concerned jennifer was able to talk freely with calligans exworkers as important to her investigation as the ones who actually saw something when the dozer went up were the ones who had been involved in other accidents not in the leasts because not all of those accidents had the flavor of the little people about them now that she had seen them she honestly didnt think this band of miahluschka was capable of setting explosives or sabotaging hydraulics for all that they were powerful spirits as far as she knew they were limited in what they could do to what they understood and that was important to her investigation there wasnt a one of those she had seen who was even familiar with a muzzleloader much less a bulldozer most of them came from the time of watchesovertheland and before they could understand that the heavy machinery was a threat and cunningly dig pit traps for it to fall into just as they had dug pit traps for wapiti and even the occasional bison when they had been among the living they could not understand that pouring sand into hydraulic fluid reservoirs would ruin a vital part of the machinery they saw that the men on the site guarded and valued the dynamite sticks in the shedwhich were only sticks to them they knew that possums would eat anything particularly if one poured bear fat over it they would not understand that those sticks could be made to release lightning and thunder not that they were stupid and she suspected if anyone ever was around them long enough to teach them the ways of the modern world they would be more of a menace than even she could dream but they were facing something completely alien to the world in which they had lived and died and faced with the alien they could only improvise with what they themselves knew so the questions remained who had raided the burial hill and cached the relics here who had sabotaged the dozer who was continuing to sabotage the site and who had set the trap that had so nearly caught david most of allwere all these acts done by the same hands she had to report back to sleighbow at romulus that if there had been any threats against calligan or the site before the explosion none of his men had ever heard about it so in that much calligan was clear she had no doubt that the man was a snake the stories her mother conveyed from other realtors made that perfectly clear if she looked long and hard enough she would probably find some way in which he had deceived romulus she needed a reason to continue to stay on the case one that would continue to supply a paycheck and one that would let her pursue the answer to her questions it was time to call sleighbow and establish that reason david himself was in her office when she made that call so that he could see and hear just where her loyalties were with his own eyes and ears she put it on speakerphone so he could hear both sides of the conversation mr sleighbow she said as soon as she had identified herself and what he had asked her to investigate i have to be up front with you there are more unanswered questions than answered ones with calligan so far as im concerned but the job you asked me to do is finished i cant find any evidence of any threats to calligan and his property prior to the explosion whatever else is going on he did not deceive romulus in that regard david looked blank he obviously could not see where her statement was leading oh there was a long pause i find your phrasing interesting miss talldeer do you have any reason to think rod calligan has attempted to deceive romulus insurance in any other way she sighed as david frowned and she made an abrupt gesture to him to warn him to be silent let me just say this much mr sleighbow the information i have leads me to think that mr calligan is less than ethical in his business practices he is continuing to suffer accidentssome appear to be outright sabotage and some simply seem to have no possible natural explanation it may be that he has some business rival that he has annoyed or some lessthanlegal associates that he has angered and he is attempting to cover their retribution up by claiming that it is all the work of native american and ecology groups i am not going to attempt to guess what kind of policy he took out with you but i suspect that such a situation would not be covered especially if he deliberately concealed illegal activities and associates you are quite right miss talldeer sleighbow replied his voice even and betraying no emotion and those are interesting speculations theyre only speculations sir she said warningly making a hushing motion at david since he looked ready to jump in again i have not found any evidence to indicate anything of the sort all i have found is that he is considered to be less than ethical by his peers and that there do not appear to have been any terroristtype threats prior to the explosion other than that i can only say that while i have not actually met the man the things i have uncovered would make me unlikely to use his services even if he were the only contractor in the threestate area i certainly would not recommend him to anyone else my personal feelings are that a man like that collects enemies and a man like that may well have been involved with some kind of organized crime figure at some time but that is strictly a personal feeling and i have no facts to justify it and i will admit to a slight prejudice against him because he seems to be attempting to make native americans into scapegoats for what has been happening to him there was a moment of silence punctuated by the ticking of someone using a keyboard i respect and appreciate your candor miss talldeer sleighbow said at last and i also respect the hunches of a private investigator with some experience hunches seldom prove to be as mystical as most people think the keyboard clicks returned ive noted your observations if you have no objection i would like to authorize you to continue to investigate however in light of the fact that there have been more accidents and that you yourself said that you are not nancy drew you may feel free to withdraw and i will find another investigator to take up where you left off david was practically bursting out of his chair but he kept quiet at least jennifer pretended to give the matter a moment of thought although her answer was a foregone conclusion i would like to continue sir she said i hate to leave something half done good a few more clicks signaled a few more keystrokes jennifer was now certain that he was recording this interview and adding it to the records youre on indefinite retainer i respect your honesty enough to be certain you will tell me when you feel your investigation has come to an end two suggestions please dont hesitate to call me if you feel you are in over your head ill see to it that you are fairly compensated and if you do uncover some kind of criminal activity please report it not only to me but to your local police and the states attorney general yes sir she promised with some satisfaction sleighbow hung up then and she took the phone off speaker mode david practically exploded what were you doing he shouted i thought you were didnt i just truthfully manage to get the suspicion away from the rights movement she interrupted yes he said after a moment but what was all that crap about organized crime complete truth just not all the truth she leaned back in her chair and regarded him through narrowed eyes calligan is the kind of man who might be involved with criminals even organized crime i said i didnt have any evidence sleighbow just gave me carte blanche to go look for some so now i have a legitimate reason to continue poking around calligan construction i could hardly mention that id seen the little people while i was poking around calligans site illegally david subsided i guess not he said reluctantly but i dont see why you couldnt do what you want she shrugged i have to have a reason for staying on calligans back if the cops ask she pointed out my own personal curiosity doesnt count and since im indian it could be taken as harassment and thats illegal ive got plenty of evidence that no protest group threatened calligannow i have to prove that there werent threats from sources he wouldnt report its still work david and its work i can do while im checking up on other things she stared up at the ceiling for a moment you know she said half to herself id kind of like to find something to nail calligan to the wall if half of what ive heard about him is true hes long overdue to be nailed i suspect him of being behind bob angers broadcast this morning david looked blank who she blinked and focused on him again you mean you haventoh thats right you havent lived here for a while local talkshow host makes rush limbaugh look like a franciscan monk the only reason he hasnt been sued is because the people he insults are either too poor to sue or he doesnt name names when they have the money for lawyers she reached into her drawer for the padded envelope that had come by messenger from the office of the principal chief of the cherokee nation pulled the cassette out of the envelope and stuck it in her cassette deck this was the broadcast this morning she watched davids face as he listened his expressions running the entire gamut from incredulous to disgusted to angry trying to guess the moment when he would ballistic she was a little off before he could explode she snapped the recorder off theres more where that came from she offered about another fortyfive minutes worth where are you going she added as he launched himself for the door im going to do something about that wilma mankillers office is already handling it she said cutting him off the news that the principal chief of the cherokees was already involved stopped him with his hand on the door they sent me a copy of the tape since i passed the word that im on the case to her office i told them when sleighbow hired me just on the off chance that anyone in cherokee nation had anything useful to tell me that i hadnt already heard on my own oh yeah he said still poised to go out and just what are they doing about it that bigoted jerkoff i mean ignoring it she replied blandly and him what he stared think about it david she said impatiently this idiot is only looking for publicity anything any indian says or does about this is just going to give him more of what he wants a few of the media press went over to wilmas office this morning for her comments fortunately she had a good zinger waiting for them she simply looked at them and said i thought you guys were here for the real news and gave them press releases about the improvements to the tribal police system shes got to be doing more than that david cried jennifer shrugged why she responded this guy is nothing david the only people who believe him are people wed never touch anywaypeople who not only dont have a clue they couldnt buy one if you gave them a roll of quarters weve got a real problem to deal with let wilma handle bob anger if he keeps it up shell find a way to get him put down probably she added thoughtfully by convincing the morning zoo djs to turn both barrels on him what they did to oral roberts is nothing compared to what they can do to him david shook his head but returned to his chair jennifer went back to her list crossing off call sleighbow you know she said after a moment this business with bob anger david looked at her hopefully we should do something about him she shook her head violently god no no now that i think about itit smells like a trap as much of a trap as that medicinepouch was we were meant to lock horns with angerto give his accusations some legitimacy he frowned at her yeah what makes you say that the timing mostly she ignored his growing scorn and took out the cassette tape to stare at it as if by doing so she could make it give up its secrets someone is getting nervous someone knows that you and i are working together now that someone is the person who tipped anger off she glanced at him sharply and before you ask no it isnt just a hunch its my own trained deduction combined with medicine skills i sense the hand of the enemy here and threat from the west the country of war and death here she held up the cassette and shook it for emphasis i see a false wartrail here the enemy has gone elsewhere if we follow the bluff we will lose him david shrank back a little in his chair acutely uncomfortable well if you say so i do she told him firmly he sighed and although she could see that he was struggling against a sharp retort he kept his mouth shut all right he said after a moment whats the plan oh your favorite she pulled out a list and groaned legwork legwork legwork she said sweetly and handed him his half of the list jennifer leaned over the table at kens pizza and batted her eyelashes flirtatiously at the plainclothes officer across from her he batted his eyes right back at her then wiped his mouth with a napkin so jen what is it you want out of me this time he asked you never buy me lunch unless you want something moi she exclaimed in mockhorror want something why wild bill i am crushedl how could you say something like that cant an honest citizen buy lunch for one of tulsas finest without wanting something not when theyre you they cant but wild bill cody a casual friend of jennifers whod recently been promoted to the detective unit didnt look or sound as if he was unhappy about the situation so jennifer decided to continue pursuing the intention that had led her to meet cody at headquarters and invite him to lunch she pouted you eat my pizza you drink my soda then you make terrible accusations that im bribing you statements not accusations he retorted and the threeninetyfive allyoucaneat lunch buffet is below the fivedollar limit that constitutes a bribe as you are well aware so what do you want i dont fix tickets and i dont give out confidential information i know that she said with annoyance all i want is office gossip you used to be in fraud whats the word on rod calligan current or history never mind both i know he took a long pull on his cola and the ice clicked against the plastic when he put it down history is fraud has him on the list of people who might go over the line some day you know people who have enough complaints against them that we figure its worth watching them in case their companies get in trouble and they start looking for creative ways to finance things but you also know that list is real long she nodded thats the way it is around here a lot of people skate on thin ice but never fall in any hint hes ever been involved in the illegal artifact business wild bill shook his head vigorously nothing but the usual contractortype stuff but thats where the current gossip comes in there are a lot of people looking really closely at this explosion of his could be what he says it is profile from the fbi says it also fits with someone whos trying an insurance scam so were stalling other thing is normally when theres real terrorists involved in a bombing someone slips up leaves fingerprints or something that can be traced back to them ormore often than not somebody has to boast about what he did whoever set this one is either real lucky or real slick and terrorists dont fit that profile she nodded wryly uhhuh theyre too busy being passionate and idealistic to be slick gotcha so so were being real careful and calligan is being a real pain because we havent arrested anybody cody played with his glass he doesnt bug the department about it but every time somebody comes around to ask him a couple more questions he always brings it up real resentful the officer gave her a look from under his bushy eyebrows thats off the record anything else is confidential no problem she picked up the check and fished a ten out of her purse to cover it handed both bills to a passing waitress and waved away change cody rose and so did jennifer thats all you wanted he seemed mildly surprised thats all she said cheerfully painless wasnt it wish my dentist was that painless he grinned broadly make sure you call me next time you need office gossip i can always use a free lunch and i can always use a friendly face dont get into any trouble cody she said as they parted at the door and dont forget what my grandfather always says whats that he asked pausing for just a moment dont believe everything you hear she arched her eyebrows significantly at least when it comes from the mouths of guys you have on lists he fired a finger at her gotcha jen be seein you she laughed next time you need a free lunch chapter twelve so another day like the past six same song different verse david glared at the neat little scrap of papertorn off as precisely as if it had been cutand shoved it into his pocket legwork right jennie was awfully fond of sending him off chasing things and half the time he thought it was just to get him out of her hair he wasnt used to being ordered around by a woman much less by one who used to be his girlfriend it was kind of hard to take but jennie just wasnt the same girl he knew back in collegeshe was so serious all the time businesslike impersonal hardly ever smiled for one thing much less laughed except when she was trying to get his goat being sarcastic or trying to give him a hard time she always had some kind of smart answer too and she didnt fit his idea of a real woman anymore not with that cool emotionless attitude of hers like shed been taking lessons from mr spock or something not a hint that they had ever been close she dressed so damned aggressively in jeans leather jackets bootsor really severely tailored suitsno makeup no jewelry nothing feminine she was obviously used to doing everything herself even when he offered to drive her somewhere she declined too damned independent that was what it was she wouldnt give up control for anyone or anything hed tried making suggestions about this case mostly she didnt even give him an argument instead she just ignored them acted as if he hadnt even said anything that was bad enough he was used to people listening to him and asking for directions he didnt like being ignored but what was the most humiliating was that when hed gone ahead and followed through with his own ideas himself what hed tried had usually backfired on him like two days ago when hed tried to tail calligans new foreman the guy whod moved up from assistant after the first foreman went up with the dozer hed figured the foreman probably knew something and tailing him seemed like a good idea after all no one on the whole crew had a better opportunity to plant something like a bomb than the foreman or the foremans assistant the man had spotted him and had tried to lose him stupidly hed tried to keep up that was when the foreman picked up his cellular phone and called the cops too late hed seen the man talking on the handset and looking back at him that was when david figured out what had just happened and had tried to get away at that point the foreman had turned the tables on him and had started tailing him keeping up a running cellular report as he did so the end of that story was inevitable the cops had pulled him over and hed spent the rest of the afternoon at the station while they checked all fifty states for any outstanding warrants on him even parking tickets they didnt find any but when they came back now and again to check on him their file folder with his name on it kept getting thicker and thicker he figured that before the afternoon was over hed cost them a couple hundred bucks in fax charges they couldnt hold him forever without charging him with something but they could keep him for twentyfour hours at least and they didnt have to make his stay comfortable and they had the right to question him every time a new addition to his file came in he could have shut up and demanded an attorney but he figured that would only make things worse they knew he was an activist by now and for all he knew oklahoma had a stalker law he could be charged under or they could try and hold him on suspicion in the calligan sabotage so he chose the appearance of cooperation his story made up out of desperation was that he was trying to see if the foreman was the source of the antiindian stories in some of the papers he knew what jennie would have done to him if he had dared to drag her name in finally they let him go with a warning that any more incidents would leave him open to harassment charges and that oklahoma did indeed have a stalker law he could be prosecuted under but now he was redflagged and he was pretty sure they had that full file on him just waiting for the moment he did something else stupid he hadnt told jennie about the incident he knew what shed say and he wasnt in the mood for i told you so he hadnt tried anything that might get him the attention of the tulsa cops again whenever he suggested she might act along the lines of working medicine she just gave him an opaque look he hadnt dared follow his own suggestions along those lines for one thing he didnt even know where to begin and for another even if he did after his one and only experience with the little people he wasnt too eager to have anything more to do with the spirits this list she had given him nowit was all perfectly ordinary stuff finding out if any osage artifacts had been offered to any of the local galleries antique stores or collectors in the last six months tracking down everyone who was licensed to handle explosives in this area finding out everyone in the area who could be considered an expert on osage culture who wasnt osage interviewing all the men on calligans construction crew to find out if they had seen any person or vehicle hanging around the site a great deal either before or after the explosion it looked like makework or something to keep him occupied while jennie did all the important things he resented that but he didnt dare make the accusation that she was sloughing him off why because she had scared him that was why he had to admit that as well and he resented both the fact and having to admit it she waited patiently for him to say something he sighed with disgust isnt this more along your line he asked patronizingly you could do most of this on the phone i could if i had the time which i dont she replied imitating his tone perfectly if i could afford a secretary it would be his job since there are things to do that only i can get way with like trading information with the cops youre going to have to do the other stuff if you want to get anything accomplished its a fair distribution of effort i have other cases to work on davidi have to make a living no pi of my smalltime stature works fulltime on anything you have the time i dont to do this kind of thing he came very close to wincing when she mentioned the cops and he hoped she didnt notice or had she somehow found out about that little runin hed had was she rubbing it in it would be just like her he thought sourly every time he tried to get into the dominant position with her she just put him right back down againand he had no doubt that if she had learned about the humiliating episode she was saving it for later use one of the guys called me this morning he said after a moment he got his buddy paul fry to keep him posted on whats going down out at the site calligan is trying to replace all the guys calling in sick but it seems like everybody who shows up for an interview is either an alkie or a fake a fake jennie looked up from frantically scribbling something on a pad by the phone what do you mean by a fake he straightened a little pleased to have some knowledge she didnt have according to fry all the ones that have gotten callbacks turn out to have given bad phone numbers either the numbers have been disconnected dont exist or no one on the other end ever heard of the guy who interviewed jennie tapped her eraser on the desktop in a curious and rhythmic pattern for a moment doesnt that strike you as odd she finally asked he made a noncommittal sound i dont know i know billy said it was another sign of the curse on calligan jennie tossed her head so that her hair whipped over her shoulder and snorted right i dont think so not unless that particular lot of miahluschka has learned how to work the phone system it takes a lot of power to fake out the phone lines and a lot more knowledge that i dont think they have she didnt add and i should know but she might just as well have both the authoritative tone of her voice and the fact that she mentioned it could be done at all confirmed his hunch that she had somehow messed with the phone system when he had tried to call her to chew her out and a little cold chill ran up his spine for a moment or two a medicine woman powerful enough to mess with the phone systemwhat did that take anyway was there anything she couldnt do or he caught himself up sharply dammit she did it to me again so what do you think is happening he asked my best guess is that someone might just be sending ringers over to calligan to keep him from filling those slots she gave him a sharp look that someone wouldnt be you would it he brought his head up indignantly me why the hell would i do something like that to keep calligan from filling those slots she said logically those are jobs theoretically being taken away from indians it would be a good way to preserve them until our guys came off the sick list oh damn he wished he had thought of that one no it isnt me then maybe i ought to find out if there really is a plot because i dont think the little people are behind this one neither do i he told herand actually that did agree with the feeling hed gotten when billy told him this morning he was beginning to get a feel for which incidents were caused by the miahluschka and which by purely human hands not that the feeling made him any more comfortable he would really rather not have anything to do with medicine at all except admire the showmanship from afar are you a shaman or are you a showman one of his friends used to ask the people he suspected of fakery or of catering to the supermarket psychic crowd up until last night he would have said that anyone who claimed to be the former was really the latter until now how sure are you about this false trail stuff he asked unwilling to make the concession but also unwilling to let her get away with putting on a show rather than giving him real facts she snorted delicately sure enough to bet my life on not following it she said but if you want more before he had a chance to protest that no he really didnt want any more thank you she had reached into a drawer in her desk and had taken out a little bag of something as she dusted it over her deskblotter and the cassette that lay there chanting under her breath he recognized it as corn pollen the pollen just lay there for a moment a frosting of yellow specks over the dark brown blotterbut then as the hair on the back of his neck began to crawl he saw very clearly that it was moving it crept across the blotter as if each bit of pollen was a tiny insect but an insect moving in a purposeful way it formed into symbols even he could read and last time he had looked there was no scientific power on earth that would make corn pollen crawl into readable patterns a ragged circle around the tape cassette with an uneven slash across it a rough arrow pointing away to the west nothing vague or requiring interpretation if she was calling on medicine spirits for advice she had made certain it was advice he could read as well as she once again his skepticism had been shattered he looked up from his frozen contemplation of the pollen on the blotter to see her watching him sardonically i hope thats enough for you she said without inflection i asked for something you could understand and see for yourself anything more than this youd better ask from grandfather he swallowed with a little difficulty iahthink that will do he replied suddenly the idea of legwork had a lot more appeal over the next several days he had a few more occasions to have his skepticism shattered mostly though she didnt do it on purposebut there were plenty of times he saw thingshalfseen people and animalsaround the house appearing and disappearing without warning once he heard her talking and heard something else answering but when he opened the door to her office there was no one else there it was unnerving to say the least and he kept feeling as if he were offbalance and that everything he had always thought was true had suddenly come into question finally it all became unnerving enough that he couldnt take it anymore something was going to have to break one way or another either he was going to have to leave tulsa give up on this problem and go back to his friends in north dakota or or else he was going to have to take a good look at himself and his world and rethink everything he had accepted as true he didnt make a conscious decision the morning was clear and cool the sky cloudlessand instead of driving to jennies office he found himself taking the opposite direction before long he found himself on a dirt road halfway between catoosa and claremore out in the middle of nowhere without thinking about it he slowed as he came to an area without planted fields or fences it seemed the right place to stop and he pulled over onto the narrow shoulder then left the car where he parked it a narrow drainage ditch lined with young cottonwood trees separated the open field from the road he jumped across it hiked into a quiet spot and sat down on a rock in the sun to think there was a slight breeze and birds called off in the distance but otherwise he might have been completely alone ringed in with tall nodding grasses that towered above his head as he sat there cutting off his sight of anything but their tips and the cloudless blue sky this might be the tallgrass prairie of the days of the buffalo herds no distractions it was a good place to do some thinking hard thinking in fact he lost all track of time as he stared at the sky and the grass tips and thought over everything that had brought him here everything right back to the very day he had left this area in the first place and he came to some hard conclusions he didnt usually act like such an idiot oh maybe he had back when he was still in school but hed had some sense knocked into him since then there just seemed to be something about this entire situation that had been bringing out the worst in him maybe it was being back home maybe it was being around jennie bringing up old baggage and old habits of behavior maybe it was just jennie herself that both irritated him and made him want to strut and bugle like a young buck in rut a bad combination for sure especially given jennies opinions of young bucks strutting and acting like fools there was very little doubt in his mind that jennie was getting a certain amount of enjoyment out of putting him downbut on the other hand every time she did so it was because he was trying to pretend he knew more than she did about either pi work or medicine when he had an opinion on law politics or the movement he honestly had to admit that she listened and acted on his advice when he told her what calligans exemployees had told him she listened and paid attention to what he told her in fact any time he voiced a fact or an opinion in an arena where he did have some real knowledge she listened and used it he didnt deserve the snide way she enjoyed putting him in his place well maybe he did a little but she only did it when he was making a fool of himself when it came right down to it shed changed like hed thought but not in the way that hed thought shed grown up a lot since college and she had sure learned a lot that you couldnt find in classrooms and man it was sure hard to tell that hed done the same with the way hed been acting around her he sat in the sun for a long time just letting it soak into him trying to rearrange his thoughts when it came to jennie to put everything he thought he knew about her on the back burner and try to look at the past few days and weeks as if she were a total stranger several observations immediately sprang to mind she knew her job really knew it the cops respected her enough that they often cut her a fair amount of slack she was making a living at a mans job and at a job that a lot of men couldnt make a living doing back when theyd broken up in college hed said some pretty unforgivable things so maybe some of that enjoyment she was getting at putting him in his place was only payback and when it came to medicineshe was the best hed ever seen except for her grandfather and old man talldeer was better than anyone hed ever heard of outside of stories hed never believed hed watched both of them as they tried to find answers to the questions that baffled them they went at their medicineceremonies with a competence and a calm that reminded him of an expert silversmith that he knew twice hed actually been allowed to participate in a small way it had stopped making him shiver and had started fascinating him even if it wasnt his tribal medicine maybe it was time to make a fresh start with her hed sure taken enough hits to his ego to soften it up for the job funny thing was when he opened his eyes on the field of tallgrass he felt kind of light and more relaxed maybe that ego of his had been heavier than he had thought the feeling of lightness persisted all the way back to town to the point that even though the rushhour traffic was horrible he wasnt upset by it he simply sat calmly behind the wheel and let the traffic move when it wanted to he even let people cut him off without snarling at them he pulled up into the talldeer driveway and saw that jennies little brat was pulled up under the carport he felt a momentary twinge then come on you said you were going to do this now dont back out on it go in apologize tell her you were being an idiot and why apologize for being an idiot when you broke up and ask her to start all over as friends he took a deep breath took the keys out of the ignition and went in from that moment on life becameif not easier certainly easier to take jennie had been surprised by his apology but he had sensed an air of skepticism as if she had been certain his change of attitude wouldnt last but these days he wasnt in the habit of treating other women the way hed treated her since theyd first collided on that doorstep it wasnt so much a change of attitude as it was reestablishing the appropriate attitude he understood her skepticism and he was determined to break it down by proving himself after two days her skepticism had softened into something like a pleased surprise after three days he decided to try dropping the bomb on her he was sitting in her office while she phoned in the results of another one of her investigations to her clientpersonnel checks apparentlythese days a lot of people wanted to know if a prospective employee was in the habit of suing his bosses or had an inordinate number of workmans comp claims the news was good the client was happy and jennie was in a good mood when she hung up and turned to him think you can spare me a couple hours he asked before she could say anything she looked surprised but nodded not warily this time which was a nice change sureyouve been putting in an awful lot of time on our mutual case for me so what do you need he sat back in his chair i needhell this is really hard for me he felt himself actually blushing i sound like some retro hippie or something butive been watching you and grandfather and i needid likei he had planned the whole speech out and now it deserted him along with his confidence jenniei mean maybe i ought to call you by your osage name for this but you never told it to mei wantcan youhelp me he looked up at her hopefully im cherokee and youre not and i know what some of my people did to yours but you and grandfather are the only medicine people i know well enough to ask she blinked at him and for a long moment said nothing then she took a deep breath and said very carefully are you asking me to help you find your spiritual identity he nodded grateful beyond words that she had articulated what he had not been able to oh my she blinked again then suddenly grinned you know your ancestors must be rotating in their graves like highspeed lathes have i ever told you what my people called yours he shook his head her mouth twitched it translates as thingonitsheadpeople because you werent particularly valiant by the arrogant standards of my people nor were you particularly outstanding in any other way and the only way they could think to distinguish you from other nations was by the bandana the cherokees wrapped around their heads she started giggling then and after a moment he saw the joke well if my ancestors are twirling yours are probably trying to beat a path back from the summerlands to whup some sense into your head he replied with a weak laugh that is if youre even considering it considering it she giggled again good god david grandfather actually predicted this two days ago and i didnt believe him how can i not do my best to help you when he said that he was going to oversee the whole shebang the whole shebang began with a threeday fast punctuated with sweatlodge ceremonies which honestly was something he had expected he wasnt completely ignorant of medicine ways after all grandfather talldeerwho he was now supposed to refer to as either mooncrow or little old man insisted that he move into jennies spare room for the duration of the ceremony but he was to bring nothing not even clothing other than what he had on his back the first day of his fast he didnt see jennie at all mooncrow led him through a special bath followed by a long stint in the saunacumsweatlodge the old man was a lot more pragmatic than david had expected handling things very calmly as if he did this sort of thing every day in the old days mooncrow said as he took a seat on the floor of the sauna and poured a dipperful of water over the heated rocks wed have a drummer and a singer in here chanting to put your mind on the right path but these dayswell my drummers in talequah running his gas station and my singers splitting his time between classes and asking do you want fries with that so well have to make do make do david asked wondering what the old man had in mind mooncrow grinned and took a towel off a bright yellow sportsmodel cassette player got to deal with modern ways sometimes this thing doesnt mind the heat and doesnt have a job and a mortgage and kids to feed doesnt get tired either david raised a skeptical eyebrow if it had been his call he would have thought this was way too much like buying a videotape of enlightenment but if mooncrow approved it but the tape mooncrow started was not some synthesizer and panflute whitebread version of a drum chant this was the real thing recorded in a drumcircle not a studio it went straight into his chest and vibrated his entire body his heart throbbed in time with it his whole body swayed in time to it and as mooncrow lit a bundle of sweetgrass for smoke david did not find it at all difficult to fall into the meditative state the old man demanded of him three days of sweats and ritual baths of tales and instruction and in the end it came down to this standing barefoot in the middle of a clearing on some friend of mooncrows private land wearing nothing but a loincloth of the old style and a medicinebag jennie had made for him mooncrow had awakened him this morning long before dawn put him in his old pickup truck and had left him here before the sun rose david was lightheaded from fasting but his mind was clear as clear as the sky overhead and the breeze that brushed his body he felt like an entirely new and different personone with more patience fewer prejudices and the wisdom to know he wasnt perfect if this was a religious revelation wellhe figured he could get to like his new self in a hurry this part of the visionquest was another change from the old days mooncrow told him with some regret in the old days he would have gone straight out into the wilderness from his own village and would have stayed out where he would never see another human traveling in whatever direction the omens sent him until he met his spiritanimal of course mooncrow had added with a chuckle both strong hands holding the steering wheel in the old days you would have done this long ago when you were a boy and you would not have been permitted in the company of men until you had but there was no wilderness near enough to tulsa to permit such a visionquest no place at all in the continental united states where he would not sooner or later encounter some other human if he began wandering so he would remain where he had been left and his spirittotem must come to him along with the lightheadedness of fasting there was the lightheadedness of excitement he had been three days in preparation for this and he had imagined many times what his spiritanimal might be the horse of his family name the pumathe bearthe wolfbest of all the eagle dont focus on what you want thats what mooncrow said he reminded himself dont focus on anything just wait without expectations open yourself to the earth he did not even notice that he had settled crosslegged as easy as a leaf drifting down from the trees he simply found himself sitting instead of standing dismissed that and as mooncrow and jennie had taught him became a part of this little corner of the earth as still and as accepting as the grass he was not even aware of the passing of time except as a change in the shadows and the patterns of shade and sunlight so when the whitetail buck stepped into the clearing and walked straight to him he was not even excited it was a beautiful animal and he was lost in admiration of it sun gleamed on the bucks rustbrown sides making him shine like a living statue of molten copper he was a tenpointer and his rack shone black and bronze gleaming as if it had been polished his huge liquid brown eyes stared directly at david his black patentleather nose twitched as he took in davids scent he picked his way slowly and deliberately across the clearing his ears pointed toward david each hoof placed with such care that the dry leaves barely whispered as he passed at least david was not excited until the deer dipped his nose to look into davids eyes and said well and it certainly took you long enough to see me mooncrow sat on a rock beside him sunlight shining on his crown of gray hair and chuckled the deer hmm david was a little chagrined at the identity of his spiritanimal not disappointed but chagrined after all of mooncrows admonitions not to expect any particular animal he still had fallen into the trap of hoping for something well a little more macho if his spirit animal had to be one of the deer familyit would have been nice to have something like the wapiti the great elk and not the whitetail buck a little more like a power symbol and less like bambi you dont sound surprised david remarked after a moment he had to be gratified by one thing at least it couldnt be more than noon by the sun his spirittotem had revealed itself to him in a very short time he had heard stories of it taking anywhere from one day to a whole week sometimes more the old man smiled giving him a sideways look out of the corner of his eye im not surprised he replied i already knew kestrel saw him the first thing the very first thing that came into his mind was why didnt they tell me it was inevitable if they knew it followed by logic that this whole spiritquest could have been bypassed but he knew why what was the point in telling him this was not some kind of monte hall giveaway this was a quest his quest of selfdiscovery what would the point have been of telling him if they had it would have meant nothing but the second question that occurred to him was to wonder when kestreljenniehad seen his spiritanimal she saw deer trying to warn you the other night the old man went on blandly as david started again was mooncrow some kind of mind reader it was when you almost tripped that bomb and he was trying to get you to leave it alone oh was all he could say mooncrow favored him with another enigmatic smile deer is a very proud creature the old man continued sometimestoo proud he lifts his antlers high and displays for the ladies at times when he should be watching for hunters the scent of a female can make him forget all caution and when he scents another malethat makes him forget everything else but locking horns david flushed and hoped mooncrow wouldnt notice because much as he hated to admit it mooncrows description of deer certainly fit david but those are his vices mooncrow said with a shrug i am certain that you can think of his virtues for yourself but among the children of the middle waters his chief virtues are cleverness speed strength and agility perhaps among your people he has virtues beyond those david shrugged slightly he really didnt know but once again he had to admit that deer certainly fit him he liked to think of himself as being clever and a quick thinker and in school hed been in track and field this does not mean that you are to stop learning spotted horse mooncrow went on serenely your spiritanimal only shows you what you are and will be your guide to the other spiritcreatures from which you must learn every creature has virtues and vices and you must learn to acquire the virtues and conquer the weaknesses reject no spirit as being unable to teach even spider can teach a powerful lesson all things come lo my web and break their necks therein that is why one of our gentes is the gente of the spider and why our women in the old days had the spider tattooed upon their hands or crayfish crayfish gave us the four sacred colors of clay there is nothing so weak and small that it cannot have powerand nothing so powerful that something weak and small cannot overcome it david nodded earnestly and suddenly felt as if he were being watched by hundreds of eyes he looked around covertly he was being watched by hundreds of eyes the clearing was full of animals all listening to mooncrow and nodding their heads in agreement and watching david to see if he was paying attention is this a hallucination or a hallucination is only an uncontrolled glimpse elsewhere spotted horse mooncrow interrupted the thought sometimes the elsewhere is the spirit world sometimes it is only the inside of your own head you should be able to tell the difference soon both can teach you something davids temper flared a little are you a showman or a shaman he snapped without thinking but mooncrow only laughed throwing his head back and crinkling up his eyes then he turned a face full of innocence toward david and said yes just that now so far every person david had met who had ever claimed to be a medicine person would react to that question with varying degrees of anger either shamed anger that he had caught them out or anger that he would even consider that they were not what they claimed to be no one had ever answered him yes to both he couldnt help it he sat and stared incredulously as the animals rustled and stirred and seemed to be laughing too david that is a silly question jennie chided from behind him he turned his head and there she was although he had not seen or heard her approaching like her grandfather she was dressed in jeans and a tshirt although both of them wore eagle feathers in their hair just as he had seen in the triple vision the hard tailfeather on the right side the soft undertail covert dyed red on the left now he knew what that meant that they knew the medicines of both the hunkahand the tzisho and of all of the gentes of both divisions they were medicine people the like of which could not have existed in the old days small wonder the osage on calligans crews respected them so much whys it silly he asked a little belligerently she chuckled because its either or very simplistic but the real situation isnt at all simple for every good shaman has to be a showman as well sometimes people simply wont believe a thing until youve wrapped it up in fancy paper and ribbon and bestowed it with a fireworks display and because in order to counterfeit something that is genuine you have to at least understand the appearance of the genuine every showman has at least a little shaman in him for that matter there is no reason why a showman cant teach you something valuable its perfectly possible to learn all the right lessons from the wrong source if your heart is right or as i tell the kids who come to play nintendo with me mooncrow said his voice still full of warmth and amusement luke skywalker learned as much from darth vader as he did from ben kenobi and yoda he even learned a thing or two from that neerdowell han solo david looked from jennie to her grandfather and back again finally he shook his head you two have been reading too much joseph campbell or you have been reading too little mooncrow countered standing and beckoning to him come jennie has your clothing and the car is ready it is time to go and that so it seemed was that except for the thoughts that ran through his head while they drove him home fed him and put him to bed thoughts that kept him silent danced behind his closed eyes and percolated through his dreams a welter of deer and bear space fighters and ancient warriors his dreams took a turn they never had before he found himself wandering in a virgin wilderness watching listening and then then hiding from a strange black beast that was neither human bird nor animal that walked upon two legs and left the land waste behind it this time smith had called rod calligan rather than the other way around calling him at home rod took the call in his home office after making certain that toni couldnt pick up one of the other phones without him knowing and the question the man asked him rather surprised rod brusque blunt are you getting anywhere with the talldeer chick how close are you to getting rid of her i havent actually seen her once rod said carefully not mentioning the trap the girl had sprung and then taken she hasnt been out to the site that i know of and she hasnt personally questioned anyone whos still on the project i think ive thrown her a couple of fastballs and at least she hasnt been actively interfering no ones called me from your company why because i have an idea smith replied cautiously i want to be certain shes out of the picture before we do anything about it its a way to capitalize a little further on that land of yours as smith outlined his idea calligan began to smile once the mall project was dead smith would come in with a phony holding company and some cash rod would supply the rest smiths company would buy the land for next to nothingland already cleared and waiting ready for any purpose they cared to put it to rod would use his leverage with the county commissioners to get the area opened for a landfill he would look like a good guy making sure that the land was used for something that would produce some county tax revenue and there would be plenty of clean dirt and rock going in therewith all the floodcontrol work going on the dirt dredged up had to go somewhere after all even the treehuggers would be happy if smiths company promised to build a park on it once the landfill was full thats whatll go on during the day smith said and i know theres not much profit there but after hours well be doing something else because john smith had a contact at a drilling company and his contact had a lot of friends just like them wildcatters and independent oil drilling firms were having a hard time keeping their heads above water as it wasand all the piddlyshit regulations about disposing of the chemicals that came out of wells were driving a lot of them under you know anything about drilling smith asked not much calligan admitted the fetishbundle in his pocket seemed to draw his fingers to it the soft leather felt comforting well they have to force water sometimes steam down into slow wells to force the oil up smith told him while he listened intently the water that comes up out of wells along with the oil is full of chemicals from cyanide to polycarbonates many of them very dangerous the old way was to bury or dump the chemicallyloaded water but new regulations say the water has to be cleaned the chemicals removed the marginal drilling firms just cant afford the cost of running an environmentally correct drilling operation thats where we come in so by day the big trucks full of river sand and construction rock would come in and leave piles of sand that would be bulldozed to cover up the barrels of chemicals johns buddies had left there at night thered be big money all around for everyone and by the time anyone found out what was being dumped there he and john smith would be long gone and no one would even be able to prove that they had even known about the illegal dumping in the first place the chemical barrels would be unmarked everything would be in cash no way to trace the payoffs no way even to prove where the chemicals came from it was a beautiful scheme it was no less beautiful in that john had tentatively picked out another site although he had done nothing about acquiring it yet that one would have cost a lot more smith said it would have been a legal hazardous waste site although it wouldnt have been rated for the welded barrels my people were going to bring in the epa would assume those fancy leakproof barrels not welded steel when rod asked him about the second site he discovered he had another reason to buy into smiths plan the other site was very near rods subdivision that would not have been possible to keep under wraps for very long smith said candidly that the operation would be a shortlived one six to eight months at the most before someone found out and pulled the plug it meant high profit but high risk people watchdogged those sites all the time and sooner or later someone would have started asking questions about the trucks coming in after normal operating hours certainly word would have leaked out long before rod was ready to sell his house and pull up stakes word would leak out about the same time the cyanide did he thought amused at his own cleverness it sounds good to me he told smith tell you what if the bitch gets out of hand you think you can give me some help with her i didnt intend to when it was just you and this bankruptcy scheme but if we add in the dumping that makes it worth my time smith replied as rod smiled just say the word i havecontacts the next day it was businessasusual although jennie didnt seem to be lobbying for him to move out of the spare room and back to his motel in fact mooncrow suggested he go check out of the motelfor a while at leastand stay with them to further his education in medicine he didnt need a second invitation it took him less than an hour to get everything moved into the guest room jennie didnt say anything and she had to have noticed it was businessasusual except for an incredible lightness of spirit despite the strange dreams of last night he just couldnt get angry at anyone for anything he ran a few more checks for jennie after hed stashed his stuff in the room while she took care of some smaller cases tracking down spouses whod split and were not paying alimony and he watched and listened to her and mooncrow maybe he was seeing things more clearly now but but under all the teasing the things that seemed like sniping there was a very deep and abiding love between jennie and mooncrow it kind of surprised him in a way he hadnt known they could have a teacherstudent relationship and still have that kind of emotional bond he noticed something else as well mooncrow was worried about somethingabout jenniebut was keeping very quiet about it was it because he respected jennies ability to take care of herself or was it simply to keep from appearing to be an interfering old man if it had been anyone else david would have said it was the latter but not with these two and jennie was beating herself over the head about something something that had nothing to do with any of her current investigations what it was he had no idea but as he watched her all through that day and the next there was at least one thing she was doing that he figured he might be able to cure it was a trap hed fallen into himself often enough to be able to see the same fault in her she was being way too serious all the time it was one thing to make sure the work got done but it was another to let the work take over your life she probably hadnt taken any time out just to have fun in years there was a little tensioncrease between her eyebrows that he wanted badly to smooth away and he wanted to do it because he was her friend and not for any other reason well mostly not anyway finally he just couldnt take it any more he had to try something otherwise he could see her turning herself into a knot in no time flat it was about nine she typed a few things into her computer with the decisive clicks hed come to associate with her finishing for the night there she said shoving the keyboard drawer back under the desktop thats as far as im going to get with this calligan thing tonight then lets go he said quickly before she could say anything about a sauna or early bed or catching the news she blinked at him as if she had forgotten completely that he was there go she said puzzled go where why whats open at this time of night he grinned you like techno he stated he knew he was right hed seen the cds on her shelf and hed heard her listening to the technoindustrial alternativerock radio program from rogers collegeor at least she had before the college administration in their infinite wisdom shut it down so one eyebrow lifted so trust me before she could object he came around to the side of her desk and held out his hand she took it dubiously he pulled her to her feet and led her out the door she got into the passengers side of his car with an expression of puzzled patience it changed to an expression of disbelief when he headed downtown since most of the downtown area locked up by at night most of it he took her to a rave at a club that hadnt been there a month ago and might not be next month in a building that had been everything from a factory to an art gallery they were probably the oldest people there it was hard to tell the lighting was not particularly conducive to taking a good look at peoples faces interesting thing about techno the heavy beat was not all that dissimilar to drumsong he hadnt done any fancydancing in a long time but when the beat caught him up and he found himself gyrating as if he were wearing his old costume he simply let his body do what it wanted to jennie clapped her hands and grinned like a maniac she recognized the moves even if the kids there didnt he wasnt dancing for them anyway he was dancing for her parading like the buck deer before the doe and they both knew it and both were delighted by the sheer silliness of it he drew a crowd anyway a little circle of admirers and when that piece ended and another began jennie got into the act leaping into the circle and matching him beat for beat hed forgotten she used to compete in the shawldancing maybe she had forgotten too until that moment now it was a kind of competition between the two of them but a competition of display where it didnt matter who won or even if there was a winner at all the band gave up before they did but the moment the music ended they tossed sweatsoaked hair out of their eyes and traded a look of agreement this was enough for one night it took a little time to work through the crowd to get to the door and the parking lot david was a little surprised when he stopped under a lotlight and looked at his watch to see that it was already midnight beside him jennie paused to glance at her own watch wow she said in a tone of awe i have more stamina than i thought same here he confessed laughing think we showed those cubs a thing or two well either they decided that we were too crazy to mess with or well have started a new dance craze by morning she replied she stood under the light long enough to pull her hair back and braid it that little frownline was gone at least for the moment and he felt a definite glow of satisfaction at how relaxed and happy she looked can i show you a good time or what he asked smugly a lot better than what you used to think was a good time she retorted a mug of beer a loaf of rhetoric and thou he started to get angry and stopped himself just in time things were going well he wouldnt gain a thing by starting an argument besides she had a point i guess ive loosened up some since then he said mildly and grinned when he saw the blank look on her face the surprise that he hadnt plowed right into a fight you could stand to loosen up some yourself jen she flushed but he realized how she could take that last comment and went on what i mean is you dont have fun enough take some time out for godsake see a movie what was the last movie you saw he knew he had her then when she had to think about it uh beauty and the beast she said i see what i mean he responded triumphantly you havent even gone out for a walk or rented a horse or anything unless it had something to do with your work right she shuffled her feet a little in the gravel of the parking lot i guess so you need more fun in your life he said decisively if you get bleeding ulcers and wind up in the hospital whos gonna put calligan away whos gonna make sure he doesnt sell our people up the river whos gonna keep mooncrow from living on pizza and ice cream all right all right she conceded throwing up her hands i surrender if you want to be the designated makeroffun go right ahead just remember the work has to be done first before we have fun he executed a fancydance step right there in the lot and amazingly didnt fall on his face or turn an ankle in all that gravel she chuckled he took that as a good omen toni calligan put her forehead down on the kitchen table and fought tears she was beginning to think she ought to pack the kids up for the summer and take them someplace safe like maybe a maximumsecurity prison there certainly didnt seem to be any safety around here no one not any of the repairmen shed called had been able to figure just what had gone wrong with the dryer one of them had even accused her of sabotaging it herself hed said it looked as if someone had just gotten in there and cut the insulation off of everything in sight she succeeded in persuading rod to buy a new dryerafter making certain he didnt hear that particular story but that had only been the start of her problems a few days later a fire started in the garage fortunately a neighbor saw it and put it out before it did any damage he really saw it start too hed been taking a break from mowing and told toni he thought hed seen a dog or something run into their garage he described it perfectly a grayishyellow dog with pointed ears and a bushy tail about the size of a spitz since he knew they didnt have a dog and since there was a rabies scare going on hed gone in after it armed with a stick only to see the back corner of the garage go uplike a torch hed said i couldnt believe it one minute everythings fine the next the walls on fire funny thing there was no dog either and it couldnt have gotten past him rod had been livid about that hed been certain shed let the kids play with matches or that shed stored greasy rags there or something and it didnt matter that the only things in that corner were the garden tools it had to be her fault then shed come out into the backyard yesterday just in time to see jill in her sandbox about to pick up a scorpion thank god shed come out when she did no one could believe it not even when they saw the crushed insect for themselves there hadnt been scorpions around ever for as long as this subdivision had been here she certainly set off a round of exterminators though every house in the neighborhood had exterminators poking under it theirs included and now today oh god ryan came in crying not a half hour ago bruised and scraped claiming something had pushed him into the street in front of a car and right behind him came a strange woman with a face as white as tonis had turned corroborating the child he was just standing there like a good boy waiting for me to go by she babbled just standing there all alone i thought just as i got to the corner that it was a good thing he was such a good little boy then suddenly there was a man standing next to him then the poor tyke went flying into the street right in front of me exactly like that man had shoved him from behind then the man was gone and i hit the brakes ryan had only saved himself by rolling then going flat so that the car actually passed over him without hitting him the driver had nearly had a heart attack before he crawled out from under her car she had brought him home herself quickly at that point toni was so close to hysteria herself by then that she actually felt calm she assured the poor woman that everything was all right that no there was no need to leave her name and address that things would be fine she was dead certain that rod would have been on the phone to his lawyerbut she wasnt rod and rod wasnt going to hear about this not if she could help it hed probably find a way to blame her as well as that poor woman anyway after shed somehow said the right things to the stranger and had sent her off to her car babbling gratitude she bathed and bandaged ryans scrapes and put him to bed with cartoons and a bowl of ice cream then she sat herself down at the kitchen table and shook if this kind of thing kept up she was going to need a prescription for valium as soon as she stopped shaking she was suddenly seized with the need to see that the kids were all right she checked on jillshe was still playing safely in the sandbox checked doublechecked and refilled with clean sand and the exterminator had been all over the house and yard this morning rod junior was at a little league practice and those were supervised ryan was asleep she went back to the kitchen slumped in her favorite chair and stared at the wall for a while that was when some of what the stranger had saidand she had dismissedcame back to her ryan had been standing alone at the corner and in this neighborhood there was nothing to hide behind at the corners nothing to make it hard for a driver to see the kids yetryan and the stranger agreed that one moment he had been alone but the next second someone had jumped up behind him and pushed him out into the street then inexplicably the attacker had vanished now the woman was hysterical and ryan was too and in the few seconds it took for the woman to slam on her brakes and run to the front of her car it was perfectly possible for a child a bully who had gone too far to run for the cover of one of the backyards except that both ryan and the woman agreed that it hadnt been a child and this adult would have found it very difficult to hide in a normal suburban neighborhood like theirs for according to both the strangerwho had no reason to make up such a wild story and ryanwho had never lied this adult had not been the kind of person you saw on the street in fact he had been an indian in beads mohawk blanket and leather pants everything but warpaint the next day david talked jennie into giving him some of the paperwork to do so that they could take in a movie the day after he dragged her off to bells amusement park the day after that he varied the routine by kidnapping her for a picnic at lunch it all paid off handsomely that worryline was becoming fainter and she had less of a pinched look about her and there still was no talk of him moving out of the spare room in the meantime he split his time between doing that legwork for herwhich included to his surprise and pleasure being granted some of the surveillance she had been doingand reading the books and private notebooks that mysteriously turned up in his room some of them surprised him stuff he would have thought was far too much along the lines of what youd find in a socalled occult bookstore for mooncrow to have any respect for but then he remembered that business about learning things from unlikely sources and read what had been left him without comment when he wasnt away from the house on one errand or another he watched mooncrow teaching the neighborhood kids without them ever realizing that they were learning anything they just thought he told neat stories and knew how to do excellent things hed even weaned them from nintendo to real archery practice and they liked it sometimes david even helped the old man when he could this morning since jennie didnt have anything for him to do mooncrow had asked him to help with the lessons and hed been pleased to discover that he hadnt lost his knack for the sport he and mooncrow were watching the kids practice their archery with a critical eye when the old man suddenly cleared his throat in a way that usually preceded a lesson david gave him a glance out of the corner of his eye surely he couldnt intend to say anything about medicine in front of these kids but when the words finally came they were not exactly what hed expected you and kestrel have been getting along a lot better mooncrow remarked with such an expression of absolute innocence that david immediately suspected some deeper purpose in the comment it didnt hurt to apologize for some things i said when we broke upand some more i said later he replied very carefully i was out of line both times assuming things i had no business assuming she overreacted buti cant blame her and id have done the same if our positions had been reversed hmm kestrel has a hasty temper like her spiritanimal if you touch her nesting pole she will scold you even before she sees whether or not you intended to climb it mooncrows full attention seemed to be on the kids lined up across the yard with their handmade bows but david knew better however that was the best way hed ever heard of describing jennies tendency to shoot first and sort things out later shes got a lot on her mind david replied feeling as if he ought to defend her people who have bad tempers and know it can usually keep their temper under control unless theyre already handling too much i guess we both know shes a workaholic and this calligan thing is really getting to her theres something going on there a lot more than shows on the surface but we cant seem to get past the surface yet but i cant blame her for being a little short on temper you know true mooncrow sighed i wanted to thank you for getting her to enjoy herself a little more and work a little less it makes her less difficult to live with david had to chuckle at that im not saying a word he replied anything i say is only too likely to get me in trouble he brushed some imaginary dirt off the legs of his jeans and waited for mooncrows reply there would be one the old man wasnt finished yet he sensed it in the way mooncrow kept watching him without seeming to watch him i dont think it would hurt if you two were more than friends mooncrow said at last i dont think it would hurt if you backtracked in some ways to when you were younger he looked slyly at david out of the corner of his eye i cant say id mind if you didnt need that spare room for anything but storing your things david blinked and licked his lips well that was certainly an unexpected development he felt rather stunned i cant say that id be unhappy about things coming around that way he paused for a moment just how would you suggest i go about doing that but mooncrow only shrugged im an old man he replied things are not the same as they were when i courted her grandmother jennie is a warrior in her own right her grandmother was a simpler woman with simpler needs i have no suggestions if i say anything to her she is likely to throw you out she is just as contrary at times as she accuses me of being so it is all in your hands young spotted horse thanks a lot he thought wryly but not with a feeling of being offended he liked mooncrow more than that he trusted the old man far more than he had trusted mooncrow when he had been a child then the old man had just been jennies grandfather who told good stories now he was a teacher a medicine person hmm i wonder if he was suggesting that as jennies grandfather or as mooncrow kestrels teacher it would make a difference he could even be suggesting it as both he would have been a lot more surprised at the oblique suggestion that he heat the situation up if he hadnt already gotten the same hints from another of jennies relatives although he had never thought hed hear mooncrow suggesting he should share jennies bed the other hints had been a lot more pedestrian if i didnt know better little old man he said lightly id suspect you of being a shoka from jennies father oh mooncrow replied far too casually why is that david made a face because i happened to run into him three times in the last weekprobably because he heard on the grapevine that im in your spare room he dropped a few bricksim sure he thinks they were hints mooncrow chuckled at that my son was never known for subtlety he told david some day i must tell you how he proposed to jennies mother but what were these unsubtle hints about nothing muchjust that it seems that the entire family would really approve if jennie and i patched things back up again he shook his head ruefully if these were the old days i have the horrible feeling that instead of me riding out to capture a bride id be the one hogtied and bent over jennies saddlebow giftwrapped by her loving family and at that mooncrow broke into loud and hearty laughter much to davids embarrassment and the surprise of all the kids who turned to see what on earth could be so funny david blushed a little but felt impelled to tell mooncrow all of it however embarrassing it had been he said that jennies mom and brothers always did like me and that everybody wishes things would go back the way they were between us when we first started college he sighed back before we had that big fight and i threw that stupid huey long quote at her anyway i guess she told her father about that only recently mooncrow said serenely she told me about it later after she had brought home the hells angel what david yelped taken completely by surprise the kids turned to look at them again well perhaps he was not a hells angel mooncrow amended but he did have a harley hog and he did belong to a bike club at any rate when i did not approve of the young man she told me what you had said to show me how much better this man treated her i think mooncrow nodded thoughtfully for a moment he did treat her well he admitted but he was too interested in the instant enlightenment and not in real achievement he did not last long oh david said weakly well ah i suppose i wasnt much better i have to admit i even knew at the time that it was a stupid thing to say but but you were strutting and flashing your antlers and she was not sufficiently impressed so you decided to turn the antlers on her mooncrow nodded well you were young young men do stupid things he agreed and sighed mooncrow grinned at him even notsoyoung men do stupid things david he replied and left him on the back steps to go and correct his young archers chapter thirteen jennie locked the door of her office turned up the radio and buried her face in her hands a headache had just begun in one temple the name of her headache washer family right now she was beginning to envy a client of hers who was an orphan just once she would like it very much if no one cared about who she was seeing or not seeing certainly having a family an intelligent and curious family to boot brought with it liabilities like having a yentafor a father she thought sourly head in hands my father the matchmaker he could have sent a shoka in full regalia and been less obvious he could have trotted out the whole family with courting gifts i feel like im in a damn sitcom david they all liked david they were all making it perfectly clear to her how much they liked david and how happy they would be if she and david would just go back to being the happy couple theyd been in college never mind that they really hadnt been all that happy a couple the worst part was it would have been funny if it had been happening to someone else it would even be funny if she didnt like david so much she was getting at least three calls a day from one member of the family or another and before the call was over the topic of david spotted horse would somehow have worked its way into the conversation how was he doing had they gone anywhere together did she think they might come over to claremore for dinner some time in the next couple of days even from her brothers they were going fishing would she and david like to join themthey were going to a powwow would she and david like to come along mothers bad enough but dad is worse her father thought he was being subtle he was about as subtle as a billboard i dont know why he doesnt just rent a billboard she could just see it now out on i fortyeight feet wide sixteen feet tall jennie when are you and david going to at least mooncrow was keeping his mouth shut he kept giving her looks but at least he kept his mouth shut it seemed as if everyone in the talldeer family was trying to throw jennie into davids bedor vice versaand no one was going to take no for an answer she expected that kind of thing out of david after all it wasnt as if he hadnt been hinting but her own family thought they were supposed to want me to preserve my socalled honor not go jumping into some guys bed well she wasnt having any she could be just as stubborn as any of them and she was not by god going to get herded into this as if she were the prize mare and david the champion stud i suppose by now dad has waylaid david at least once telling him how nice it would be if we got back together again she thought forlornly thats probably why hes been looking like a hopeful puppy these past few days the worst part of it was if shed wanted him before now she really had it bad for him this business with finding his spiritual direction was not just for show hed made an enormous amount of progress and it made him all the more attractive to her hed been treating her the way she suspected he normally treated other women as competent equals he at least had managed to unload all that old baggage and start fresh even if she had not shed forgotten deliberately all the things about his personality that had attracted her to him in the first place now all those things were coming back with a vengeance and if he was frustrated as hell sleeping all alone just down the hall from her she was twice as frustrated were just working colleagues she kept telling him she kept trying to convince herself of that we need to keep a certain distance to keep this professional she kept repeating that to herself like a mantra it wasnt working but dammit i will not be herded into something no matter who thinks it would be good for me she buried her face in her hands and massaged her temples you know if the folks would just back off it would be so much easier hes a nice guy hes more than a nice guy ive got the hots for him like ive never had the hots for anyone else i never lost the hots for him if they d leave me alone i could make up my mind about him one way or another if i could just think about this without the pressure and if pigs could fly david finished entering the last of his data into jennies computer and did a backup before turning it off things had been markedly less strained between them since hed been acting more like a big brother than anything else but theyd really improved over the past couple of days she had stopped wincing every time the phone rang it looked as if her folks had gotten the message finally mooncrow promised hed talk to jennies father and get him to back off he thought taking a quick glance at her guess he got through to them hed basically given up on getting back together with her when hed had that little talk with mooncrow asking if the old man would get jennies family to leave her alone hed already cooled his own jets things had been getting so strained that he was afraid she was going to tell him to get lost just to get her family off her back and when it all came down to itthis calligan thing was bigger than either of them she was the only one who had all the right connections to put it all together he was afraid that she needed help she wouldnt get if he had to make tracks so in order to make sure the job got done his own desires needed to go on the back burner forever if that was what it took the last thing i want is to screw things up for her all over again he had decided we make a good working team on this and maybe im assuming too much but i think she needs me if shes going to crack this case without breaking herself she needs two pairs of legs two sets of eyes and indirect contacts to calligans crew i think she can do it alone but it ii put her in the hospital she needs somebody she can delegate work to and somebody she can bounce ideas off of and if he couldnt have anything else he still wanted her as a friend and a medicine mentor he didnt have so many people he called friend that he could afford to lose any of them much less lose one over something as stupid as her family trying to play matchmaker thats it he said as she looked up from a pile of papers ive got it all in there but i havent spotted a pattern of artifact sales that correspond to anything that might have been taken from that gravesite the only things positively identified as osage are a couple of ribbonwork pieces that date to about there were some pots that could have been from the site but they didnt seem old enough she sighed and rubbed her eyes youre getting pretty good at spotting patterns she admitted if you dont see it i dont think i would either she stood up and stretched i need the sauna as the sauna grandfather is doing the medicine work on this hes so much better than i that it isnt funny im going to call it a night he replied he flexed his shoulders i dont know how you can sit here and type for as long as you do my eyes are tired and ive got to meet some of calligans men tomorrow the ones that are still working more accidents already she said in surprise yeahlittle ones but a lot of them he stood up and shoved the chair back under the desk oh mooncrow wants us to take him somewhere tomorrow after i talk to the guys her eyes widened and she nodded as she had mentioned mooncrow had been doing some kind of medicine for the past couple of days looking for something shed said apparently hed found it well go enjoy your steam kiddo he told her and gave her a brotherly he hoped wink and a peck on the cheek youve earned it how about if tomorrow i buy you and mooncrow some lunch she laughed no you dont i know damn good and well that youre on the end of your cash i cant pay you much but at least i can feed you he flushed and shrugged a few weeks ago he would have flatly denied he was in any financial trouble at all a few months ago he would have been angry at her for even suggesting he didnt have everything under control that was then this is now andhey this gives me exactly the opening i need okay i can live with that he leaned back against the wall and tilted his head to one side you said a while back that you needed a secretary or at least someone to help with the routine stuff no reason why i cant hold that particular job down for room and board if you want his reply and the suggestion evidently caught her flatfooted do you really mean that she asked after a moment or are you just putting me on not for a chance to stay here im not call it assistant instead of secretary and id feel better but sure i mean it he told her surprised he hadnt thought of this sooner its no worse than any of the other jobs ive had shoot jennie ive worked at mickie ds ive pumped gas in truck stops ive even washed cars this is cushy compared to those jobs and its sure as hell more of an intellectual stimulus i know some about computers and ive been a paralegal in about five states and where else am i going to get a package that includes room board and medicine training she bit her lip and looked at him as if she were seeing him for the first time you know she replied slowly if i had an assistant i could take on a lot more cases than i do i could train you help you get your pi license we dont make a bad team he snorted hell i think we make a great team if youre willing to make it a little more formal she nodded slowly tell you what lets work out this calligan thing and see if we can keep from killing each other and after we get it wrapped up whatever additional cases i can take in with you as an assistant ill pay you for deal deal he replied instantly and with relief this was something solid and settled hed needed solid for a while he just hadnt figured it out till now she grinned you know youre the one whos going to have to do all the paperwork on yourself quarterlies s the whole bit not a problem now go bake yourself he told her weve both got early starts to make tomorrow she wandered off down the hall he closed up the office and headed in the opposite direction toward the kitchen he got himself a quick snack glanced into the darkened living room and saw that mooncrow had already retired to his room the old man had been working a lot he probably needed a good nights rest more than jennie did at this point medicine sure can take it out of you he thought soberly heading back toward his own room after making certain of all the physical locks on doors and windows and turning off the lights i never knew that either its work as hard as manual labor hell no wonder the old man is in good shape he has to be maybe thats why jennie took tai chi way back when maybe i ought to think about some kind of martial arts class or aerobics or something as he turned off the hall lights he saw that there was no light coming from either the sauna or from under jennies door good he thought with satisfaction she needs the rest ill just do a couple of chapters in that book about the osage and but as he opened his own door and closed it again he froze because he was not alone his hand stuck to the light switch as he heard soft breathing after a moment he lowered it carefully my is tucked right on top of the websters whoever this is dont bother looking for your gun came a whisper from behind him as he stealthily reached toward the top of the bookcase by the door where he kept his automatic i moved it a pair of hands rested on his shoulders for a moment and turned him carefully around i figured your reflexes were as automatic as mine jennie continued with a chuckle and i didnt want to get shot she laughed softly deep in her throat it was the most incredibly sexy laugh hed ever heard he brought his hands up slowly and she fitted herself into his arms jennie what are you doing here he said finally a stupid thing to say but it was the only thing his stupefied brain could come up with sexual harassment she said trying to see if i can get my new secretary to go to bed with me assistant he replied firmly im holding out for assistant i may be easy but im not cheap jennie chuckled again and pulled him over to the bed all right she agreed assistant it is she began unbuttoning his shirt slowly taking the initiative so long as its understood that i am the one seducing you yes bossmaam he replied obediently his fingers touched the top button of her jeans and stopped there by the way if you dont mind my askingwhy now because i dont like to be herded she said fiercely then pulled his face down to hers and kissed him licking the corners of his mouth nibbling his lower lip i dont like conspiraciesespecially when my own family is doing the conspiring i prefer cooperative efforts myself bossmaam he agreed then returned the kiss with interest her skin tingled at the touch of his tongue his technique had definitely improved he pulled away just long enough to ask your safesex or mine mine she replied rattling the little plastic packet she pulled out of the pocket of her jeans im the boss remember she took the upper hand again pulling him down onto the bed and tumbling after pulling his shirt off and starting on his jeans he returned the favor slipping his hands up under her tshirt after that things only got better she couldnt help making thenandnow comparisonsbut they all came out in favor of now this was a double bed not a bunk they didnt have to worry about being caught by the ra or by his or her roommate he was a better more considerate lover so she hoped was she at least shed learned how to make putting on a condom a sensual experience and there was something more now that hadnt been there when they were in college something between them a kind of energy it wasnt passiontheyd had plenty of that before probably too much this was something that carried over into everything made every touch of a fingertip seem doubly intense whatever it was it was wonderful arid even when it was over when they both collapsed in exhaustion it wasnt gone she listened to his heartbeat slow with her ear against his chest and fitted herself into the curve of his arm trying to sort it all out i suppose this means asking for a christmas bonus is out of the question he said conversationally she started to giggle she couldnt help it where the hell did you get this sense of humor she demanded all of a sudden you can laugh at yourselfyou never did that before he took a deep breath and let it out slowly i had it all along i just didnt think thathell i just didnt think period he ran a finger along the side of her face i dont exactly know jennie kestrel maybe thats it i stopped posing with youor when i do pose we both know it does that seem logical as logical as anything she replied thoughtfully funny all of a sudden i feel like im living with my skin off he sighed so do i he replied slowly sleepily so do i ihave to confess something though what that your good behavior is temporary he started to laugh after a moment of silence quietly but it was real laughter how did you guess he asked she snuggled a little closer because it happens to me every time i have a profound medicine experience she confessed in turn i go on really good behavior for a while then well i start to slip back to being a bitch not as big a bitch as i was before butstill there it is im human so are you i guess humans can only be perfect for so long her confession left him quiet for a moment ill make a deal with you he said finally as she hoped he would if you give me a little slack when im being a bastard ill cut you some when youre being a bitch she smiled into the darkness its a deal she replied softly mooncrow seemed neither surprised nor displeased when they both came out of the same room in the morning he simply greeted them both in a very preoccupied way jennie sobered completely forgetting her own faint embarrassment when she caught his mood whatever he expected to learn today it was far more important than who had slept in whose bed last night or any other night for that matter they all three piled into mooncrows car although david was the one who drove following the old mans brief instructions jennie perched in the back seat leaning forward so she could listen to both of them mooncrow guided them out past the airport following i toward catoosa but on the local roads and not the highway they seemed to be tracing the course of mingo creek here mooncrow said suddenly take the next turnoff that proved to be a graveled county road in pretty good shape actually better than she had feared it might be when she saw the gravel it looked as if the county had managed to get most of the roads graveled after the washouts of spring mooncrow sat tensely on the front seat beside david and peered ahead through the windshield it was obvious now why he had wanted david to drive he was looking for something or perhaps he was watching for landmarks not visible to the ordinary eye a crude onelane timbered bridge crossed the creek ahead of them jennies guess about the creek was borne out when the old man told david to stop at the bridge well have to leave the car here off to the side where it wont obstruct anyone mooncrow said finally no one will be along to bother it david simply nodded intuition had told both of them to dress for hiking and now she was glad that they had for mooncrow led them right down to the creek bed where they followed its path for at least a half mile it was pretty rough hiking none of the floodcontrol projects had gotten this far up the creek it was full of downed trees old tires even a dead car rocks ranging from the size of a bowling ball to the size of that old car studded the bottom of the ravine but above their heads jennie winced at the thickets of wild plum and plenitude of blackberry vines the going would be no easier up there finally mooncrow held up his hand as they reached a grove of ancient willows cottonwoods and redbuds he looked around as if he was taking his bearings and then scrambled up the bank using the exposed roots of a willow with a trunk that must have been two feet in diameter david and jennie followed to find him holding to the trunk with one hand as he examined every inch of the ground around the willow frowning she couldnt see anything here and she wasnt prepared to use that inner vision just at the moment the willow that mooncrow stood beneath would probably wash into the creek after a few more big storms fully a third of its roots were exposed across from them was the silted area that had been the old creek bed now it supported a flourishing community of saplings weeds and brush up and down the creek bed was more of the same but mooncrow kept peering around and finally looked down through the mat of willow roots and then he blanched whats wrong little old man jennie asked quickly what have you found it is what i have not found kestrel he replied as david reached out to steady him his voice was strong but his hands were shaking it is what i have not found he sat down then on the roots of the willow jennie joined him with david on the other side you know that i told you how watchesovertheland had defeated an evil man he said jennie nodded this was for davids benefit for he had not heard the story it was needful for him to drown that evil man and then bury him needful to drown him so that his blood could not touch the earth escape and take his spirit with it needful to bury him so that his spirit could not wander so that it would be held in place by the earth if that man had become like the miahluschka he could have found others to work through it was here that our ancestor buried that man with a willow planted over his body to hold him there mooncrows face grew bleak but nothing lasts forever and the willow did not hold him look he pointed down below where the creek had obviously changed its course and undercut the willow see how the water came and washed everything from under the roots the willow i think ate most of the bones as watchesovertheland intended but the evil ones spiritbundle was buried there with him and itit is gone i can feel it david shook his head but jennie felt the blood draining out of her face as well these things these spiritbundles can be doorways mooncrow explained for davids sake they can allow things through them so now the bundle is loose in the world and so is the spirit of that evil man he can work through whoever takes up the bundle and the longer he works through that person the more likely it is that he will be able to take the place of anyone who touches it this is something that he was working toward to be able to live on this earth forever by sending others through his spiritdoor and taking their place davids forehead wrinkled buti dont see the point mooncrow stared down at the water as if he was demanding that it give up its secret and tell him where the bundle was now the point is that this evil one wanted life forever and power and he got his power through hate he will make that hate grow here and now he will poison the earth to give him power over it so wicked was he that he had no spiritanimal he created his own neither bird nor insect neither animal nor serpent he made it out of all of these things so that it would serve him rather than guide him and he made it corrupt so that it would poison all that it touched that is what made him so evil that he would corrupt anything so long as he had dominion over it david stared at the old man his own face going pale and jennie wondered if he too had a dream like hers of a poisoned earth and dead eagles lying in the ashes i had a dream the night of my visionquest he said slowly i was in a place like tulsa but with absolutely no people completely virgin wilderness everything was greatand then thisthis monster came and it was like you just described it wasnt animal or bird but it had pieces of all kinds of things only twisted and distorted wherever it went things just died as it passed i was really afraid and i hid from it mooncrow nodded listening closely and clenched his jaw you are new in your medicine and should not have seen this spiritthing unless it had gotten a great deal of power and it should not have been able to kill things in the spiritworld unless it was as powerful now as it was in our ancestors time jennie felt her heart sink at his words he saw her expression and nodded confirming that her feelings of danger and dread were not misplaced the warm sunlight seemed to thin and a chill crept over her this is a bad thing david mooncrow said then this is a very terrible thing somehow we must find whoever has this spiritbundle we must take it away from him and we must do what our ancestor did so long ago he looked out over the creek and his face was a mask that hid every emotion but determination we must catch the beast david then we must take its power and cage it somehow rod calligan doodled idly on the pad on his desk and weighed out his options he had hoped that hed seen the last of the talldeer girl when he hadnt heard or seen anything at all from her the cops had gone off to pretend they were investigating but there were no real leads and he and they both knew it the pi herself hadnt even set foot on the property once that he could prove maybe he thought she had taken the presence of the trap hedleft as evidence that her people were involved after all and had told the insurance company so or at least she had told them she could not disprove the allegation but it seemed that she was not going to give up after all smith had just called with the bad news that shed been put on indefinite retainer by his company sleighbow was higher up than smith there was nothing smith could do to get her dropped if shed been put on retainer it meant that she had found something suspicious and shed convinced sleighbow that more work needed to be done probably by telling him her suspicions possibly by giving him her evidence very bad news so she was playing her cards very close to her chest so close hed had no inkling shed found anything and she evidently had sources he hadnt traced sooner or later she was going to find something out she had the bomb after all or at least he had to presume she had it so she had at least one piece of real hard evidence that might be traced back to him if she could do that she could argue convincingly that if he had planted one bomb on his own property he could have planted more than one that would be more than enough to start a real investigation with him as the suspect instead of the halfhearted investigation the cops had going now then if anyone started to look closely at the riverside mall project all his layers of concealment would peel away and it would become fairly obvious that the project was marginal at best then if the insurance companyor worse the feds ordered an investigation of their own everything would come tumbling down he reached into his pocket for the fetishbundle it had become something like a worry stone for him and just simply handling it always calmed him this time was no exception as his hand closed around the leather confidence quelled the rising panic there was no real need to worry after all he had run deals along the edge of the shadow before he hadnt ever needed to use final solutions but hed always had them in reserve there was no real difference between planting a trap to get rid of the girl and ordering her hitother than the fact that it took control out of his own hands if the talldeer girl actually had anything on him there would be feds crawling all over here even now so she didnt have anything solid only suspicions you couldnt convict anyone on suspicions hell you couldnt even get an indictment on suspicion so since she wouldnt fall into his traps he was going to have to take the direct approach to getting rid of her even though it would be a bigger risk to delegate that task to someone else tulsa was a bigger city than people realized it had its share of scum and lowlifes if you were truly desperate there were even punks who would fill your contract for as little as fifty bucks but those were generally burnedout druggies and dangerous to use the going rate was about five thousand for a pro but with a pro there would be nothing leaving a trail not with the people rod intended to use those fiftybuck punks were extremely unreliable the fivehundreddollar hit men would sometimes come back looking for blackmail rod had used the latter now and again but never for anything that he could be blackmailed over most smart contractors knew muscle not mafiarelated of course that was out of his league just guys who a hundred years ago would have been rustlers and horse thieves rod used guys like that to strongarm reluctant farmers or homeowners into selling at a reasonable price or to scare tenants into moving without riling complaints with the authorities about substandard construction he knew the right jargon things that sounded perfectly normal on the phone but this time rod would take out his contract with a real workman someone you saw once if at all paid in advance and never heard from again except that the target came down with a bad case of death and it always looked like suicide a hitandrun or another tragic case of random violence pretty girls were raped and killed all the time and if the pretty girl was also a pi well she just had been in the wrong place and hadnt been careful enough itd be good for about two nights on the local news and wouldnt even make the nationals pros didnt leave tracks and they didnt come back after blackmail money it was bad for repeat business smith ought to know some pros in this area hed certainly hinted that he did should he call smith in on this that was the question he rubbed his thumb over the leather of the fetish and looked out the window noting absently the small flock of scrawny black birds in the tree outside funny they were absolutely silent so they werent blackbirds starlings or grackles they were too thin to be ravens and too big to be crows still werent black birds some kind of omen of death maybe that was the sign he ought to move on this let them pick the talldeer girls bones not his he called smith back i need someone he said a reliable tulsa mechanic i think our equipment needs about five grand worth of work i have just the right men smith said john smith hung up the phone jaw clenched and a vein in his temple starting to throb not that he cared if calligan had the chick rubbed out in his opinion it should have been done before this no the real problem was that calligan was stupid and smalltime if things went wrong he could implicate smith noif anything went wrong calligan would implicate smith he would sing so fast and so well theyd put him in the opera even if things didnt go wrong there was no guarantee that calligan would stay quiet he was getting nervous sounded a little hysterical whenever smith said anything about talldeer in fact if hed tried something of his own to get rid of the girl he probably left a pretty messy trail behind him damned amateurs it might not be a bad idea to collect a little insurance of his own he left his desk and took a quick walk outside to a public telephone kiosk not one right outside his building but one further down in the office park he always had a roll of quarters with him just in case he waited ten minutes then called the same number hed given calligan fixers said the voice on the other end i need some custom work done on my car he replied something really special that was the code that he needed a safe line to talk openly give me your number ive got a customer ill call you back brusque businesslike calm these were real professionals probably the best in tulsa they should be theyd taken care of a number of embarrassing little problems for prominent people for instance that evangelist with the awkward and talkative relative smith gave the man the number of the pay phone and hung up a few minutes later it rang about that custom job yeah it was not the same voice he had expected that your people just got a call from a man who wanted an indian girl shut up he said quietly and calmly i sent him to you weve got a deal but hes making me nervous his names rod calligan construction smiths estimation of the men went up a notch he insisted on paymentinperson you want some insurance on him or do you want him shut down smith had thought about that while he made his walk and waited for the phone to ring calligan was still useful insurance he said hes got a wife and kids get rid of his target first then pick up the family maybe get rid of the wife to prove were serious make sure the indians get the blame for all of it so far as the cops are concerned easy but itll take some time to fill calligans contract so it wont happen right away the man replied make your deposit send us the spec sheet on him thatll be fifteen as soon as we get it well open the policy for you and fill your order as soon as we take care of calligans send them all the details on calligan with their fee in cash that meant to their mail drop untraceable cash it would take him a little work to collect the moneyhe had it but he would want to get it in thousanddollar lots from several places to make sure he didnt get sequential bills thatll do fine expect it in a few days he told the man and hung up so much for rod calligan and his little problem you just had to know who to call toni calligan held back tears with the last of her strength she was just about ready to sign herself into the asylum she was afraid to let the kids out of her sight after the attack on ryan things kept happening inexplicable things but worst of all so far as her sanity was concerned they never happened when rod was home rod junior had tattled hed told rod how hed come home to find toni crying at the kitchen table after ryans near accident she had been able to keep rod from finding out about that for maybe five minutes after a brief session of bullying he had the story of the near miss out of her unfortunately she hadnot gotten the strangers name and phone number so there was no one to corroborate her story but ryan now rod was accusing her of making things up and getting ryan and jill to tell the same stories the few incidents that she had evidence of he somehow twisted around to being her fault saying she was careless a bad mother and somehow hed found out what that one repairman had said about the dryer that was when he really lost his temper with her which lately hadnt been very good anyway hed taken it out on her he hit her telling her she deserved it deserved to be punished because she was not only unfit to be the mother of his good son rod but was crazy and was making the other two crazy and he was just going to have to beat the craziness out of her her life had become a nightmare but the real nightmare was not the attacks on her children or even the bruises that rods beating had left the real nightmare was that she was beginning to think he was right she was going crazy she didnt know what else to think after what had happened this afternoon when shed been making spaghetti sauce in the pressure cooker she had just put the pot on the burner she had turned around to pick up a pot holder and had looked up at a sudden movement thinking one of the kids had come in there was an indian in her kitchen an indian with a mohawk some kind of shell necklace around his neck a blanket tied around his waist fringed leather pantscarrying a hatchet with a shiny metal blade in one hand some kind of wooden club in the other and his faceit had such an expression of hate that she shrank back with a little squeak of panic so terrified her voice wouldnt work then he was gone just gone he didnt leave he vanished completely just as ryan appeared in the doorway it couldnt have been more than thirty seconds from the time shed lit the flame to when the indian vanished into thin air she wasnt sure what warned her then some instinct god only knew but the moment ryan appeared she knew something horrible was going to happen and she just leapt on him tackled him and pulled him to the floor right outside the kitchen just as the pressure cooker exploded she got both of them just out of the way of the shrapnel for the pot had literally exploded rather than having the lid blow off she sat there on the floor with ryan and they both cried for a while then she got him calmed down extracted a promise from him not to tell his daddy and ventured into the kitchen there was only one thing to do if she didnt want another lectureor worsefrom rod she had to get the mess cleaned up hide the damage from a cursory examination and get some other kind of dinner going before he got home and how she was going to explain this if he did find out she had no idea maybe she wouldnt have to rod never came into the kitchen if he could help it a few hours with some plaster would take care of the holes in the walls and ceiling and he probably wouldnt notice the dents in the fridge even if he did come in she set to work frantically pulling bits of metal out of the walls scrubbing red saucelike bloodoff the walls the ceiling the floortrying to remember if she had told rod what supper would be she had hell well he would just have to put up with a different kind of sauce she could say it was an experiment she snatched tomato sauce and spices out of the cabinet threw them at random into a pot if it came out tasting funny she could bury it in cheese but the indianshe had to be going crazy no amount of scrubbing would wipe him out of her mind standing there between the table and the fridge long hair trailing down his back staring at her hating her telling her so with his eyes and then vanishing just like a soap bubble she was going crazy she had to be she stopped dead at that thought hands frozen on her scrubbing pads hair trailing into her face if she was crazy could rod be right could she be doing these things herself could she have put the scorpion in the sandbox stripped the insulation from the wires in the dryer turned the heat up under the pressure cooker was she trying to kill her own children she started crying at that silently so as not to alert the children mechanically she went back to scrubbing tears falling to mingle with the soapy water if she was doing all this she didnt remember doing anything butpeople with multiple personalities didnt remember what then other selves did either sybil trudi chase eve they had no idea what their other selves did and they never noticed missing time either the places in their lives where the other personalities took over but then a single ray of hope came to her the woman who had almost hit ryanshe had seen the indian too what was more even if this indian was a personality of her own she couldnt possibly have gotten into a costume down the street pushed ryan in front of the car then sprinted back to her kitchen and shed the costume before ryan and the stranger arrived there she sniffed and wiped her eyes with the back of her hand she had to keep cleaning no matter what she had to keep cleaning cleaning up this mess that was real reality she could cope with this even if the rest of her life was falling apart even if it was the only thing left in her life that she could cope with chapter fourteen jennie wrapped her long hair into a french braid and examined herself carefully in the mirror hmm a little too harsh i think she added a touch of eye shadow better somehow she felt as if she were donningwell not warpaint but possibly bluffpaint the colors the osage put on when they were not taking the path of war but wanted their enemies to think that wahkontah had directed them to do just that on the other hand that was indirectly what she was doing she was about to try to pull off a bluff she was still not certain of all the points in the connection between calligan and the looted gravesite but the little medicinepouch proved he was involved the presence of the miahluschka at the site only confirmed that she and mooncrow had done everything they could she needed some kind of realworld proof that he had at least looted the gravesite based on that and on the bomb she and david had taken she might be able to convince the police and the insurance company that calligan was running some kind of looted artifact scam that he routinely boobytrapped his caches and that his men had accidentally set off one of his bombs it was thin but it was better than watching him get off scotfree something protected calligan mooncrow said so the little people were going after everything near him it stood to reason that they just might be attacking his family at this point if that was the case calligans wife might be willing to talk she might know something so jennie was going on the offensive time to talk to antonia calligan there were any number of explanations for the artifacts and the little people including the possibility that it could be the wife who had looted the site and cached the artifacts this was remote and certainly did not fit the little jenny knew about the woman but still a possibility that should not be dismissed without checking hence the suit and the makeup she wanted to look like someone that antonia would find familiar enough to talk to possibly even confide in meanwhile mooncrow and david had jobs of their own mooncrow was searching the spiritworlds for signs of the evil spirits work it seemed far too coincidental for that spirit to have suddenly been freed at about the same time that calligan looted the sacred ground but whether calligan was under the direct influence of the evil one was still in question david was searching the papers for the same thing going back for six months which is about when mooncrow thought the flood had uncovered the spiritbundle that was missing if they were very lucky it was in the hands of someone who was resistant to it if not well they would play that as it came she gave her hair another pat and headed out would you like another cup of coffee antoniaoh call me toni please calligan asked her dark eyes pleaded with jennie to accept so of course she did tonis kitchen was a warm and homey place eggshellwhite and tan but was curiously marred the immaculate white walls showed slightly discolored patches of very fresh plaster and paint there were odd dents in the metal cabinets and the appliances strange nothing else in the house showed that kind of abuse but it was fairly obvious that the kitchen was the only place where toni felt comfortable jennie wasnt too surprised you could eat off the floors in the living and dining areas but the rooms looked like pictures in a magazine not places where children played and people ate clearly the kitchen was tonis personal domain the only place in the house that was permitted to be less than perfect rod calligans wife wore her dark hair in a pert hamillcut despite three children she was slender under that perky pink sweatsuit but pert and perky were the very last adjectives that jennie would ever apply to her despite a petite figure and a sweet square face hagridden maybe the faint circles under her eyes came from anxiety and jennie would have bet a years income that the reason that the hollows under her cheekbones were there had less to do with weight watchers and far more to do with worry she looked afraid but afraid of what she didnt exactly babble but she spoke nervously running on at length whenever a silence threatened playing with her rings or combing her fingers through her hair what was more jennie had never met anyone so starved for company in her life no that wasnt right not company but a friend toni calligan acted as if she didnt have a single friend of her own female or male anywhere in tulsa maybe she didnt maybe rod calligan didnt permit her to have friends after all friends would take time away from cleaning and housekeeping friends might give her something to think about besides her husband i just dont know that much about rods company jennie toni said somewhat wistfully as she passed over the newly filled cup when antonia became toni jennifer had of course become jennie i wish i did i really dont feel as if im being much help to you jennie had the uncanny feeling of being a mind reader even though her medicine talents did not lie at all in that direction she knew exactly what had put that wistful tone in toni calligans voice it was simple toni wanted her company wanted her to stay around the less toni knew the sooner jennie would leave because jennie obviously wouldnt stay just to keep toni company actually im not so much looking for hard information as you might think toni jennie assured her feeling obscurely sorry for the woman your husband told the company im working for that there were people making threats before and after the bombing youve probably heard who those people were supposed to bemostly native american groups what im looking for is a feeling of something a little offif you remember noticing things being strange around that time period for instance one thing id like to know is if you remember any odd phone calls coming to the house this spring and summer oh no threats toni exclaimed immediately brightening a little because she at least had some information even if it was negative no one called here with any threatsor at least they didnt call the house line rod has a private line for business in his office of course i wouldnt know if he got any threatening calls on that line although he didnt act as if there was anything different going on he was tense but not the way hed be if there was anyone threatening him and how id love to get into that office jennie thought greedily if there are any deep black secrets about rod calligan thats where they ii be ill bet grandfather was right about one thing at least something was protecting rod calligan here she was mere feet away from that office yet she might just as well have been thousands of miles away she was unable to sense anything there it was a complete blank in the middle of the otherwise ordinary house she would have given her hopes of ever being a pipebearer for the key to that office or the chance to get inside but the possibility of that at least at the moment was pretty remote i wasnt thinking of threatening calls actually she said slowly the kind of people who have been implicated in the bombing havei suppose youd call it a sense of honor they would never threaten a woman or a child so you would never hear any threats no what i was thinking was simply strange calls an inordinate number of people who hang up when you answered the phone people who wouldnt identify themselves or give a number for a return call people you didnt recognize that kind of thing tonis brows creased as she thought notthat i noticed she said hesitantly butare you certain these people wouldnt consider hurting a child the strange tone in her voice made jennies senses move to full alertness she picked her words very carefully i said that the people who had been implicated would never consider doing such a thing but i dont suppose it will come as any shock to you that there are some people who would consider a child a very good target children are very innocent very vulnerable carefully kestrel dont say anything that could be taken as disapproval of her husband and dont blurt out anything about the little people im sure you realize that your husband is in a business where people collect enemies and it is possible that one of those people has become angry enough with him to decide to attack him personally rather than through business channels toni paled just a little hes beenvery tense lately she said very on edge and his temper has been awfully short she laughed nervously sometimes he kind of takes it out on me and the kids not little rod but ryan and jill little rod is a lot like his dad but ryan and jill are like me suddenly there was an explanation for tonis longsleeved sweatsuit on a hot june day bruises welts in other words rod was indulging his temper by beating his wife taking it out on you hmm jennie kept her anger tightly under control shed handled enough abuse cases to know that the women involved in an abusive relationship did not want anyone noticing it much less saying something about it they would not admit that it was abuse to themselves they would not listen to anyone who told them it was abuse this must be something new or you wouldnt have mentioned it she replied after taking a sip of coffee right hes always had a temper but its been a little worse lately toni said with another nervous laugh of course we all provoke him its summer so the kids are rowdy and i cant always keep up with their messes but its also his busiest time of year and he doesnt have time to be patient shed heard all that before they always had excuses most of the excuses had been handfed to them by the very spouses who were abusing them great so now i have a classic case of spouse abuse on my hands along with everything else everything else was the miasma of hatred so thick in the kitchen that it was difficult for jennie to sit there calmly sipping coffee only the fact that it was not directed at her made it possible for her to chat pleasantly away and not take to her heels the hatred of the miahluschka hung heavily over this house if they could not have rod calligan directly then they would make him suffer through his family that was the feeling jennie got not a feeling that toni was involved at all but that she was as good a target as a bulldozer one thing jennie was certain of toni calligan was innocent of any wrongdoing which added yet another complication to an already complicated situation first jennie would have to get them out of the line of fire take them away as targets for the little people right now they might simply be causing the same kind of accidents that were happening at the mall site but it was not very likely things would remain that way for much longer not with the bloodhunger she sensed here the little people wanted someone hurt purely and simply getting toni and her kids into safety meant removing them from rod calligans life kids sure are a handful once school closes arent they she said changing the subject to one toni would immediately feel more comfortable with this was going to take time and patience to be certain of protection all ties to calligan would have to be destroyed that could mean a mundane divorce as well as a purification ceremony could she talk toni calligan into so drastic a step maybe she did not speak as a woman who loved her husband but rather as a woman who thought she should love her husband there was a real and distinct difference and if calligan was abusing herthere was a chance time and patience dammit both of which she thought wryly as toni brightened and began talking about her kids i have always been in short supply of it just figures jennie was seeing more of toni calligan now than of david and mooncrow she began coming over after rod calligan had left for the day and stayed at the house for as long as she dared for one thing while she was there the miahluschka werent playing their tricks so at least she was keeping them from hurting anyone for several hours at a time for another toni wasnt just hungry for adult companionship she was starving for it it made jennie angry with calligan all over again how he could reduce an intelligent woman to this state to avoid any trouble for toni she pitched in on the daily decontamination chores she couldnt call it cleaning the space shuttle went through less thorough scrubdowns it soon became clear that all this ultracleanliness was at rods insistence only the childrens rooms and the kitchen and laundry were allowed to look livedin everything else must look as if it was ready for a house beautiful tour at all times regardless of anything else tonis explanation was that rod might have to bring a client in at any moment and that client had to be impressed from the moment he walked in the door but jennie figured that even toni knew better than that just from the hesitant way in which she offered the rather lame explanation this was just one more way that rod controlled his wife and proved his control to others only one room was offlimits the locked office toni didnt even have a key to it every time she came jennie surreptitiously checked the door but it always remained locked and behind that door there was nothing to medicine senses but a black hole frustrating very frustrating still if she could not get into the office she nevertheless had the mission of getting toni and her kids out of rods influence so that the miahluschka would leave them alone she had a foreboding feeling that the little people were losing what little patience they possessed and would start something soon toni started at every odd sound and kept looking for something out of the corner of her eye she might just have started to see them which would mean they were preparing to work some revenge slowly she began planting hints how normal husbands might lose their tempers once in a while but they didnt blame their wives for everything that went wrong and that adult human beings did not take out their frustrations on other humans beings when toni seemed tentatively to be receptive she planted a few more hints describing the womens shelter and some of the women she had taken there for help she began planting other hints as well especially after she learned that toni had some remote cherokee blood in her she told stories over coffee about spiritual or supernatural experiences of any number of people shed known harmless stories mostly involving brief glimpses into the spirit worlds and the like and stressing how people who might think they were hallucinating could very well actually be seeing things that those with less open minds could not jennie was reminded irresistibly of the winter that mooncrow taught her how to make wild birds eat out of her hand she had spent hours at a time sitting in the snow with a handful of sunflower seeds not daring to move hardly daring to breathe while the cardinals titmice and chickadees ventured nearer and nearer eventually her patience had paid off to the point where the birds would swoop down and perch on her hat as soon as they saw her coming could she get this bird to come to her too it might mean more than this case it might mean the saving of a womans sanity and the salvation of her childrens lives jennie did not like the increasingly frightened look in toni calligans eyes whenever she thought she heard her husbands car in the driveway it reminded her more and more of the look she had seen in the eyes of a trapped and helpless deer if the rest of her life had not been so hellish the entrance of jennie talldeer into it would have been cause for celebration for the first time since her marriage to rod toni calligan had a friend she used to have friends she used to have a lot of them but rod had driven them away one by one with his sarcastic remarks and his constant badgering questions other women got tired of being interrogated about where they had been where they were going what they were going to do and did their own husbands and fathers know about it they didnt like the way that rod watched them when he was homeas if he thinks im going to steal the silverware or turn you into a moonie frieda miller had complained they didnt like the remarks that one of her former girlfriends had called sexist but jennie talldeer somehow had a sixth sense for when rod was going to return and she never visited when he was around or left any signs that she had ever been there at all jennie was bright fun to talk to and didnt seem much like a private investigator at all just like one of the girls best of all jennie understood even if some of the things she had to sayabout husbands in general admittedly and never directly accusing rodmade toni acutely uncomfortable then again maybe jennie was simply telling toni in a roundabout way why she was avoiding rod when jennie was gone and toni sat alone over the coffee she had to admit that what jennie said made sense the things rod did to her and to ryan and jillthey just werent right all those cruel taunts and the way he kept trying to frighten ryan under the guise of making the boy tough and the scolding sessions that had gone from words to blows true tonis father had never been a very warm or loving man but he had never hit her mother although he had been just as sarcastic and cutting as rod hed always known what to say to just devastate a person so did rod well that made sense too from what jennie said funny she had never thought what a weapon words could be until jennie pointed it out words could hurt worse than knives because they cut you where it didnt show on the outside on the outside she had begun thinking over things in the leisure granted her by jennies willingness to pitch in and help she often had as much as an hour or two now when she could just sit and think and a lot of her thoughts were very uncomfortable she had to admit if only to herself that rod never had been the prince charming shed thought in fact in a lot of ways he was more like ivan the terrible but shed been so busy what with one thing and another that shed never really thought about how she was less his wife and more like his housekeeper errandrunner and admit it toni punching bag that was how jennie detached but compassionate had described some of her clients women she had met at the womens shelter or women she had taken there they were punching bags for their husbands shed said sighing whenever something went wrong for the man he came home and took it out on her or the kids or both i mean in a way i can almost understand it these guys all had nowhere to go no way to express their anger and frustration and their wives were the only creatures they knew weaker and less powerful than they were its like chickens in a chicken house the big chickens pick on the littler ones and so on down the line until it comes to the last chicken in the chicken house who gets abuse from everybody but that doesnt make it right people arent chickens people know better uncomfortable thinking shed asked toni about what shed done before she married rod pointed out that she could still make a living for herself even if rod wasnt there that was something that hadnt occurred to her in ages and toni had started to wonder just what life would be like without rod around jennie was a pretty smart cookie when it came down to it everything she said made sense shed said other things too things that were beginning to make toni wonder about being crazy or not she had a lot of funny and sometimes notsofunny stories about people whod seen what she called spirits things that werent necessarily ghosts but certainly werent physical and what jennie said about the spirits sure matched those indians toni kept seeing she was seeing them out of the corner of her eye all the time now halfseen shadows or transparent ghostimages sometimes they even showed up when rod was home though never in the same area of the house as he was they seemed to wait to try and catch her alone the only time they werent there was when jennie was visiting toni really wished they would show up then so she could find out if jennie saw them too but they never obliged like a kid they were never there when you wanted them they lurked around the house to the point where she saw them at least twice or three times a night peering in the windows grimacing at her and disappearing when she turned to look straight at them they tended to show up after dark too which made them pretty unnerving she hadnt told jennie about them but it was almost as if jennie knew about them just like she knew about rod without being told anything almost as if she knewand understood thunder growled making them both look up gripes where did that come from jennie talldeer said glancing at her watch and then up at the growing storm outside i really have got to go before this breaks it looks like its going to be hell to drive in toni nodded surreptitiously rubbing her sore wrist hoping jennie wouldnt notice but jennie spotted the movement anyway and raised an eyebrow at her arthritis she asked grateful for the out toni nodded rod had grabbed her wrist and yanked her around last night shaking her the wrist had been swollen this morning it had gone down some but this coming storm made it twinge i guess so toni replied hoping her flush of guilt at lying didnt show it was real sore this morning i hate to think of having arthritis already though it makes me feel so old jennie shrugged my brother broke his ankle fancydancing on uneven ground and it gives him all kinds of hell whenever its about to rain and my fingers hurt sometimes trust me arthritis doesnt care how old you are but i really need to go toni much as i hate to because the minute the rain breaks rod will be coming back home toni thought with a sigh jennie knows but shes too nice to say that she doesnt want to run into him im sure if he knows that shes supposed to be checking him out he ii be nice to her but take it out on me and if he doesnt hell be rotten to her just to get rid of her well thanks for coming over and giving me a hand with everything she said instead and smiled come on ill see you off jennie grimaced as they got outside and saw the true magnitude of the storm on the western horizon the window in the kitchen looked north while this boomer was coming straight out of the west huge black thunderheads loomed thousands of feet up in the air their tops forming the anvil formations that meant dangerous weather to come the roofs of the houses hid the bottoms of the clouds but they wouldnt for long and the angry growl of thunder was testament enough to the amount of lightning hitting the ground at the leading edge of the storm youd better go turn on a radio jennie advised as she got into her little truck keep the tv off though and stay away from the windows this looks like it could brew up a tornado and theres going to be a lot of lightning for sure you might want to get the kids ready to duck into the bathroom if we get a tornado alert ill do that toni said just as the wind picked up with three chilly gusts that sent garbage cans flying into the street and flattened her clothing against her the air was full of rainand ozonesmell youd better get going she added over the distant growl of thunder this may flood the underpasses jennie pulled out with a backward wave she hurried into the backyard to gather up the kids ryan and jill were only too happy to come inside but rod sassed her i want to watch he said its not here yet you think im gonna melt if i get a little wet toni gave his rump a little smack for the sass you get in that house when i tell you to mister she scolded shagging him inside after the other two youre not too big for me to spank you better remember that ryan and jill went to their rooms and she assumed that rod followed she went straight to the kitchen to turn on a radio they didnt have cable anymore and she didnt trust the television in a thunderstorm jennie was right to warn her the antenna that rod had put up before they got cable was too high and he had never taken it down it was on a tower that made it the tallest thing in the neighborhood and whenever there was lightning she was always afraid it would get hit rod laughed at her for her fears but she would never allow the set on during a storm if he wasnt there to insist on it outside the sky turned black and the kitchen went as dark as if the sun were setting she tuned in right in the middle of a national weather service bulletin they were always so scratchy and full of static she had to concentrate to make out what the man was saying strong winds damaging hail severe thunderstorm not even a watch this one as any fool could see was already here no talk of tornadoes though she caught the sound of the television from the living room and hurried in to find young rod messing with it in the gloom of the living room the only light came from the screen you get away from that she snapped i have told you and told you dont use the tv in a thunderstorm i wanta see doppler six radar rod whined defiantly chill out ma nothings gonna happen you talk like some kind of hystric and you act like you want me t grow up t be a fag now thatexcept that the word was hysteric not hystricwas straight from his fathers mouth bad enough to hear it from rodbut this was too much she saw red and was about to give him that spanking she had promisedbut before she could move to give his fanny a real tanning she saw something else instead the indian it rose up from the shadows behind the television set where it had either been lurking or been doing something to the television set ryan came up behind her and grabbed for her hand with a gasp this time the indian did not disappear when she turned her full attention on it she was looking straight at it and although rod didnt seem to see it ryan beside her did and shrank against her whimpering it grinned at her a nasty snide grin like a wolverine she thought crazily like a bear trap likelike the devil just before he takes a soul and it vanished rod was still messing with the television there he said in triumph as the picture came in the channel six weatherman standing in front of an image of a doppler radar scan i need to tune his hand was on the dial just as lightning hit the antenna above them the next half hour was hell on earth toni found herself on the dining room floor ryan beside her with no memory of how they had gotten there she scrambled to her feet and dashed into the living room vaguely aware that every hair on her head was standing on end and feeling a kind of tingle in her hands and feet as if theyd been asleep young rod was collapsed in a heap beside the television the back of the set had blown out and glass shards were embedded in the wall behind the set rods outstretched hand was black and crisped he wasnt moving she didnt scream she didnt panic ryan she said very clearly and out of some kind of unholy calm call tell them your brothers been hit by lightning if our phone doesnt work go next door and use theirs and give them our address if the phone does work make the call then go next door to mrs nebles take jill stay there but ma ryan burbled clearly terrified go now she yelled fiercely and then all her concentration was on the child who needed her she ran across the living room and fell to her knees beside rod she put him over on his back carefully in case there was a spinal injury feeling under his chin for a pulse no pulse no breathing she had never done cpr except on a dummy but it all came back to her now she tilted his head back made sure his airway was clear covered his mouth and nose with her mouth and breathed once twice then pump his chest she didnt need to be too careful he wasnt so small that shed crack his ribs breathe pump breathe pump dont forget to breathe for yourself or you ii pass out at some point she heard sirens over the sound of the pouring rain and the thunder outside she ignored them as she ignored everything else breathe pump breathe hands pulled her away she fought them for a moment until she saw it was the paramedics in their bright yellow slickers then she let them take over surrounding rod with their machines and their expertise other people came crowding in firemen mrs nebles the neighbor with ryan and jill she couldnt see rod for all the bodies around him but she heard the pure tone of a flatlined ekg then heard someone say clear and then everyone pulled away she heard the snap of the fibrillator heard someone curse the flat tone continued she collapsed into the chest of whoever was holding her sobbing as hysterically as her two remaining children she would never forget that horrible unwavering tone for as long as she lived they tried over and over again to get rods heart started but the tame lightning of their machines could not restart what the wild lightning had stopped finally they pronounced rod dead on the scene covered him up with a rubber sheet and took him away into the rain in an ambulance but one with the lights and siren dead she rode in the back with the paramedic holding her hand awkwardly she was no longer crying no longer screaming with the pain of her loss she was numb now after the ambulance ride after the session at the hospital with the doctors and the paperworkhow could they bother with paperwork at a time like thatafter the call to rod missing him by minutes theyd left a policeman at her home the nurses told her patting her hand the policeman would tell him he would come soon to help her with all this but he never came and she stumbled through it all alone thank god mrs nebles had said she would take care of ryan and jill thank god the paramedics had reminded her to bring her purse what she couldnt remember was in the papers she kept in her purse insurance why she had wanted to scream people to notify recounting it all to the police still rod did not come surely he would come and take her home but he didnt come and finally the nurses took pity on her and called the neighbor who had ryan and jill asked mrs nebles to keep the kids overnight then sent her home with another policeman rather than a taxi they probably didnt trust her to remember what her own address was rods car was in the driveway she walked up to the silent darkened house still numb not knowing what she was going to say to him suddenly she was afraid for himhow could he be expected to bear up under this rod was his image his golden child he must be half insane no wonder he hadnt come to the hospital she pulled open the doorand there he was staring at her she opened her mouth the tears starting again but as it happened he didnt give her a chance to say anything he simply dragged her inside face full ofnot the grief she had expected but silent fury he dragged her into the living room to the spot in front of the tv where rod had died he shoved her down on her knees on the spot where he had lain he screamed at her as she knelt there unable to move or think screamed at her that this was all her faultshe was a slut a whore an unfit mothershe had caused rods death to make way for her own favored brats who were probably bastards by some fancy gigolo conceived while he was hard at work trying to make a decent life for them all then when she didnt respond except for silent tears he hit her he knocked her into the wall and she put up her hands ineffectually to defend herself that seemed to infuriate him even further and he pulled her to her feet then balled up both his fists punching her in the face and stomach alternately while she wept and retched and finally dropped into merciful unconsciousness she woke up again lying where she had fallen in the dark and silent house and crawled as far as the bathroom using the sink to haul herself to her feet somehow she got herself cleaned up studiously avoiding looking at herself in the mirror but she could not bear to go to the bedroom not to lie beside the man who had done this to her and blamed her for her own sons death instead clutching her sore stomach she got as far as the little bed in ryans room before she collapsed again face and body throbbing with pain onto the neatly made cotton comforter eventually she slept when she woke the next morning an aching mass of misery inside and but rod was already gone the doorbell rang just as she was putting the finishing touches on a makeup job that she hoped vaguely would disguise the bruises the black eye and the swollen lip and jaw it rang again and she moved carefully to answer it assuming that it must be the neighbor mrs nebles who had taken ryan and jillpoor things they must be hysterical rod hadnt come to get them and only god knew what theyd been told last night but when she opened the door it wasnt the neighbor it was jennie talldeer her expression one of sympathy and haunted guilt a guilt that toni recognized but could not imagine the meaning of there was a handsome longhaired young man standing politely behind her and toni gulped down a surge of nausea and revulsion right now she did not want to see any menhe would think she was to blame he would say that rod had been right to beat her toni we heard on the news this morning andmy god jennie exclaimed her expression transforming from sympathy to shock and outrage what the hell did rod do to you not what happened but what did rod do to you jennie knew it was out in the open between them and toni was too tired to try to hide it anymore he said she began then burst into tears momentarily forgetting the presence of the young man he said it was my fault she sobbed as jennie took her arms and gently led her inside to the kitchen he said it was all my fault and he hit me and godhow badly are you hurt did he touch the kids the young man asked quietly but urgently toni cast a quick glance at him through her tears and to her amazement saw that his expression was identical to jennies shock and outrageand concern nnno she replied with surprise was jennie right toni had thought all men must be like rod but i dddont think so i ththink theyre still next door ill be all right i thththink they traded a look and jennie nodded ill call the womens shelter he said you take care of her then he turned to toni mrs calligan he said very gently touching her hand as if it was something fragile and precious you stay here with jennie were going to get you some help and were going to get you out of this place and we wont let anyone hurt you again she stared after him tears forgotten in pure shock as jennie led her to the kitchen table and sat her down and began to talk to her in a voice of compassion and absolute authority by the time the caseworker from the womens shelter arrived jennie had buried her own feelings of guilt under a powerful load of pure and unadulterated rage toni calligans face was a mass of bruises and welts that no amount of pancake makeup could disguise she had seen women beaten up worse than thisbut they had not been friends david was just as outraged and he was having as hard a time controlling it i want to go track that bastard down and beat him senseless he fumed under his breath as the caseworker spoke to toni calligan thatgod hes not an animal no animal would do something like that stay cool jennie advised him although she was feeling anything but cool herself if you go after him youll not only blow it for toni but youll blow our other case for us remember this is oklahoma everything in a wifebeating case has to be perfect for it to go through he nodded jaw clenched i know that he admitted but i dont like it neither do i she listened with half an ear to what the caseworker was telling toni outlining her options but warning her that they needed around fortyeight hours to get a space cleared for her and the kids at a safe house i need to take you into the bathroom and take pictures the caseworker said compassionately but firmly i need pictures of the bruises on your face and body in good light without makeup well want to get a restraining order filed against your husband and if you decide you want a divorce well need evidence of this beating for both of the judges the one for the restraining order and the one who well be filing the divorce papers with that last had a tentative sound to it jennie knew why this was the moment when fifty percent of the women who had been abused backed out it was just once theyd say he was drunk hes fine when hes sober hell change i know he will but it wasnt just once he never got sober and he never changed not without years of therapy anyway and all too often the ones who walked back into those marriages came out again on a stretcher or a slabjennie more than half expected that faced with the word divorce toni would be one of those fifty percent but instead tonis head came up a little i want a divorce she said thickly he doesnt like ryan and jill if he can blame me forfor her voice broke for just a moment if he can blame me how much longer will it be before he blames them you want the facts the caseworker said with a weary sigh you sound like youve thought this through my guess is maybe a couple of weeks then hell not only beat you hell start pounding them in the name of discipline the man is sick you are not a doctor and its not your job to make him well i want a divorce toni replied i want my babies taken where he cant hurt them and i want a divorce the caseworker met jennies eyes for a moment and gave her a furtive thumbsup before turning back to toni calligan is your life in any immediate danger she asked are the kids can you stick this out for the fortyeight hours we need toni considered this for a moment i think well be all right for that long she replied after a moment i wont change my mind but i think we can keep out of his way good the caseworker took toni into the bathroom for a brief photo session then packed up her forms and her notes im going to go next door and talk to your neighbor and send the kids back here to you if shes willing she can be the one you run to if he does get violent if that happens dont argue with him dont stand there just run tell your kids that if they hear a fight starting they need to run if your neighbor agrees shell lock the door after you and call and one of our rescue people before he has a chance to get any worse ill come get her from next door as soon as the neighbor calls me jennie put in hastily i think that will make the neighbor a little more willing toni cast her a look of pure gratitude and the caseworker stuffed all of her things into her bag and left letting herself out the front door jennie reached over and patted her shoulder ive done this before you know she said conversationally toni youre handling this as well as anyone could expect and better than i would i think youre going to be all right toni dabbed at her eyes with a tissue ii dont know if i am or not she replied an edge of desperation in her voice i just know thatthat this cant go on anymore jennie slid into the place that the caseworker had left vacant and david came to stand beside her one hand on her shoulder she wasnt certain what to say next guilt was replacing her outrage again and she looked up to see that david was studying tonis face her frightened haunted eyes tell her jen he said suddenly tell her about the spirits the miahluschka now she replied taken by surprise toni calligan stopped dabbing her eyes for a moment to fix both of them with a troubled and puzzled look spirits she said falteringly then blurted out you mean like the indian ghosts you told me about david and jennie traded another glance then jennie took a deep breath and began what david wants me to tell you aboutinvolves something that your husband might have done chapter fifteen to jennies intense relief toni calligan listened quietly to her halting explanation of the looted gravesite the little people their burning desire for revenge and how she and her children might have become targets for that revenge she had been afraid that even if toni was in a receptive frame of mind she still would not believe but her words fell on ears that were ready to hear them and the explanations met with nods and worried frowns that was really what i meant when i was talking about the people rod calliganshe avoided calling calligan tonis husbandmight have gotten angry at him the miahluschka have no sense of honor since many of them died without honor anything and anyone is a lawful target to them in fact they are sadistic enough that they might well choose to prolong the punishment they intend for him byby hurting the things around rod calligan before they touch him toni fingered her swollen lip whatwhat if rod hurt those things himself she asked finally wouldnt they think he didnt care about them jennie shrugged i dont know honestly toni i have to tell you many men beat women because they look on their spouses as possessions theirs to do with asthey please as long as rod calligan thinks of you as his possession you are still a good target so far as the miahluschka are concerned she had avoided as many of the complications as she could eliminated the suspicion that rod himself was to blame for many if not all of the accidents at his site and she eliminated mentioning that rod seemed to be protected from the direct revenge of the spirits she concentrated instead on what she knew but could not prove that he had looted the sacred ground that the little people were angry and out for blood his and that of anyone connected with him these things that have been happening are exactly the kind of things the miahluschka are good at and if youve had other kinds of accidents welltheyre experts at arranging that kind of thing she did not mention the dead child although the place around the television set was so full of the influence of the little people that she was catching afterimages out of the corner of her eye every time she looked through the doorway toni nodded all through the narrative hesitantly at first then more and more eagerly finally as jennie finished she asked another question these spirits she said if you can see them do they look like people real people i mean solid sometimes david said slowly trading a look with jennie do they look like indians or like you toni persisted with an edge of desperation in her voice i mean do they have ordinary clothing or like a mohawk haircut leather pants a blanket like modern indians or like ones in a movie or a book they can look like the osage of long ago jennie replied i cant recall ever hearing of one that looked modern or they can look like owls but i dont think youd recognize them in an owlform why do you ask toni calligan shivered because ive been seeing them thats why she told them the words tumbling out one after the other as if she could not stop them tall men with mohawk haircuts and wearing leather pants ryan has too lurking around the houseand sometimes just before something horrible is going to happen explanations spilled out of her then a litany of accidents that were nothing of the kind of the dryer fire the indian man who had pushed ryan into the path of the car the exploding pressure cookerthe indians who had appeared and disappeared the miahluschka who had been haunting the house at night watching from around corners making their presence felt and finally the indian who had risen up out of the corner of the living room as the storm struck young rod playing with the tv in defiance of her orders and the lightning strike on the television antenna just as rods hand was on the dial before she was finished toni was in tears again recalling the horror of that moment and the fruitless attempt to revive her son this time jennie moved over to her side of the table to put her arm around the woman hoping to offer some small measure of support and comfort but this time the tears were for herself as much as for the lost child i thought i was going crazy toni sobbed i thought i was seeing things that maybe i was really the one doing all this and i was so crazy i didnt remember any of it i thought this morning when i woke up that maybe i had electrocuted rod and id hallucinated the whole thing you werent going crazy david said quietly you saw them theyve been after you and after your kids and they finally hit rod calligan right where it hurts most by taking his eldest boy toni ive seen them and a meaner bunch youve never laid eyes on and its all rod calligans fault if anyone killed that child he did but why she asked wiping her eyes why would he berobbing graves he doesnt even like indians the whole time weve lived here we havent been to the gilcrease once david pursed his lips our guess is that rod calligan has been looting gravesites and stealing artifacts then caching them at this mall site planning on digging them up later maybe he figured that if they were found on land he owned he had treasure rights to them and could sell them legitimately there are some people who are willing to pay a lot for indian artifacts but you can sell them for a lot more money if you can sell them legitimately jennie found herself nodding with surprise and approval now that was something she had not thought of but it made sense it made perfect sense in fact it was the first time that all of the pieces had fallen together in this case she gave david a brief but dazzling smile he shrugged but looked rather pleased with himself as well he should be anyway the way we have it figured something went wrong when his own bulldozer uncovered one of the caches david continued maybe he never intended for one to get uncovered maybe it was the fault of the miahluschka maybe they arranged things so that some of his prize loot was pulverized his brow furrowed for a moment i dont exactly know how the bomb fits in there unless calligan boobytrapped the caches like he did the like some of the treasurehunters in south america do jennie hadnt missed the quick rephrasing he had almost mentioned the booby trap they had nearly sprung toni calligan didnt notice anything she was concentrating too hard on the rest of what david had said she seemed particularly interested when david mentioned the mall site as a place where her husband had been burying looted artifacts i always thought there was something funny about that place she replied wiping her swollen eyes that mall i mean rod was so obsessed with it when half the people in town told him it was going to be a disaster because it was on a floodplain she looked up at jennie her expression hardening what youve been basically saying over and over is that you really do think he brought all this on us that youre completely certain that its his fault all this has been happening thats it jennie replied then shrugged you have to take my word for it if youre going to believe in the miahluschka and medicine its very subjective stuff i cant prove most of it i cant even prove the looting none of this would even be enough to bring charges much less to convict him in a court but the miahluschka know theyve tried and convicted him and theyre carrying out the sentence the only problem so far as i am concerned is that they are also carrying it out on you and your children i have one dead child and two who had escapes so narrow it was miraculous toni calligan said the heat of anger creeping into her voice i know whats been happening there is no natural explanation i can believe it i saw that indian myself twice and i can believe rod would rob graves hed rob his own parents graves if he thought there was something good in them he fooled me for a long time and for a lot longer i fooled myself but im not going to delude myself anymore that might just be anger and outrage in the wake of the beating speaking but jennie didnt think so this woman knew rod calligan as well as anyone could this was probably experience talking not anger the bruised face looked determined the hands clenched on her tissue spoke volumes about her feelings its going to take two days before i can get the kids out of here toni continued maria says that i should be very cool and very meek try and stay out of his way as much as possible and act as if i thought i deserved all this so he doesnt suspect that were about to run her jaw tightened and tears started up again anyway im going to be so busy with thetaking care ofi think i can keep myself and the kids out of his way good jennie said but toni wasnt through youve done so much to help she continued i dont know much about what rods been doing but maybe i can find out something for you in the next two days dont do anything that puts you at risk jennie warned a little alarmed she did not want toni hurt worse than she already was youre going to be at risk enough from rod and then theres the miahluschka i have no idea what theyll try next or when cant you do something for her david asked his own eyes dark with concern you got them to leave me alone but she had to shake her head you came into their territory and i was able to bluff them into thinking you were with me she turned to toni i wish i could do something if i could protect you from them i would but while you live in this house under this roof they will not believe me if i try to tell them that you are not a lawful target it will have to wait until you have filed divorce papers that act will resonate into the spirit world divorcing your spirits as well as your marriage then ior better still my grandfather can perform a purification ceremony for you that will take you completely out of rod calligans sphere so far as the spirits are concerned theyve already done so muchmaybe theyll be satisfied for a while toni replied voice tight with unshed tears jennies stomach twisted bad enough that the poor woman had gone through losing her childthe rest of this was torture of the innocent but the miahluschka had no hearts and maybe theyve seen how much rod thinks of me and the other two kids anyway if i can id like to do something she frowned for a moment as if she had suddenly recalled something you know there used to be a couple of cardboard boxes full of some strange things in his office they used to give me the creeps that was just before all this stuff the strange accidents started happening is the stuff there now jennie asked quickly hope rising for that and the chance that the strange things might come from watchesoverthelands grave shed break down the damn office door and to hell with legalities but toni shook her head no she replied dashing jennies hopes again no he took it out right about the time he started locking the door and i havent seen it since i still dont know what was in those boxes all i know is they were really dirty and they werent the kind of thing i ever thought hed have around if it was artifacts hes probably sold them by now david said sotto voce jennie grimaced but he was probably right dont risk your own safety but when it comes to information on rod calligan we could use the inside help jennie told her after a moment every leg up we can get on this case is something we didnt have before id be interested and so would the cops it would be nice to be able to prove he boobytrapped his own land im not sure that he could be charged with manslaughter but at the least he could get reckless endangerment and it would leave things wide open for civil suits by the survivors ill do what i can toni calligan replied her chin up with a look of determination in her eyes that belied the black eye the bruises the swollen lip i promise david took the city bus back to the house to tell mooncrow what had been happening at least now they had a good theory that made all the pieces fit if rod calligan were systematically robbing gravesites and caching the artifacts at the mall to be dug up in the course of excavation it explained just about everything anomalous and it explained the anger of the little people she asked david to write everything down and fax it to sleighbowwith the preface that this was all very speculative and they had no way of proving any of it but she wanted sleighbow to have all the information she did minus the little people of course she was positive that at the least mr sleighbow would find it all very interesting she was rather certain that using insured property for the storage of dubiously acquired artifacts was not covered by calligans policy jennie thought it all the way through on her way to the offices of the womens shelter following behind maria tonis caseworker the little chevette was easy enough to follow even though the streets were crowded as people got out for lunch traffic in tulsa still was never as bad at its worst as it was in dallas at its best the mall site was a bad one although on the surface it might seem to be a good place to put a shopping area granted there was no mall or even a decent shopping center that close to the river this was a highincome area heavily residential a highend shopping mall should have good potential but when you looked close at least according to jennies mother the picture changed existing malls still had plenty of vacancies what with the recession and all a smaller highend shopping complex associated with a hotel was not doing well and it was very near calligans site worse yet there wasnt nearly enough access the streets were predominantly residential and a plan to increase riverside drive to six lanes was controversial and being fought by the local residents this site was after all on a floodplain and her mothers tips from the local real estate grapevine said that reason alone had kept people away he didnt even have a quarter of the shops booked but he owned the land free and clear and david said just before he left that he thought oklahoma property rights included treasurehunter rights to whatever was found there maria was a cautious driver that made her easier to follow she never ran yellow lights much to the annoyance of those behind her and although jennie already knew the way she was glad to have the excuse to go slowly it gave her the opportunity to think this through david had explained the law as he understood it cautioning that he had not looked up oklahoma law yet if calligan had treasure rights that meant that valuable artifacts that seemed to have been cached there under oklahoma law belonged to calligan unless someone could come along with proof of ownership or proof that the objects had been stolen or both and if that was the case it also accounted for the fact that hed just buried them there rather than making it look like a legitimate burial site under oklahoma law remains had to be reburied in an appropriate place if they were dug up in the course of construction but something that was obviously a cache site came under the heading of treasure even if there were bones cached with it the bones alone would be reinterred what was with them became simple property since sacred pipes and fetishbundles didnt exactly come with id numbers or registration cards there was no way on earth or heaven that jennie could prove the artifacts calligan had came from the looted graves so assume that this was what he had done calligan would have the right to sell them probably for a lot of money if there had been a wahhopeh bundle for instance well there werent many of those in white hands and none in the hands of private collectors selling them on the black market would get him a lot of money but being able to claim them with the force of the law on his side would allow him to put objects up for bid openly which would mean a lot more money than if hed had to sell them privately so he gets his loot and makes obvious caches on his land now how does that fit in with the bomb and just as importantly how does that fit in with the stuff that was bulldozed that was the part that puzzled her wait a minute the more public his discovery the less likely it will be for someone to think he looted the stuff so say he makes one cache of relatively worthless pieces of broken pottery and bones and has his men dig it up then he fights the work stoppage so it looks as if he didnt know the stuff was there when the archeologists say it was a cache rather than a burial site he orders work shut down does his own excavations and uncovers more caches these a lot more valuable than the stuff his crew ruined he sells it all in legitimate circles and makes back ten times what he spent on the canceled mall it was a beautiful scheme and the only thing that had ruined it was the bomb which still didnt fit in it was a bright red piece in the middle of the green puzzle and it stuck out in all directions so why the explosionwell he probably boobytrapped his caches like david said only the miahluschka moved one of the bombs or else the explosion was something not even he knew was going to happen maybe a business rival whatever he decided to capitalize on it and blame it on us that way the cops wouldnt be looking for more booby traps the explanation for the one that nearly got david was easy enough he probably set that one right out in the open to get me as soon as he found out i was working on the case hed kill a lot of birds with one stone hed get me out of his hair get another bombing he could blame on the movement put up more smoke and mirrors to hide what was really going on she nodded to herself as she pulled into the shelter parking lot it all made perfect sense and it certainly explained calligans insistence on continuing with a project that was doomed to failure calligan was a lot of things but stupid wasnt one of them but he didnt plan on the miahluschka and he didnt plan on me she thought grimly as she got out of her car to join the shelter caseworker who was waiting for her lets just see if between us we can bring him down the office of the womens shelter was a madhouse there were always a hundred kinds of crisis going on each one worse than the last yet somehow amid all the chaos things did get done it took a long time to get as maria toni calligans caseworker put it all the ducks in a row oklahoma was a state riddled with antique laws and outmoded assumptions it was for instance a commonlaw state live together with someone for seven months in such a way that everyone knew you were sharing a bed and you were commonlaw spouses and liable for each others debts under the law for that matter check into the same motel room and you were automatically commonlaw spouses if one of you wasnt already married this was not such a good thing so far as spousal abuse was concerned in marias words in oklahoma unless you can get witnesses and documentation that the abuse went past simply slappin her around to larn her you dont get protection or a divorce judges especially older male judges were not inclined to take abuse seriously if there was nothing but one womans word against a man they were too inclined to believe that the little woman was just angry with her hubbie and trying to get a little attention for herself so the neighbors testimony had to be taken then jennies as well as marias and tonis jennie had to swear that the pictures maria had taken were undoctored and had been taken exactly the way maria said they were david had to come in long enough to make a statement which was good news as far as jennie was concerned she got a chance to tell him her speculations and to warn him she thought that she was going to be here for a while he got a chance to tell her that the assumptions he had made about oklahoma treasure law were correct once all the documentation was in order they still werent done a lawyer had to draw up the preliminary papers a judge had to review them and the evidence and besides all that the safe house had to be located and room made for toni and the kids marias guess of fortyeight hours was based not on the fact that she knew they had a place but that it would take that long to locate one for her all that took time and it was well after ten when the last of the ducks were properly lined up and jennie could go home she was exhausted but it didnt stop her mind from working another rather nasty thought had occurred to her after david had gone back to mooncrow to make sure he didnt gorge himself on pizza all this time they had been assuming that the appearance of the evil one had nothing to do with rod calligan but what if they were wrong what if rod calligan had taken the evil ones spiritbundle what if it had been the evil one who had been behind the looting of watchesoverthelands gravegoods she had put the thought out of her mind while she and maria worked on the more mundane matter of getting toni calligan out of her husbands hands but it came back to her as she walked out to her truck the lighting was very good here in a place where mostly women worked and where angry men might want to come after them still although the shadows were small they seemed all the darker for that she thought she saw vague birdshaped things watching her from the trees not owlssomething more like starved crows except their legs and necks were all wrong and not miahluschka either she would have seen them while if there really was something there it was doing its best to make sure she couldnt see it the back of her neck crawled and she was very happy to get to the brat she got in and locked the doors quickly and started the engine the familiar surroundings made her jitters seem silly and she shook her head at herself frowning as she worked through all the implications of that last speculation what if calligan had gotten the spiritbundle with some other loot orwhat if he had even picked it up all by itself after it washed down mingo creek the evil one would certainly have known where jennies ancestor was just as mooncrow had pointed out he would have been delighted to assist in the desecration what if calligan was the instrument through which the evil one was working what if all this was because of the evil one and not just calligans own greed a nasty thought a very nasty thought but it would explain the bomb because the evil one wouldnt care if calligans own people died he thrived on creating the maximum harm to everyone no matter whose side they were on he had no allies not really and anyone who thought he was an ally was deluding himself she pulled out of the lot and headed down the relatively deserted street her frown deepening the evil one would find a ready enough instrument in rod calligan that was for sure the man purely didnt give a shit about anyone but himself he was positioned very well to do an incredible amount of damage to the native american population of the area right now her hands tightened on the steering wheel and she drove paying only scant attention to the road taking backstreets to avoid the lights calligan already had some people convinced it was the indians whod blown up his dozer it wouldnt take much to get another good chunk of the previously uncommitted population on his side convincing one decent journalist would do that he could undo everything any of the tribal leaders had done in this state he could get at the oklahoma legislature easily enough and get them to try to restrict native sovereignty that would mean that indianrun gaming could be shut down for instance something that the fundamentalist groups were already agitating for any forms of tribal income other than arts and crafts could and would be shut down that would cut off a lot of funding for all kinds of education and healthcare projects and plenty more say goodbye to tribal police for instance he could by playing this whole situation right set indian rights back by fifty years or more or at the very least he could see that it all got tied up until it had to go in front of the supreme court that would take years to settle if it ever got settled at all and meanwhile even if they won before the court they would still lose in terms of public opinion it hadnt been that long ago that a kid had to hide the fact that he was an indian if he didnt want trouble if he wanted decent treatment and a decent job if calligan and the evil one were really working together pretty soon it wouldnt just be yellow journalists like anger who were badmouthing native americans she was so wrapped up in these unpleasant speculations that she didnt even realize she was being followed until she pulled onto pine and finally noticed that the car behind her had been there since shed left the womens shelter parking lot a chill ran down her back and she clenched the steering wheel it could just be a coincidencebut why not check she made a couple of really odd turns and felt another thread of cold fear trickle down her spine when the car behind her did the same her gut tightened and she looked at the darkened houses around her knowing there was no help coming from them not in this neighborhood they were following her whoever whatever they were and they didnt care if she knew it someone from calligan trying to scare her off by roughing her up possibly not carjackers her brat wasnt worth taking but for a woman alone there were other possibilities all of them nasty sure she knew martial arts but that wouldnt help her much against two men bigger than she was now she wished shed had the three thousand for that evasivedriving course shit she would be on the side of town where there wasnt a police station and in north tulsa sadly the only time the cops came was if shots were fired this wasnt the worst neighborhood in town but it wasnt the kind where anybody paid any attention when someone yelled for help and i didnt bring my gun because i thought we were calling on a bereaved mother i didnt plan on being out ms late i didnt plan on being alone too late now there was only one thing to do try to lose them speed and hope a cop stopped her shed gladly risk a ticket then just as her foot came down on the accelerator and she passed the limit by five miles per hour a red light popped up from the dash of that sinister dark car behind her and all her adrenaline flowed away in a rush of mingled relief and disgust oh hell an unmarked car cruising for easy fish and quick tickets for the monthly quota and i fell right into it i should have known better than to go through this area at the end of the month she didnt know whether to laugh or curse she pulled the brat over to the side of the road stopped as the car behind her followed her like a shark following the scent of blood turned off the ignition and rolled down her window just enough to pass her license through the car behind her stopped just behind her rear bumper by a couple of feet the light on the dash went out although they left their headlights on and a bulky figure in a uniform and hat got out of the drivers side she squinted at him through the back window trying to make out what he looked like against the light odd that was an awfully large car for a cruiser that didnt look exactly like the tulsa pd uniformthere was something wrong with the shape of the shoulder patch and why werent there extra lights behind the grill the driver paused just short of her door as she tried to identify the make of the car she handed out her license but the cop did not take it get out of the car please miss the man said in a calm and neutral voice alarm threaded her nerves all over again wait a minute they dont ask you to get out of the car on a routine traffic stop she glanced back again and got a better look at the car it was a lincoln there wasnt a city in the country that could afford lincoln town cars for unmarked units too late her moment of hesitation gave her away the last thing she saw as she reached for the keys to start the car and get out of there was the club swinging at her window the last thing she remembered was throwing up her hands to protect her face from the club and the shower of safetyglass fragments the last thing she felt was a blow to the side of her head followed by an explosion of stars and oblivion think thisll do jim asked as bob slowed the car at the top of the dam at lake keystone bob squinted down through the darkness at the little spit of park below keystone dam you sure theyre planning on opening the gates around two he asked his partner absolutely jim said theyre going to do a major water release it was on all the news programs itll send all the garbage thats been collecting under the dam downriver by the time they find her shell be under the twentyfirst street bridge if they find her at all freds leaving the truck at riverside park theyll never know where she went unless she floats up tom grunted in the backseat lets get this over with he said in a calm and dispassionate voice i dont like doing a job in the open like this too big a chance somebodyll come by bob took the lincoln down past the dam then made the unmarked turnoff that led to the tiny park after they made the turn there was a small sign that advised that the park was closed after nine in the evening but he ignored it there was no gate and with the economy as bad around here as it was there was no money to spare for cops to patrol this area that made it a good place to do a job if hed had more time he would have gotten a fourwheel drive vehicle and taken the mark down a little further to an access road and the sand and gravel works it would have been just as easy to get rid of her there with less chance of discovery but beggars couldnt be choosers besides tom still had on his uniform they still had the dashlight if anyone came by they could claim to be police looking for pushers that would get kids to clear out fast and kids looking to neck or score would be all that would show up out here this time of night the parking lot at the foot of the dam was completely in shadow he pulled the lincoln in under the shelter of some trees just in case and the three of them got out the mark moved a little when they opened the trunk but tom was good with that club she was still pretty much out and her facial cuts had all been superficial enough that paper towels theyd put over her face and under her head had blotted up all the blood those would go into the river with her calligan the pervert had wanted them to rape her before they got rid of her asshole didnt he know that semen samples were as good as fingerprints for catching somebody and what if they got blood on themselves they had to think of these things you never knew what a body was going to do sometimes things got screwed up and some kid found a stiff while it was still fresh you just didnt leave anything of yourself behind that was the rule that was why all three of them wore surgical gloves crewcuts common shoes a size bigger than they usually wore and brand new clothing besides bob didnt screw stiffs and this one was the next thing to being a stiff well this was going to be quick clean and professional and screw calligan none of the three got any jollies out of pain or terror with luck she wouldnt even fight them toni rolled up his sleeves and pants picked her up wrapped in the garbage bag theyd lined the trunk with she whimpered a little he ignored her carrying her like a roll of carpet over one shoulder there was a good place down at the end of the parking lot all gravel no sand to hold tracks the other two didnt bother with saving their clothing it came from kmart and it would all be thrown in the goodwill bin as soon as they got back to tulsa there was a gym bag with jeans sneakers and tshirts in the backseat she started to come to just as they reached the water she really woke up when they put her in the water was a lot colder than hed thought it would be hardly much above freezing strange it shouldnt have been that cold the cold water woke her up and that was when she put up as much of a fight as she could not much of one really she was tiny and there were three of them to hold her down they held her under until she stopped struggling and stopped bubbling then tom noticed the lights of a car on the other side of the dam no point in taking chances he observed bob agreed quick clean professional get out before anyone sees you leave nothing that can be traced they got into the lincoln and left bob noticed the lights of a car pulling into the access road in his rearview mirror and congratulated himself on a clean getaway so dying wasnt really that bad after all curiously after the lungs stopped straining for air there was no pain only weariness and complete detachment kestrel perched in a tree high above keystone dam and watched her murderers with a dispassionate eye as if she were watching a movie that she knew she would not see the end of no doubt about it they were professional she hadnt even guessed that they werent cops until it was too late they had the light the uniform even the regulation billy club not that it was particularly hard to buy any of that stuff through catalogs but if you wanted to get rid of a mark without a fight that was the way to do it funny though that they brought her all the way here just above the eagle nesting grounds to finish the job ironic in fact they probably would never even be implicated she was certain that the car would undergo a complete cleaning and vacuuming as soon as they took it back to tulsa they had been careful not to let so much as a thread of theirs adhere to her or anything of hers touch the car wrapping her in a common industrialsized garbage bag which they left in the river in a way she could even admire them as one admired any professional they were good probably the best in the area and the solution to a number of deaths which had always seemed rather odd to her suddenly presented itself as the three men got into their car and drove away with the lights still off she flipped her wings a little to settle them and continued to watch there didnt seem to be any urgency in going anywhere anymore she might as well watch and see what happened next mostly she was tired and rather numb the flood of complete fear that had taken her over at the end seemed to have exhausted every other emotion but to her mild surprise another car came screaming down the access road at a rather dangerous speed not more than a minute after the lincoln left it was hard to tell cars in the dark and from above but this one looked rather familiar then as the doors flew open and david flung himself out of the drivers side she recognized it as her grandfathers poor david just a little too late she felt as if she should be angry that they hadnt come sooner butit just didnt seem important anymore in fact there wasnt much that was important anymore when you came right down to it kestrel yawned a little and blinked feeling vaguely restless shouldnt i be going somewhere david went right to the spot where shed been left as if she were iron and he was a magnet with mooncrow right behind him he pulled her out limp and dripping and began frantic cpr it would make a lovely dramatic scene in a movie she sighed too late love she knew shed been under too long nothing not even a miracle would revive her now if hed had her in the light shed have been blue at first she thought that mooncrow was simply frozen with shock but then she realized as she saw his spiritshape forming over his head that he had gone into a medicine trance he stood like a statue while a misty shape wisped upward becoming more and more solid until at last there was a glistening bird hovering just above his head he was wearing his white crowself and when he looked up and saw her in the treetops he arrowed up toward her but something was holding him away his wings pumped furiously but he made no progress toward her he changed to a raven and the results were no better his wingbeats slowed his wings seemed to get heavier and he dropped back toward the ground back to his body she shifted from foot to foot restively with growing unhappiness surely she should be going somewhere she didnt want to stay here anymore watching mooncrow try to reach her watching david crying and trying to force life back into a lifeless body huge wings shadowed the moon for a moment the tree shook as something landed just above her she turned her head sharply and eagle peered down at her his great beak gaping in greeting immediately her unrest settled this must be what she had been waiting for a guide to the summer country well little sister he said she thrilled at the sound of his voice in her mind the first real emotion she had felt since she found herself perching here she bobbed her head modestly greeting to you great one do you come to guide me he turned his head to peer at her from his other eye do you wish guidance he replied watching her closely you have much still to do here tahahkahe cannot deal with the tangle of the evil one nor can your grandfather not alone at first she was confused by the osage name deerwithbranchinghorns until she remembered davids spiritquest and what his spiritanimal had proved to be of course eagle would not use anything but davids osage spirit name and david would not know what it was in osage it was too bad she could not give it to him now she felt a vague regret and a dim sorrow as she saw how david was weeping over her even as he continued to blow futile air into lungs that would get no use from it and tried to force life into a heart that had ceased to beat but eagles point needed to be addressed great one i fear that the time for action is gone for this one the spirithouse below is beyond repair there will be brain damage after so much time without heart beating and lungs breathing again she felt a vague emotion this time anger if wahkontah wanted her to do something about calligan and the evil one shouldnt he have brought help a little sooner but eagle laughed silently his beak open and his thin tongue showing would i have come to remind you of your duty if the spirithouse were unusable he asked you know how chill the water is i need not explain it to you and whatever else is wrong i will see it taken care of as he spoke a warm golden glow haloed him a hint of the sunlight in the midst of the night she bowed her head down to her toes at that humbly overcome with deep awe there was no doubt in her mind that she was in the presence of one of the great spirits a messenger of wahkontah as she had named him what he pledged would come to be for he had the authority to make it so he turned his head to look down below and sighed there is the small matter of tahahkahe as well he observed david was clearly at the end of his rope she had never imagined him losing control to anything but anger and to see him in hysteria was something of a shock small perhaps in the larger view but if you are gone from his lifehe may lose his way and he will surely lose his focus he loves you you love him together you form a balanced whole should this not count for something but there is a larger matter at hand as well he spread his wings and in their shadow she saw whatmightbe she saw toni calligan dead and dumped into an oil pit by the same men who had murdered her she saw rod calligan galvanizing opinion against the native americans as she had already imagined she saw calligan and another man turning the abandoned mall site into a dumping ground for toxic waste saw the entire ecosystem along the arkansas river destroyed poisoned with the first to go being the bald eagles nesting here she saw the toxins spreading all through the ground water until even the local wells were poisoned and wildlife vanished but then she saw what was behind it all the evil one who had grown powerful enough that he had the ability to split small bits of himself into the independent forms of his choosing and what he had chosen were three black birds birds that even appeared in the waking world to act as his eyes and ears there he intended to infuse rod ryan and jill calligan with the spirits of his black birds using them he would destroy the native americans he hated the whites he despised he had studied rod calligan and he would gain power through the accumulation of money and influence specializing in the destruction and poisoning of the earth of the lives of humans who had no idea he even existed he would reducelife to the misery all too often depicted in fiction he had seen and read that fiction and it had amused him he planned to use it as his pattern to make it into a reality it would be all too easy to do people were accustomed to being miserable and would not notice one more increment of misery they were used to the mediocre they were already doing what they were told he would gain control so gradually that no one would notice in the general population and those who would take note he would destroy through rod calligan for as long as the man lasted and then through his children eagle folded his wings and she came back to the present but found herself looking deeply into his golden eye where she saw herself reflected without distortion kestrel who had cut herself off from her emotions living her life totally by reason and logicuntil david came back and led her into the habit of feeling again who had concentrated all of her life on the job as if simply living wasnt as important as the job who had most of all been unwilling to give up control and let outside forces and purposes take it even for the briefest of periods as if by always being in control she would always be able to do exactly the right thing and would never ever make a mistake and all because she was afraid to lose control afraid to make those mistakes that had to be made if you were going to be a person and not a machine eagle blinked and she found herself looking into his eye again seeing the laughter there laughter that suddenly became too much to resist well little sister eagle said mildly have you seen at last the lesson that held you back for so long are you ready to take a new path and perhaps share it with the young male deer well staying in control sure hasnt worked she laughed and how i could have been afraid to make mistakes eagle grinned then you will return she laughed even harder at her own absurdity of course she agreed and suddenly she was freezingly cold with stones biting into her back ribs and head aching horribly lungs afire coughing up water and laughing even as her lungs burned and her heart pounded jennie david caught her up in his arms babbling crying holding her and pounding her back to help her cough up the rest of lake keystone all at the same time she managed to get her arms around him still alternately laughing and coughing he stopped pounding just long enough to kiss her and she tasted the salt of his tears mixed with the river water mooncrow covered her with a blanket wiped her face and hair with a towel saying nothing but grinning with tears on his face and david just held her as if he wanted to keep her there forever his shoulders shaking with fear and cold and griefturnedjoy and sheshe let him she and mooncrow kept glancing at each other all during the ride home and giggling have to explain it to poor david she thought more than once he obviously thought they were both still hysterical he just drove he had no intention of stopping until he got them both home and he kept his eyes on the road and both hands on the wheel even though he clearly would much have preferred to trade places with mooncrow in the backseat but jennie shared a joke with her grandfather that would be very hard to explain it wasnt so much a joke as it was a stateofmind relief for one thing a knowledge shared the absurdity of how she had been blocking herself and how easy it had been once she saw what mooncrow had been trying to tell her heyoka she would say to him and theyd both break up heyoka yourself he would reply and it would start all over again in fact they really didnt stop laughing until they got home which was just as well since as long as she was laughing her head didnt hurt quite so much david insisted on carrying her into the house still wrapped in mooncrows prize blanket her grandfather followed as david carried her to her room and laid her gently on the bed take these he ordered handing her pills and a bottle of orange juice what are these timerelease contrarycapsules she asked and set him snickering again no he replied through the little snorts vitamins aspirin and antibiotics she raised a rebellious eyebrow at that but david took them from mooncrow and sat down on the bed beside her holding out the juice you either take them or i give them to you he said sternly mooncrow is right you dont need pneumonia on top of everything else and when you get done taking the pills you go to sleep but mooncrow waved that off before jennie could object no first she must tell us what happened to her he said all that she learned you and i know only what my vision told us that she had been attacked and taken to the dam not who and what and why there was something about the inflection of his voice that made even david sigh but bow to his will and jennie took the pills she told them all that had happened or all that she could at any rate most of her experience with eagle simply didnt translate well into words especially the parts about the evil one and his plans so she left that part out said simply that she had been there watching and stuck to what she knew about the hit men especially that toni calligan was next on their list david looked skeptical at first but after a while he began nodding it helped that she was able to describe in detail everything that he had been doing i wont pretend to understand half of this he said finally then glanced over at mooncrow i guess its enough that the little old man does it is enough for now mooncrow murmured jennie leaned back against the pillows they had heaped up behind her and sighed now that it was all outshe felt absolutely spent and very much as if someone had hit her on the head drowned her and left her for dead you need rest mooncrow said and got up to leave we will speak of this in the morning but his eyes said something else entirely we will meet in the spirit worlds she read there i see that there are things you cannot tell me here things that he would not understand she nodded at least in that place her head and body would not be bruised and aching he smiled winked once with another meaning entirely and left the two of them alone david started to leave her hand on his wrist prevented him dont go she said softly ive had enough of being alone to last for the rest of my life good he replied and stayed chapter sixteen i hope you know what youre doing david murmured two days later i hope i do too she replied quite seriously im sorry my love it isnt much of a plan but its all we have this time i have daylight on my side and i know the countryside the back roads he shook his head but leaned down and kissed her through the newly repaired window of her brat id like to keep you wrapped up safebut youre kestrel and you have to fly and hunt you wouldnt be kestrel if you didnt do that you wouldnt be jennie if you didnt do your job break a leg he said and went back to mooncrows car the only obvious souvenirs of her death and revival were a few cuts on her face already healing the bruises under her clothing were more extensive but they were healing too now she was back on the job it was not nearly over yet but she did not want david to know how dangerous what she planned to do was she pulled her truck out of the parking lot of the fastfood joint six blocks from the calligans place she glanced down at the remains of her meal the wrapper from a sandwich an empty fry carton a softdrink cup and a halffinished frozen yogurt cone the condemned ate a hearty meal not the hit men were watching the calligans house david had spotted them when he went to check on toni he was afraid that if the goons knew that toni was bailing out on rod theyd move in to pick her and the kids up once she got to a safe house she would no longer work as a bargaining chip against her husband in fact once she got to a safe house the thugs might not be able to locate her any more than rod could jennie didnt think those things she knew them if toni was in their hands she was dead if the kids were in their hands rod would do anything their employer wanted toni ryan and jill were innocent as innocent as any of the slaughtered women and children at claremore mound jennie had been born far too late to save those innocents but these three at least she could and would rescue so they would somehow have to lure the goons away and while they were gone david and mooncrow would pick up toni and the kids as scheduled and take them to the offices of womens shelter once toni signed the divorce papers and request for a restraining order mooncrow would sever all ties to rod in a special ceremony of purification then thugs thrown off the track mundane and spiritual connections to rod calligan parted she and her kids should be safe from rod the hit men the evil one and the miahluschka as well jennie still was not entirely certain how the hit men figured in all thiswho had brought them in to take toni and her kids not why rod had hired them to take care of her there was some part of the picture still missing some mundane connection she had not seen in her eagleguided vision somewhere there was someone who wanted a handle on rod calligan she guessed it was some kind of silent business partner who was as deeply into this thing as rod if not more so well fine that was one thing she could try to track down later meanwhile it was time to play hare and hounds or perhaps kestrel and black birds she drove slowly past the calligan house paused as if to stop and then pretended to spot the lincoln on the corner she was near enough to see the faces of two of the three men through the windshield of their car and it was one of those moments when she wished she had a camera the expressions on their faces were absolutely priceless she had never seen anyone quite so stunned in her lifeunless perhaps it had been a deer caught in the headlights of an oncoming car a sudden impulse hit her to thumb her nose and cross her eyes at them she fought it down although it was terribly tempting she had to make them think she was as startled to see them as they were to see her had to make her rabbit attractive enough that they would leave the target they had staked out in order to finish the job on her so she pretended to gasp threw the truck in reverse to spin it around and took off and as she had hoped they reacted to the bait she had thrown out acting with atypical impulse they came right after her and as she fled the remains of her meal bumped her leg she looked down and the halfeaten cone caught her eye this she could not resist she reached down and grabbed the cone she slowed just a little swerved just a little and tossed it out the back window the white yogurt hit the middle of the windshield of the lincoln with a hearty spack she couldnt help it the gesture had been so heyoka that she burst out laughing the yogurt looked like a huge birddropping in the middle of their windshield surprise the men slowed abruptly reacting to the sudden impact slowed just enough to give her an edge as she sped off now she certainly had their attention and given the care that they had taken so far that their vehicle take no damage this would surely ensure that they followed her this time she had a route planned this time they were not ready with their police gear this time it was broad daylight the first thing she had to do was to get onto country roads that she knew and they hopefully didntget them out where there wouldnt be civilians in the line of fire and onto roads where that big heavy lincoln town car would be at a disadvantage and her light brat would have the upper hand this was a fine line she had to follow she had to keep them close enough that they would not give up yet she had to make certain they didnt catch her this time she was not unarmed her and five speedloaders were on the dashboard just under the steering wheel in a special tearaway velcro holder shed designed herself if a gun battle started she was ready for it if they cornered her she was ready for them she hoped but the plan called for nothing so violent in fact the plan called for her to lead them straight into the speed trap at catoosa she was fairly certain they had a number of things in that car that the cops would find very interesting and even if they didnt well she had filed assault charges while her bruises and injuries were still fresh creating mug portraits of all three for the tulsa pd and pointing out these three had committed assault and impersonated police officers sowith any luck they would at least spend some time cooling their heels in a holding tank and with no luckshe had enough connections in the department to find out where they lived even though a check on their license number had revealed a post office box there were other ways to get their addresses a professional hit man did not want himself exposed chances were that a discreet visit by say three of her large and muscled occasional employees would persuade them that tulsa was no longer a good place to operate all that means i have to survive this though she reminded herself as she sped down a series of turns that would take her out into farm country and twolane gravel roads she took a quick look in the rearview mirror they were right on her tail and from the look of it they were perfectly well aware that the safest way to get rid of someone in oklahoma was to run him down then refuse to take the sobriety test so theyre going to see if they cant crash me then act drunk right i just hope they didnt pony up the three grand for the evasive driving course and i hope that they are still as worried about scratches on their pretty town car as they are about catching me if they actually decide to ram me off the roadthey outweigh this little brat by about twice rod calligan stood in the shade of his office a frown on his face arms crossed over his chest watching work progressing on the mall site and it was progressing that was why he was frowning all of the indians had come back to work yesterday with no explanations all of them by law since theyd been out sick he had to take them back and the accidents had stopped at least yesterday and today so it was business as usual better than usual since they seemed to be determined to make up for the sick time off by working twice as hard if they kept working like this he was going to have a difficult time finding a rationale for shutting work down unless he blew up another dozer he was so busy watching his industrious crew that he didnt notice the commotion in the air above the site until more than half of the workers stopped what they were doing and began pointing up at something in the sky he squinted shaded his eyes with one hand the other hand going automatically to the fetish in his pocket and looked in the direction they were pointing by the time he spotted what they were looking at virtually everyone else on the crew was already intent on it it was an aerial battle a kind of dogfight with three scrawny black birds chasing something else a swift little brown bird about the size of a blue jay or a robin what the hell he thought fuming fingering the fetish in his pocket work had completely ground to a halt while the men watched the indians among them cheering the bird being chased as if it were their personal friend it swooped low enough to the ground and near enough to him that he saw it was a hawk or falcon though smaller than hed thought hawks were supposed to be with brown and gray feathers a speckled breast and black markings around its eyes he should have been pleased this was throwing delay into the work again and that was what he wanted but he wasnt the very sight of that bird escaping the black ones over and over sent him into an unthinking rage if the indians seemed to think that the hawk was their friend he felt the same about the other birds hawks were vermin they took game that rightfully belonged to human hunters the black birds were probably protecting their own nests from a bird that would kill their young and just when it looked as if the black birds finally had the little hawk cornered a raven flew up out of nowhere croaking alarm and flapping wildly distracting the black birds enough that they missed their strike the indians cheered wildly as the hawk arrowed right between a couple of pieces of equipment did a wingover and climbed past her pursuers damn them calligan thought his stomach sour with anger damn them damn them without any idea of who he was damning or even why jennie wiped sweat out of her eyes and clutched the wheel until her knuckles ached her stomach was in knots her shoulder and back muscles tighter than banjo strings she was in trouble trouble she hadnt anticipated a few moments ago she had narrowly missed getting forced over and only got away by hitting the brakes doing a bootlegger turn and shooting off in the opposite direction she intended to go now she was going the wrong way to hit that speed trap in catoosa she needed another plan and another route this was a bad road for the brat and a good one for the lincoln lots of straightaways highway she decided its all curves all those little crossroads where traffic comes up out of nowhereand theres that climb up from the verdigris river thats all switchbacks thats it if she could just get therethe bluff rose a good two hundred feet up maybe three offering one of the most spectacular views in this part of oklahoma no way that boat of a lincoln was going to be able to keep up with the brat on those switchbacks and thenthen straight on until she got to lynn lanethen lynn lane to eleventh street did these guys know there was a major copshop on eleventh if they did they might not realize how close to lynn lane it was especially not if they never came at it going south she might be able to lead them right up to the door certainly she could trick them into something stupid like speeding along there right now she didnt care if she got caught and they didnt right now she was more concerned with escape the lincoln loomed up in her mirror she floored it first get to that damn bird kept getting away rod wished passionately he had a gun hed have shot the damn thing and his crew was acting like the spectators at a horse race in no way was he going to get them back to work while this was going on his hand was clenched so tightly on the fetish that it ached his eyes burned and watered from staring into the bright sky larry bushyhead watched the young female kestrel slipping just ahead of the talons of her pursuers with his hands clenched tight and a knot in his stomach when she twisted out of their clutches yet again he cheered her wildly as if by his cheering he could give her the strength and the spirit to keep going there was more to this than some strange birds chasing a little falcon he knew it in his bones this meant something something important these werent just birds this was an omenor a reflection of something else some deadly hunt elsewhere those birds were like nothing he had ever seen before and he knew his birdlife there was a sinister not quite natural air about them if only he knew what it was but since he didnt he did what he could he stared at the little dot of a bird and willed her strength speed stamina willed her all the power he could if only he knew enough about medicine so that he could help her with medicine power and beside him he sensed every other indian on the site doing the same thing fly he told her prayed for her fly little girl you can do it but he knew by her faltering wingbeats that she was in trouble jennie was definitely in trouble her guts were filled with the ice of pure fear she bit her lip and tasted blood she hadnt reckoned on the fact that she would be going uphill all the advantages of her smaller car were outweighed by the fact that the engine was smaller too the bad guys were catching up to her and there was still about a half mile of switchbacks yet to go come on she begged her laboring engine come on just a little farther the lincoln loomed up in her rearview mirror again filling it fear closed a cold hand around her throat come on you can do it the man driving was smiling and he vanished from her mirror as he pulled into the lefthand lane hes gonna force me off the road and right here off the road meant down about a hundred and fifty feet worth of down no one could survive a drop like that they turned together and he was right at her rear bumper he nudged the accelerator and came right alongside a blind corner a lefthand switchback loomed right up aheadthe last turn before the topif she could just keep him from forcing her off there then a flash of inspiration theres two pedals stupid she screamed at herself just as he pulled alongside grinning at her across his partner in the front seat use the other one no more than a hundred feet from the corner she jammed on the brakes he went sailing by staring at her mouth agape with shock just as a bus rounded the corner up ahead in his lane he had just enough time to react he jerked the wheel wildly to the right at the same instant that the bus driver in a panic jerked his to the left to avoid the oncoming car jennie could only watch hand stuffed into her mouth as the bus tried to swerve back into its own lane and hit the lincoln a glancing blow along the drivers side just in front of the rear wheel just enough to send it spinning right over the edge tumbling over the side of the bluff the kestrel went into another dive but this one had the feeling of desperation about it the black birds were right on her tail and she was either going to plow into the dirt of the arkansas bluffs or fly right up into their claws do something larry bushyhead told the white eye of the sun fiercely help her do something and at that precise moment someone did do something the kestrel skimmed the surface of the river the black birds followingso intent on her that they paid no attention to anything else like the pair of bald eagles that suddenly dove down out of the sun straight for them larry watched in stunned joy he remembered something a falconer friend had once told him if you want to really know what the fastest bird alive is ask someone who just had their prize peregrine falcon taken by an eagle the eagles were like twin thunderboltsand evidently no one had ever told them that bald eagles were fish and carrion eaters because they were obviously after those black birds and the black birds didnt even know they were there a second later they knew all rightbut by then it was too late it happened so quickly that larry could hardly believe it just the two plummeting eagles and three little explosions of black feathers as the eagles fisted their prey knocking the birds out of the sky and into the river they fanned their wings and tails to brake down then made a graceful leisurely circle to land on the sandbar beside the skinny black bodies larry found himself cheering like a madman as they made their flyby and it seemed to him that they bowed once like star performers for an appreciative audience before bending to dine the kestrel soared wearily up into the air and was lost in the blue of the sky larry cheered himself hoarse then turned and found himself staring into the face of his boss rod calligan a face that was transfixed with such rage and hate that for a moment larry didnt even recognize him the bus bounced off the wall of the bluff and skidded along it to a halt the whitefaced driver fighting the wheel and the momentum of multiple tons of steel and plastic and passengers the passengers themselves screamed loudly enough to be heard over the shrieking of air brakes the scrape of metal on rock and the dull thud of an explosion as flame blossomed over the edge of the curve the bus slid to a stop mere inches away just off her bumper the driver stared down at her through his windshield statuelike whiter than marble jennie just sat frozen her hands clutching her steering wheel her heart trying to beat its way out of her rib cage it was the shrieking of the passengers that finally galvanized her into movement she slammed the brats door open and sprinted for the bus certain from all the noise that there were people sprawled in various states of broken all over the interior but miraculously no one was hurt the driver was in a complete state of shock as well he might be but jennie and a couple of the passengers who had their wits about them began helping the others out of the bus within a few moments more cars appeared on both sides of the road some of whose drivers had seen the plume of flame and smoke from the lincoln one driver had a cellular phone and two had cb radios all three called police and ambulances jennie stayed there anyway as the only witness to the entire accident she told the police when they finally arrived that the driver of the lincoln had been trying to pass her on the blind curve and that the bus driver had pulled off the best save she had ever seen in her life since no one in the lincoln survived to dispute her version of the story and the driver honestly did not remember much besides seeing the lincoln on the wrong side of the road and swerving to avoid it the cops were perfectly willing to believe her it was only when she finally pulled her brat away from the scene that she saw what was written on the side of the bus eagle tours david gritted his teeth and went on with his part of the plan even though he wanted to go chasing right after the three guys in the lincoln as it sped off after jennies brat this whole thing depended on everyone doing his part doing it right and doing it without interfering with the rest of the plan he wouldnt help either her or toni calligan by rushing off and doing something stupid toni was not even aware of what else was going on but the dual threat of her soontobeex husband and the miahluschka was probably more than enough for her she was white as a sheet under her makeup and healing bruises and the two kids poor little mites were clearly just as terrified when david came to the door he wondered what had been going on in that house in the past fortyeight hours then decided that maybe he really didnt want to know after all it would only make him madder and he might lose his temper go down to calligans construction site and beat the bastards face in he was only heartbeats from doing that as it was only his promise to jennie had kept him from dashing out to kill the man when he realized calligan had sent those goons to drown her but david had promised she would not respect him for breaking a promise she would neyer forgive him for messing up the case by breaking calligans head logically he knew that emotionally though countless generations of warrior ancestry told him to go collect some blood he hustled all three of his charges into the backseat of mooncrows car and threw their luggage into the trunk the sooner they got out of this neighborhood the less chance there was of getting caught mrs nebles waved goodbye from her front window and gave toni the highsign as they pulled away toni smiled weakly and returned it everything was ready and waiting at the office a small and private room the shelter lawyer the papers the ride to a safehouse the lawyer coached toni through the procedure with sublime disregard for mooncrow who smudged toni the kids the lawyer and the papers impartially chanting and drumming with his other hand then again this probably wasnt the strangest ceremony these offices had ever seen hadnt jennie said something about being part of the dedication ceremonies yes she had told him about it shed offered an osage purification and blessing along with a female rabbi a female episcopalian priest a female minister a voodoo priestess and some kind of witch no wonder the lawyer wasnt fazed on the other hand given what they re doing here they probably figured they needed all the blessings they could get he decided mooncrow and the lawyer were equally efficient they finished at about the same time and both stood aside to let maria herd up toni and her kids like a faithful sheepdog and whisk them off to somewhere a lot safer wait toni said just before maria herded them out the door maria paused and toni looked back at david before we go offi didnt get a chance to tell you this i want you to get hold of the cops that are investigating the bombing she said firmly tell them that i have things they need to know things i found out over the past couple of days i want to testify against rod and i found a lot of papers and tapes in the safe in his office when i got in there this morning he had them in a box marked insurance i guess he thought that was clever theyre all in my suitcase david nodded and looked at maria who grimaced actually toni if you have things you think might put you in danger ill take you downtown before i take you to the shelter you might qualify for the witness protection program and that would free up a little more space for another woman who doesnt i thought about that toni replied and licked her lips nervously with what i overheard on the phonei think i would qualify and id feel a lot safer with the cops watching us no insult meant maria but your people dont know rod and i do ithink he might try something really drastic when he realizes were gone youre on maria waved her out the door and david relaxed a little then joined the lawyer in opening windows and fanning smoke out of the room sorry about this he began apologetically the lawyer laughed dont worry about it she assured him ive seen weirder believe me the worst was the time we got some poor little haitian girl in here who was so terrified of a curse that she wouldnt even pick up a pen until we brought in the woman that helped at the dedication a little smoke is nothingthe obeah brought in chickens a goati thought we were never going to get the goat smell out and were still finding feathers in odd corners david laughed as they chased the last of the smoke out the windows and opened the door to the rest of the office then he borrowed the office phone long enough to call in a progress report to sleighbow and romulus insurance and mr sleighbow was very interested in what toni calligan had said before she left very interested thank you mr horse he said gravely ill get in touch with the tulsa pd and have them call me as soon as theyve taken mrs calligans statement if she is that concerned he hesitated for a momentplease remind ms talldeer that she told me she was not nancy drew urge her to take extreme caution well its a little too late for that david thought with heavy irony but sleighbow didnt know about the past three days the attack was the one thing that jennie had insisted on keeping from him she had pointed out that she could not prove that her attackers had been sent by calligan if however she could get the thugs picked up they would very probably sing some fascinating tunes at least sleighbbw was concerned for jennies safety david had to respect that and the man himself sleighbow didnt know jennie personally she was just a hired hand so david made sure to thank the man and promised him another update as soon as they had any information at all the rest of the shelter volunteers were clustered around a television set as he came out of the little office and it did not look as if they were watching soaps not with the expressions of shock on their faces my god said one isnt that jennie talldeer what he exclaimed sudden images of jennie lying hurt or worse flashing into his mind he practically leapt the desk to try and get a look at the screen himself he got a brief glimpse of jenniealive all right oh thank godbefore the station went to a commercial the woman who had made the exclamation spotted him crowding in and said arent you jennies boyfriend then before he could answer she reached for the channel changer hang on ill bet theyll have this on another channel this time they apparently came in right at the beginning of the newsbreak a different reporter was on the scene of some kind of accident he recognized the spot immediately near the top of the bluff above the verdigris river on highway the camera panned down the bluff to the smoking remains of some kind of vehicle far below before turning to the road and showing a bus and jennies brat practically nosetonose a different reporter was interviewing jennie who looked remarkably composed unless you knew her and knew that it was nothing but a mask the woman turned up the sound acted like theyd been drinking and tried to pass me just in front of the blind curve jennie was saying i slammed on the brakes just as the bus came around the other side that poor bus driver didnt have a prayer of missing them and the only reason i didnt end up in the wreck was because i had already stopped the driver should get a medal for keeping that bus under control and on the road the reporter thanked her and went on to interview one of the passengers on the bus the cameraman panned down on the wrecked car again was it a lincoln it sure could have been david looked over at mooncrow who only nodded nodded wait a minutemooncrow looked a lot more tired than he should be for the simple ceremony hed just completed unless of course he had been doing other things at the same time david got the old man aside while the attention of the women was still on the television and hissed you knew about this didnt you you knew she was in trouble mooncrow shrugged what good would it have done to tell you i did what i could and you could have done nothing david scowled and gritted his teeth the old man might be right about thatbut still when jennie came in about an hour later the entire volunteer staff had cycled through and no one knew of her involvement in the bus accident david got to her first i dont know whether to hold you or hit you he said under his breath as he caught her in a tight embrace hold me she advised i have enough people trying to hit me she looked as gray as mooncrow and about as tired the old man came up beside them and david watched them trade significant looks with a sense of frustration i hope to hell they get around to telling me about whats been going on he thought grinding his teeth a little but there was no point in taking out his frustration on her did those close to all medicine people feel left out like this tonis in police custody he told her instead of snapping at her she found something out something big enough that she wants to testify jennies head came up at that alertly damn she swore softly in that casewed better get those papers served on rod calligan before he gets wind of that and goes into hiding if we cant serve the protective order and the divorce papers on him thats only going to complicate the states case did you call sleighbow for me already taken care of i figured hed want to hear that david said pleased that hed thought of it my only question is are you up to this paper thing you need me along she replied staunchly or actually to be completely truthful we need each other if hes going to try anything well be two against one i dont think that hell try anything with a witness around david grimaced but she was right and given rod calligans recent history he wasnt going to bet on the man reacting sanely to the papers being served all right he said lets rock i will come mooncrow said suddenly they both turned to look at him the old man had regained most of his color but he still looked exhausted nevertheless he was adamant david could tell from his expression of stubborn will i will come he repeated i will stay in the car but i will come jennie nodded slowly i think hes right she said i think hed better david shrugged the more the merrier he replied philosophically and gathered up the papers he was going to serve on calligan shall we jennie remained very quiet all the way to the mall site but her hand crept into davids and she settled her head on his shoulder with a sigh he squeezed the hand and turned his head just enough to kiss the top of her hair but kept his attention on traffic this was not the time to get into an accident mooncrow did stay in the car when they reached the site it was just past quitting time but calligans beemer was still there and there was a light on in the office bingo david said softly jennie nodded and let go of his hand they climbed out of the car and headed for the portable building housing calligans remote office the door wasnt locked david simply walked right in the secretarys desk just inside was unoccupied but david spotted rod calligan sitting at a second desk just inside a door on the left at the back of a larger office calligan looked up as they both entered frowning but he either didnt see jennie or simply dismissed her as unimportant im not hiring he began but jennie wasnt paying any attention to him she was concentrating on the artifacts on calligans blotter they were all old earthstained fragilelooking a medicine bag of some kind a pipe a fetishbundle wrapped in ancient handwoven grasscloth im not here for a job mr calligan david said formally you are rod calligan arent you calligan nodded looking annoyed good david held out the papers and calligan took them reflexively this is a protective order forbidding you to come within one hundred yards of antonia calligan ryan calligan and jill calligan and a preliminary divorce decree thank you for accepting them he stepped back from the desk rod calligan stared at him for a moment in stunned shock then his face began to turn purplered with anger by the way mr calligan jennie said from behind david im jennifer talldeer an investigator hired by mark sleighbow at romulus insurance ive got a few questions id like to ask you about your three friends who drove the black lincoln jennie realized as soon as she entered the office that calligan didnt recognize her in fact he probably had no idea who she was or what she looked like so even though she was certain the hit men had told him she was dead he showed no surprise as she followed david in through the door until she told him who she was that is it had been hard to concentrate on quick strategyhard to concentrate on much of anything once she saw what was spread out across his desk calligan had an entire array of stolen artifacts from watchesoverthelands gravegoods and others jennie could not imagine how he had managed to keep their presence hidden from her she should have been able to sense them the moment they got near the site unless whatever had been protecting calligan was also hiding his stolen treasures he had been about to launch into some kind of display of anger verbally or possibly physically against david and men who were angry didnt think about what they were saying she knew he had hired those three thugs but she didnt know if he had actually seen or met them but he had to know that there were three of them and he might assume whatever car they drove was dark the minute she spoke her own name he went white but when she said the words black lincoln he went berserk he leapt up out of his chair his face suffused with rage and his hand clenched around something something that pulsed with an evil dark power power that oozed thick and blackly poisonous as crude oil a power she had sensed before the evil one now it all made sense the graverobbing the bomb and her visions now the pieces all fell together and she saw the shape of what she had been facing she had only just enough time to recognize the fetishbundle for what it was and to make that sudden realization when calligan lunged at her she backpedaled frantic to avoid the touch of that bundle he came up over the desk at her equally determined to touch her with it there was no room to escape he bodyslammed her into the filing cabinets behind her and as she flailed to avoid further contact she did the very last thing she wanted to do she accidentally touched the hand holding the spiritbundle this time there was no gradual transition something seized her shook her like a dog shook a rag and flung her away she wasnot in the waking world not any longer chapter seventeen kestrel stood in the heart of the spirit world but in a part of it she did not recognize at least not at first this was a bleak and barren landscape where nothing grew and nothing lived the sky was the color of ashes the ground under her feet cracked and lifeless nothing broke the arid horizon but the occasional dead stick of what had once been a tree now withered and sere a thin and bitter wind sighed mournfully across this land full of acrid burning stenches and the sicksweet smell of decay she wore her human form in her full regalia as hunkah and tzisho as warrior and medicine person before her stood another human someone she did not recognize at all by his costume he was osage of long ago his hair was cut in the warriors roach and he wore the deerskin leggings of a hunter but he had no eagle feathers in his hair and no shell torque about his neck instead he had the feathers of some sooty black bird braided into his hair a soft down plume on the right side and the hard tailfeather on the left the very opposite positioning of the two eagle plumes she wore around his neck he had a collar of hard black talons of no bird or animal that she could recognize centered with a disk of shiny black flint and his face was painted not with warpaint nor with bluffpaint but with jagged lightning bolts of ebonyblack and he was one with this terrible landscape she found herself in he stood here with the full confidence and comfort of one who belonged to this place was familiar with it the predator in the heart of his territory that was when she recognized it as the place of her dream before this all began the terrible place where the eagles died the man before her was neither old nor young and his expression was so completely blank that he might have been a departmentstore mannequin but his eyes held an evil and a hatred so intense that she instinctively stepped back a pace or two from him he reached toward her and she backed up again she sensed that if she let him touch her hell drain me she thought with growing horror hell take everything worth having from me ill still be alive but there wont be anything left of what makes me what i am no spirit no heart no energy no laughter no creativity no hope no love thats what he did here and that was what made him so horrifying this was why watchesovertheland had to stop him he devoured people things from within and left nothing behind but the dregs he makes them into something worse than nothing worse than killing them outright because they know what hes done to them and hes left them despair despair is all his victims have left and now with no physical body to limit him nothing to confine him and all the protections that had been put around his spiritbundle gone he was more dangerous than he had ever been in her ancestors time he reached toward her again slowly as if he was toying with her she evaded him but not easily it felt as if she were moving through mud was he mustering the resources of this place against her she tried to summon up some sort of protection and failed he laughed at her his voice ringing with scorn you may have conquered my black birds little hawk he told her sneering but now you meet the devourer i am hunger and you cannot escape me she didnt reply she could only wish desperately and profoundly that there was some way to invoke watchesovertheland to bring him back from the summerlands he defeated this evil one before her ancestor mohshonahketa was the one who knew how to deal with him what worked against him the first time but she was on her own she was more frightened now than when she had been struggling to keep from drowning more frightened than a few hours ago facing her murderers for a second time that had only been a physical death that she risked this was morethe death of all that made her whole she had never ever felt so helpless in all of her life what was worse she watched the evil ones eyes and knew that he knew all of this by the sly smile creeping onto his thin lips knew that he read her every thought and could play on all her weaknesses and exploit them you have to deal with the enemy inside yourself before you can take on the enemy that faces you like i have the leisure for a psychological review right now what should i do ask him to wait for a minute while i bring in my analyst his smile widened just a little more while the bitter wind of his place called by his power whipped her hair around her face stinging her eyes and calling up tears of pain and pure unadulterated fear he licked his lips as if he tasted and relished those tears david was not prepared for calligan to come lunging over the desk he stepped back instinctively that was a mistake he cleared the way for the man to bodyslam jennie into the wall of filing cabinets opposite the desk then he reacted leaping to jennies defense but it was too late jennie was out cold and calligan was backing away toward the door quickly he positioned himself between jennie and calligan taking a defensive stance over her prone body he glanced down briefly desperate to determine how badly she was hurt but afraid to take his eyes off calligan for long but calligan relaxed and gifted david with the nastiest smile hed ever seen david tensed if something made calligan smile he had a pretty good idea that he wasnt going to like it then the contractor reached around behind his own back and locked the door of his office i told romulus i told sleighbow over and over that they couldnt trust you savages he said pulling a clasp knife from his pocket nowlets see if i can come up with a good story his eyes focused just past davids shoulder for a moment got it that primitive little tart must have decided to use you as her way to bring me down calligan eyed david as if he were some kind of lower form of life a bug or a worm i can see why you must make a lot of money as a gigolo so first you seduce and steal my wife then persuade her to file against me then you use serving those papers on me as an excuse to get in here to try and murder me he shook his head and tsked barbarians there isnt a judge and jury in oklahoma whod blame me for killing you and your bimbo temporary insanity thats what theyd say strange calligan spoke as if he was reciting something as if someone were coaching him with a hidden mike but his eyes were alert enough so he wasnt on drugs or anything david tensed his eyes on calligans regretting profoundly that he had left his gun at home and his knives in the car with mooncrow but jennie had sworn that he couldnt risk going armed when he was serving legal papers and he really hadnt thought that calligan would try anything stupid in a place as public as his office calligan handled that knife as if he knew how to use it a very bad sign calligan saw his eyes flick briefly to the knife and his smile widened i was a navy seal did you know that he asked conversationally they train the seals right missed nam though i always felt kind of cheated id have enjoyed it he circled a little and made a brief feint to the right david saw immediately what he was up to he wanted to get david away from jennie so instead of moving he simply pivoted watching calligans eyes and trying to think if there was anything within reach that he could use for a weapon kestrel backed up another pace but she didnt think a simple tactic like that was going to work for much longer it might look as if she could back up forever across this wasteland but this was his wasteland and he could manipulate it in any way he chose sooner or later he was going to get tired of this oh ancestor if only i could call you back to me daughter said a deep voice just behind her suddenly so suddenly that it made her jump something materialized at her side a bright presence in the darkness she glanced to her right and almost sobbed with relief another osage stood beside her his costume dating from the same ancient days as the evil one like his all the decorations on it were noneuropean shells quills claws teethbut this man wore proper warpaint a musselshell torque and like kestrel he wore eagle feathers both the undertail covert of the tzisho on the left and the hard tailfeather of the hunkah on the right there was no doubt whatsoever in her mind who this was not when she sensed an immense power and strength in him and an enormous confidence mohshonahjceta she said with a little nod of respect and a smile of relief ancestor you are very welcome here as she spoke she moved back and to the side instinctively placing herself shouldertoshoulder with him he smiled back at her and some of that power and strength flowed into her erasing some of her blind terror but when she looked back at their enemy the evil one did not seem to be any less confident he looked mohshonahketa up and down contemptuously one old and brittle he said with scorn and one green and with no experience hardly a challenge at all so watchesovertheland said mildly but you are hardly younger than i kestrel felt a third presence join her and mohshonahketa a moment later mooncrow stood at her left shoulder he looked very much like watchesovertheland except that the decorations on his ritual clothing like hers boasted the additions of ribbon and beadwork the evil one snorted even threetoone you cannot defeat me he laughed you old fool he continued pointing at kestrels ancestor should have warned them you had the little old men of all the gentes beside you when you bested me last you have only these two at your side now and i he seemed to loom largerno he was growing larger looming over all three of them i have no limits upon my power now he spread his arms gathering his power to him and lightning flickered about his head as he prepared to strike them but watchesovertheland was not going to stand there and wait for him to act follow he ordered and fled kestrel followed him as he somehow twisted the very fabric of this place and escaped from the evil ones land into another level of the spirit world her sight distorted then cleared she gasped for a moment trying to breathe air that was suddenly heavy no it was not air at all kestrel found herself wearing the form of a fish the swift and clever trout arrowing through the sparkling water of a clear river ahead of her was a great salmon which must be mohshonahketa beside her a black bass which was surely mooncrow the river darkened as something passed overhead kestrel gathered herself and leapt high the evil one was there waiting for her fishing spear in hand he had already stretched a net across the river ahead of them they were trapped he struck at her leaping body she writhed as she fell and the head of the spear just skimmed past her sleek flank this time it was her turn to cry follow as she fell back into the river and gulped lifegiving water then twisted the fabric of the river and ran on four hooves across a grassy plain in the shape of an appaloosa mare her unshod hooves thudded dully beneath her cushioned by grass that had never seen a blade this grassland stretched from horizon to horizon dotted only with a bush or two with a hint of thin darkness to the east where there might be trees following a watercourse overhead the sky was a blue bowl the sun a whitehot disk in the midst of it two stallions raced behind her a medicine hat pony and a tall palomino and she pulled herself up not wanting to run blindly into a new trap she stood warily sniffing the wind that whipped her mane and tail head up looking for the evil one the stallions followed her lead each facing in a different direction she wondered how the evil one would counter this shape there wasnt much that could take on three mustangs and win not on the plains then the palomino whinnied sharply and she and watchesovertheland pivoted in his direction fire fire sprang up in a long line stretching from horizon to horizon racing toward them eating its way across the landscape kestrel fought her horseinstinct to run in a blind panic as more fires cut across the horizon until they were ringed with flame follow whinnied mooncrow and reared and leapt she followed and found herselffluttering through air that tasted thick and grainy in bird shape but not the familiar birdshape of kestrel but black speckled stubtailed a starling she faltered for a moment then picked up her wingbeats again moving easily among the highrise apartment buildings fumes drifted up from the traffic below but they didnt seem to bother her in this shape car horns blared sirens screamed construction equipment rattled and pounded and the noise of uncounted engines battered her ears beside her flapped an english sparrow and a pigeon the air behind them popped and the evil one in his form of black bird hovered there for a moment confused by the terrific noise that moment was all that kestrel needed it was time to stop running and give him a taste of being the prey calling a starling alarm she dove on the black bird certain of what would follow her alarm call swiftly summoned a cloud of starlings from all directions which followed her lead and proceeded to mob the black bird mercilessly individually the evil one was more than a match for themand in fact he lashed out with beak and claws and sent several of his tormentors tumbling dead out of the sky but that only made the rest of the starlings angrier and they pecked at his head and pulled at his feathers until he began to falter and lose height and he could not tell which of the starlings was really kestrel he could only strike blindly and hope that luck would put her into his reach he could not win this one and so he changed the setting shattering the air with a terrible cry that wrenched the fabric of time and space sending them all hurtling into the white of a landscape of nothing but snow and ice wind ate at her snow whipped around her driving itself into her eyes and nose the sky was white the ground was an undulating white everything was white kestrel shivered despite the thick coat of fur she wore encased as she was in the body of an arctic fox beside her were a white wolf and a snowy owl she had barely time to take in what form she now had when what she had thought was a snowdrift heaved upward on two hind legs roaring and came at them with monstrous paws spread wide to crush them all but they were not there when the polar bears foreclaws hit the snow kestrel had gone to the right the white wolf to the left and the owl straight up this time they attacked the bear the fox nipping at its hind end the wolf tearing at its flanks and the owl battering its face and eyes with its wings the bear roared with frustration and knocked the owl out of the air instantly both kestrel and mooncrow leapt in each snatching a wing and pulling it away from the bears claws this is nothing but stalemate she thought to herself as she panted her sides heaving her lungs aching he can wear us down like thiswe have to find some way to bottle him up put me down and follow commanded mohshonahketa and she obeyed unthinkingly opening her jaws then followed as the owl plunged forward into the cool green depths of the forest a very very large forest no she was simply very small she scampered instinctively into the shelter of a leaffilled cranny beneath the trunk of a fallen forest giant she was a deermouse beside her was a chipmunk and beside him a vole she peered out at the forest outside it was as silent as the city had been noisy with one lone bird calling off in the distance and not even a faint breeze rustling the trees sunlight lanced down through the branches making shafts of gold among the green kestrel will you trust me asked her ancestor twitching his whiskers with agitation nearby a black wolverine snuffled through the dead leaves and she knew that this was the evil one looking for them but for the moment they were safely hidden in the hollow beneath the fallen tree yes she answered simply then when you find yourself as a swallow fly into the first cave that you see fly into a cave but even though swallows were clever flyers and often nested in caves how would that help she never got a chance to ask that question for at that moment the black wolverine caught their scent and began to dig at the entrance to their shelter follow cried mooncrow and once again she darted through the air this time above a landscape she recognized it was the area around carlsbad new mexico and she was indeed in the shape of a swallow unfortunately she was entirely alone and behind her was a coopers hawk talons outstretched to snatch her out of the sky the coopers was the deadliest predator of birds that flew kestrel had seen them take starlings and crows before their prey even knew there was a danger with a squeak of panic kestrel twisted and dipped and turned trying to outmaneuver her enemy but she was tired and the evil one wasnt even missing a wingbeat she looked down hoping for some kind of brush to dive into to shake her pursuer but there was nothing down there but rocks and cactus and the mouth of a small cave she folded her wings and dove the hawk followed but as she looked back she heard him laugh and saw him transform in midair from a hawk to a great black owl too late for her to change direction she shot through the mouth of the cave into echoing semidarkness how kind of you to be so stupid as to go into a place where i have the advantage he mocked as she banked frantically just in time to avoid the back wall of the cave then she had to bank again as her flight took her too near the entrance he was guarding evading his talons by so little that she squeaked with pain as he grabbed one of her primaries and yanked it out he lunged at her and as soon as he passed into the cave itself he flew directly into the web of an enormous spider it confused him and he flapped in place angrily shaking his head to try and rid himself of the clinging fibers but before he could a huge bat dropped down on his back from the ceiling above knocking him into the floor of the cave so hard that he hit his head and for the moment he lay stunned kestrel seized the opportunity and darted outside followed by the bat the bat transformed into mohshonahketa as soon as both of them were outside mooncrow rose up from out of the rocks and kestrel dropped down beside him and took her human form again now cried her ancestor they joined power calling on the ancient rocks calling on the earth and air the sky and lightning and all the ancient spirits answered them the earth shook itself knocking them off their feet the sky sent down lightning all around them blinding them deafening them hemming them in rocks tumbled down the slope of the hill blocking the entrance of the cave and before the evil one could find a shape to escape the trap lightning struck the hillside again and again until the sand smoked and fused sealing him inside for all time david dodged a swipe of calligans knife and stumbled into the side of the desk sending everything that was not already on the floor flying he grabbed an ashtray and flung it at the man who dodged it laughing wildly and slashed at him again the windows too small to get out of even if jennie were conscious the only chair is on the other side of the desk the filing cabinets are too heavy to tip over he ducked another knife strike frantically running through his limited options the phone is on the floor and i dont think hes gonna give me a minute to call was that smoke he glanced to the side and swore the lamp that had been on the desk had gone into the wastepaper basket smoke wisped up from the trash calligan followed his glance and grinned even more as flames licked up from the paper and the bulb exploded with a pop oh shit isnt the other side of this trailer where they keep the explosives shed to put it out hed have to leave jenniewhich was exactly what calligan wanted the minute he left her unprotected calligan would kill her calligan laughed and david snarled as the flames licked up a little higher from the wastebasket this guy is effin crazy where the hell is mooncrow cant he see the fire from here mooncrow might not be able to get through the locked door but if he called the fire department calligan lunged and david skidded out of reach the blade actually ripping his shirt in passing calligan was as fast as a striking snake he recovered and lunged again as the flames caught the chair next to the desk and dense black smoke mingled with the flames if the fire didnt get them the smoke surely would where was mooncrow calligans got him or hes had a stroke hed looked awfully gray back there at the office calligan lunged again trying to drive david away from jennie and cackled insanely and this joker doesnt care if we all die so long as he gets me and jennie screw this theres only one way to deal with this maniac he knew he was going to get hurt but he didnt think that calligan would anticipate his next move and he remembered something one of his lakotah buddies told him about going up against a knifefighter you can always take the knife out of the picture if youre willing to get hurt doing it just force the target on him dont let him pick where hes going to stick you and the flames were climbing the wall beside him now they didnt have more than a minute or two if they were going to get out of there alive calligan lungedand david charged into the lunge he took the knife in his shoulder but his adrenaline was up now and he didnt even feel it he bodyslammed calligan into the wall grabbed both his shoulders and slammed his head up sideways into the filing cabinets calligans eyes rolled up into his head and david let him fall he pulled the knife out of his shoulder with one hand while he kicked the door open the flimsy lock didnt hold past the second kick now the flames covered the back wall entirely he took the two steps he needed to reach jennie thanking all the gods that she was tiny then slung her firemanstyle across his good shoulder as blood poured from the wound in his other shoulder soaking his shirt as he turned he took a fraction of a second to look for the artifacts knowing that jennie would ask after them remembering that she had said they were important but there wasnt anything anywhere in sight and he had no time no time left at all he plunged through the door stumbled down the stairs and staggered across the bare sandy groundthe office was going to go up at any moment and they needed some cover quick there he spotted a pile of bags of sand for concrete and tumbled around in back of them dropping jennie as soon as they were behind them and falling to his knees he pulled her further into safety then took a quick nervous peek around the edge just as that whole corner of the lot went up jeezus he fell back as the ground beneath him shook momentarily blinded and deafened but by the time he could see again the fire department half the cops in tulsa and everyone in the neighborhood were converging on the site sirens and people screaming no sir jennie said politely to the cop while the paramedic bandaged davids shoulder we dont know what happened david and i were delivering the divorce and protective orders from my client toni calligan you can check that with the womens shelter yourself mr calligan wasnt happy about it but she shrugged he threw us out david had stalled the cops just long enough to think of a story they might believe shes being polite officer david put in grimacing a little with pain mr calligan told us to go to hell and went berserk and threw us out of the office threw jennie literally and she landed on the steps and got knocked out cold then for some reason he assaulted me with a letter opener you get a look at mrs calligan youll see what i mean that bastard was a psycho that poor ladys black and blue it all checks lieutenant one of the other cops said radio to his ear his wifes got a protective order on him and shes turning in evidence on him in the bomb case out here the lieutenant gave david a sharp look he returned one as bland and innocent as a baby calf honest to god i dont know what the hell happened after he went after me david said still wideeyed i got out after he stabbed me and he locked the door i figured he might be going after agun or something so i picked up jennie off the steps slung her over my shoulder and got the hell out i got just past that pile of sandbags when the whole place went up not too bad a story for one built as hastily as this one it accounted for his stab wound and jennies goose egg right now all he wanted was for the cops to let them loose he had the feeling that by the time toni calligan finished making her statements and the cops finished searching calligans home office theyd find more than enough to make them overlook a few minor discrepancies in his story he wanted to get to a hospital and get a painscrip for this shoulder then he wanted to go home he didnt want to think about what hed seen in the moment before the office went up like a demo from industrial light and magic a whole swarm of the little people grinning like fiends dragging calligan kicking and screaming behind them jennie listened to davids improvised story with a feeling of awe damn if he can make up things like that out of nowhere hes going to be a hell of a partner i never could do convincing fibs the police lieutenant gave them another one of those looks after spending a good ten minutes trying to shake their story but finally sighed all right he said you and ms talldeer can go just dont leave town david visibly summoned the rags of his dignity officer he said earnestly ms talldeer is making me her partner the last thing i want to do is leave town he dragged himself to his feet with the sympathetic help of the paramedic jennie stood up with care for her aching head and they both headed for the car where mooncrow waited for them thank god hes all right apparently the fire hadnt actually been visible from outside mooncrow told david and the police that he hadnt known there was anything wrong until the explosion itself david evidently believed him good thing too he wasnt anywhere near ready to hear what had really happened i dont suppose you saved the artifacts did you jennie asked sotto voce as they neared the car she was wistful but not at all hopeful fraid not babe he replied apologetically i didnt see anything and i didnt have time to look getting you out was a lot more important she sighed well its better destroyed than in a museum in calligans hands or with some private collector then she brightened i just realizedwe did this we took care of everything calliganhe had the evil ones spiritbundle and with that gone we even took care of that part of the mess no point in getting any more elaborate than that not yet anyway she stopped just at the car door and turned toward him she felt a glow of pride and happiness that not even the headache from her concussion could dim we did this david i could never have done this without you and mooncrow he flushed with pleasure and flushed even more when she stood on tiptoe to kiss him a kiss that lasted so long that mooncrow finally called them back to their surroundings by clearing his throat ostentatiously much as i enjoy seeing you two enjoy yourselves they separated reluctantly and climbed into the car your turn to drive little old man david said getting into the backseat with jennie and putting his good arm around her shoulders were walking wounded remember certainly sah mooncrow drawled in an excellent imitation of an impeccably english chauffeur and what are your directions we need a doc to look at us both jennie began the paramedic said we needed to go to the emergency room mooncrow turned to glare at her i have enough friends at the indian hospital to get someone to do a house call he said acidly what kind of a grandfather do you think i am david laughed a contrary little old man he replied all right i know what youre waiting for home james and dont spare the horses veddy good sah mooncrow replied with immense dignity and a twinkle in his eye once more assuming his chauffeur persona veddy veddy good but he didnt immediately put the car in motion instead he reached over the back of the seat and dropped a long bundle across jennies knees a friend of ours wanted you to have this he said as the wrappings fell open david raised an eyebrow in surprise it was a pipe a very old pipe it could have been the twin of the one lost in calligans office and jennie cool unflappable jennie just stared at it looking as stunned as if someone had just hit her in the back of the head with a twobyfour authors note i am not an expert on
