thomas hoover caribbee the men had six canoes in all wide tree trunks hollowed out by burning away the heart indian style they carried axes and longbarreled muskets and all save one were bare to the waist with breeches and boots patched together from uncured hides by profession they were roving hunters forest incarnations of an older world and their backs and bearded faces earth brown from the sun were smeared with pig fat to repel the swarms of tropical insects after launching from their settlement at tortuga off northern hispaniola they headed toward a chain of tiny islands sprawling across the approach to the windward passage route of the spanish galeones inbound for veracruz their destination was the easterly cape of the grand caicos a known spanish stopover where the yearly fleet always put in to reprovision after its long atlantic voyage preparations began as soon as they waded ashore first they beached the dugouts and camouflaged them with leafy brush next they axed down several trees in a grove back away from the water chopped them into short green logs and dragged these down to the shore to assemble a pyre finally they patched together banana leaf ajoupa huts in the cleared area experienced woodsmen they knew well how to live off the land while waiting the first day passed with nothing through a cloudless sky the sun scorched the empty sand for long hours then dropped into the vacant sea that night lightning played across thunderheads towering above the main island and around midnight their ajoupas were soaked by rain then in the first light of the morning while dense fog still mantled the shallow banks to the west they spotted a ship it was a single frigate small enough that there would be only a handful of cannon on the upper deck jacques le basque the densebearded bear of a man who was their leader declared in his guttural french that this was a historic moment one to be savored and passed a dark onionflask of brandy among the men now would begin their longplanned campaign of revenge against the spaniards whose infantry from santo domingo had once burned out their settlement murdered innocents it was he said the start of a new life for them all all that remained was to bait the trap two of the hunters retrieved a bucket of fat from the ajoupas and ladled it onto the green firewood another scattered the flasks remaining liquor over the top of the wood then dashed it against a heavy log for luck finally while the men carefully checked the prime on their broadgauge hunting muskets le basque struck a flint to the pyre the green wood sputtered indecisively then crackled alive sending a gray plume skyward through the damp morning air jacques circled the fire triumphantly his dark eyes reflecting back the blaze before ordering the men to ready their dugouts in the brushy camouflage along the shore as they moved to comply he caught the sleeve of a young englishman who was with them and beckoned him back anglais attendez ici i want you here beside me the first shot must count the young man had been part of their band for almost five years and was agreed to be their best marksman no slight honor among men who lived by stalking wild cattle in the forest unlike the others he carried no musket this morning only a long flintlock pistol wedged into his belt in the flickering light he looked scarcely more than twenty his face not yet showing the hard desperation of the others his hair was sandy rust and neatly trimmed and he alone among them wore no animal hideshis doublet was clearly an english cut though some years out of fashion and his sweatsoiled breeches had once been fine canvas even his boots now weathered and cracked from salt might years before have belonged to a young cavalier in covent garden he moved to help jacques stoke the fire and pile on more green limbs though the blaze and its plume should have been easily visible to the passing frigate by now the sleepy lookout seemed almost to fail to notice the ship had all but passed them by before garbled shouts from its maintop finally sounded over the foggy waters next came a jumble of orders from the quarterdeck and moments later the vessel veered its bow turning into the wind the mainsail quickly being trimmed as it steered into the bay jacques slapped at the buzzing gnats around them and yelled out a spanish plea that they were marooned seamen near death as he examined the frigate through the morning fog he grunted to himself that she was small barely a hundred tons scarcely the rich prize theyd braved the wide caribbean in dugouts for but now a longboat had been launched and two seamen in white shirts and loose blue caps were rowing a young mate toward the pair of shadowy figures huddled against the smoky pyre at the shore le basque laughed quietly and said something in a growl of french about allowing the ships officers to die quickly to reward their hospitality the younger man wasnt listening through the halflight he was carefully studying the longboat now he could make out the caps of the seamen woolen stockings loosely flopping to the side then he looked back at the ship seamen perched in its rigging to stare and thought he heard fragments of a familiar tongue drifting muffled over the swells next a crowd of passengers appeared at the taffrail led by a welltodo family in ruffs and taffetas they werent spanish they couldnt be the man wore a plumed hat and long curls that reached almost to his velvet doublet london fashions obvious at hundreds of yards the woman a trifle stout had a tight yellow bodice and long silk cape her hair tied back between them was a girl perhaps twelve with long chestnut ringlets he examined the rake of the ship once more to make doubly sure then turned to jacques that ships english look at her boxy waist short taffrail doubtless a merchantman out of virginia bound for nevis or barbados he paused when he realized jacques was not responsive finally he continued his voice louder i tell you therell be nothing on her worth having wood staves candle wax a little salt fish i know what they lade jacques looked back at the ship unconcerned cela na pas dimportance anglais therell be provisions we have to take her but no silver theres no english coin out here in the americas never has been and who knows what could happen let some ordnance be set off or somebody fire her and we run the risk of alerting the whole spanish fleet now le basque shrugged pretending to only half understand the english and responded in his hard french taking hers best if she truly be anglaise then well keep her and use her ourselves he grinned showing a row of blackened teeth and have the women for sport ill even give you the pretty little one there by the rail anglais for your petite amie he studied the ship again and laughed shes not yet work for a man the younger man stared at him blankly for a moment feeling his face go chill behind him in the brush he heard arguments rising up between the english hunters and the french over what to do during his years with them they had killed wild bulls by the score but never another englishman jacques were not spaniards this is not going to be our way he barely heard his own words surely he told himself we have to act honorably that was the unwritten code in the new world where men made their own laws anglais i regret to say you sadden me somewhat le basque was turning mechanically i once thought you had the will to be one of us but now his hand had slipped upward a slight motion almost invisible in the flickering shadows but by the time it reached his gun the young mans long flintlock was already drawn and leveled jacques i told you no the dull click of a misfire sounded across the morning mist by now le basques own pistol was in his hand primed and cocked a part of him its flare opened a path through the dark between them but the young englishman was already moving driven by purest rage he dropped to his side with a twist an arm stretching for the fire then his fingers touched what he sought and closed about the glassy neck of the shattered flask it seared his hand but in his fury he paid no heed the ragged edges sparkled against the flames as he found his footing rising as the wide arc of his swing pulled him forward le basque stumbled backward to avoid the glass growling a french oath as he sprawled across a stack of green brush an instant later the pile of burning logs suddenly crackled and sputtered throwing a shower of sparks then again god help them the young man thought theyre firing from the longboat they must assume he turned to shout a warning seaward but his voice was drowned in the eruption of gunfire from the camouflage along the shore the three seamen in the boat jerked backward all still gripping their smoking muskets then splashed into the bay empty the craft veered sideways and in moments was drifting languorously back out to sea many times in later years he tried to recall precisely what had happened next but the events always merged a blur of gunfire as he dashed for the surf trailed by le basques curses the dugouts began moving out muskets spitting random flashes he looked up to see the stout woman at the rail of the frigate brush at her face then slump sideways into her startled husbands arms he remembered too that he was already swimming stroking toward the empty boat when the first round of cannon fire from the ship sounded over the bay its roar muffled by the water against his face then he saw a second cannon flare and watched the lead canoe dissolve into spray and splinters the others were already turning back abandoning the attack when he grasped the slippery gunwale of the longboat his only hope to reach the ship as he strained against the swell he became dimly aware the firing had stopped memories of the last part were the most confused still seething with anger he had slowly pulled himself over the side then rolled onto the bloodstained planking beside him lay an english wool cap its makers name still lettered on the side one oar rattled against its lock the other was gone he remembered glancing up to see seamen in the ships rigging begin to swivel the yards a sign she was coming about then the mainsail snapped down and bellied against a sudden gust damn them wait for me only a hundred yards separated them now as the longboat continued to drift seaward it seemed a hundred yards though for years afterward he wondered if perhaps it might have been even less what he did remember clearly was wrenching the oar from the lock and turning to begin paddling toward the ship that was when the plume of spray erupted in front of him as he tumbled backward he heard the unmistakable report of the ships sternchaser cannon he could never recollect if he had actually called out to them he did remember crouching against the gunwale listening to the volleys of musket fire from seamen along the ships taffrail several rounds of heavy lead shot had torn through the side of the longboat sending splinters against his face when he looked out again the frigate was hoisting her lateen sail ready to run for open sea the line of musketmen was still poised along the rail waiting beside them was the family the man was hovering above the stout woman now laid along the deck and with him was the girl only then did he notice the heat against his cheek the warm blood from the bullet cut he glanced back at the fire even more regretful he hadnt killed jacques le basque someday he told himself he would settle the score his anger was matched only by his disgust with the english only one person on the ship seemed to question what had happened the girl looked down at the woman for a long sad moment then glanced back her tresses splayed in the morning wind his last memory before he lapsed into unconsciousness was her upraised hand as though in farewell ten years later book one barbados chapter one no sooner had their carriage creaked to a halt at the edge of the crowd than a tumult of cheers sounded through the humid morning air with a wry glance toward the man seated opposite katherine bedford drew back the faded curtains at the window and craned to see over the cluster of planters at the waters edge garbed in their usual ragged jerkins gray cotton breeches and wide sweatstained hats across the bay edging into view just beyond the rocky cliff of lookout point were the tattered patched sails of the zeelander a dutch trader well known to barbados its just rounding the point now her voice was hard with more than a trace of contempt from here youd scarcely know what their cargo was it looks the same as always as she squinted into the light a shaft of caribbean sun candled her deepblue eyes her long ringlet curls were drawn back and secured with a tiara of spanish pearls a halfhearted attempt at demureness spoiled by the nonchalant strands dangling across her forehead the dark tan on her face betrayed her devotion to the sea and the sun although twentythree years of life had ripened her body her high cheeks had none of the plump anemic pallor so prized in english women aye but this time shes very different katy make no mistake nothing in the americas will ever be the same again not after today governor dalby bedford was across from her in the close airless carriage angrily gripping the silver knob of his cane finally he bent forward to look too and for a moment their faces were framed side by side the likeness could scarcely have been greater not only did they share the same intense eyes there was a similar high forehead and determined chin damned to them its a shameful morning for us all just the same youve got to go down and be there though she despised the thought as much as he did she realized he had no choice the planters all knew dalby bedford had opposed the plan from the beginning had argued with the council for weeks before arrangements were finally made with the dutch shippers but the vote had gone against him and now he had to honor it accordingly while he sat watching the zeelander make a starboard tack coming about to enter the bay katherine leaned across the seat and pulled aside the opposite curtain the hot wind that suddenly stirred past was a sultry harbinger of the coastal breeze now sweeping up the hillside where field after identical field was lined with rows of tall leafy stalks green and iridescent in the sun the new barbados is already here she thought gloomily the best thing now is to face it without a word she straightened her tight sweaty bodice gathered her wrinkled skirt and opened the carriage door she waved aside the straw parasol that james their irish servant and footman tried to urge on her and stepped into the harsh midday sun dalby bedford nodded at the crowd then climbed down after he was tall and unlike his careless daughter always groomed to perfection today he wore a tan waistcoat trimmed with wide brown lace and a white cravat that matched the heronfeather plume in his widebrimmed hat over the years the name of dalby bedford had become a byword for freedom in the americas under his hand barbados had been made a democracy and virtually independent of england first he had convinced the kings proprietor to reduce rents on the island then he had created an elected assembly of small freeholders to counter the highhanded rule of the powerful council he had won every battle until this one katherine moved through the crowd of blackhatted planters as it parted before them through the shimmering glare of the sand she could just make out the commanding form of anthony walrond farther down by the shore together with his younger brother jeremy like hundreds of other royalists they had been deported to barbados in the aftermath of englands civil war now anthony spotted their carriage and started up the incline toward them and for an instant she found herself wishing shed thought to wear a more fashionable bodice your servant sir a gruff greeting aimed toward dalby bedford disrupted her thoughts she looked back to see a heavyset planter riding his horse directly through the crowd with the insistent air of a man who demands deference swinging down from his wheezing mount he tossed the reins to the servant who had ridden with him and began to shove his way forward fanning his open gray doublet against the heat close to fifty and owner of the largest plantation on the island benjamin briggs was head of the council that governing body of original settlers appointed years before by the islands proprietor in london his sagging leathery face was formidable testimony to twenty years of hard work and even harder drink the planters on the council had presided over barbados transformation from a tropical rain forest to a patchwork of tobacco and cotton plantations and now to what they hoped would soon be a factory producing white gold briggs pushed back his dusty hat and turned to squint approvingly as the frigate began furling its mainsail in preparation to drop anchor god be praised were almost there the years of starvation are soon to be over katherine noted that she had not been included in his greeting she had once spoken her mind to benjamin briggs concerning his treatment of his indentures more frankly than he cared to hear even now looking at him she was still amazed that a man once a small bristol importer had risen to so much power in the americas part of that success she knew derived from his practice of lending money to hardpressed freeholders at generous rates but short terms then foreclosing on their lands the moment the sight bills came due its an evil precedent for the english settlements mark my word bedford gazed back toward the ship he and benjamin briggs had been sworn enemies from the day he first proposed establishing the assembly i tell you again itll open the way for fear and divisiveness throughout the americas its our last chance for prosperity sir all else has failed briggs responded testily i know it and so do you before the governor could reply anthony walrond was joining them your servant sir he touched his plumed hat toward dalby bedford conspicuously ignoring briggs as he merged into their circle jeremy at his heel anthony walrond was thirtyfive and the most accomplished aristocratic man katherine had ever met besides her father his lean elegant face was punctuated by an eyepatch worn with the pride of an epaulette that came from a sword wound in the bloody royalist defeat at marston moor after he had invested and lost a small fortune in support of the kings failed cause he had been exiled to barbados his ancestral estate sequestrated by parliament she still found herself incredulous that he had only four weeks earlier offered marriage why she puzzled had he proposed the match he was landed worldly and had distinguished himself during the war she had none of his style and polish katherine your most obedient he bowed lightly then stood back to examine her affectionately she was a bit brash it was true and a triflewell more than a trifleforward for her sex but underneath her blunt seemingly impulsive way he sensed a powerful will she wasnt afraid to act on her convictions and the world be damned so let her ride her mare about the island daylong now if she chose there was breeding about her that merely wanted some refinement sir your servant katherine curtsied lightly and repressed a smile no one knew she had quietly invited anthony walrond riding just two weeks earlier the destination she had picked was a deserted little islet just off the windward coast where they could be alone propriety she told herself was all very well but marrying a man for life was no slight matter anthony walrond it turned out had promise of being all she could want he reflected on the memory of that afternoon for a moment himself delighted then turned back to the governor with as solemn an air as he could manage i suppose this islandll soon be more in debt than ever to the hollanders i think its time we started giving english shippers a chance now that its likely to be worth their bother aye doubtless youd like that briggs flared i know you still own a piece of a london trading company you and that pack of english merchants would be pleased to charge us double the shipping rates the hollanders do damn the lot of you those of us whove been here from the start know we should all be on our knees thankin heaven for the dutchmen the english settlements in the americas wouldve starved years ago if it hadnt been for them he paused to spit onto the sand just beside anthonys gleaming boots let english bottoms compete with the dutchmen not wave the flag your servant katherine jeremy walrond had moved beside her touching his plumed hat as he nodded a cloud of perfume hovered about him and his dark moustache was waxed to perfection though he had just turned twenty his handsome face was still boyish with scarcely a hint of sun your most obedient she nodded lightly in return trying to appear formal over the past year she had come to adore jeremy as though he were a younger brother even though she knew he despised the wildness of barbados as much as she gloried in it he was used to pampering and yearned to be back in england he also longed to be thought a man longed in truth to be just like anthony save he didnt know quite how they all stood awkwardly for a moment each wondering what the ship would signify for their own future and that of the island katherine feared that for her it would mean the end of barbados few remaining forests hidden groves upland where she could ride alone and think cultivated land was suddenly so valuable that all trees would soon vanish it was the last anyone would see of an island part untamed and free depressed once more by the prospect she turned and stared down the shore toward the collection of clapboard taverns clustered around the narrow bridge at the river mouth adjacent to the taverns was a makeshift assemblage of tobacco sheds open shops and bawdy houses which taken together had become known as bridgetown the largest town on barbados it was now all but empty everyone even the tavern keepers and irish whores had come out to watch then through the brilliant sunshine she spotted an unexpected pair ambling slowly along the waters edge the woman was well known to the islandjoan fuller the yellowhaired proprietor of its most successful brothel but the man whatever else he was certainly no freeholder for one thing no puritan planter would be seen in public with mistress fuller the stranger was gesturing at the ship and mumbling unhappily to her as they walked abruptly she reached up to pinch his cheek as though to dispel his mood he glanced down and fondly swiped at her tangled yellow hair then bade her farewell turned and began moving toward them gods life dont tell me hes come back briggs first noticed the stranger when he was already halfway through the crowd he sucked in his breath and whirled to survey the line of dutch merchantmen anchored in the shallows along the shore nothing but farther down near the careenage at the river mouth a battered frigate rode at anchor the ship bore no flag but the word defiance was crudely lettered across the stern aye word has it he put in this morning at first light edward bayes a blackhatted council member with ruddy jowls was squinting against the sun whatre you thinking wed best do briggs seemed to ignore the question as he began pushing his way through the crowd the newcomer was fully half a head taller than most of the planters and unlike everyone else he wore no hat leaving his rustcolored hair to blow in the wind he was dressed in a worn leather jerkin dark canvas breeches and sea boots weathered from long use he might have passed for an ordinary seaman had it not been for the two spanish flintlock pistols freshly polished and gleaming that protruded from his wide belt your servant captain briggs greeting was correct and formal but the man returned it with only a slight distracted nod back to see what the hollandersve brought im afraid i already know what theyre shipping i picked a hell of a day to come back the stranger rubbed absently at a long scar across one cheek then continued as though to himself damn me i should have guessed all along this would be the way the crowd had fallen silent to listen and katherine could make out that his accent was that of a gentleman even if his dress clearly was not his easy stride suggested he was little more than thirty but the squint that framed his brown eyes made his face years older by his looks and the uneasy shuffle of the council members gathered around them she suddenly began to suspect who he might be katy who the devil jeremy had lowered his voice to a whisper im not sure but if i had to guess id say thats probably the smuggler you claim robbed you once scarce wonder briggs is nervous she thought every planter on the shore knows exactly why hes come back hugh winston is that him jeremy glared at the newcomer his eyes hardening you cant mean it hed not have the brass to show his face on english soil hes been here before ive just never actually seen him you always seem to keep forgetting jeremy barbados isnt part of england she glanced back surely you heard what he did it happened just before you came out she gestured toward the green hillsides hes the one we have to thank for all this i fancy hes made briggs and the rest of them rich for all the good itll ever do him what hes done if you must know is make a profession of stealing from honest men damned to their cane hes scarcely better than a thief do you know exactly what he did you mean that business about your frigate the eightytonner of ours that grounded on the reefs up by nevis island hes the one who set our men ashorethen announced he was taking the cargo in payment rolls of wool broadcloth worth almost three thousand pounds sterling and several crates of new flintlock muskets he smuggled the cloth into virginia sold it for nothing and ruined the market for months hed be hanged if he tried walking the streets of london i swear it doesnt anybody here know that she tried to recall what she did know the story heard most often was that hed begun his career at sea on a dutch merchantman then so word had it hed gone out on his own according to tales that went around the caribbees hed pulled together a band of some dozen runaway indentures and one night somehow managed to sail a small shallop into the harbor at santo domingo he sailed out before dawn at the helm of a two hundredton spanish squarerigger after some heavy refitting it became the defiance they probably know he robbed you jeremy but i truly doubt whether they care all that much what do you mean hes the one benjamin briggs and the others hired to take them down to brazil and back that voyage had later become a legend in the english caribbees its objective was a plantation just outside the city of pemambucocapital of the new territory in brazil the dutch had just seized from the portuguese there the barbados council had deciphered the closely guarded process brazilian plantations used to refine sugar from cane sap thanks to the friendly dutch and hugh winston englishmen had finally cracked the centuriesold sugar monopoly of portugal and spain you mean hes the same one who helped them get that load of cane for planting and the plans for briggs sugar mill jeremy examined the stranger again exactly he also brought back something else for briggs she smiled can you guess jeremy flushed and carefully smoothed his new moustache i suppose youre referring to that portuguese mulatto wench he bought to be his bed warmer yes she thought hugh winstons dangerous voyage outsailing several spanish patrols had been an allround success and everybody on the island knew the terms he had demanded sight bills from the council all cosigned at his insistence by benjamin briggs in the sum of two thousand pounds sterling payable in twentyfour months well sirbriggs smiled at winston as he thumbed toward the approaching shipthis is the cargo well be wanting now if were to finish converting this place to sugar you could be of help to us again if youd choose this is where the futurell be depend on it i made one mistake helping this island winston glanced at the ship and his eyes were momentarily pained i dont plan to make another then he turned and stared past the crowd toward the green fields patchworked against the hillsides inland but i see your cane prospered well enough when do we talk why any time you will sir weve not forgotten our debts briggs forced another smile well have a tankard on it right after the auction he turned and motioned toward a redfaced irishman standing behind him wearing straw shoes and a long gray shirt farrell a moment of your valuable time yor worship timothy farrell one of briggs many indentured servants bowed sullenly as he came forward then doffed his straw hat squinting against the sun his voice still carried the musical lilt of his native kinsale where he had been offered the choice not necessarily easy between prison for debt and indentured labor in sweltering barbados he had finally elected barbados when informed falsely that he would receive a grant of five acres of land after his term of servitude expired a practice long since abandoned katherine watched as briggs flipped him a small brass coin fetch a flask of killdevil from the tavern up by the bridge and have it here when i get back killdevil was bought from dutch shippers who procured it from brazilian plantations where it was brewed using wastes from their sugarworks the portuguese there employed it as a cheap tonic to rout the devil thought to possess african slaves at the end of a long day and render them sluggish it retailed handily as a beverage in the english settlements of the americas however sometimes being marketed under the more dignified name of rumbullion or rum briggs watched as farrell sauntered off down the shore thats what well soon hear the last of a lazy papist like half the lot thats being sent out nowadays he turned to study the weathered dutch frigate as it eased into the sandy shallows and the anchor chain began to rattle down the side but weve got good workers at last by jesus weve found the answer katherine watched the planters secure their hats against a sudden breeze and begin pushing toward the shore even anthony and jeremy went with them the only man who held back was hugh winston still standing there in his wornout leather jerkin he seemed reluctant to budge maybe she thought he doesnt want to confront it as well he shouldnt weve got him to thank for this after a moment he glanced back and began to examine her with open curiosity his eyes playing over her face then her tight bodice finally he shifted one of the pistols in his belt turned and began strolling down the sloping sand toward the bay well damn his cheek all along she had planned to go down herself to see firsthand what an auction would be like but at that instant the shifting breeze brought a sudden stench from the direction of the ship she hesitated a rare moment of indecision before turning back toward the carriage this she now realized marked the start of something she wanted no part of moving slowly toward the shore winston found himself puzzling over the arch young woman who had been with governor bedford doubtless she was the daughter you heard so much about though from her dress youd scarcely guess it but she had an open way about her you didnt see much in a woman plenty of spirit there and doubtless a handful for the man who ever got her onto a mattress forget it he told himself youve enough to think about today starting with the zeelander and her cargo the sight of that threemasted fluyt brought back so many places and times brazil rotterdam virginia even barbados her captain johan ruyters had changed his life that day the zeelander hailed his bulletriddled longboat adrift in the windward passage winston had lost track of the time a bit now but not of the term ruyters had made him serve in return for the rescue three years three miserable years of short rations doubled watches and no pay back when he served on the zeelander her cargo had been mostly brown muscavado sugar ferried home to rotterdam from hollands newly captive plantations in brazil but there had been a change in the world since then the dutch had seized a string of portuguese trading fortresses along the coast of west africa now at last they had access to a commodity far more profitable than sugar he reflected on ruyters first axiom of successful trade sell whats in demand and if theres no demand for what youve got make it new sugar plantations would provide the surest market of all for what the dutch now had to sell so in the spring of ruyters had left a few bales of brazilian sugarcane with benjamin briggs then a struggling tobacco planter on barbados suggesting that he try growing it and refining sugar from the sap explaining the portuguese process as best he could it had been a night over two years past at joans place when briggs described what had happened after that the cane grew well enough aye and i managed to press out enough of the sap to try rendering it to sugar but nothing else worked i tried boiling it in pots and then letting it sit but what i got was scarcely more than molasses and mud its not as simple as i thought then he had unfolded his new scheme but if youll take some of us on the council down to brazil sir the dutchmen claim theyll let us see how the portugals do it well soon know as much about sugarmaking as any papist therell be a fine fortune in it i promise you for all of us but how hed asked briggs did they expect to manage all the work of cutting the cane these indentures sir weve got thousands of them hed finally agreed to accept the councils proposition and the defiance was ideal for the run once an old spanish cargo vessel hed disguised her by chopping away the high focsle removing the pilots cabin and lowering the quarterdeck next hed rerigged her opened more gunports in the hull and installed new cannon now she was a heavily armed fighting brig and swift good god he thought how could i have failed to see it had to come to this there was no other way so maybe its time i did something my own way for a change yes by god maybe theres an answer to all this he thought again of the sight bills now locked in the great cabin of the defiance and payable in one week two thousand pounds it would be a miracle if the council could find the coin to settle the debt but they did have something he needed and either way master briggs i intend to have satisfaction or i may just take your balls for a bell buoy now a white shallop was being lowered over the gunwales of the zeelander followed by oarsmen then after a measured pause a new figure wearing the high collar and widebrimmed hat of hollands merchant class appeared at the railing his plump face was punctuated with a goatee and his smile was visible all the way to the shore he stood a long moment dramatically surveying the lowlying hills of barbados and then captain johan ruyters began lowering himself down the swaying rope ladder as the shallop nosed through the surf and eased into the sandy shallows dalby bedford moved to the front of the receiving delegation giving no hint how bitterly he had opposed the arrangement briggs and the council had made with the dutch shippers your servant captain your most obedient servant sir ruyters english was heavily accented but otherwise flawless winston recalled he could speak five languages as smoothly as oil and shortchange the fastest broker in twice that many currencies it is a fine day for barbados how went the voyage briggs asked stepping forward and thrusting out his hand which ruyters took readily though with a wary gathering of his eyebrows a fair wind taken for all seventyfour days and only some fifteen percent wastage of the cargo not a bad figure for the passage though still enough to make us friends of the sharks but ive nearly three hundred left all prime are they strapping briggs peered toward the ship and his tone sharpened slighdy signaling that social pleasantries were not to be confused with commerce remember well be wantin them for the fields not for the kitchen none stronger in the whole west of africa these are not from the windward coast mark you where i grant what you get is fit mostly for house duty i took half this load from cape verde on the guinea coast and then sailed on down to benin by the niger river delta for the rest these nigers make the strongest field workers there is even a chief amongst them a yoruba warrior ive seen a few of these yoruba nigers in brazil and i can tell you this one could have the wits to make you a firstclass gang driver ruyters shaded his eyes against the sun and lowered his voice in truth i made a special accommodation with the agent selling him which is how i got so many hardy ones usually i have to take a string of mixed quality which i get with a few kegs of gunpowder for the chiefs and maybe some iron together with a few beads and such for their wives but i had to barter five chests of muskets and a hundred strings of their cowrieshell money for this yoruba after that though i got the pick of his boys ruyters stopped and peered past the planters for a second his face mirroring disbelief then he grinned broadly and shoved through the crowd extending his hand toward winston by the blood of christ i thought sure youd be hanged by now how long has it been six years seven he laughed and pumped winstons hand vigorously then his voice sobered not here to spy on the trade i hope id best beware or youre like to be eyeing my cargo next you can have it winston extracted his hand reflecting with chagrin that he himself had been the instrument of what was about to occur what say now ruyters smiled to mask his relief aye but to be sure this is an easy business he turned back to the planters as he continued it never fails to amaze me how ready their own people are to sell them they spy your sail when youre several leagues at sea and build a smoke fire on the coast to let you know theyve got cargo he reached for dalby bedfords arm to usher him toward the waiting boat anthony walrond said something quietly to jeremy then followed after the governor following on their heels was benjamin briggs who tightened his belt as he waded through the shallows ruyters did not fail to notice when several of the oarsmen smiled and nodded toward winston he was still remembered as the best first mate the zeelander had ever hadand the only seaman anyone had ever seen who could toss a florin into the air and drill it with a pistol ball better than half the time finally the dutch captain turned back beckoning itd be an honor if you would join us sir as long as you dont try taking any of my lads with you winston hesitated a moment then stepped into the boat as it began to draw away from the shore around them other small craft were being untied and the planters jostled together as they waded through the light surf and began to climb over the gunwales soon a small motley flotilla was making its way toward the ship as winston studied the zeelander he couldnt help recalling how welcome she had looked that sunbaked afternoon ten years past in his thirsty delirium her billowing sails had seemed the wings of an angel of mercy but she was not angelic today she was dilapidated now with runny patches of tar and oakum dotting her from bow to stern by converting her into a slaver he knew ruyters had discovered a prudent way to make the most of her last years as they eased into the shadow of her leeward side winston realized something else had changed the entire ship now smelled of human excrement he waited till ruyters led the planters headed by dalby bedford and benjamin briggs up the saltstiff rope ladder then followed after the decks were dingy and warped and there was a haggard look in the mens eyes he didnt recall from before profit comes at a price he thought even for quick dutch traders ruyters barked an order to his quartermaster and moments later the main hatch was opened immediately the stifling air around the frigate was filled with a chorus of low moans from the decks below winston felt briggs seize his arm and heard a hoarse whisper take a look and see how its done its said the dutchmen have learned the secret of how best to pack them i already know how a slavers cargoed he pulled back his arm and thought again of the dutch slave ships that had been anchored in the harbor at pernambuco a slaves chained on his back on a shelf for the whole of the voyage if he lives that long he pointed toward the hold why not go on down and have a look for yourself briggs frowned and turned to watch as the quartermaster yelled orders to several seamen all shirtless and squinting in the sun who cursed under their breath as they began reluctantly to make their way down the companionway to the lower deck the air in the darkened hold was almost unbreathable the clank of chains began and winston found himself drawn against his will to the open hatchway to watch as the cargo was unchained from iron loops fastened to the side of the ship their manacled hands were looped through a heavy line the seamen passed along the length of the lower deck slowly shakily the first string of men began to emerge from the hold their feet and hands were still secured with individual chains and all were naked as each struggled up from the hold he would stare into the blinding sun for a confused moment as though to gain bearings then turn in bewilderment to gaze at the green beyond so like and yet so alien from the african coast finally seeing the planters he would stretch to cover his groin with manacled hands the hesitation prompting a dutch seaman to lash him forward the africans black skin shone in the sun the result of a forced diet of cod liver oil the last week of the voyage then too there had been a quick splash with seawater on the decks below followed by swabbing with palm oil when the zeelanders maintopman had sighted the low green peaks of barbados rising out of the sea they seemed stronger than might have been expected the effect of a remedial diet of salt fish the last three days of the voyage well sir what think you of the cargo ruyters face was aglow winston winced better your vessel than mine but its no great matter to ship these africans the truth is we dont really even have to keep them fettered once we pass sight of land since theyre too terrified to revolt we feed them twice a day with meal boiled up into a mush and every other day or so we give them some english horsebeans which they seem to favor sometimes we even bring them up topside to feed whilst we splash down the decks below he smiled and swept the assembled bodies with his eyes thats why we have so little wastage not like the spaniards or portugals who can easily lose a quarter or more to shark feed through overpacking and giving them seawater to drink but ill warrant the englishll try to squeeze all the profit they can one day when your ships take up the trade and then youll doubtless see wastage high as the papists have english merchantsll never take up the slave trade ruyters gave a chuckle aye but that they will as im a christian and soon enough too he glanced in the direction of anthony walrond your london shippersll take up anything we do that shows a florins profit but well give you a run for it he turned back to briggs what say you sir are they to your liking i take it theyre a mix like we ordered wouldnt load them any other way theres a goodly batch of yoruba granted but the rest are everything from ibo and ashanti to mandingo theres little chance theyll be plotting any revolts half of them are likely blood enemies of the other half the first mate lashed the line forward with a catoninetails positioning them along the scuppers at the head was a tall man whose alert eyes were already studying the forested center of the island winston examined him for a moment recalling the haughty yoruba slaves he had seen in brazil is that the chief you spoke of ruyters glanced at the man a moment they mostly look the same to me but aye i think thats the one prince atiba i believe they called him a niger and pure yoruba hell never be made a slave wont he now youll find the cat can work wonders ruyters turned and took the catoninetails from the mate hell jump just like the rest with a quick flick he lashed it against the africans back the man stood unmoving without even a blink he drew back and struck him a second time now harder the yorubas jaw tightened visibly but he still did not flinch as ruyters drew back for a third blow winston reached to stay his arm enough take care or he may prove a better man than youd wish to show before ruyters could respond briggs moved to begin the negotiations what terms are you offering sir like we agreed ruyters turned back a quarter now with sight bills for another quarter in six months and the balance on terms in a year paid in bales of tobacco at standing rates or sugar assuming weve got it then ive yet to see two gold pieces keeping company together on the whole of the island he snorted i suppose itll have to be what do you say to the usual exchange rate i say we can begin lets start with the best and not trouble with the bidding candle yet ill offer you a full twenty pounds for the first one there briggs pointed at the yoruba the dutch captain examined him in disbelief this is not some indentured irishman sir this is a robust field hand youll own for life and he has all the looks of a good breeder my conscience wouldnt let me entertain a farthing under forty would you take some of my acres too is there no profit to be had in him these africansll pay themselves out for you in one good year two at the most just like they do in brazil ruyters smiled and this is the very one that cost me a fortune in muskets its only because i know you for a gentleman that id even think of offering him on such easy terms hes plainly the pick of the string winston turned away and gazed toward the shore the price would be thirty pounds he knew ruyters bargaining practices all too well the sight of the zeelanders decks sickened him almost as much as the slaves he wanted to get to sea again to leave barbados and its greedy puritans far behind but this time he told himself youre the one who needs them just a little longer and therell be a reckoning and after that barbados can be damned thirty pounds then and may god forgive me ruyters was slapping briggs genially on the shoulder but youll be needing a lot more for the acres you want to cut why not take the rest of this string at a flat twentyfive pounds the head and make an end on it itll spare both of us time twentyfive make it twenty then ruyters lowered his voice but not a shilling under god is my witness by my life youre a conniving moor passing himself as a dutchman briggs mopped his brow its time for the candle sir theyre scarcely all of the same quality ill grant you some should fetch well above twenty i ventured the offer thinking a gentleman of your discernment might grasp a bargain when he saw it but as you will he turned and spoke quickly to his quartermaster a short surly seaman who had been with the zeelander almost as long as ruyters the officer disappeared toward the great cabin and returned moments later with several long white candles marked with rings at oneinch intervals he fitted one into a holder and lit the wick well begin with the next one in the string ruyters pointed to a stout graybearded man gentlemen what am i bid twelve pounds fifteen fifteen pounds ten sixteen as winston watched the bidding he found his gaze drifting more and more to the yoruba briggs had just purchased the man was meeting his stare now eye to eye almost a challenge there were three small scars lined down one cheekthe clan marks yoruba warriors were said to wear to prevent inadvertently killing another clan member in battle he was naked and in chains but he held himself like a born aristocrat eighteen and ten briggs was eyeing the flickering candle as he yelled the bid at that moment the first dark ring disappeared the last bid on the candle was mr benjamin briggs ruyters turned to his quartermaster who was holding an open account book quill pen in hand at eighteen pounds ten shillings mark it and lets get on with the next one winston moved slowly back toward the main deck studying the first yoruba more carefully nowthe glistening skin that seemed to stretch over ripples of muscle and the quick eyes seeing everything what a fighting man hed make hed snap your neck while you were still reaching for your pistol it couldve been a big mistake not to try and get him but then what howd you make him understand anything unless he remembered that some of the yoruba in brazil still fresh off the slave ships already spoke portuguese learned from the traders whod worked the african coast for god only knows how long the portugals in brazil always claimed you could never tell about a yoruba they were like moors sharp as tacks his curiosity growing he edged next to the man still attempting to hold his eyes then decided to try him fala portugues atiba started in surprise shot a quick glance toward the crowd of whites then turned away as though he hadnt heard winston moved closer and lowered his voice fala portugues senhor after a long moment he turned back and examined winston sim suficiente his whisper was almost buried in the din of bidding he paused a moment then continued in barely audible portuguese how many of my people will you try to buy senhor only free men serve under my command then you have saved yourself the loss of many strings of money shells senhor the branco here may have escaped our sword for now but they have placed themselves in our scabbard he looked back toward the shore before the next rainy season comes you will see us put on the skin of the leopard i swear to you in the name of ogun god of war chapter two joan fuller sighed and gently eased herself out of the clammy feather bed unsure why she felt so oddly listless like as not it was the patter of the noonday shower now in full force gusting through the open jalousies in its daily drenching of the taverns rear quarters a shower was supposed to be cooling so why did she always feel hotter and more miserable afterwards even now threads of sweat lined down between her full breasts inside the curve of each long leg she moved quietly to the window and one by one began tilting the louvres upward hoping to shut out some of the salty mist day in and day out the same pattern first the harsh sun then the rain then the sun again mind you it had brought to life all those new rows of sugar cane marshalled down the hillsides raising hope the planters might eventually settle their accounts in something besides weedy tobacco but money mattered so little anymore time thats the commodity no purse on earth could buy and the barbados sun and rain day after day were like a heartless cadence marking times theft of the only thing a woman had truly worth holding on to the tropical sun and salt air would be telling enough on the face of some girl of twenty but for a woman all but thirtywell in gods own truth some nine years pastit was ruination still there it was every morning like a knife come to etch deeper those telltale lines at the corners of her eyes and after shed frayed her plain brown hair coloring it with yellow dye hoping to bring out a bit of the sparkle in her hazel eyes she could count on the harsh salt wind to finish turning it to straw god damn miserable barbados as if there werent bother enough now hugh was back the whoremaster half ready to carry on as though hed never been gone when you both knew the past was past but why not just make the most of whatever happens and time be damned she turned and glanced back toward the bed he was awake now too propped up on one elbow groggily watching for a moment she thought she might have disturbed him getting upin years past he used to grumble about thatbut then she caught the look in his eyes what the pox in truth it wasnt always so bad having him back now and again slowly her focus strayed to the dark hair on his chest the part not lightened to rust by the sun and she realized she was the one who wanted him this minute but she never hinted that to hugh winston she never gave him the least encouragement she kept the whoreson off balance else hed lose interest after you got to know him the way she did you realized hugh fancied the chase as she started to look away he smiled and beckoned her over just like shed figured she adjusted the other shutters then took her own sweet time strolling back almost as though he werent even there then she casually settled onto the bed letting him see the fine profile of her breasts and just happening to drape one long leg where he could manage to touch it but now she was beginning to be of two minds gods life it was too damned hot hugh or no he ignored her ankle and for some reason reached out and silently drew one of his long brown fingers down her cheek very slowly she stifled a shiver reminding herself shed had quite enough of men in general and hugh winston in particular to do a lifetime but still before she realized it hed lifted back her yellow hair and kissed her deeply on the mouth suddenly it was all she could manage keeping her hands on the mattress then he faltered mumbled something about the heat and plopped back onto the sweatsoaked sheet well god damn him too she studied his face again wondering why he seemed so distracted this trip it wasnt like hugh to let things get under his skin though admittedly affairs were going poorly for him now mainly because of the damned civil war in england since he didnt trouble about taxes hed always undersold english shippers but after the war had disrupted things so much the american settlements were wide open to the cutrate hollanders who could sell and ship cheaper than anybody alive these days the butterboxes were everywhere you could look out the window and see a dozen dutch merchantmen anchored right in carlisle bay ever since that trip for the council hed been busy running whatever he could get between virginia and some other place he hadnt saidyet he had scarcely a shilling to show for his time why else would he have paid that flock of shiftless runaways he called a crew with the last of his savings she knew it was all he had and hed just handed it over for them to drink and whore away when would he learn and if youre thinking youll collect on the councils sight bills dear heart youd best think again master benjamin briggs and the rest of that shifty lot could hold school for learned scholars on the topic of stalling obligations he was doubtless too proud to own it straight out but he neednt trouble she already knew hugh winston her lover in times past and still the only friend she had worth the bother was down to his last farthing she sighed telling herself she knew full well what it was like gods wounds did she know what it was like back when hugh winston was still in his first and only term at oxford the son of one lord harold winston before hed been apprenticed and then sent packing out to the caribbees joan fuller was already an orphan the hardest place you could be one on the cobblestone streets of billingsgate city of london thats where you think youre in luck to hire out in some household for a few pennies a week with a hag of a mistress who despises you for no more cause than youre young and pretty of course you steal a little at first not too much or shed see but then you remember the master who idles about the place in his greasy nightshirt half the day and who starts taking notice after you let the gouty old whoremaster know youd be willing to earn something extra finally the mistress starts to suspectthe bloodhounds always do after a whileand soon enough youre back on the cobblestones but you know a lot more now so if youre half clever youll take what youve put by and have some proper dresses made up bright colored with ruffled petticoats and a few hats with silk ribands then you pay down on a furnished lodging in covent garden the first floor even though its more than all the rest of the house soon youve got lots of regulars and then eventually you make acquaintance of a certain gentleman of means who wants a pert young thing all to himself on alternate afternoons it lasts for going on two years till you decide youre weary to death of the kept life so you count up whats set byand realize its enough to hire passage out to barbados which someone once told you was supposed to be paradise after london and you like a fool believed it but which you discover quick enough is just a damned sweltering version of hell youre here now though so you take what little moneys left and find yourself some girls irish ones whove served out their time as indentures despise having to work and cant wait to take up the old life same as before they came out and finally you can forget all about what it was like being a penniless orphan trouble is you also realize youre not so young anymore would you fancy some hollander cheese love the purser from the zeelander lifted a tub for me and theres still a bit left and ill warrant theres cassava bread in back still warm from morning she knew hugh always called for the local bread the hard patties baked from the powdered cassava root rather than that from the stale weevily flour shipped out from london he ran a finger contemplatively across her breastsnow they at least were still round and firm as any strutting irish wench half her age could boastthen dropped his legs off the side of the bed and began to search for his boots i could do with a tankard of sack the very brass of him when hed come back half drunk in the middle of the night ranting about floggings or some such and waving a bottle of killdevil hed climbed into bed had his way and promptly passed out so instead of acting like he owned the place he could bloody well supply an explanation so how did it go yesterday she held her voice even a purr with that business on the zeelander that wasnt the point she actually had in mind if it hadnt been so damned hot shed have nailed him straight out something along the lines of and where in bloody hell were you till all hours or maybe why ist you think you can have whatever you want the minute you want it that was the enquiry the situation called for you missed a fine entertainment his tone of voice told her he probably meant just the opposite youre sayin the sale went well for the dutchmen she watched him shrug then readied herself to monitor him sharply and after that i expect you were off drinking with the council she flashed a look of mock disapproval doubtless passing yourself for a fine gentleman as always i am a gentleman he laughed and swung at her with a muddy boot just missing as she sprang from the bed i just rarely trouble to own it aye youre a gentleman to be sure and by that thinking im a virgin still since i was doubtless that once too so ive heard you claim but that was back well before my time you had rare fortune darlin you got the rewards of years of expertise she reached to pull on her brown linen shift and i suppose youll be telling me next that master briggs and the council can scarcely wait to settle your sight bills theyll settle them in a fortnight one way or another or damned to them he reached for his breeches not the fancy ones he wore once in a while around the council but the canvas ones he used aboard ship and the tone of his voice changed i just hope things stay on an even keel till then i dont catch your meaning she studied him openly wondering if that meant he was already planning to leave the planters new purchase hed finished with the trousers and was busy with his belt half of them are yoruba and pray whats that shed thought he was going to explain more on the bit about leaving i think theyre a people from somewhere down around the niger river delta the africans you mean she examined him still puzzled the slaves youve hit on it the slaves like a fool i didnt see it coming but its here all right may god curse ruyters now i realize this is what he planned all along the bastard when he started telling everybody how they could get rich with cane save none of these puritans knows the first thing about working africans hes sold them a powder keg with these yoruba he rose and started for the door leading into the front room of the tavern and theyre doing all they can to spark the fuse whatre you tryin to say she was watching him walk something that still pleased her after all the years but she kept on seeming to listen when hugh took something in his head youd best let him carry on about it for a time theyre proud and ive got a feeling theyre not going to take this treatment he turned back to look at her finally reading her confusion ive seen plenty of yoruba over the years in brazil and i can tell you the papists have learned to handle them differently theyre fast and theyre smart some of them even come off the boat already knowing portugee i also found out that at least one of those ruyters sold to briggs can speak it is that such a bad thing itd seem to me what im saying is now that theyre here theyve got to be treated like men you cant starve them and horsewhip them the way you can irish indentures ive got a strong feeling theyll not abide it for long he moved restlessly into the front room a woodfloored space of rickety pine tables and wobbly straight chairs plopping down by the front doorway his gaze fixed on the misty outline of the river bridge i went on out to briggs plantation last night thinking to talk over a certain little matter but instead i got treated to a show of how he plans to break in his slaves the first thing he did was flog one of his new yoruba when he balked at eating loblolly corn mush thats going to make for big trouble mark it she studied him now and finally realized how worked up he was hugh usually noticed everything yet hed walked straight through the room without returning the groggy nods of his men two french mates and his quartermaster john mewesthe latter now gaming at threehanded whist with saltbeef peg and buttockdeclink jenny her two newest irish girls she knew for sure peg had noticed him and that little sixpenny tart bloody well knew better than to breathe a word in front of her mistress well settle down a bit she opened the cabinet and took out an onionflask of sack together with two tankards tell me where youre thinking youll be going next she dropped into the chair opposite and began uncorking the bottle or am i to expect you and the ladsll be staying a while in barbados this time he laughed well now am i supposed to think its me youre thinking about or is it youre just worried we might ship out while one of the lads still has a shilling left somewhere or other she briefly considered hoisting the bottle shed just fetched and cracking it over his skull but instead she shot him a frown and turned toward the blearyeyed gathering at the whist table john did you ever hear the likes of this one by my life hed have the lot of you drink and play for free john mewes a bristol seaman who had joined hugh years ago after jumping ship at nevis island stared up groggily from his game then glanced back at his shrinking pile of coinsshrinking as saltbeef pegs had grown his weathered cheeks were lined from drink and as always his ragged hair was matted against his scalp and the jerkin covering his wide belly was stained brown with spilled grog inexplicably women doted on him in taverns the length of the caribbean aye yor ladyship it may soon have to be this bawd of yours is near to takin my last shilling before shes scarce troubled liftin her skirts to earn it he took another swallow of killdevil from his tankard then looked imploringly toward winston on my honor capn by the look of it im apt to be poor as a country parson by noontide tomorrow but youre stayin all this week with me john peg was around the table and on his lap in an instant her soft brown eyes aglow a promise to a lady always has to be kept else youll lose your luck then shall i be havin your full measure for the coin of love its near to all thats left ill take an oath on it my purses shriveled as the popes balls for love peg rose and i suppose im to be livin on this counterfeit you call love whilst youre off plyin your sweet talk to some stinkin dutch whore over on the wild coast the damned hollander wenches are all too sottish by half theyd swill a mans grog fastern he can call for it he took another pull from his tankard and glanced admiringly at pegs bulging halflaced bodice but i say deal the cards mlady where theres life theres hope as im a christian and what was it you were saying love joan turned back to winston and poured another splash into his tankard i think it was something to do with the new slaves i said i dont like it and i just might try doing something about it i just hope theres no trouble here in the meantime his voice slowly trailed off into the din of the rain this bother about the slaves was not a bit like him joan thought hughd never been out to right all the worlds many ills besides what did he expect gods wounds the planters were going to squeeze every shilling they could out of these new africans everybody knew the caribbees and all the americas were beyond the line outside the demarcation on some map somewhere that separated europe from the new world out here the rules were different hugh had always understood that better than anybody so why was he so out of sorts now that the planters had found a replacement for their lazy indentures heaven can tell he had wrongs enough of his own to brood about if he wanted to trouble his mind over lifes little misfortunes what is it really thats occupying your mind so much this trip love it cant just be these new slaves i know you too well for that she studied him ist the sight bills ive been thinking about an idea ive had for a long long time seeing whats happened now on barbados it all fits together somehow whatre you talking about im wondering if maybe its not time i tried changing a few things this was definitely a new hugh he never talked like that in the old days back then all he ever troubled about was how he was going to manage making a livinga problem he still hadnt worked out if you want the honest truth she looked at him now suddenly so changed and recollected the first time she ever saw him it was a full seven years past just after shed opened her tavern and while he was still a seaman on the zeelander that dutch ship had arrived with clapboards and staves from portsmouth rhode island needed on barbados for houses and tobacco casks while the zeelander was lading barbados cotton for the mills in new england hed come in one night with the other members of the dutch crew and shed introduced him to one of the girls but later on it was her hed bought drinks for not the plump irish colleen hed been with and then came the questions howd she get on he wanted to know living by her wits out here in the new world where was the money shed figured rightly that hugh was looking for something maybe thinking to try and make his own way as she had after a while hed finally ordered a tankard for the pouting girl then disappeared but there he was again the next evening and the one after that too each time hed go off with one of the girls then come back and talk with her finally one night he did something unheard of he bought a full flask of killdevil and proposed they take a walk down to look at the ship gods life as though she hadnt seen enough wornout dutch frigates then she realized what was happening this young english mate with a scar on his cheek desired her was paying court to her he even seemed to like her didnt he know she no longer entertained the trade herself but hugh was different so like a fool she lost sight of her better judgment later that night she showed him how a woman differed from a girl and she still found occasion to remind him from time to time seven years later i want to show you how i came by the idea ive been working on he abruptly rose and walked back to the bedroom when he returned he was carrying his two pistols their long steel barrels damascened with gold and the stocks fine walnut he placed them carefully on the table then dropped back into his chair and reached for his tankard take a look at those gods blood she glanced at the guns and gave a tiny snort every time i see you youve got another pair i like to keep up with the latest designs so tell me whats latest about these a lot of things in the first place the firing mechanisms a flintlock so when you pull the trigger the piece of flint there in the hammer strikes against the steel wing on the cap of the powder pan opening it and firing the powder in a single action also the powder pan loads automatically when the barrels primed its faster and better than a matchlock thats lovely but flintlocks have been around for some time or hadnt you heard she looked at the guns and took a sip of sack amused by his endless fascination with pistols hed always been that way but it was to a purpose youd be hard pressed to find a marksman in the caribbees better or faster than hugha little talent left over from his time with the cowkillers on tortuga though for some reason hed as soon not talk about those years she glanced down again is it just my eyes or do i see two barrels now i grant you this is the first time ive come across anything like that congratulations thats whats new about this design watch he lifted up a gun and carefully touched a second trigger a smaller one in front of the first the barrel assembly emitted a light click and revolved a half turn bringing up the second barrel ready to fire see theyre double barreled i hear its called a turnover mechanismsince when you pull that second trigger a springloaded assembly turns over a new barrel complete with a primed powder pan he gripped the muzzle and revolved the barrels back to their initial position this designs going to be the coming thing mark it he laid the pistol back onto the table oh by the way theres one other curiosity have a look there on the breech can you make out the name she lifted one of the flintlocks and squinted in the halflight just in front of the ornate hammer there was a name etched in gold don francisco de castilla thats moren likely the gunsmith who made them on a fine pistol youll usually see the makers name there you ought to know that she looked at him i didnt suppose you made them yourself darlin ive never seen that name before but god knows therere lots of spanish pistols around the caribbean everybody claims theyre the best thats what i thought the name was too at first he lifted his tankard and examined the amber contents tell me how much do you know about jamaica whats that got to do with these pistols one thing at a time i asked you what you know about jamaica no moren everybody else does its a big island somewhere to the west of here that the spaniards hold theres supposed to be a harbor and a fortress and a little settlement they call villa de la vega with maybe a couple of thousand planters but thats about all from what i hear since the spaniardsve never yet found any gold or silver there she studied him puzzling whyre you asking ive been thinking maybe ill go over and poke around a bit he paused then lowered his voice maybe see if i can take the fortress maybe take the fortress you say she exploded with laughter and reached for the sack i reckon id best put away this flask right now you dont think i can do it i hear the spaniardsve got heavy cannon in that fortress and a big militia even some cavalry no englishmans going to take it she looked at him not wishing to offend love but wouldnt you say thats just a trifle out of your depth i appreciate your expression of confidence he settled his tankard on the table then tell me something else do you remember jackson the famous captain jackson you mean captain william jackson sure i recall that lying knave well enough she snorted who could forget him he was here for two months once while you were out and turned barbados upside down recruiting men to sail against the spaniards settlements on the main claiming he was financed by the earl of warwick he sat drinking every night at this very table then left me a stack of worthless sight drafts saying hed be back in no time to settle them in spanish gold she studied him for a moment that was four years past the best i know he was never heard from since for sure never heard from him suddenly she leaned forward dont tell me you know where he might be not any more but i learned last year what happened back then it turns out he got nothing on the main the spaniards would empty any settlementmaracaibo puerto cabellohe tried to take theyd just strip their houses and disappear into the jungle so he went back emptyhanded wrong thats what he wanted everybody to think happened especially the earl of warwick he kept on going winston lowered his voice again beyond reach of the men across the room i wouldnt believe what he did next if i didnt have these pistols he picked up one of the guns and yelled toward the whist table john aye mewes was on his feet in an instant wiping his hand across his mouth remember where i got these flintlocks i seem to recall it was virginia jamestown he reached down and lifted his tankard for a sip then he wiped his mouth a second time an if you want my thinkin they was sold to you by the scurviestlookin whoreson that ever claimd he was english that id not trust with tuppence an thats the truth well she leaned back in her chair along with the pistols i also got part of the story of jacksons expedition it seems this man had been with them claimed he was first mate on the flagshipbut hed finally jumped ship when jackson tried to storm a fortress up on the coast of spanish florida then made his way north to virginia he stole these pistols from jacksons cabin the night he swam ashore then ive half a mind to confiscate them here and now as payment for my sight drafts she inspected the guns but i still dont follow what thats got to do with jamaica he picked up one of the pistols again and traced his finger along the flintlock the name don francisco de castilla i kept thinking and thinking and finally i remembered thats not a pistol maker thats the name of the spanish governor of villa de la vega jamaica but then how did jackson get them i never saw these pistols when he was here and id have remembered them you can be sure she was staring skeptically at the guns thats what i began to wonder so i tracked down the seller and found out what really happened he lowered his voice again jackson got them from de castillas personal strongbox in the fortress william jackson took jamaica he got the idea the spaniardsd never be expecting an attack that far from the main and he was right so after maracaibo he made way straight for jamaica he raised the bay at dawn brought the fleet together and put in for the harbor the fortress the town all of it was his in a morning but how could he hold the place as soon as the spaniards over on the main got word theyd be sure to send a he didnt bother he delivered the town back in return for provisions and a ransom of twenty thousand pieces of eight split the money with his men and swore them to secrecy but he kept these pistols winston smiled except now theyre mine hold a minute im afraid im beginning to see what youre thinking she leaned forward alarm in her eyes so let me tell you a few things about that little expedition of jacksons that fasttalking rogue put in here with three armed frigates he raised over five hundred men and god knows how many muskets i saw them all off holding my valuable sight drafts the day he set sail out of carlisle bay but what if i got more men in gods name who from who do you think he ran his fingers through his hair and looked away ive been thinking it over for months well now ive made up my mind what the hell are the americas for slavery he looked back im going to take jamaica and keep it itll be the one place in the new world where therell be no indentures no slaves just free men the way it was on tortuga christ on a cross youve totally taken leave of sense she looked at him dumbfounded youd best stop dreaming about jamaica and put your deep mind to work on how youre going to collect those sight bills from the council youve got to make a living love the sight bills are part of my plan as it happens i expect to settle that very item next friday night best of luck she paused then pushed back from the table gods blood were you invited he looked up from his tankard how do you know where im going theres only one place it could be the fancy ball master briggs is holdin for the council in his grand new estate house its the reason theres not a scrap of taffeta left in the whole of bridgetown i was trying to buy some all yesterday for the girls i have to go its the perfect time to see them all together and i suppose miss katherine bedfordll be there as well her voice had acquired an unmistakable edge in her official capacity as first lady oddly enough i neglected to enquire on that point did you now she sniffed aye her highnessll be in attendance and probably wearin half the taffeta i wanted to buy not that itll be made up properly shell be there the strumpet on my honor what if she is its no matter to me he drank again i just want my sight bills paid in coin as agreed not in bales of their damned worthless tobacco she seemed not to hear when shes too busy ridin that mare of hers to so much as nod her bonnet to an honest woman who might have need to make a living all right he set down his tankard ill take you pardon i said ill take you now youve gone totally daft she stared at him secretly overjoyed hed consider asking can you fancy the scene me in amongst all those dowdy puritan sluts stuffing their fat faces whilst arguing over whether to starve their indentures completely to death not to mention thered be general heart seizure in the ranks of the council the half of which keep open accounts here on the sly only im lucky to get paid in musty tobacco let alone the coin you re dreaming of she laughed and i warrant youll be paid with the same love thats assuming youre ever paid at all as you will he took a sip of sack but since youre so worried about the women dont forget who elsell probably be there who do you mean remember what the portugals say e a mulata que e mulher its the mulatto whos the real woman she translated the famous pernambuco expression then frowned i suppose you mean that portuguese mulatto master briggs bought for himself when you took them all down to brazil the one named serina the very one i caught a glimpse of her again last night i know her you rogue probably better than you do briggs is always sending her down here for bottles of killdevil sayin he doesnt trust his indentures to get them home shes a finefeatured woman of the kind if i say it myself finer than briggs deserves did you know that amongst the council shes known as his pumpkincolored whore those hypocritical puritan whoremasters i always ask her to stay a bit when she comes i think shes probably lonely poor creature but i can tell you one thing for certainshe takes no great satisfaction in her new owner or in barbados either come to that after the fine plantation she lived on in brazil she laughed something not hard to understand im always amazed to remember shes a slave probably one of the very first on this island she looked away reflectively though now shes got much company too much you may be right for once its a new day on my faith and i dont mind telling you it troubles me a bit therere apt to be thousands of these africans here soon therell be nothing like it anywhere in the americas she sighed but the councils all saying the slavesll change everything make them all rich her voice quickened as she turned back do you suppose its true probably thats why i plan to try and change a few things too he looked out at the bay where a line of brown pelicans glided single file across the tips of waves the horizon beyond was lost in mist my own way chapter three katherine gazed past the pewter candlesticks and their flickering tapers down the long cedar table of briggs dining hall now piled high with stacks of greasy wooden plates spilling over with halffinished food the room was wide and deep with dark oak beams across the ceiling and fresh white plaster walls around the table were rows of grim men in black hats and plump puritan women in tight bodices and starched collars for all its surface festivity there was something almost ominous about the evening change was in the air and not change for the better at the head of the table were the most prominent members of the council the owners of barbados largest plantations she knew the wealthiest ones personally edward bayes his jowls protruding beneath his whisp of beard owned the choicest coastal lands north around speightstown thomas lancaster now redcheeked and glassyeyed from the liquor had the largest plantation in the rolling plains of st georges parish midisland nicholas whittington dewlapped and portly was master of a vast acreage in christs church parish on the southern coast anthony walrond had not been invited nor any other of the new royalist emigreswhich she should have known was exactly what was going to happen before she went to all the bother of having a new dress and bodice made up no tonight the guests were the rich planters the old settlers who arrived on barbados in the early years and claimed the best land they were the ones that dalby bedford now seated beside her diplomatically sipping from his tankard liked to call the plantocracy they had gathered to celebrate the beginnings of the sugar miracle and the new order the room was alive with an air of expectancy almost as palpable as the smoke that drifted in through the open kitchen door benjamin briggs banquet and ball purportedly a celebration was in truth something more like a declaration the assembly that elected body created by dalby bedford from among the small freeholders would soon count for nothing in the face of the big planters new wealth and power henceforth this flagship of the americas would be controlled by the men who owned the most land and the most slaves the worst part of all she told herself was that briggs celebration would probably last till dawn though the banquet was over now the ball was about to commence and after that briggs had dramatically announced there would be a special preview of his new sugarworks the first on the island in hopes of reinforcing her spirits she took another sip of canary wine then lifted her glass higher to study the room through its wavy refractions now briggs seemed a distorted comical pygmy as he ordered the servants to pass more bottles of killdevil down the table where the planters and their wives continued to slosh it into their pewter tankards of lemon punch after tonight she found herself thinking the whole history of the americas might well have to be rewritten barbados would soon be englands richest colony and unless the assembly held firm these few greedy puritans would seize control all thanks to sugar right there in the middle of it all was hugh winston looking a little melancholy and pensive he scarcely seemed to notice as several toasts to his health went round the tablesalutes to the man whod made sugar possible he obviously didnt care a damn about sugar he was too worried about getting his money as well he should be she smiled to herself hell never see it not a farthing anybody could tell that briggs and the council hadnt the slightest intention of settling his sight bills he didnt impress them for a minute with those pretty spanish pistols in his belt theyd stood up to a lot better men than him besides there probably werent two thousand pounds in silver on the whole island like all the american settlements barbados economy existed on barter and paper everything was valued in weights of tobacco or cotton metal money was almost never seen in fact it was actually against the law to export coin from england to the americas the whole council together couldnt come up with that much silver he could forget about settling his sight bills in specie i tell you this is the very thing every man herell need if hes to sleep nights briggs voice cut through her thoughts he was at the head of the table describing the security features of his new stone house mind you its not yet finished he gestured toward the large square staircase leading up toward the unpainted upper floors but its already secure as the tower of london she remembered briggs had laid the first stone of his grand new plantation house in the weeks after his return from brazil in anticipation of the fortune he expected to make from sugar and he had immediately christened it briggs hall the house and its surrounding stone wall were actually a small fortress the dining room where they sat now was situated to one side of the wide entry foyer across from the parlor and next to the smoky kitchen a long stone room set off to the side there were several small windows along the front and back of the house but these could all be sealed tight with heavy shuttersa measure as much for health as safety since the planters believed the cool night breeze could induce dangerous chills and hot paroxysms maybe he thought he needed such a house maybe she told herself he did he already had twenty indentures and hed just bought thirty africans the island now expected more slave cargos almost weekly as she listened she found herself watching hugh winston wondering what the councils favorite smuggler thought of it all well at the moment he looked unhappy he seemed to find briggs lecture on the new need for security either pathetic or amusinghis eyes were hard to make outbut she could tell from his glances round the table he found something ironic about the need for a stone fort in the middle of a caribbean island briggs suddenly interrupted his monologue and turned to signal his servants to begin placing trenchers of clay pipes and virginia tobacco down the table a murmur of approval went up when the planters saw it was imported not the musty weed raised on barbados the appearance of the tobacco signaled the official end of the food as the grayshirted servants began packing and firing the longstemmed pipes then kneeling to offer them to the tipsy planters several of the more robust wives present rose with a grateful sigh holding their new gowns away from the antrepellent tar smeared along the legs of the table and chairs they began retiring one by one to the changing room next to the kitchen where briggs irish maidservants could help loosen their tight bodices in preparation for the ball katherine watched the women file past then cringed as she caught the first sound of tuning fiddles from the large room opposite the entryway what was the rest of the evening going to be like surely the banquet alone was enough to prove briggs was now the most powerful man in barbados soon perhaps in all the americas he had truly outdone himself even the servants were saying it was the grandest night the island had ever seenand predicting it was only the first of many to come the indentures themselves had all dined earlier on their usual fare of loblolly cornmeal mush sweet potatoes and hyacinth beansthough tonight they were each given a small allowance of pickled turtle in honor of the banquet but for the council and their wives briggs had dressed an expensive imported beef as the centerpiece of the table the rump had been boiled and the brisket along with the cheeks roasted the tongue and tripe had been minced and baked into pies seasoned with sweet herbs spices and currants the beef had been followed by a dish of scots collops of pork then a young kid goat dressed in its own blood and thyme with a pudding in its belly and next a sweet suckling pig in a sauce of brains sage and nutmeg mulled in claret wine after that had come a shoulder of mutton and a side of goat both covered with a rasher of bacon then finally baked rabbit and a loin of veal and as though that werent enough to allow every planter there to gorge himself to insensibility there were also deep bowls of potato pudding and dishes of baked plantains prickly pear and custard apples at the end came the traditional cold meats beginning with roast duck well larded then spanish bacon pickled oysters and fish roe with it all was the usual killdevil as well as canary wine sherry and red sack from madeira when the greasestained table had been cleared and the pipes lighted briggs announced the afterdinner cordial a wide bowl of french brandy appeared before him and into it the servants cracked a dozen large hen eggs then a generous measure of sugar was poured in and the mixture vigorously stirred finally he called for a burning taper took it himself and touched the flame to the brandy the fumes hovering over the dish billowed into a huge yellow blossom and the table erupted with a cheer after the flame had died away the servants began ladling out the mixture and passing portions down the table katherine sipped the sweet harsh liquid and watched as two of the planters sitting nearby their clay pipes billowing rose unsteadily and hoisted their cups for a toast the pair smelled strongly of sweat and liquor they werent members of the council but both would also be using the new sugarworksfor a percentageafter briggs had finished with his own cane since their plantations were near briggs and neither could afford the investment to build his own one was thomas lockwood a short brooding cornwall bachelor who now held a hundred acres immediately north of briggs land and the other was william marlott a thin nervous suffolk merchant who had repaired to barbados with his consumptive wife ten years before and had managed to accumulate eighty acres upland all now planted in cane to the future of sugar on barbados lockwood began his voice slurred from the killdevil then marlott joined in and a fine fortune to every man at this table a buzz of approval circled the room and with a scrape of chairs all the other men pulled themselves to their feet and raised their cups katherine was surprised to see hugh winston lean back in his chair his own cup sitting untouched on the boards hed been drinking all evening but now his eyes had acquired an absent gaze as he watched the hearty congratulations going around after the planters had drunk briggs turned to him with a querulous expression wheres your thirst captain will you not drink to the beginnings of english prosperity in the caribbees sure its been a long time coming youll be an even longer time paying the price it was virtually the first time winston had spoken all evening and his voice was subdued there was a pause then he continued his voice still quiet so far all sugars brought you is slavery and prisons for homes when it was freedom that englishmen came to the americas for or so ive heard claimed now sir every mans got a right to his own mind on a thing i always say but the caribbees were settled for profit first and foremost lets not lose sight of that briggs smiled indulgently and settled his cup onto the table for that matter whats all this freedom worth if youve not a farthing in your pocket weve tried everything else and its got to be sugar its the real future of the americas depend on it which means weve got to work a batch of africans plain as that and pay mind they dont get out of hand weve tried it long enough to know these white indentures cant or wont endure the labor to make sugar try finding me a white man wholl cut cane all day in the fields thats why every spoon of that sweet powder an english gentlewoman stirs into her china cup already comes from a black hand in chains its always been itll always be for sure itll be the papist spaniards and portugals still holding the chains if not us winston beginning to look a bit the worse for drink seemed not to hear which means youre both on the end of a chain one way or another well sir thats as it may be briggs settled back into his chair but youve only to look at the matter to understand theres nothing to compare with sugar ask any papist now ive heard said it was first discovered in cathay but we all know sugars been the monopoly of the spaniards and portugals for centuries till now mind you the men in this room are the first englishmen whove ever learned even how to plant the canenot with seeds but by burying sections of stalk katherine braced herself for what would come next she had heard it all so many times before she almost knew his text by heart we all know that if the dutchmen hadnt taken that piece of brazil from the portugals sugard be the secret of the papists still so this very night were going to witness the beginning of a new history of the world english sugar aye edward bayes interrupted pausing to wipe his beard against his sleeve weve finally found something we can grow here in the caribbees thatll have a market worldwide show me the fine lord who doesnt have his cook lade sugar into every dish on his table or the cobbler one foot in the almshouse who doesnt use all the sugar he can buy or steal bayes beamed his redtinged eyes aglow in the candlelight and thats only today sir i tell you only today the market for sugars just beginning not a doubt briggs continued consider the new fashion just starting up in london for drinking coffee and chocolate theres a whole new market for sugar since theyll not be drunk without it he shoved aside his cup of punch and reached to pour a fresh splash of killdevil into his tankard in faith sugars about to change forever the way englishmen eat and drink and live and ill wager an acre of land herell make a pound of sugar for every pound of tobacco itll grow lockwood rose again when sugarll bring who knows how many times the price if we grow enough cane on barbados and buy ourselves enough of these africans to bring it in well be underselling the papists in five years time maybe less aye briggs seconded lockwood eyeing him as he drank it was common knowledge that briggs held eighteenmonth sight drafts from the planter coming due in a fortnight katherine looked at the two of them and wondered how long it would be before the better part of lockwoods acres were incorporated into the domain of briggs hall well i kept my end of our bargain for better or worse winstons voice lifted over the din of the table now its time for yours two thousand pounds were what we agreed on in coin spanish piecesofeight english sovereignstheres little difference to me its come katherine thought but hell not raise a shilling briggs was suddenly scrutinizing his tankard as an uneasy quiet settled around the table its a hard time for us all just now sir he looked up six months more and well have sugar to sell to the dutchmen but as it is today thats something you shouldve thought about when you signed those sight drafts id be the first one to grant you that point sir the very first briggs face had assumed an air of contrition but whats dones done he placed his rough hands flat down on the table as though to symbolize they were empty weve talked it over and the best we can manage nows to roll them over with interest naturally what would you say to five percent that wasnt the understanding winstons voice was quiet but his eyes narrowed well sir thats the terms were prepared to offer briggs tone hardened noticeably in this world its the wise man who takes what he can get the sight bills are for cash on demand winstons voice was still faint scarcely above a whisper katherine listened in dismay realizing shed secretly been hoping he could stand up to the council just to prove somebody could and now damn your sight bills sir weve made you our offer briggs exchanged glances with the other members of the council in truth itd be in the interest of all of us here to just have them declared worthless paper you cant rightfully do that winston drank again they have full legal standing we have courts here sir that could be made to take the longer view to look to the interests of the island therere still courts in england if we have to take it that far but youll not be going back there sir we both know itd take years briggs grinned and ill warrant youd get more justice in england than you bargained for if you had the brass to try it that remains to be seen winston appeared trying to keep his voice firm but therell be no need for that i seem to recall the terms give me recoursethe right to foreclose without notice foreclose briggs seemed unsure he had caught the word since you cosigned all the notes yourself i wont have to bother with the rest of the council winston continued i can just foreclose on you personally remember you pledged this plantation as collateral that was a formality and it was two years past briggs laughed before i built this house and the sugarworks at the time there was nothing on this property but a thatchedroof bungalow formality or not the drafts pledge these acres and whats on them well damn you sir briggs slammed down his tankard youll not get mind you i dont have any use for the land winston interjected so why dont we just make it the sugarworks that ought to about cover whats owed he looked back if i present the notes in bridgetown tomorrow morning we can probably just transfer ownership then and there what do you say to that arrangement youve carried this jest quite far enough sir briggs face had turned the color of the red pricklypear apples on the table we all need that sugarworks youll not be getting your hands on it i presume i speak for all the council when i say well protect our interests if you try foreclosing on that sugarworks ill call you out ive a mind to anyway here and now for your damned impudence he abruptly pushed back from the table his doublet falling open to reveal the handle of a pistol several council members shoved back also all had flintlock pistols in their belts the usual precaution in an island of unruly indentures winston appeared not to notice i see no reason for anyone to get killed over a little business transaction briggs laughed again no sir i suppose youd rather just try intimidating us with threats of foreclosure but by god if you think you can just barge in here and fleece the council of barbados youve miscalculated its time you learned a thing or two about this island he continued his voice rising just because you like to strut about with a pair of fancy flintlocks in your belt dont think well all heel to your bluff he removed his dark hat and threw it on the table it matched the black velvet of his doublet you can take our offer or you can get off my property here and now katherine caught the determined looks in the faces of several members of the council as their hands dropped to their belts she suddenly wondered if it had all been planned was this what theyd been waiting for they must have known hed not accept their offer and figured there was a cheaper way to manage the whole business anyway a standoff with pistols winston against them all i still think itd be better to settle this honorably winston looked down and his voice trailed off but there was a quick flash of anger in his bloodshot eyes slowly he picked up his tankard and drained it as the room grew silent he coughed at the harshness of the liquor then began to toy with the lid flipping the thumb mechanism attached to the hinged top and watching it flap open and shut he heaved a sigh then abruptly leaned back and lobbed it in the general direction of the staircase as the tankard began its trajectory he was on his feet kicking away his chair there was the sound of a pistol hammer being cocked and the hiss of a powder pan then the room flashed with an explosion from his left hand where a pistol had appeared from out of his belt at that moment the lid of the tankard seemed to disconnect in midair spinning sideways as it ricocheted off the post of carved mastic wood at the top of the stairs the pistol clicked rotating up the underbarrel and the second muzzle spoke this time the tankard emitted a sharp ring and tumbled end over end till it slammed against the railing finally it bounced to rest against the cedar wainscot of the hallway a small centered hole directly through the bottom the shorn lid was still rolling plaintively along the last step of the stairs the entire scene had taken scarcely more than a second katherine looked back to see him still standing he had dropped the flintlock onto the table both muzzles trailing wisps of gray smoke while his right hand gripped the stock of the other pistol still in his belt you can deduct that from whats owed his eyes went down the table briggs sat motionless in his chair staring at the tankard while the other planters all watched him in expectant silence finally he picked up his hat and settled it back on his head without a word slowly one by one the other men closed their doublets over their pistols and nervously reached for their tankards after a moment winston carefully reached for his chair and straightened it up he did not sit youll be welcome to buy back the sugarworks any time you like just collect the money and settle my sight bills the room was still caught in silence till finally briggs found his voice but the coins not to be had sir try and be reasonable i tell you wed not find it on the whole of the island then maybe ill just take something else he reached out and seized the motley gray shirt of timothy farrell now tiptoeing around the table carrying a fresh flask of killdevil to briggs the terrified irishman dropped the bottle with a crash as winston yanked him next to the table men and provisions briggs looked momentarily disoriented i dont follow you sir what would you be doing with them thats my affair just give me two hundred indentures owned by the men on the council who signed the sight drafts he paused that should cover about half the sum ill take the balance in provisions then you can all have your sight bills to burn now briggs was studying the tankard in front of him his eyes shining in the candlelight two hundred indentures and youd be willing to call it settled to the penny in the silence that followed the rasp of a fiddle sounded through the doorway followed by the shrill whine of a recorder briggs yelled for quiet then turned back there may be some merit in what youre proposing he glanced up at farrell watching the indenture flee the room as winston released his greasy shirt yes sir im thinking your proposal has some small measure of merit i dont know about the other men here but i can already name you a number of these layabouts i could spare he turned to the planters next to him and several nodded agreement aye id have us talk more on it he pushed back his chair and rose unsteadily from the table the other planters took this as a signal and as one man they scraped back their chairs and began to nervously edge toward the women now clustered under the arches leading into the dancing room when the times more suitable tomorrow then give us till tomorrow night sir after weve had some time to parlay briggs nodded then turned and led the crowd toward the sound of the fiddles relief in his eyes katherine sat unmoving dreading the prospect of having to dance with any of the drunken planters she watched through the dim candlelight as winston reached for an open flask of killdevil took a triumphant swig then slammed it down she suddenly realized the table had been entirely vacated save for the two of them the audacity of course it had all been a bluff anyone should have been able to tell hed just wanted the indentures all along but why i suppose congratulations are in order captain pardon he looked up not recognizing her through the smoke and flickering shadows forgive me madam i didnt catch what you said congratulations that was a fine show you put on with your pistol he seemed momentarily startled but then he laughed at his own surprise and took another swig of killdevil thank you very much he wiped his mouth set down the bottle and glanced back forgive me if i disturbed your evening where did you learn to shoot like that i used to do a bit of hunting have you ever actually shot a man not that i choose to remember i thought so it really was a bluff her eyebrows lifted so may i enquire what is it you propose doing now with your two hundred men and provisions youre miss bedford if im not mistaken he rose finally making her out i dont seem to recall our being introduced he bowed with a flourish hugh winston your most obedient servant then he reached for the flask of killdevil as he lowered back into his chair id never presume to address a lady unless were properly acquainted she found the hint of sarcasm in his tone deliberately provoking she watched as he took another drink directly from the bottle i dont seem to recall ever seeing you speak with a lady captain youve got a point his eyes twinkled perhaps its because therere so few out here in the caribbees or could it be youre not aware of the difference his insolent parody of politeness had goaded her into a tone not entirely to her own liking so ive sometimes been told again his voice betrayed his pleasure but then i doubt there is much really he grinned at least by the time they get around to educating me on that topic as happened only rarely she couldnt think of a sufficiently cutting riposte she was still searching for one when he continued all the while examining her in the same obvious way hed done on the shore excuse me but i believe you enquired about something the men and provisions i believe it was the plain answer is i plan to take them and leave barbados as soon as i can manage and where is it you expect youll be going she found her footing again and this time she planned to keep it lets say on a little adventure to see a new part of the world he was staring at her through the candlelight ive had about enough of this island of yours miss bedford as well as the new idea that slaverys going to make everybody rich im afraid its not my style but i gather youre the man responsible for our noble new order here captain he looked down at the flask his smile vanishing if thats true im not especially proud of the fact at last she had him all his arrogance had dissolved just like jeremy that time she asked him to tell her what exactly hed done in the battle at marsten moor yet for some reason she pulled back still studying him its hard to understand you captain you help them steal sugarcane from the portugals then you decide you dont like it at the time it was a job miss bedford lets say ive changed my mind since then things didnt turn out exactly the way id figured they would he took another drink then set down the bottle and laughed that always seems to be the way what do you mean its something like the story of my life his tone waxed slightly philosophical as he stared at the flickering candle i always end up being kicked about by events so now ive decided to try turning things around do a little kicking of my own thats a curious ambition i suppose these indentures are going to help you do it she was beginning to find him more interesting than shed expected you said just now you learned to shoot by hunting i know a lot of men who hunt but ive never seen anything like what you did tonight where exactly did you learn that he paused wondering how much to say the place of course was tortuga and these days that meant the cowkillers men who terrified the settlers of the caribbean but this wasnt a woman he cared to frighten he was beginning to like her brass the way she met his eye maybe he thought hed explain it all to her if he got a chance someday but not tonight the story was too long too painful and ended too badly his memories of tortuga went back to the sultry autumn of just a year before that little island had been taken over by a group of english plantersmen and women whod earlier tried growing tobacco up on st christopher only to run afoul of its carib indians and their poisoned arrows after looking around for another island theyd decided on tortuga where nobody lived then except for a few hunters of wild cattle the cowkillers since the hunters themselves spent a goodly bit of their time across the channel on the big spanish island of hispaniola tortuga was all but empty but now these planters were living just off the northern coast of a major spanish domain potentially much more dangerous than merely having a few indians about so they petitioned the newly formed providence company in london to swap a shipment of cannon for a tobacco contract the company recently set up by some puritan wouldbe privateers happily agreed enter hugh winston hed just been apprenticed for three months to the company by his royalist parents intended as a temporary disciplining for some unpleasant reflections hed voiced on the character of king charles that summer after coming home from his first term at oxford lord winston and his wife lady brett knowing he despised the puritans for their hypocrisy assumed this would be the ideal means to instill some royalist sympathies as it happened two weeks later the providence company posted this unwelcome son of two prominent monarchists out to tortuga on the frigate delivering their shipment of guns no surprise governor hilton of the islands puritan settlement soon had little use for him either after he turned out to show no more reverence for puritans than for the monarchy he was sent over to hunt on hispaniola with the cow killers thats where he had to learn to shoot if he was to survive as things turned out being banished there probably saved his life when the spaniards got word of this new colony with englishmen pouring in from london and bristol the audiencia of santo domingo the large spanish city on hispaniolas southern side decided to make an example so in january of they put together an assault force of some two hundred fifty infantry sailed into tortugas harbor and staged a surprise attack as they boasted afterward they straightaway put to the sword all those they first captured then hanged any others who straggled in later by the time theyd finished theyd burned the settlement to the ground and killed over six hundred men women and children they also hanged a few of the cowkillersa mistake that soon changed history when jacques le basque the bearded leader of hispanio las hunters found out what had happened to his men he vowed he was going to bankrupt and destroy spains new world empire in revenge from what was heard these days he seemed well on his way to succeeding hugh winston had been there a founding member of that band of men now known as the most vicious marauders the world had ever seen that was the piece of his life hed never gotten around to telling anyone i did some hunting when i was apprenticed to an english settlement here in the caribbean years ago well i must say you shoot remarkably well for a tobacco planter captain she knew he was avoiding her question why i thought id just explained i also hunted some in those days he took another drink then sought to shift the topic perhaps now i can be permitted to ask you a question miss bedford id be interested to know what you think of the turn things are taking here that is in your official capacity as first lady of this grand settlement what exactly do you mean god damn his supercilious tone the changes ahead here on barbados he waved his hand will everybody grow rich the way theyre claiming some of the landowners are apt to make a great deal of money if sugar prices hold why she wondered did he want to know was he planning to try and settle down or get into the slave trade himself in truth that seemed more in keeping with what he did for a living now some and why only some he examined her puzzling every planter must already own a piece of this suddenly valuable land the council members and the other big landowners are doubtless thinking to try and force out the smaller freeholders wholl not have a sugarworks and therefore be at their mercy she began to toy deliberately with her glass uncomfortable at the prospect she was describing its really quite simple captain im sure you can grasp the basic principles of commerce given your line of work no little fortunes just a few big ones oddly he refused to be baited youve got it precisely but what does that matter to you you dont seem to care all that much what happens to our small freeholders if thats true its a sentiment i probably share with most of the people who were at this table tonight he raised the empty flask of killdevil and studied it thoughtfully against the candle so if briggs and the rest are looking to try and take it all then id say youre in for a spell of stormy weather here miss bedford well their plans are far from being realized that i promise you our assembly will stand up to them all the way then i suppose i should wish you and your father and your assembly luck youre going to need it he flung the empty flask crashing into the fireplace rose and moved down the table the light seemed to catch in his scar as he passed the candle and now perhaps youll favor me with the next dance she looked up startled as he reached for her hand captain i think you ought to know that im planning to be married to one of these rich planters i presume to a gentleman if you know what that is and a man who would not take it kindly if he knew i was seen with you here tonight oh yes anthony walrond winston erupted with laughter well good for him he also has superb taste in flintlock muskets please tell him that when next you see him you mean the ones you stole from his ship that went aground i dont expect he would find that comment very amusing wouldnt he now winstons eyes flashed well damned to him and if you want to hear something even less amusing than that ask him sometime to tell you why i took those muskets he reached for her hand at any rate id like to dance with his lovely fiancee ive already told you but its so seldom a man like me is privileged to meet a true lady his smile suddenly turned gracious as you were thoughtful enough to point out only a few moments ago why not humor me i dont suppose youre his property you seem a trifle too independent for that anthony would doubtless be infuriated but she found herself smiling back anyway how would he ever find out none of these puritans even spoke to him besides what else was there to do sit and stare at the greasy tankards on the table but what exactly had hugh winston meant about anthonys muskets very well just one im flattered he was sweeping her through the archway into the next room the fiddles were just starting a new tune while the planters and their wives lined up facing each other beginning the country dance flaunting two as couples began to step forward one by one then whirl down the room in turns to the music katherine found herself joining the end of the womens line moments later winston bowed to her heels together then spun her down the makeshift corridor between the lines he turned her away from him then back elegantly in perfect time with the fiddle bows the dance seemed to go on forever as bodies smelling of sweat and killdevil jostled together in the confinement of the tiny room yet it was invigorating purging all her misgivings over the struggle that lay ahead when she moved her body to her will like this she felt in control of everything as if she were riding the wind hard against her cheek then as now she could forget about anthony the council about everything why couldnt all of life be managed the same way when the dance finally concluded the fiddlers scarcely paused before striking up another just one more he was bending over saying something what she looked up at him not hearing his words above the music and noise and bustle of the crowd whatever it was hed said it couldnt be all that important she reached for his hand and guided him into the next dance a loud clanging resounded through the room causing the fiddles to abruptly halt and startling katherine who found herself alarmed less by the sound than by the deadening return of reality she looked around to see benjamin briggs standing in the center of the floor slamming a large bell with a mallet attention gentlemen and ladies if you please he was shouting even though the room had gone silent alls ready the sugarworks startup is now there was general applause around the room he waited till it died away then continued in a more moderate tone i presume the ladies will prefer to retire above stairs rather than chance the night air theres feather beds and hammocks ready and the servantsll bring the candles and chamber pots winston listened in mock attentiveness then leaned over toward katherine then i must bid you farewell miss bedford and lose you to more worthy companions she looked at him dumbly her blood still pumping from the dance the exhilaration and release were the very thing shed been needing i have no intention of missing the grand startup she tried to catch her breath its to be history in the making dont you recall that it truly will be he shrugged but are you sure the sugarworks is any place for a woman as much as a man she glared back at him theres a woman there already captain briggs mulatto i heard him say shes in the boiling house tonight showing one of the new africans how to heat the sap she supposedly ran one once in brazil maybe she just told him that to avoid the dance he turned and watched the planters begin filing out through the wide rear door shall we join them then as they walked out into the courtyard the cool night air felt delicious against her face and sweltering bodice at the back of the compound briggs was opening a heavy wooden gate in the middle of the tenfoothigh stone wall that circled his house these africansll make all the difference on my faith its already plain as can be he cast a withering glance at katherine as she and winston passed then he followed them through ordering the servants to secure the gate the planters were assembled in a huddle now surrounded by several of briggs indentures holding candlelanterns he took up his place at the front of the crowd and began leading them down the muddy road toward the torchlit sugarworks lying to the left of the plantation house along the road were the thatched cabins of the indentured servants and beyond these was a cluster of halffinished reed and clay huts scarcely head high that the africans had begun constructing for themselves theyre sound workers for all their peculiar ways briggs paused and pointed to a large drum resting in front of one of the larger huts it was shaped like an hourglass and separate goatskins had been stretched over each mouth and laced together end to end what do you make of that contrivance the first thing they did was start making this drum and all this morning before sunup they were pounding on it damnedest racket this side of hell aye mine did the very same lancaster volunteered i heard them drumming all over the island briggs walked on they gathered round that yoruba called atiba whos shaking some little seashells on a tray and chanting some of their gabble after a time hed say something to one of them and then thered be more drumming he shook his head in amazement idolatry worsen the papists ive a mind to put a stop to it whittington interjected the indentures are already complaining its a bother i grant you but i see no harm in their customs long as they put in a days work the place i drew the line was when they started trying to bathe in my pond every night when any christian knows baths are a threat to health but for it all one of them will cut more cane than three irishmen he cast a contemptuous glance backward at timothy farrell who was following at a distance holding several bottles of killdevil from sunup to sundown good workers to the man so if they choose to beat on drums i say let them its nothing from my pocket katherine watched winston shake his head in dismay as he paused to pick up the drum turning it in his hands you seem troubled about their drumming captain whys that he looked up at her almost as though he hadnt heard youve never been to brazil have you miss bedford i have not then you probably wouldnt believe me even if i told you he looked back at the huts and seemed to be talking to himself god damn these englishmen theyre fools its surely some kind of their african music obviously his voice had a sarcastic cut which she didnt particularly like but before she could reply to him in kind he had set down the drum and moved on seeming to have forgotten all about whatever it was that had so distressed him the moment before then he turned back to her may i enquire if you yourself play an instrument miss bedford i once played the spinet she reached down and picked up a small land crab wandering across their path she examined it then flung it aside its claws flailing but i dont bother anymore he watched the crab bemusedly then turned back then you do know something about music were not without some rudiments of education here on barbados captain and languages have you ever listened to these yoruba talk theirs is a language of tones you know same as their drums some of these new africans have a curioussounding speech i grant you he stared at her a moment as though preoccupied god help us all he might have said more but then he glanced after the crowd now moving down the road ahead of them a gang of blacks could be seen through the torchlight carrying bundles of cane in from the field and stacking them in piles near the new mill situated atop a slight rise a group of white indentured workers was also moving cane toward the mill from somewhere beyond the range of the torchlight whipping forward a team of oxen pulling a large twowheeled cart stacked with bundles she noticed winston seemed in no great hurry and instead appeared to be listening absently to the planters would you believe this is the very same cane we brought from brazil briggs was pointing toward a halfcut field adjacent to the road i planted october a year ago just before the autumn rains its been sixteen months almost to the day just like the dutchmen said he turned back to the crowd of planters the indentures weeded and dunged it but i figured the africans would be best for cutting it and i was right born field workers theyll be a godsend if they can be trained to run the sugarworks he lowered his voice this is the last well need of these idling white indentures they were now approaching the mill which was situated inside a new thatchedroof building intended for crushing the cane and extracting the juice it would be powered by two large white oxen shipped down specially from rhode island the mill was a mechanism of three vertical brass rollers each approximately a foot in diameter that were cogged together with teeth around their top and bottom a large round beam was secured through the middle of the central roller and attached to two long sweeps that extended outward to a circular pathway intended for the draft animals when the sweeps were moved the beam would rotate and with it the rollers we just finished installing the rollers tonight there was no chance to test it but i explained the operation to the indentures well see if they can remember an ox had been harnessed to each of the two sweeps as briggs approached he signaled the servants to whip them forward the men nodded and lashed out at the animals who snorted tossed their heads then began to trudge in a circular path around the mill immediately the central roller began to turn rotating the outer rollers against it by way of its cogs as the rollers groaned into movement several of the indentures backed away and studied them nervously well what are you waiting for briggs yelled at the two men standing nearest the mill holding the first bundles of cane go ahead and try feeding it through one of the men moved gingerly toward the grinding rollers and reached out at arms length to feed a small bundle consisting of a half dozen stalks of cane into the side rotating away from him there was a loud crackle as the bundle began to gradually disappear between the rollers as the crushed cane stalks emerged on the rear side of the mill a second indenture seized the flattened bundle and fed it back through the pair of rollers turning in the opposite direction in moments a trickle of pale sap began sliding down the sides of the rollers and dripping into a narrow trough that led through the wall and down the incline toward the boiling house briggs walked over to the trough and examined the running sap in silence then he dipped in a finger and took it to his lips he savored it for a moment looked up triumph in his eyes and motioned the other men forward have a taste its the sweetest nectar there could ever be as the planters gathered around the trough sampling the first cane juice indentures continued feeding a steady progression of cane bundles between the rollers while the planters stood watching the trough began to flow it works by christ marlott emitted a whoop and dipped in for a second taste the first english sugar mill in all the world weve just witnessed that grand historic moment miss bedford winston turned back to her his voice sardonic in a little more time these wonderful sugarmills will probably cover barbados together with the slaves needed to cut the cane for them id wager that in a few years time therell be more africans here than english what weve just witnessed is not the beginning of the great english caribbees but the first step toward whatll one day be the great african caribbees i suggest we take time to savor it well his voice was drowned in the cheer rising up from the cluster of planters around briggs they had moved on down the incline now and were standing next to the boiling house watching as the sap began to collect in a tank briggs scrutinized the tank a moment longer then turned to the group this is where the saps tempered with wet ashes just before its boiled thats how the portugals do it from here it runs through that troughhe indicated a second flow now startingdirectly into the first kettle in the boiling house he paused and gestured farrell to bring the flasks forward i propose we take time to fortify ourselves against the heat before going in shall we proceed winston was pointing down the hill then he laughed or would you like some liquor first please she pushed past him and headed down the incline they reached the door of the boiling house well before the planters who were lingering at the tank passing the flask winston ducked his head at the doorway and they passed through a wide archway and into a thatchedroof enclosure containing a long waisthigh furnace of dutch brick in the back visible only from the light of the open furnace door were two figures briggs new yoruba slave atiba and his portuguese mistress serina katherine who had almost forgotten how beautiful the mulatto was found herself slightly relieved that serina was dressed in perfect modesty she wore a fulllength white shift against which her flawless olive skin fairly glowed in the torchlight as they entered she was speaking animatedly with atiba while bending over to demonstrate how to feed dry cane tops into the small openings along the side of the furnace when she spotted them however she pulled suddenly erect and fell silent halting in midsentence the heat in the room momentarily took away katherines breath causing her to stand in startled disorientation it was only then that she realized hugh winston was pulling at her sleeve something in the scene apparently had taken him completely by surprise then she realized what it was serina had been speaking to the tall loinclothclad yoruba in an alien language that sounded almost like a blend of musical tones and stops now the planters began barging through the opening congratulating briggs as they clustered around the string of copper cauldrons cemented into the top of the long furnace then as the crowd watched expectantly a trickle of cane sap flowed down from the holding tank and spattered into the first redhot cauldron the men erupted with a cheer and whipped their hats into the air again the brown flask of killdevil was passed appreciatively after taking a long swallow briggs turned to serina gesturing toward atiba as he addressed her in pidgin portuguese intended to add an international flavor to the evening ele compreendo sim compreendo she nodded reached for a ladle and began to skim the first gathering of froth off the top of the boiling liquid then she dumped the foam into a clay pot beside the furnace shes supposed to know how fast to feed the furnaces to keep the temperature right and when to ladle the liquor into the next cauldron down the row he stepped back from the furnace fanning himself with his hat and turned to the men according to the way the portugals do it in brazil the clarified liquor from the last cauldron in the line here is moved to a cistern to cool for a time then its filled into wooden pots and moved to the curing house is that ready too a husky voice came from somewhere in the crowd aye and ive already had enough pots made to get started we let the molasses drain out and the sugar cure for three or four months then we move the pots to the knocking house where we turn them over and tap out a block of sugar the top and bottom are brown sugar what the portugals call muscavado and the center is pure white he reached again for the bottle and took a deep swallow twenty pence a pound in london when our tobacco used to clear three farthings to be sure the mill and the boiling house are the key well have to start building these all over the island thomas lancaster removed his black hat to wipe his brow then pulled it firmly back on his head and start training the africans in their operation no white man could stand this heat she should have this one trained in a day or so briggs thumbed toward atiba now standing opposite the door examining the planters then we can have him train more ill venture youd do well to watch that one particularly close edward bayes lowered his voice speaking into his beard theres a look about him aye hes cantankerous ill grant you but hes quick he just needs to be tamed ive already had to flog him once ten lashes the first night here when he balked at eating loblolly mush ten you say dalby bedford did not bother to disguise the astonishment in his voice would you not have done better to start with five are you lecturing me now on how to best break in my africans briggs glared i paid for them sir theyre my property to manage as i best see fit nicholas whittington murmured his assent and others concurred as you say gentlemen but youve got three more dutch slavers due within a fortnight i understand theyre supposed to be shipping barbados a full three thousand this year alone bedford looked about the room with a concerned expression thatll be just a start if sugar production expands the way it seems it will it might be well if we had the assembly pass acts for ordering and governing these slaves damn your assembly we already have laws for property on barbados again the other planters voiced their agreement bedford stood listening then lifted his hand for quiet katherine found herself wishing he would be as blunt with them as winston had been sometimes the governors good manners got in the way something that hardly seemed to trouble hugh winston i tell you this is no light matter no man in this room knows how to manage all these africans what englishman has ever been responsible for twenty thirty nay perhaps even a hundred slaves theyve to be clothed in some manner fed paired for offspring and religion sir some of the quakers weve let settle in bridgetown are already starting to say your blacks should be baptized and taught christianity you cant be suggesting it if we let them be made christians where would it end briggs examined him in disbelief youd have laws sir acts of your assembly well theres the place to start i hold the first law should be to fine and set in the stocks any of these socalled quakers caught trying to teach our blacks christianity well not stand for it katherine saw serinas features tense and her eyes harden but she said nothing merely continued to skim the foam from the boiling surface of the cauldron the spaniards and portugals teach the catholic faith to their negroes bedford continued evenly and there you have the difference theyre not english theyre papists briggs paused as he studied the flow of cane sap entering the cauldron from the holding tank still dripping slowly from the lead spout by the looks of it it could be flowing faster he studied it a moment longer then turned toward the door the mill maybe thats the answer what if we doubled the size of the cane bundles katherine watched the planters trail after briggs out the doorway and into the night still passing the flask of killdevil what do you think captain should an african be made a christian theologys not my specialty miss bedford he walked past her tell me first if you think a puritans one he was moving toward serina who stood silently skimming the top of the first cauldron now a vigorous boil she glanced up once and examined him then returned her eyes to the froth katherine just managed to catch a few words as he began speaking to her quietly in fluent portuguese as though to guard against any of the planters accidentally overhearing senhora how is it you know the language of the africans she looked up for a moment without speaking her eyes disdainful im a slave too as you well know senhor then she turned and continued with the ladle but youre a portugal and never forget that i am not one of these preto she spat out the portuguese word for negro atiba continued methodically shoving cane tops into the roaring mouth of the furnace but you were speaking to him just now in his own language i recognized it he asked a question and i answered him thats all then you do know his language how i know many things she fixed his eyes continuing in portuguese perhaps it surprises you ingles that a mulata can speak at all i also know how to read something half the branco rubbish who were in this room tonight probably cannot do katherine knew only a smattering of portuguese but she caught the part about some of the branco the whites not being able to read she smiled to think there was probably much truth in that certainly almost none of the white indentures could further she suspected that many of the planters had never bothered to learn either i know you were educated in brazil winston was pressing serina relentlessly i was trying to ask you how you know the language of this african she paused her face a blend of haughtiness and regret she started to speak then stopped herself wont you tell me she turned back as though speaking to the cauldron my mother was yoruba is that how you learned his voice was skeptical i was taught also by a babalawo a yoruba priest in brazil whats she saying katherine moved next to him shielding her eyes from the heat desculpe senhora excuse me winston quickly moved forward continuing in portuguese as he motioned toward katherine this is i know perfectly well who miss bedford is serina interrupted him still in portuguese katherine stared at her not catching the foreign words is she talking about me she said her mother was a yoruba winston moved between them and she said something about a priest is she some sort of priest is that what she said no serinas english answer was quick and curt then she said something else to winston in portuguese she said she was not though the women of her mothers family have practiced divination for many generations divination katherine studied him puzzled then she turned back to serinawhat do you mean by that serina was looking at her now for the first time divination is the way the yoruba people ask their gods to tell the future how exactly do they go about doing such a thing many ways she turned back to the cauldron winston stood in the silence for a moment then turned to katherine i think one of the ways is with shells in brazil i once saw a yoruba diviner shaking a tray with small seashells in it serina glanced back now speaking english i see you are an ingles who bothers to try and understand other peoples one of the few ive ever met felicitacao senhor my compliments yes that is one of the ways and the most sacred to a yoruba its called the divination of the sixteen cowrie shells a yoruba diviner foretells the will of the gods from how the shells lie in a tray after it has been shakenby how many lie with the slotted side up its the way the gods talk to him who are these gods they speak to katherine found herself challenged by the mulattos haughtiness serina continued to stir the cauldron youd not know them senhora but i would be pleased to hear of them katherines voice was sharp but then she caught herself and softened it are they something like the christian god serina paused examining katherine for a moment and then her eyes assumed a distant expression i do not know much about them i know there is one god like the christian god he is the high god who never shows his powers on earth but there are many other gods who do the one the yoruba call on most is shango the god of thunder and lightning and of fire his symbol is the doubleheaded axe there also is ogun who is the god of iron she hesitated and the god of war katherine studied her do you believe in all these african deities yourself who can say whats really true senhora her smooth skin glistened from the heat she brushed the hair from her eyes in a graceful motion as though she were in a drawing room while her voice retreated again into formality the yoruba even believe that many different things can be true at once something no european can ever understand theres something you may not understand senhora winston interjected speaking now in english and i think you well should the yoruba in this room also knows the language of the portugals take care what you say its not possible she glanced at atiba contemptuously continuing loudly in portuguese hes a saltwater preto before winston could respond there was an eruption of shouts and curses from the direction of the mill they all turned to watch as benjamin briggs shoved through the doorway pointing at atiba get that one out here i warrant he can make them understand the sweltering room seemed frozen in time except for briggs now motioning at serina tell him to come out here he revolved to winston ive a mind to flog all of them whats wrong the damned mill i doubled the size of the bundles the very thing i shouldve done in the first place but now the oxen cant turn it properly i want to try hooking both oxen to one of the sweeps and a pair of africans on the other ive harnessed them up but i cant get them to move he motioned again for atiba to accompany him this ones got more wit than all the rest together maybe i can show him what i want serina gestured toward atiba who followed briggs out the door into the fresh night air katherine stared after him for a moment then turned back winston was speaking to serina again in portuguese but too rapidly to follow will you tell me one thing more as you wish senhor she did not look up from the cauldron what was going on last night with the drums she hesitated slightly i dont know what you mean winston was towering over her now i think you know very well what i mean senhora now tell me damn it what were they saying she seemed not to hear him through the silence that filled the room there suddenly came a burst of shouts from the direction of the mill katherine felt fear sweep over her and she found herself seizing winstons arm pulling him toward the doorway outside the planters were milling about in confusion vague shadows against the torchlight then she realized atiba was trying to wrench off the harness from the necks of the two blacks tied to the sweeps of the mill while yelling at briggs in his african language she gripped winstons arm tighter as she watched william marlott brandishing a heavybladed cane machete move on atiba then several other planters leapt out of the shadows grabbed his powerful shoulders and wrestled him to the ground youd best flog him here and now marlott looked up sweat running down his face itll be a proper lesson to all the rest briggs nodded toward several of the white indentures and in moments a rope was lashed to atibas wrists then he was yanked against the mill his face between the wet rollers one of the indentures brought forward a braided leather horsewhip katherine turned her face away back toward the boiling house not wanting to see serina was standing in the doorway now staring out blankly a shimmering moistness in her eyes chapter four for almost a month now any night he could manage atiba had slipped unseen from the compound and explored the southern coast of the island the shore and the upland hills now he was sure they could survive after the island became theirs the branco the white english were savages who destroyed all they touched but there were still traces of what once had been between the fields of sterile cane he had found and tasted the fruits of the sacred earth there were groves of wild figs their dark fruit luscious and astringent and plump coconuts their tender core as rich as any in yorubaland along the shore were stands of seagrape trees with a sweet purple fruit biting to the tongue he had also found palmlike trees clustered with the tender papaya and farther inland there were groves of banana and plantain he had discovered other trees with large oranges plump with yellow nectar as well as pomegranates and tamarind just like those he had known in ife his home city the soil itself gave forth moist melons wild cucumbers and the red apples of the prickly cactus there also were calabash the hard round gourds the ingles had already learned could be hollowed out for cups and basins the only thing wanting was that staple of the yoruba people the yam but they would not have to survive from the soil alone in the thickets he had heard the grunts and squeals of the wild hogs fat sows foraging nuts leading their litters along the shore he had seen flocks of feeding egrets in the dawn light ready to be snared and roasted and at his feet there had been hundreds of land crabs night prowlers as big as two hands ripe for boiling as they scurried back to their sand burrows along the shore he could not understand why the branco slaves who worked alongside the yoruba allowed themselves to be fed on boiled corn mush a natural bounty lay within arms reach the orisa those forces in nature that work closest with man were still present on the island he could sense them waiting in the wood of the trees this ravished place had once been a great forest like the one north of ife and it could be again if the hand of the ingles was taken from it and the spirit of the orisa its rightful protectors freed once more the first cooing of the wood dove sounded through the thatched hut above the chorus of whistling frogs from the pond signaling the approach of day atiba sat motionless in the graying light crosslegged at the edge of the mud seat nearest the door and studied the sixteen cowrie shells as they spun across the reed tray that lay before him as he watched eight of the small ovals came to rest mouth up in a wide crescent the remainder facing down the tiny room was crowded with the men of the yoruba their cotton loincloths already drenched with sweat from the early heat now all eyes narrowed in apprehension waiting for this babalawo the priest of the yoruba to speak and interpret the verses that revealed the message in the cowries bi a ko jiya ti o kun agbon if we do not bear suffering that will fill a basket a ko le jore to kun inu aha we will not receive kindness that will fill a cup he paused and signaled the tall bearded drummer waiting by the door the mans name was obewole and he had once been many rains ago the strongest drummer in the entire city of ife he nodded and shifted the large drumthe yoruba iya iluthat hung at his waist suspended from a wide shoulder strap abruptly the small wooden mallet he held began to dance across the taut goatskin the verses atiba had just spoken were repeated exactly the drums tone changing in pitch and timbre as obewole squeezed the cords down its hourglass waist between his arm and his side moments later there came the sound of more drums along the length of the southern coast transmitting his verses inland in less than a minute all the yoruba on barbados had heard their babalawos exact words then he said something more and shook the tray again this time five cowries lay open set as a star again he spoke his eyes far away a segi oko ma we oko the tree that swims like a canoe a sagada jari erin the sword that will cut iron once more the drum sent the words over the morning quiet of the island atiba waited a few moments longer then slowly looked up and surveyed the expectant faces around him the shells had spoken true enough but the message of the gods was perplexing seemingly shango had counseled endurance while ogun foretold war he alone was priest and he alone could interpret this contradictory reading he knew in his heart what the gods wanted what they surely must want still the realization brought painful memories he knew too well what war would mean he had seen it many timesthe flash of mirrored steel in the sunlight the blood of other men on your hands the deaths of wise fathers and strong sons the worst had been when he and his warriors had stood shoulder to shoulder defending the ancient royal compound at ife with their lives when the fulani from the north had breached the high walls of the city and approached the very entrance of the ruling obas palace those huge sculptured doors guarded by the two sacred bronze leopards that day he and his men had lost more strong warriors than there were women to mourn them but by nightfall they had driven out the worshippers of other gods who would take their lands pillage their compounds carry away their seedyams and their youngest wives he also knew there could be betrayal he had seen it during the last season of rains when the drums had brought news of strangers in the southeastern quarter of the world that was yorubaland he and his men had left their compounds and marched all day through the rain that night among the trees they had been fallen upon by benin slavers men of black skin who served the branco as a woman serves the payer of her brideprice but the men of the yoruba would never be made to serve their gods were too powerful their ancestors too proud the yoruba were destined to rule just as they had governed yorubaland for a thousand years theirs was an ancient and noble people nothing like the halfcivilized ingles on this island in the great metropolis of ife surrounded by miles of massive concentric walls the yoruba had lived for generations in wide family compounds built of white clay their courtyards open to light and air walking streets paved with brick and stone wearing embroidered robes woven of finest cotton sculpting lostwax bronzes whose artistry no ingles could even imagine they did not swelter in patchedtogether log huts like the ingles planters here or in thatched hovels like the ingles planters servants and they paid reverence to gods whose power was far greater than any branco had ever seen the sky has no shadow it reaches out in all directions to the edge of the world in it are the sun the moon all that is he paused waiting for the drums then continued i have gone out into the dark the void that is night and i have returned unharmed i say the orisa are here strong we must make war on the branco to free them once more he paused again no mans day of death can be postponed it is already known to all the gods there is nothing we need fear after the drums had sent his words across the island the hut fell quiet then there came a voice from a small wizened man sitting on atibas left a yoruba older than the rest with sweat pouring down the wrinkles of his long dark face you are of royal blood atiba your father balogun was one of the sixteen royal babalawo of the oba of ife one of the great awoni it was he who taught you his skills he cleared his throat signifying his importance yet i say you now speak as one who has drunk too many horns of palm wine we are only men ogun will not come forth to carry our shields old tahajo you who are the oldest and wisest here tonight you know full well i am but a man atiba paused to demonstrate deference he was chagrined that this elder who now honored his hut had to sit directly on the mud seat that there was no buffalo skin to take down off the wall for him as there would have been in a compound at ife though the gods allow me to read their words in the cowries i still eat the food a woman cooks i know you are a man son of balogun and the finest ever sired in ife i knew you even before you grew of age before you were old enough to tie a cloth between your legs i was there the day your clan marks were cut in your cheek those three proud lines that mark you the son of your father be his son now but speak to us today as a man not as babalawo let us hear your own voice atiba nodded and set aside the tray then he turned back to the drummer and reached for his gleaming machete since tahajo wishes it we will wait for another time to consult more with ogun and shango now i will hold a sword and speak simply as a man obewole nodded and picked up the mallet this island was once ruled by the orisa of the forest but now there is only cane its sweetness is bitter in the mouths of the gods for it has stolen their home i say we must destroy it to do this we will call down the fire of lightning that shango guards in the sky how can we call down shangos fire the old man spoke again none of the others in the cramped hut dared question atiba so boldly no man here is consecrated to shango we are all warriors men of ogun his power is only over the earth not the skies i believe there is one on this island whose lineage is shango a woman perhaps she no longer even knows it but through her we will reach him he turned and signaled obewole to ready the drum now i will speak hear me shangos spirit is here on this island he will help us take away the strength of the ingles he paused for the drums then continued i learned on the ship that before the next new moon there will be many more of us here the other warriors who were betrayed by the benin traitors will be with us again then we will take out the fire of shango that the ingles hold prisoner in the boiling house and release it in the night among the fields of cane we will burn the compounds of the ingles and take their muskets then we will free the white slaves they are too craven to free themselves but they will not stand with their branco masters he turned again to obewole and nodded send the words winston shifted uneasily in his sleep then bolted upright rubbing the slight ache of his scar as he became aware of the distant spatter of drums they were sporadic but intense patterns were being repeated again and again all down the coast he slipped from the bed and moved quietly to the slatted window to listen more closely but now the drums had fallen silent the only sounds left in the sweltering predawn air were the cooing of wood doves and the harsh quark of egrets down by the bridge accompanied by joans easy snores he looked back and studied her face again realizing that time was beginning to take its toll he also knew he didnt care though he figured she did mightily shed never concede he could take jamaica maybe she was right but odds be damned it was time to make a stand jamaica he thought about it again his excitement swelling enough cannon and the spaniards could never retake it never even get a warship into the harbor it was perfect a place of freedom that would strike a blow against forced labor throughout the new world not a minute too soon either the future was clear as day the english settlers in the caribbees were about to install what had to be the most absolute system of human slavery ever seen admittedly finding sufficient men and women to work the fields had always been the biggest impediment to developing the virgin lands of the americas especially for settlements that wanted to grow money crops for export but now barbados had discovered africans what next if slavery proved it could work for sugar in the caribbees then it probably would also be instituted for cotton and tobacco in virginia agricultural slavery had started here but soon it would doubtless be introduced wholesale into north america christians perpetrating the most unspeakable crime against humanity possible who knew what it would someday lead to he no longer asked himself why he detested slavery so much but there was a reason if hed wanted to think about it a man was a man seeing briggs horsewhip his yoruba was too similar to watching ruyters flog his seamen he had tasted the catoninetails himself more than once in fact whipping the yoruba was almost worse since a seaman could always jump ship at the next port but a slave especially on a small island like barbados had nowhere to go no escape not yet but come the day jamaica was his are you all right love joan had awakened and was watching him i was listening to the drums and thinking he did not turn those damned drums every morning why dont the planters put a halt to it she raised up and swabbed her face with the rough cotton sheet god curse this heat im tired of all of it particularly slavery i fancy these africans are not your worry youd best be rethinking this daft scheme of yours with the indentures thats on schedule the council agreed to the terms drew up a list of men and i picked the ones i wanted whatre you thinkin to do about ordnance skepticism permeated her groggy voice ive got a batch of new flintlocks on the defiance generously supplied to me by anthony walronds trading company he laughed in grateful appreciation for helping out that frigate of theirs that went aground up by nevis island i heard about that i also hear hed like those muskets back he can see me in hell about that he was strolling back toward the bed nude in the early light she admired the hard ripple of his chest the long muscular legs also ive got the boys at work making some halfpikes weve set up a forge down by the bay and what pray are you expectin to use for pikestaffs were having to cut palm stalks he caught her look i know but what can i do theres no cured wood to be had on this short a notice lo what an army youll have she laughed wryly do you really think all those indentures will fight for their freedom yes he settled onto the bed thats what im counting on well youre counting wrong love most of them dont care a damn for anything except maybe drinkin in the shade believe me i know them ill give them something to fight for it wont be like here where theyre worked to death then turned out to starve i could tell you a few stories about human nature that might serve to enlighten you she stretched back and pulled up her shift to rub a mosquito bite on her thigh if it was me id be trying to get hold of some of these africans from the scars ive seen on a few of them id say theyve done their share of fighting on my faith they scare the wits half out of me they make me uneasy too how do you mean darlin all these drums weve been hearing i found out in brazil the yoruba there can talk somehow with a special kind of drum theyve got one that looks like a big hourglass i figure those here can do it too only nobody realizes it let me tell you joan there was plenty of yoruba talk this morning so far the africans here are considerably outnumbered but if they start a revolt the indentures might decide to rise up too then some indentures here tried a little uprising once a couple of years back and about a dozen got hanged for their pains i dont fancy theyll try it again soon dont be so sure remember how the irish indentures went over to the spaniards that time they attacked the english settlement up on nevis island they swam out to the spaniards frigates hailed them as fellow papists and then told them exactly where all the fortifications were but how many of these africans are there here now probably not all that many maybe not yet with the dutch slavers thatve come so far id guess therere no more than a couple of thousand or so but therere more slave ships coming every week who knows whatll happen when therere three or four thousand or more itll not happen soon how can it she slipped her arms around his neck and drew him down next to her lets talk about something else tell me how you plan to take jamaica gods life i still dont know why youd want to try doing it at all youre just afraid i cant do it he turned and kissed her then pulled down the top of her shift and nipped at one of her exposed breasts tell me the truth maybe i will someday if you get back alive she took his face in her hands and lifted it away by the bye i hear you had a fine time at the ball dancin with that jade who you know who you whoremaster the high and mighty miss bedford id had a bit to drink i dont precisely recall what all happened dont you now well some of the council recall that evening well enough you can be sure you werent too drunk to scare the wits out of them with those spanish pistols its the talk of the island she watched as he returned his mouth to her breast and began to tease the nipple with his tongue now listen to me that little virgins no good for you for one thing i hear shes supposed to be marryin our leading royalist sir anthony though i swear i dont know what he sees in her shes probably happier ridin her horse than being with a man i warrant shed probably as soon be a man herself i dont want to hear any more about miss bedford he slipped an arm beneath her and drew her up next to him ive got something else in mind she trailed her hand down his chest to his groin then she smiled my but thats promisin theres always apt to be room for improvement if you set your mind to it god knows ive spoiled you she leaned over and kissed his thigh then began to tease him with her tongue without a word he shifted around and brushed the stubble of his cheeks against her loins she was already moist from sweat and desire god thats why i always let you come back she moved against him with a tiny shudder when by rights i should know better sometimes i think i taught you too well what pleases me i know something else you like even better he seized a plump down pillow and stationed it in the middle of the bed then started to reach for her she was assessing her handiwork admiringly he was ready the way she wanted him could be she drew herself above him but you cant always be havin everything your own way youve got me feelin too randy this mornin so now im going to show you why your frustrated virgin miss bedford fancies ridin that horse of hers so much serina was already awake before the drums started listening intently to catch the soft cadence of the verses she repeated them silently knowing they meant the cowrie shells had been cast it was madness benjamin briggs sometimes called her to his room in the mornings but she knew there would be no call today he had ordered her from his bed just after midnight drunk and cursing about a delay at the sugar mill who had cast the cowries was it the tall strong one named atiba could it be he was also a yoruba babalawo she had heard the verses for the cowries once before years ago in brazil there were thousands which her mother had recited for her all in one week the entire canon even now she still remembered some of them just a few her mother had never admitted to anybody else she knew the verses since women werent supposed to cast the cowries the men of the yoruba always claimed the powers of the cowries were too great for any save a true babalawo and no woman would ever be permitted to be that women were only allowed to consult the gods by casting the four quarters of the kola nut which only foretold daily matters important affairs of state were reserved for the cowries and for men but her mother had secretly learned the verses shed never said how shed even promised to explain them one day but that day never came when she was sure the drums had finished she rose slowly from the sweltering pallet that served as her bed and searched the floor in the halfdark till she felt the smooth cotton of her shift she slipped it on then began brushing her long gleaming hair proud even now that it had always been straight like a portuguese donnas she slept alone in a small room next to the secondfloor landing of the back stairway the one by the kitchen that was used by servants when she had finished with her hair and swirled it into a high bun portuguese style she slowly pushed open the slatted jalousies to study the clutter of the compound as always she found herself comparing this haphazard english house to the mansion she had known in brazil on the large plantation outside pernambuco now it seemed a memory from another world that dazzling white room she had shared with her mother in the servants compound the day the senhor de engenho the master of the plantation announced that she would go to the blackrobed jesuits school instead of being put to work in the fields like most of the other slave children her mother had begun to cry for years she had thought they were tears of joy then the next day her mother had started work on their room she had whitewashed the walls smeared a fresh layer of hard clay on the floor then planted a small frangipani tree by the window during the night its tiny red blossoms would flood their room with a sweet almost cloying fragrance so they woke every morning to a day bathed in perfume years later her mother had confessed the beautiful room and the perfume of the tree were intended to always make her want to return there from the foul rooms of the branco and their priests she remembered those early years best her mother would rise before dawn then wake the old gnarled ashanti slave who was the cook for the household ordering the breakfast the senhor had specified the night before then she would walk quietly down to the slave quarters to waken the gang driver who would rouse the rest of the plantation with his bell next she would return to their room and brush her beautiful mulata daughters hair to keep it always straight and shining in preparation for the trip to the mission school the priests had built two miles down the road serina still recalled the barefoot walk down that long tree lined roadway and her mothers command repeated every morning to never let the sun touch her light skin later she would wander slowly back through the searing midday heat puzzling over the new language called spanish she was learning and the strange teachings of the christians the priests had taught her to read from the catechism and to write out the stories they told of the catholic saintsstories her mother demanded she repeat to her each night she would then declare them lies and threaten her with a dose of the purgative physicnut to expel their poisons her mother would sometimes stroke her soft skin and explain that the christians false god must have been copied from olorun the yoruba high god and deity of the cosmos it was well known he was the universal spirit who had created the world the only god who had never lived on earth perhaps the christians had somehow heard of him and hoped to steal him for their own he was so powerful that the other gods were all his childrenshango ogun all the yoruba deities of the earth and rivers and sky the yoruba priests had never been known to mention a white god called jesu but she had learned many things from jesus priests the most important was that she was a slave owned by the senhor de engenho she was his property as much as his oxen and his fields of cane that was the true lesson of the priests a lesson she had never forgotten these new saltwater yoruba were fools their life and soul belonged to the branco now and only the branco could give it back you could never take it back yourself there was nothing you could do to make your life your own again she recalled a proverb of the ashanti people a slave does not choose his master a slave chose nothing she found herself thinking again of her mother she was called dara the yoruba name meaning beautiful and she was beautiful beyond words with soft eyes and delicate skin and high cheekbones her mother dara had told her how she had been taken to the bed of her portuguese owner after only a week in brazil he was the senhor de engenho who had sired mulata bastards from the curing house to the kitchen they were all still slaves but her mother had thought her child would be different she thought the lightskinned girl she bore the branco would be made free and she had chosen a yoruba name for her the senhor de engenho had decided to name her serina one night while drunk a slave chose nothing daras mulata daughter also was not given her freedom instead that daughter was taken into the masters house taught to play the lute and dance the galliards of joao de sousa carvalho when she was ten given an orange petticoat and a blue silk mantle when she was twelve and taken to his bed the day she was fourteen her own father he had used her as his property for eight years then sold her to a stinking englishman she later learned it was for the princely sum of a hundred pounds a slave chose nothing still something in the defiance of atiba stirred her he was bold and handsome even though a preto she had watched his strong body with growing desire those two days they were together in the boiling house she had begun to find herself wanting to touch him to tame his wildness inside her for a moment he had made her regret she had vowed long ago never to give herself to a preto she was half white and if ever she had a child that child would be whiter still to be white was to be powerful and free she also would make certain her child was christian the christian god was probably false but in this world the christians held everything they owned the yoruba the yoruba gods of her mother counted for nothing not here not in the new world she smiled resignedly and thought once more of atiba he would have to learn that too for all his strength and his pride just as she had he could call on ogun to tell him the future but that god would be somewhere out of hearing if he tried to war against the branco she had seen it all before in brazil there was no escape a slave chose nothing could he be made to understand that or would that powerful body one day be hanged and quartered for leading a rebellion that could only fail unsure why she should bother yet unable to stop herself she turned from the window and quietly headed down the creaking makeshift rear stair then she slipped past the kitchen door and onto the stone steps leading out into the back of the compound it was still quiet with only the occasional cackle of irish laughter from the kitchen whose chimney now threaded a line of wood smoke into the morning air the gate opened silently and easilythe indenture left to guard it was snoring still clasping an empty flaskand she was out onto the pathway leading down the hill to the new thatched huts of the slaves the path was quiet and graydark green lizards scurried through the grass around her and frogs whistled among the palms but there was no sign the indentures were awake yet in the distance she could hear the low voice of atiba lecturing courage to his brave yoruba warriors the preto fools she knew a woman would not be welcome would be thought to defile their solemn council of war let them have their superstitions this was the new world africa was finished for them they werent yoruba warriors now here they were just more preto slaves for all their posturing once more she was glad she had been raised a portuguese not a yoruba woman bound to honor and revere whatever vain man she had been given to as wife as she neared the first hut she stopped to look and shake her head sadly what would the slaves in brazil think of these thatched hovels she knew they would laugh and ridicule the backwardness of these saltwater preto who knew nothing of european ways then she noticed a new drum a small one only just finished that had been left out for the sun to dry she had heard once what these special drums were for they were used in ceremonies when the men and women danced and somehow were entered and possessed by the gods but there were no yoruba women on briggs plantation he had not bothered to buy any yet since men could cut cane faster she wanted to smile when she realized the yoruba men here had to cook their own food a humiliation probably even greater than slavery but the smile died on her lips when she realized the drum was just a sad relic of a people torn apart she examined the drum recalling the ones she had seen in brazil its wood was reddish and the skins were tied taut with new white cords she smoothed her hand against her shift then picked it up and nestled it under her arm feeling the coolness of the wood she remembered the goat skin could be tuned by squeezing the cords along the side carefully she picked up the curved wooden mallet used to play it and gripping the drum tightly against her body tapped it once twice to test the fluctuation in pitch as she pressed the cords the sharp almost human sound brought another rush of memories of brazil nights when she had slipped away to the slave quarters and sat at the feet of a powerful old babalawo an ancient yoruba priest who had come to be scorned by most of the newly baptized slaves she was too young then to know that a mulata did not associate with black preto that a mulata occupied a class apart and above she had listened breathlessly night after starry night as he spun out ancient yoruba legends of the goddess oshunwho he said was the favorite wife of shango then he would show her how to repeat the story back to him using just the talking drum she looked toward the gathering in the far hut thinking again of the verses of the cowries holding the drum tightly she began to play the curved stick across the skin the words came easily a se were lo nko you are learning to be a fool o ko ko ogbon you do not learn wisdom she laughed to herself as she watched the startled faces of the yoruba men emerging from the thatched hut after a moment she saw atiba move out onto the pathway to stare in her direction she set the drum onto the grass and stared back he was approaching now and the grace of his powerful stride again stirred something a desire she had first felt those nights in the boiling house what would it be like she wondered again to receive a part of his power for her own though his face declared his outrage she met his gaze with defiancea mulata need never be intimidated by a preto she continued to watch calmly as he moved directly up the path to where she stood without a word he seized the drum held it skyward for a moment then dashed it against a tree stump several of the partly healed lash marks on his back opened from the violence of the swing he watched in satisfaction as the wood shattered leaving a clutter of splinters cords and skin then he revolved toward her a branco woman does not touch a yoruba drum branco she had never heard herself referred to before as white but she had always wanted to always yet now now he spat it out almost as though it meant unclean a branco woman may do as she pleases she glared back at him thats one of the first things you will have to learn on this island i have nothing to learn from you soon perhaps you may learn from me youve only begun to learn she felt herself turning on him bitterly she could teach him more than he ever dreamed but why youll soon find out that youre a preto perhaps you still dont know what that means the branco rule this island they always will and they own you you truly are a branco you may speak our tongue but there is nothing left of your yoruba blood it has long since drained away as yours will soon to water the cane on this island if you try to rise up against the branco i can refuse to submit the hardness in his eyes aroused her was it desperation or pride and youll die for it then i will die if the branco kills me today he cannot kill me again tomorrow and i will die free he fixed her with his dark gaze and the three yoruba clan marks on his cheek seemed etched in ebony then he turned back toward the hut and the waiting men someday soon perhaps i will show you what freedom means chapter five katherine held on to the mizzenmast shrouds shielding her eyes against the glitter of sun on the bay and looked at hugh winston he was wearing the identical shabby leather jerkin and canvas breeches she remembered from that first morning along with the same pair of pistols shoved into his belt he certainly made no effort to present a dignified appearance also the afternoon light made you notice even more the odd scar across one weathered cheek what would he be like as a lover probably nothing so genteel as anthony walrond good god she thought what would anthony and poor jeremy say if they learned i came down here to the defiance actually sought out this man they hate so much theyd probably threaten to break off marriage negotiations out of spite but if somethings not done she told herself none of thats going to matter anyway if the rumor from london is true then barbados is going to be turned upside down hugh winston can help us no matter what you choose to think of him she reflected on winstons insulting manner and puzzled why she had actually half looked forward to seeing him again he certainly had none of anthonys breeding yet there was something magnetic about a man so rough and careless still god knows finding him a little more interesting than most of the dreary planters on this island scarcely meant much was he she found herself wondering at all attracted to her possibly if he thought on it at all hed see their common ground she finally realized he despised the puritans and their slaves as much as she did and like her he was alone it was a bond between them whether he knew it now or not then all at once she felt the fear again that tightness under her bodice she had pushed away no more than half an hour past when her mare had reached the rim of the hill the last curve of the rutted dirt road leading down to the bay shed reined in coral still not sure she had the courage to go and see winston while her mare pawed and tugged at the traces she took a deep breath and watched as a gust of wind sent the bloodred blossoms from a grove of cordia trees fleeing across the road then shed noticed the rush of scented air off the sea the wide vista of carlisle bay spreading out below the sky full of tiny colored birds flitting through the azure afternoon yes shed told herself its worth fighting for worth jeopardizing everything for even worth going begging to hugh winston for its my home do you ever miss england living out here in the caribbees she tried to hold her voice nonchalant with a lilt intended to suggest that none of his answers mattered all that much though the afternoon heat was sweltering she had deliberately put on her most feminine riding dressa billowing skirt tucked up the side to reveal a ruffle of petticoat and a bodice with sleeves slashed to display the silk smock beneath shed even had the servants iron it specially anthony always noticed it and winston had too though he was trying to pretend otherwise i remember england less and less he sipped from his tankardhe had ordered a flask of sack brought up from the great cabin just after she came aboardand seemed to be studying the suns reflection in its amber contents the americas are my home now for better or worse england doesnt really exist for me anymore she looked at him and decided jeremy had been right the truth was hed probably be hanged if he returned he paused a moment then continued and you miss bedford have you been back not since we left when i was ten we went first to bermuda where father served for two years as governor and chief officer for the sommers island company then we came down here i dont really even think of england much anymore i feel im a part of the americas now too she shaded her face against the sun with one hand and noticed a bead of sweat trickling down her back along the laces of her bodice in truth im beginning to wonder if ill ever see england again id just as soon never see it again he rose and strolled across the deck toward the steering house then he settled his tankard on the binnacle and began to loosen the line securing the whipstaff a long lever used for controlling the rudder do you really want to stay aboard while i take her out youve done it every day this week just around sunset ive watched you from the hill and wondered why she casually adjusted her bodice to better emphasize the plump fullness of her breasts then suddenly felt a surge of dismay with herself that she would consider resorting to tawdry female tricks but desperate times brought out desperate measures besides youve got the only frigate in the bay now thats not dutch and i thought id like to see the island from offshore i sometimes forget how beautiful it is then youd best take a good long look miss bedford he replied matteroffactly its never going to be the same again not after sugar takes over katherine you can call me katherine she tried to mask the tensenessno the humiliationin her voice im sufficiently compromised just being down here theres scarcely any point in ceremony then katherine it is miss bedford again scarcely a glimmer of notice as he busied himself coiling the line but she saw john mewes raise his heavy eyebrows as he mounted the quarterdeck companionway his wide belly rolling with each labored step winston seemed to ignore the quartermaster as he continued since youve been watching then i suppose you know what to expect were going to tack her out of the harbor over to the edge of those reefs just off lookout point then well come about and take her up the west side of the island north all the way up to speightstown its apt to be at least an hour dont say you werent warned perfect she thought just the time ill need you seem to know these waters well it was rhetorical just to keep him talking hugh winston had sailed up the coast every evening for a week regardless of the wind or state of the sea he obviously understood the shoreline of barbados better than anyone on the island that was one of the reasons she was here you sail out every day part of my final preparations miss bedford katherine he turned to the quartermaster john aye mewes had been loitering by the steeringhouse trying to stay in the shade as he eyed the opened flask of sack winston had not offered him a tankard weigh anchor i want to closehaul that new main course one more time then try a starboard tack aye as you will he strode gruffly to the quarterdeck railing and bellowed orders forward to the bow the quiet was broken by a slow rattle as several shirtless seamen began to haul in the cable with the winch they chattered in a medley of languagesfrench portuguese english dutch she watched as the anchor broke through the waves and was hoisted onto the deck next mewes yelled orders aloft moments later the mainsail dropped and began to blossom in the breeze the defiance heeled slowly into the wind then began to edge past the line of dutch merchantmen anchored along the near shoreline winston studied the sail for a few moments what do you think john she looks to be holding her luff well enough i never liked it capn ive made that plain from the first so im thinkin the same as always youve taken a foreandaft rigged brigantine one of the handiest under christian sail and turned her into a squarerigger well not have the handling weve got with the running rigging mewes spat toward the railing and shoved past katherine still astonished that winston had allowed her to come aboard governors daughter or no its ill luck he told himself a fair looker that ill grant you but if its doxies wed be taking aboard now i can think of plenty whod be fitter company he glanced at the white mare tethered by the shore wishing she were back astride it and gone half the time you see her the wench is riding like a man not sidesaddle like a woman was meant to if were going to make jamaica harbor without raising the spaniards militia well have to keep short sail winston calmly dismissed his objections that means standing rigging only no topsls or royals aye and shell handle like a gaffsailed lugger just for the approach while we land the men well keep her rigged like always for the voyage over he maneuvered the whipstaff to start bringing the stern about sending a groan through the hull she seems to work well enough so far we need to know exactly how many points off the wind we can take her id guess about five maybe six but weve got to find out now he turned back to katherine and caught her eyes they held somethingwhat was it almost an invitation but thats not why shes here he told himself this womans got a purpose in mind all right except its not you whatever it is though the looks of herd almost make you wonder if shes quite so set on marrying some stiff royalist as she thinks she is dont be a fool the last thing you need to be thinking about now is a woman given the news theres apt to be big trouble ahead here and soon youve got to be gone so perhaps youd care to tell me katherine to what i owe the pleasure of this afternoons visit id venture youve probably seen the western coast of this island a few hundred times before entirely without my aid i was wondering if youd heard whats happened in london she held on to the shrouds the spiderweb of ropes that secured the mast and braced herself against the roll of the ship as the defiance eased broadside to the sun along the curving shoreline a string of dutch merchantmen were riding at anchor all threemasted fluyts their fore and main masts steeped far apart to allow room for a capacious hatch in the five weeks that had passed since the zeelander put in with the first cargo of africans four more slavers had arrived they were anchored across the bay now their round sterns glistening against the water as the afternoon light caught the gilding on their high narrow afterstructure riding in the midst of them was the rotterdam just put in from london the sight of that small dutch merchantman had brought back her fear it also renewed her resolve you mean about king charles i heard probably before you did he was watching her tanned face and secretly admiring her courage she seemed to be taking the situation calmly i was working down here yesterday when the rotterdam put in then id like your version what exactly did you hear probably what everybody else heard they brought word englands new rump parliament that mob of bloodthirsty puritans installed by cromwells army has locked king charles in the tower with full intentions to chop off his head they also delivered the story that parliament has declared barbados a nest of rebels since your assembly has never recognized the commonwealth virginia and bermuda also made that select list of outcasts he glanced toward the bow then tested the steering lever so miss katherine bedford id say the americas are about to see those stormy times we talked about once only its a gale out of england not here he turned and yelled forward john reef the foresail as we double the point then prepare to take her hard about to starboard she watched as he shoved the steering lever to port flipping the rudder to maneuver around the reefs at the edge of the bay then reached for his pewter tankard its sides dark with grease and she tried to stifle her renewed disgust with him his obvious unconcern as she watched him drink maybe it really was all a game to him maybe nothing could make him care a damn after all in the silence that followed the creaks of the weathered planking along the deck grew louder more plaintive given some of that may be true captain what do you think will happen now just call me hugh i presume i can enjoy my fair share of barbados democracy while it lasts he shrugged since you asked ill tell you i think it means the end of everything we know about the americas breathe the air of independence while you still can maybe you didnt hear the other story going around the harbor here the dutchmen are claiming that after parliament gets around to beheading the king it plans to take over all the patents granted by the crown its supposedly considering a new law called a navigation act which is going to decree that only english bottoms can trade with the american settlements no hollanders that means the end of free trade theres even talk in london that a fleet of warships may head this way to enforce it ive heard that too it sounds like nothing more than a thames rumor did you know that right now all the dutchmen here are lading as fast as they can hoping they can put to sea before theyre blockaded or sunk by a score of armed english menofwar nobody in the assembly thinks cromwell would go that far well the dutchmen do whatever else you might say a hollanders about the last man id call a fool i can tell you carlisle bay is a convocation of nervous netherlanders right now he squinted against the sun and ill pass along something else katherine theyre not the only ones id just as soon be at sea myself with my men she examined him her eyes ironic so i take it while youre not afraid to stand up to the council men with pistols practically at your head youre still worried about some navy halfway around the world the difference is that the council owed me money he smiled wanly with england its more like the other way around thats not the real reason is it all right hows this for all we know their navy may not be halfway around the world anymore he glanced at the sun then checked the sail again its no state secret im not mother englands favorite son the less i see of the english navy the happier ill be whatll you do if a fleet arrives while youre still here ill worry about it then he turned back a better question might be what does barbados plan to do if a fleet arrives to blockade you and force you into line his voice grew sober id say this island faces a difficult choice if parliament goes ahead and does away with the king the way some of its hotheads reportedly want to then therell no longer be any legal protection for you at all word of this new sugar project has already gotten back to london you can be sure id suspect the puritans whove taken over parliament want the american colonies because theyd like a piece of barbados sudden new fortune for themselves new taxes for commons and new trade for english shippers now that youre about to be rich here your years of being ignored are over he lifted the tankard and took another drink of sack so what are you going to do submit or declare war on parliament and fight the english navy if everybody here pulls together we can resist them with what he turned and pointed toward the small stone fortress atop lookout point the hill stood rocky and remote above the blue caribbean not with that breastwork you wont i doubt a single gun up theres ever been set and fired whats more id be surprised if therere more than a dozen trained gunners on the whole of the island since the royalist refugees here were mostly officers back home the way things stand now you dont have a chance then well have to learn to fight wont we she tried to catch his eye i suppose you know something about gunnery gunners are most effective when theyve got some ordnance to use he glanced back then thumbed toward the point whats in place up there i think therere about a dozen cannon and therere maybe that many more at the jamestown breastwork so the leeward coast is protected theres also a breastwork at oistins bay on the south she paused studying his profile against the sun an image rose up unbidden of him commanding a battery of guns her at his side it was preposterous yet exhilarating those are the places an invasion would come arent they theyre the only sections of shoreline where the surfs light enough for a troop ship to put in then weve got a line of defense dont you think its enough no he spoke quietly you dont have the heavy ordnance to stop a landing all you can hope to do without more guns is just try and slow it down a bit but assuming thats true where would we get more cannon especially now this was the moment shed been dreading of course their ordnance was inadequate she already knew everything hed been saying there was only one place to get more guns they both realized where well youve got a problem katherine he smiled lightly just to let her know he was on to her scheme then looked away toward the shoreline on their right now the island was a mantle of deep seemingly eternal green reaching down almost to the waters edge and beyond that up the rise of the first hill were dullcolored scatterings of plantation houses the defiance was making way smoothly now northward holding just a few hundred yards off the white sandy shore you know im always struck by what a puny little place barbados is he pointed toward a small cluster of clapboard houses half hidden among the palms along the shore if you put to sea like we are now you can practically see the whole island north to south she glanced at the palmlined coast then back what are you trying to say that gathering of shacks were passing over there is the grand city of jamestown he seemed to ignore the question as he thumbed to starboard which i seem to recall is the location of that famous tree everybody here likes to brag about so much jamestown was where stood the massive oak into whose bark had been carved the inscription james king of e and the date that was the year an english captain named john powell accidentally put in at an empty forested caribbean island and decided to claim it for his king that tree proclaims this island belongs to the king of england well no more the kings finished so tell me who does it belong to now ill tell you who it doesnt belong to cromwell and the english parliament she watched the passing shoreline and tried to imagine what it would be like if her dream came true if barbados could make the stand that would change the americas permanently when shed awakened this morning birds singing and the island sun streaming through the jalousies shed suddenly been struck with a grand thought a revolutionary idea she had ignored the servants pleas that she wait for breakfast and ordered coral saddled immediately then shed headed inland through the mossfloored forests whose towering ironwood and oak trees still defied the settlers axes amidst the vines and orchids shed convinced herself the idea was right what if all the english in the new world united declared their independence during her lifetime there had been a vast migration to the americas two out of every hundred in england she had never seen the settlement in new england the one at plymouth on the massachusetts bay but she knew it was an outpost of puritans who claimed the anglican church smacked too much of popery the new englanders had always hated king charles for his supposed catholic sympathies so there was no chance theyd do anything except applaud the fanatics in england who had toppled the monarchy but the settlements around the chesapeake were different virginia was founded because of profit not prayer books its planters had formed their own assembly in the first in the americas and they were a spirited breed who would not give in easily to domination by englands new dictatorship there was also a settlement on bermuda several thousand planters who had their own assembly too and word had just come they had voted to banish all puritans from the island in retaliation against cromwell hugh winston who thought he knew everything didnt know that bermuda had already sent a secret envoy to dalby bedford proposing barbados join with them and form an alliance with virginia and the other islands of the caribbees to resist the english parliament bermuda wanted the american colonies to stand firm for the restoration of the monarchy the barbados assembly appeared to be leaning in that direction too though they still hoped they could somehow avoid a confrontation but that was wrong shed realized this morning so very wrong dont they see what we really should do this is our chance we should simply declare the richest settlements in the americasvirginia barbados st christopher nevis bermudaindependent of england a new nation it was an idea shed not yet dared suggest to dalby bedford who would likely consider it close to sedition and she certainly couldnt tell a royalist like anthony hed only fight for the monarchy but why she asked herself do we need some faraway king here in the americas we could we should be our own masters first however weve got to show cromwell and his illegal parliament that they cant intimidate the american settlements if barbados can stand up to them then maybe the idea of independence will have a chance i came today to ask if youd help us stand and fight if we have to she listened to her own voice and knew it was strong and firm he stood silent for a moment staring at her then he spoke almost a whisper above the wind who exactly is it wants me to help fight england the assembly no i do thats what i thought he shook his head in disbelief or was it dismay and turned to check the whipstaff when he glanced back his eyes were skeptical ill wager nobody knows you came down here am i correct i didnt exactly make an announcement about it and that lowcut bodice and pretty smile is that just part of your negotiations i thought it mightnt hurt she looked him squarely in the eye god almighty what youd do for this place i pity cromwell and his roundheads he sobered i dont mind telling you im glad at least one person here realizes this island cant defend itself as things stand now youd damned sure better start trying to do something he examined her puzzled but why come to me she knew the answer hugh winston was the only person she knew who hated england enough to declare independence he already had you seem to know a lot about guns and gunnery she moved closer and noticed absently that he smelled strongly of seawater leather and sweat did i hear you say you had an idea where we could get more cannon to help strengthen our breastworks so were back to business i might have expected he rubbed petulantly at his scar no i didnt say though we both know where you might from those dutchmen in the harbor every merchantman in carlisle bay has guns you could offer to buy them or just take them but whatever you do dont dally too long one sighting of english sail and theyll put to sea like those flying fish around the island how about the cannon on the defiance how many do you have i have a few he laughed then reflected with pride on his firstclass gun deck twentytwo demiculverin nine pounders and all brass so they wouldnt overheat hed trained his gunners personally every man and hed shot his way out of more than one harbor over the past five years his ordnance could be run out in a matter of minutes primed and ready naturally youre welcome to them all youll have to do is kill me first i hope it doesnt come to that so do i he studied the position of the waning sun for a moment then yelled forward for the men to hoist the staysail next he gestured toward mewes john take the whipstaff a while and tell me what you think of the feel of her id guess the best we can do is six points off the wind the way i said aye mewes hadnt understood what all the talk had been about but he hoped the captain was getting the best of the doxy i can tell you right now this new rigging of yours makes a handy little frigate work like a damnd fivehundred ton galleon just try taking her about he glanced at the shoreline they were coming in sight of speightstown the settlement at the north tip of the island lets see if we can tack around back south and make it into the bay but would you at least help us if we were blockaded she realized she was praying he would say yes katherine whats this island ever done for me besides right now ive got all i can manage just trying to get the hell out of here i cant afford to get caught up in your little quarrel with the commonwealth he looked at her every time ive done an errand for barbados its always come back to plague me so you dont care what happens here she felt her disappointment surge it had all been for nothing and damned to him i suppose i had a somewhat higher opinion of you captain winston i see i was wrong ive got my own plan for the caribbean and that means a lot more to me than who rules barbados and its slaves then im sorry i bothered asking at all ive got a suggestion for you though winstons voice suddenly flooded with anger why dont you ask your gentleman fiance anthony walrond to help from what i hear he was the royalist hero of the civil war he doesnt have a gun deck full of cannon she wanted to spit in winstons smug face but hes got you katherine doesnt he he felt an unwanted pang at the realization he was beginning to like this woman more than he wanted to she had brass though as long as youre here anyway why dont we at least toast the sunset and the free americas thatre about to vanish into history he abruptly kissed heron the cheek watched as she flushed in anger then turned and yelled to a seaman just entering the companionway aft fetch up another flask of sack benjamin briggs stood in the open doorway of the curing house listening to the sweee call of the longtailed flycatchers as they flitted through the groves of macaw palms the long silence of dusk was settling over the sugarworks as the indentures and the slaves trudged wearily toward their thatched huts for the evening dish of loblolly mush down the hill toward the shore vagrant bats had begun to dart through the shadows in the west the setting sun had become a fiery disk at the edge of the seas far horizon he watched with interest as a single sail cut across the suns lower rim it was hugh winstons defiance rigged in a curious new mode he studied it a moment puzzling then turned back to examine the darkening interior of the curing house long racks holding wooden cones of curing sugar extended the length of one wall he thought about the cones for a time watching the slow drip of molasses into the tray beneath and wondering if it mightnt pay to start making them from clay which would be cheaper and easier to shape though the africans seemed to understand working clay theyd been using it for their hutshe knew that only whites could be allowed to make the cones the skilled trades on barbados must always be forbidden to blacks whose tasks had to be forever kept repetitive mindnumbing the africans could never be allowed to perfect a craft it could well lead to economic leverage and potentially resistance to slavery and the end of cheap labor he glanced back toward the darkening horizon but now winstons frigate had passed from view behind the trees winston was no better than a thieving rogue bred for gallowsbait but you had to admire him a trifle nonetheless he was one of the few men around who truly understood the need for risk here in the americas the man who never chanced what he had gained in order to realize more would never prosper in the americas a natural aristocracy was rising up one not of birth but of boldness boldness would be called for tonight but he was ready he had done what had to be done all his life the first time was when he was thirtyone a tobacco importer in bristol with an auburnhaired wife named mary and two blueeyed daughters a man pleased with himself and with life then one chancefilled afternoon he had discovered in a quick succession of surprise and confession that mary had a lover the matter of another man would not have vexed him unduly but the fact that her gallant was his own business partner did the next day he sold his share of the firm settled with his creditors and hired a coach for london he had never seen bristol again or mary and his daughters in london there was talk that a syndicate of investors led by sir william courteen was recruiting a band of pioneers to try and establish a new settlement on an empty island in the caribbees for which they had just received a proprietary patent from the king though benjamin briggs had never heard of barbados he joined the expedition he had no family connections no position and only a few hundred pounds but he had the boldness to go where no englishman had ever ventured eighty of them arrived in the spring of on the william and john with scarcely any tools only to discover that the entire island was a rain forest thick and overgrown nor had anyone expected the harsh sunshine day in and day out they all would have starved from inexperience had not the dutch helped them procure a band of arawak indians from surinam who brought along seeds to grow plantains and corn and cassava root for bread the indians also taught the cultivation of cotton and tobacco cash crops perhaps just as importantly they showed the new adventurers from london how to make a suspended bed they called a hammock in order to sleep up above the islands biting ants and how to use smoky fires to drive off the swarms of mosquitoes that appeared each night yet help notwithstanding many of those first english settlers died from exposure and disease by the end of the year benjamin briggs was one of the survivors later he had vowed never to forget those years and never to taste defeat the sun was almost gone now throwing its last long shadows through the open thatchwork of the curinghouse walls laying a pattern against the hard earthen floor he looked down at his calloused hands the speckle of light and shade against the weathered skin and thought of all the labors he had set them to the first three years those hands had wielded an axe clearing land and then they had shaped themselves to the handle of a hoe as he and his five new indentures set about planting indigo and those hands had stayed penniless when his indigo crops were washed away two years running by the autumn storms the carib indians called huracan next he had set them to cotton in five years he had recouped the losses from the indigo and acquired more land but he was still at the edge of starvation in a cabin of split logs almost a decade after coming out to the caribbees he looked again at his hands thinking how they had borrowed heavily from lenders in london the money just enough to finance a switch from cotton to tobacco it fared a trifle better but still scarcely recovered its costs though he had managed to accumulate more and more acres of island land over the years from neighbors less prudent he now had only a moderate fortune to show for all his labor hed actually considered giving up on the americas and returning to london to resume the import trade but always he remembered his vow so instead he borrowed again this time from the dutchmen and risked it all one last time on sugar he scraped a layer from the top of one of the molds and rubbed the tan granules between his fingers telling himself that now at last his hands had something to show for the two long decades of callouses blisters emptiness he tasted the rich sweetness on a horned thumb and its savor was that of the americas the new world where every man started as an equal now a new spirit had swept england the king was dethroned the hereditary house of lords abolished the people had risen up and though youd never have expected it new risk had risen up with them the american settlements were suddenly flooded with the men england had repudiated banished aristocrats like the walronds whod bought their way into barbados and who would doubtless like nothing better than to reforge the chains of class privilege in the new world most ironic of all these men had at their disposal the new democratic institutions of the americas they would clamor in the assembly of barbados for the island to reject the governance of the english parliament hoping thereby to hasten its downfall and lead to the restoration of the monarchy worse the assembly that reed in the winds of rhetoric would doubtless acquiesce regardless of what you thought of cromwell to resist parliament now would be to swim against the tide and to invite war the needful business of consolidating the small tracts on barbados and setting the island wholesale to sugar would be disrupted and forestalled perhaps forever why had it come down to this he asked himself again now of all times when the fruits of long labor seemed almost in hand when you could finally taste the comforts of lifea proper house rich food a woman to ease the nights he had never considered taking another wife once had been enough but he had always arranged to have a comely irish girl about the house to save the trouble and expense of visiting bridgetown for an evening a prudent man bought an indentured wench with the same careful eye hed acquire a breeding mare a lustylooking one might cost a few shillings more but it was money well invested your one compensation for all the misery the first was years ago when he bought a redheaded one straight off a ship from london not guessing till he got her home that hed been swindled she had a sure case of the pox the french disease her previous career it then came out included bridewell prison and the taverns of turnbull street he sent her straight to the fields and three months later carefully bought another this one irish and seventeen she had served out her time five years and then gone to work at a tavern in bridgetown he had never seen her since and didnt care to but after that he always kept one about sending her on to the fields and buying a replacement when he wearied of her that was before the voyage down to pernambuco brazil had been an education in more ways than one you had to grant the papists knew a thing or so about the good life they had bred up a sensuous latin creation the mulata he tried one at a tavern and immediately decided the time had come to acquire the best he had worked hard he told himself he had earned it there was no such thing as a mulata indenture in pernambuco so hed paid the extra cost for a slave and he was still cursing himself for his poor judgment haughtiness in a servant was nothing new in the past hed learned you could easily thrash it out of them even the irish ones this mulata though somehow had the idea she was gifted by god to a special station complete with highborn latin airs the plan to be finally rid of her was already in motion she had come from pernambuco with the first cane and she would be sold in bridgetown with the first sugar he already had a prospective buyer with an opening offer of eighty pounds hed even hinted to hugh winston that she could be taken as part payment for the sight drafts but winston had refused the bait it was men and provisions he insisted nothing else winston may god damn his eyes footsteps sounded along the gravel pathway and he turned to examine the line of planters approaching through the dusk all wearing dark hats and colorless doublets as he watched them puffing up the rise of the hill he found himself calculating how much of the arable land on the island was now controlled by himself and these eleven other members of the council tom lancaster owned twelve hundred acres of the rolling acres in st georges parish nicholas whittington had over a thousand of the best land in christs church parish edward bayes who had ridden down from his new plantation house on the northern tip of the island owned over nine hundred acres john lynes had amassed a third of the arable coastal land on the eastern windward side of the island the holdings of the others were smaller but together they easily owned the major share of the good cane land on barbados what they needed now was the rest your servant sir the planters nodded in chorus as they filed into the darkened curing house every man had ridden alone and briggs had ordered his own servants to keep clear of the curing house for the evening god in heaven this much already bayes emitted a low whistle and rubbed his jowls as he surveyed the long rows of sugar molds youve got a fortune in this very room sir if this all turns out to be sugar and not just pots of molasses like before itll be white sugar or ill answer for it and itll be fine as any portugal could make briggs walked to the corner of the room returning with two flasks of killdevil and a tray of tankards the question now gentlemen is whether well ever see it sold i dont follow you sir whittington reached for a brown flask and began pouring himself a tankard as soon as weve all got a batch cured well market it to the dutchmen or well ship it to london ourselves i suppose youve heard the rumor working now amongst the dutchmen that there might be an embargo aye but its no more than a rumor therell be no embargo i promise you itd be too costly its not just a rumor there was a letter from my london broker in the mail packet that came yesterday on the rotterdam he saw fit to include this briggs produced a thin roll of paper its a copy he had made of the act prepared in the council of state ready to be sent straight to commons for a vote he passed the paper to whittington who unscrolled it and squinted through the halflight briggs paused a moment then continued the act would embargo all shipping into and out of barbados till our assembly has moved to recognize the commonwealth cromwell was so sure itd be passed he was already pulling together a fleet of warships to send out and enforce it word hast the fleet will be headed by the rainbowe which was the kings flagship before cromwell took it fifty guns a disbelieving silence enveloped the darkened room and you say this act was set to pass in parliament whittington looked up and recovered his voice itd already been reported from the council of state and the letter was four weeks old moren likely its already law the rainbowe could well be sailing at the head of a fleet right now as we talk if cromwell does that were as good as on our knees tynes rubbed his neck and took a sip from his tankard what do you propose we can do as i see it therere but two choices briggs motioned for the men to sit on a row of empty kegs he had provided the first is to lie back and do nothing in which case the royalists will probably see to it that the assembly here votes to defy commons and declare for charles ii which means well be at war with england god help us lancaster removed his hat to wipe his dusty brow aye a war incidentally which would force cromwell to send the army to subdue the island if he hasnt already hed probably post troops to try and invade us like some people are saying which means the assembly would doubtless call up every ablebodied man on the island to fight all the militia and the indentures letting the cane rot in the fields if its not burned to cinders by then good jesus whittingtons face seemed increasingly haggard in the waning light that could well set us back years aye and who knows what would happen with the indentures and the slaves wholl be able to watch over them if we have to put the island on a war footing it could endanger the lives of every free man here god knows were outnumbered by all the irish papists and the africans aye the more indentures and slaves youve got the more precarious your situation lancasters glazed eyes passed down the row of sugar molds as he thought about the feeble security of his own clapboard house he also remembered ruefully that he owned only three usable muskets well gentlemen our other choice is to face up to the situation and come to terms with parliament its a bitter draught ill grant you but itll save us from anarchy and maybe an uprising the assemblyll never declare for the commonwealth the royalist sympathizers hold a majority whittingtons face darkened which means theres nothing to be done save ready for war theres still a hope we can do something about the assembly briggs turned to tynes a small tanned planter with hard eyes how many men do you have in your regiment therere thirty officers and maybe two hundred men how long to raise them raise them sir he looked at briggs uncomprehending to what purpose theyre militia to defend us against attack by the spaniards its not the spaniards weve to worry about now i think we can agree theres a clear and present danger nearer to hand briggs looked around him i say the standing assembly of barbados no longer represents the best interests of this island for any number of reasons is there a limit on their term lancaster looked at him questioningly i dont remember the law were not adjudicating law now gentlemen were discussing the future of the island were facing war but beyond that its time we talked about running barbados the way it should be along economic principles therell be prosperity you can count on it but only if weve got a free hand to make some changes he took a drink then set down his tankard what do you mean lancaster looked at him well sir the main problem now is that weve got an assembly here thats sympathetic to the small freeholders not surprisingly since thanks to dalby bedford every man here with five acres can vote our good governor saw to that when he drew up the voting parishes five acres theyre not the kind who should be in charge of governing this settlement now i know it and so does every man in this room all the same they were elected that was before sugar think about it these small freeholders on the assembly dont understand this island wasnt settled just so wed have a batch of fiveacre gardens gods blood i cleared a thousand acres myself i figured that someday id know why i was doing it well now i do what are you driving at bayes squinted past the rows of sugar cones well examine the situation this island could be the finest sugar plantation in the world the dutchmen already claim its better than brazil but the land heres got to be assembled and put to efficient use if we can consolidate the holdings of these small freeholders we can make this island the richest spot on earth the assembly doesnt understand that theyd go to war rather than try and make some prosperity here what are you proposing we do about it lancaster interjected warily what if we took action in the interests of the island briggs lowered his voice we cant let the assembly vote against the commonwealth and call down the navy on our heads theyve got to be stopped but how do we manage it tynes voice was uneasy we take preventive action he looked around the room gentlemen i say itd be to the benefit of all the free englishmen on barbados if we took the governor under our protection for the time being which would serve to close down the assembly while we try and talk sense with parliament wed be taking the law into our own hands tynes shifted uncomfortably its a question of whose law you mean according to the thinking of the english parliament this assembly has no legal standing anyway since theyve yet to recognize the rule of commons wed just be implementing whats already been decided i grant you this island would be wise not to antagonize cromwell and parliament just now whittington searched the faces around him and if the assembly wont take a prudent course then what were talking about here amounts to overturning the sitting governor and closing down the assembly lancasters voice came through the gloom weve not the actual authority even if parliament has weve got something more sir briggs met his troubled gaze an obligation to protect the future of the island what we need now he told himself is responsible leadership if the council can deliver up the island the quid pro quo from cromwell will have to be acting authority to govern barbados parliament has no brief for the assembly here which fits nicely with the need to be done with it anyway the irony of it only if barbados surrenders do we have a chance to realize some prosperity if we stand and fight were sure to lose eventually and then none of us will have any say in what comes after and in the long run itll be best for every man here rich and poor when theres wealthas theres sure to be if we can start evicting these freeholders and convert the island over to efficient sugar plantationseverybody benefits the wealth will trickle down like the molasses out of these sugar cones even to the undeserving its the way things have to be in the americas if were ever to make a go of it but one step at a time first we square the matter of bedford and the assembly but have we got the men lancaster settled his tankard on a keg and looked up hesitantly with the militia we already have under our command id say weve got sympathetic officers since theyre all men with sizable sugar acreage on the other hand itd probably not be wise to try calling up any of the small freeholders and freemen so to get the numbers well be wanting id say well just have to use our indentures as the need arises youve named a difficulty there whittington took a deep breath remember the transfer over to winston takes place day after tomorrow thats going to leave every man here short after that ill have no more than half a dozen christians on my plantation all the rest are africans aye hell have the pick of my indentures as well lancaster added his voice troubled hell just have to wait briggs emptied his tankard and reached for the flask well postpone the transfer till this things settled and let winston try to do about it what he will chapter six a light breeze stirred the bedrooms jalousie shutters sending strands of the midnight moon dancing across the curves of her naked almond skin as always when she slept she was back in pernambuco in the whitewashed room of long ago perfumed with frangipani with moonlight and soft shadows that pirouetted against the clay walls slowly silently the moon at the window darkens as a shadow blossoms through the airless space and in her dream the form becomes the ancient babalawo of pernambuco hovering above her then something passes across her face a reverent caress and there is softness and scent in its touch like a linen kerchief that hints of wild berries the taste of its honeyed sweetness enters the dream and she finds herself drifting deeper into sleep as his arms encircle her drawing her up against him with soft yoruba words her body seems to float the dream deepening its world of light and shadow absorbing her beckoning the softness of the bed gliding away now she feels the touch of her soft cotton shift against her breasts and senses the hands that lower it about her soon she is buoyed upward toward the waiting moon past the jalousies at the window noiselessly across the rooftop she awoke as the man carrying her in his arms dropped abruptly to the yard of the compound she looked to see the face and for an instant she thought it truly was the old priest in brazil the same three clan marks the same burning eyes then she realized the face was younger that of another man one she knew from more recent dreams she struggled to escape but the drugged cloth came again its pungent cloying sweetness sending her thoughts drifting back toward the void of the dream now the wall of the compound floats past vaulted by the figure who holds her draped in his arms his yoruba words are telling her she has the beauty of oshun beloved wife of shango that tonight they will live among the orisa the powerful gods that dwell in the forest and the sky for a moment the cool night air purges away the sweetness of the drug the potion this babalawo had used to numb her senses and she is aware of the hard flex of his muscle against her body without thinking she clings to him her fear and confusion mingled with the ancient comfort of his warmth till her mind merges once more with the dark atiba pointed down toward the wide sea that lay before them a sparkling expanse spreading out from the shoreline at the bottom of the hill faintly tinged with moonlight i brought you here tonight to make you understand something in ife we say the darkness of night is deeper than the shadow of the forest do you understand the chains on your heart can be stronger than the chains on your body he turned back to look at serina his gaze lingering over the sparkling highlights the moon now sprinkled in her hair he found himself suddenly remembering a yoruba woman he had loved once not one of his wives but a tall woman who served the royal compound at ife he had met with her secretly after his wives were killed in the wars and he still thought of her often something in the elegant face of this mulata brought back those memories even more strongly she too had been strongwilled like this one was this woman also sacred to shango as that one had been you only become a slave when you give up your people his voice grew gentle almost a whisper what is your yoruba name im not yoruba she spoke quickly and curtly forcing the words past her anger as she huddled for warmth legs drawn up arms encircling her knees then she reached to pull her shift tighter about her and tried to clear her thoughts the path on which hed carried her through forests and fields was a blurred memory only slowly had she realized they were on a hillside now overlooking the sea he was beside her wearing only a blue shirt and loincloth his profile outlined in the moonlight dont say that the first thing you must know is who you are unless you understand that you will always be a slave i know who i am im mulata portugues im not african she glanced down at the grass beside her bare feet and suddenly wished her skin were whiter im the color of dead leaves she thought shamefully of the barren earth then she gripped the hem of her shift and summoned back her pride im not a preto why would i have an african name she felt her anger rising up once more purging her feelings of helplessness to be stolen from her bed by this ignorant preto brought to some desolate spot with nothing but the distant sound of the sea that he would dare to steal her away a highborn mulata she did not consort with blacks she was almost white the wind laced suddenly through her hair splaying it across her cheeks and she realized the night air was perfumed now almost as the cloth had been a wild fragrance that seemed to dispel a portion of her anger her humiliation for a moment she found herself thinking of the forbidden things possible in the night those hidden hours when the rules of day can be sacrificed to need and she became aware of the warmth of his body next to hers as he crouched waiting motionless as the trees at the bottom of the hill if she were his captive then nothing he did to her would be of her own willing how could she prevent him yet he made no move to take her why was he waiting but to have a yoruba name means to possess something the branco can never own he caressed her again with his glance even though she was pale he had wanted her from the first moment he saw her and he had recognized the same want in her eyes only held in check by her pride why was she so proud he wondered if anything she should feel shame that her skin was so wan and pale in ife the women in the compounds would laugh at her saying the moons would come and go and she would only wet her feet barren no man would take some frail albino to share his mat even morefor all her fine ingles clothes and her soft bed she was ten times more slave than he would ever be how to make her understand that you only become a slave when you give up the ways of your people even if your father was a branco you were born of a yoruba woman you still can be yoruba and then you will be something have something the powerful hands that had carried her to this remote hilltop were now toying idly with the grass you are not the property of a branco unless you consent to be to be a slave you must first submit give him your spirit if you refuse if you remember your own people he can never truly enslave you he will have only your body the work of your hands the day you understand that you are human again you are wrong she straightened here in the americas you are whatever the branco says you will never be a man unless he says you are she noticed a tiny race in her heartbeat and told herself again she did not want to feel desire for this preto now or ever do you want to know why because your skin is black and to the ingles black is the color of evil they have books of learning that say the christian god made africans black because they are born of evil they are less than human they say your blackness outside comes from your darkness within she looked away shamed once more by the shade of her own skin her unmistakable kinship with this preto next to her then she continued bitterly repeating the things shed heard that the puritan divines were now saying in the islands parish churches the ingles claim africans are not men but savages something between man and beast and because of that their priests declare it is the will of their god that you be slaves she had intended to goad him more to pour out the abusive scorn she had so often endured herself but the softness of the yoruba words against her tongue sounded more musical than she had wanted he was quietly smiling as she continued and now i order you to take me back before master briggs discovers im gone the sun is many hours away so for a while yet you wont have to see how black i am he laughed and a pale glimmer of moonlight played across the three clan marks on his cheek i thought you had more understanding than is expected of a woman perhaps i was wrong we say the thread follows the needle it does not make its own way for you the portugues and now this branco briggs have been the needle you merely the thread he grasped her shoulder and pulled her around why do you let some branco tell you who you are i say they are the savages they are not my color they are sickly pale they dont worship my gods they pray to some cruel god who has no power over the earth their language is ugly and harsh mine is melodic rich with verses and ancient wisdom he smiled again at the irony of it but tonight you have told me something very important about the mind of these ingles you have explained why they want so much to make me submit if they think we are evil then they must also think us powerful suddenly he leaped to his feet and joyously whirled in a circle entoning a deep eerie chant toward the stars it was like a song of triumph she sat watching till he finished then listened to the medley of frightened night birds from the dark down the hill how could this preto understand so well her own secret shame see so clearly the lies she told herself in order to live abruptly he reached down and slipped his hands under her arms lifting her up to him the first thing i want to do tonight is give you back a yoruba name a name that has meaning he paused what was your mother called her name was dara our word for beautiful he studied her angular face gravely it would suit you as well for truly you are beautiful too if you took that name it would always remind you that your mother was a woman of our people she found herself wishing she had the strength to push his warm body away to shout out to him one final time that he was a preto that his father was a preto and her own a branco that she had no desire to so much as touch him but suddenly she was ashamed to say the word white and that shame brought a wave of anger at him at herself all her life she had been proud to be mulata what right did this illiterate preto have to make her feel ashamed now and what are you you are a preto slave who brings me to a hilltop in the dark of night and brags about freedom tomorrow you will be a slave again just like yesterday what am i angrily he gripped her arms and pulled her face next to his the fierceness of his eyes again recalled the old babalawo in brazil he had had the same pride in himself his people i am more than the ingles here are ask of them and you will discover half once were criminals or men with no lands of their own no lineage in my veins there is royal blood a line hundreds of generations old my own father was nearest the throne of the ruling oba in ife he was a babalawo as i am but he was also a warrior before he was betrayed in battle he was the second most powerful man in ife thats who i am my fathers son what happened was he killed impulsively she took his hand and was surprised by its warmth he disappeared one day many markets later i learned he was betrayed by some of our own people because he was too powerful in ife he was captured and taken down to the sea sold to the portugues i was young then i had only known twelve rainy seasons but i was not too young to hunt down the traitors who made him slave they all died by my sword he clenched his fist then slowly it relaxed but enough tonight i want just one thing to teach you that you still can be free that you can be yoruba again why do you want so much to change me because darahis eyes were locked on hersi would have you be my wife here i will not buy you with a bride price instead i will kill the man who owns you she felt a surge of confusion entwined with want but again her disdain of everything preto caught in her breast why she wondered was she even bothering to listen after you make me yoruba i will still be a slave to the ingles only for a few more days his face hardened a tenseness that spread upward through his high cheeks and into his eyes wait another moon and you will see my warriors seize this island away from them ill not be one of your yoruba wives she drew back and clasped her arms close to her breasts listening to the night alive now with the sounds of whistling frogs and crickets rather than be wife to a yoruba you would be whore to an ingles he spat out the words which means to be nothing but if you take this island you can have as many wives as you like just as you surely have now in ife she drew away still not trusting the pounding in her chest what does one more mean to you both my wives in ife are dead his hand reached and stroked her hair they were killed by the fulani years ago i never chose more though many families offered me their young women now you want war again and death here i raised my sword against my enemies in yorubaland i will fight against them here no yoruba will ever bow to others black or white he gently touched her cheek and smoothed her pale skin with his warm fingers you can stand with us when we rise up against the ingles his touch tingled unexpectedly like a bridge to some faraway time she dreamed about and still belonged to for an instant she almost gave in to the impulse to circle her arms around him pull him next to her he stroked her cheek again lovingly before continuing perhaps if i kill all the ingles chiefs then you will believe you are free that your name is dara and not what some portugues once decided to call you he looked at her again and his eyes had softened now will you help me she watched as the moonlight glistened against the ebony of his skin this preto slave was opening his life to her something no other man had ever done the branco despised his blackness even more than they did hers but he bore their contempt with pride with strength more strength than she had ever before sensed in a man and he needed her someone finally needed her she saw it in his eyes a need he was still too proud to fully admit a hunger for her to be with him to share the days ahead when yes when she would stand with him to destroy the branco together softly she reached up and circled her arms around his broad neck suddenly his blackness was exquisite and beautiful tonight i will be wife to you will you hold me now the wind whipped her long black hair across his shoulder and before she could think she found herself raising her lips to his he tasted of the forest of a lost world across the sea she had never known his scent was sharp and male she felt his thumb brush across her cheek and sensed the wetness of her own tears what had brought this strange welling to her eyes here on this desolate hillside was it part of love was that what she felt now this equal giving and accepting of each other she shoved back his open shirt to pass her hands across the hard muscles of his chest scars were there deep the signs of the warrior he once had been then she slipped the rough cotton over his back feeling the open cuts of the lashes the marks of the slave he was now suddenly she realized he wore them as proudly as sword cuts from battle they were the emblem of his manhood his defiance of the ingles just as his cheek marks were the insignia of his clan they were proof to all that his spirit still lived she felt his hands touch her shift and she reached gently to stop him over the years in brazil so many men had used her she had been given to any white visitor at the plantation who wanted her first it was portuguese traders ship captains even priests then conquering hollanders officers of the dutch forces who had taken brazil a hundred men all born in europe all unbathed and rank all white she had sensed their branco contempt for her with anger and shame to this black yoruba this strong proud man of africa she would give herself freely and with love she met his gaze then in a single motion pulled the shift over her head and tossed it away shaking out the dark hair that fell across her shoulders as she stood naked before him in the moonlight the wind against her body seemed like a foretaste of the freedom the love he had promised he studied her for a moment the shadows of her firm breasts casting dark ellipses downward across her body she was dara slowly he grasped her waist and lifted her next to him as she entwined her legs about his waist he buried his face against her and together they laughed for joy later she recalled the touch of his body the soft grass the sounds of the night in her ears as she cried out in completeness the first she had ever known and at last a perfect quiet had seemed to enfold them as she held him in her arms his strength tame as a childs in the mists of dawn he brought her back through the forest serenaded by its invisible choir of egrets and whistling frogs he carried her home across the rooftop to her bed to a world no longer real damn me sir i suppose youve heard the talk ill tell you i fear for the worst johan ruyters wiped his mouth with a calloused hand and shoved his tankard across the table motioning for a refill the great cabin of the defiance was a mosaic of flickering shadows lighted only by the swaying candlelantern over the large oak table it could well be the end of dutch trade in all the english settlements from here to virginia i suppose theres a chance who can say winston reached for the flask of sack and passed it over he was exhausted but his mind was taut with anticipation almost ready he told himself youll be gone before the island explodes theres only one last thing you need a seasoned pilot for jamaica bay one of the stories i hear is that if barbados doesnt swear allegiance to parliament there may be a blockade aye but that cant last long and frankly speaking it matters little to me who governs this damned island parliament or its own assembly he waved his hand then his look darkened no its this word about some kind of navigation act that troubles me you mean the story that parliaments thinking of passing an act restricting trade in all the american settlements to english bottoms aye and lets all pray its not true but we hear the damned london merchants are pushing for it weve sowed and now theyd be the ones to reap what do you think youll do do sir id say theres little we can do the low countries dont want war with england though thats what it all may lead to if london tries stopping free trade he glanced around the timbered cabin there was a sternchaser cannon lashed to blocks just inside the large windows aft and a locked rack of muskets and pistols secured forward why had winston invited him aboard tonight they had despised each other from the first the better part of our trade in the new world nows with virginia and bermuda along with barbados and st christopher down here in the caribbees itll ruin every captain i know if were barred from ports in the english settlements well the way things look now youd probably be wise just to weigh anchor and make for open sea before theres any trouble here assuming your sight drafts are all in order aye theyre signed but now im wondering if ill ever see them settled he leaned back in his chair and ran his fingers through his thinning gray hair ive finished scrubbing down the zeelander and started lading in some cotton this was going to be my best run yet god damn cromwell and his army as long as the civil war was going on nobody in london took much notice of the americas true enough you hollanders got rich since there was scarcely any english shipping but in a way itll be your own fault if barbados has to knuckle under now to england and english merchants i dont follow you sir ruyters regarded him questioningly itd be a lot easier for them to stand and fight if they didnt have these new slaves you sold them thats a most peculiar idea sir he frowned how do you see that winston rose and strolled aft to the stern windows studying the leaded glass for a moment before unlatching one frame and swinging it out a gust of cool air washed across his face you hollanders have sold them several thousand africans whod probably just as soon see the island turned back to a forest so theyll be facing the english navy offshore with a bunch of african warriors at their backs i dont see how they can man both fronts thats a curious bit of speculation sir which im not sure id be ready to grant you but it scarcely matters now ruyters stared down at the table so what do you thinks likely to happen my guess is the assemblyll not surrender the island to cromwell without a fight theres too much royalist sentiment there he looked back at ruyters if theres a blockade or if cromwell tries to land english forces id wager theyll call up the militia and shoot back but theyve nothing to fight with scarcely any ordnance worth the name thats what im counting on winstons eyes sobered what do you mean sir its the poor man that remembers best who once lent him a shilling i figure that anybody who helps them now will be remembered here in the days to come regardless of how this turns out why in the name of hell would you bother helping them no man with his wits about him wants to get caught in this not if hes looking to his own interests ill look to my interests as i see fit winston glanced back and you can do the same aye to be sure i intend to but what would you be doing getting mixed up in this trouble therell be powder and shot spent before its over sir or im not a christian i figure theres today and then theres tomorrow when this islands going to be a sugar factory and theyll need shippers they wont forget who stood by them if i pitch in a bit nowmaybe help them fortify the point for instanceill have first call im thinking of buying another bottom just for sugar he looked at ruyters and laughed why should all the new sugar profits go to you damned butterboxes well sir youre not under my command anymore i cant stop you from trying the dutchman cleared his throat noisily but theyd not forget so soon whos stood by them through all the years ask any planter here and hell tell you weve kept this island and all the rest of the english settlements from starving for the last twenty years he took a swallow from his tankard then settled it down thoughtfully though mind you we needed them too england had the spare people to settle the americas which the low countries never had but weve had the bottoms to ship them what they need its been a perfect partnership he looked back at winston what exactly do you think you can do i mean this business about fortifying the point just a little arrangement im making with some members of the assembly im asking you as one gentleman to another sir plain as that winston paused a few moments then walked back from the window the lantern light played across his lined face as a gentleman then between us im thinking ill offload some of the ordnance on the defiance and move it up to the point ive got twice the cannon on board that theyve got in place there i figure i might also spare them a few budgebarrels of powder and some round shot if they need it i suppose i see your thinking ruyters frowned and drank again but its a fools errand for all that even if they could manage to put up a fight how long can they last theyre isolated who can say but i hear theres talk in the assembly about trying to form an alliance of all the american settlements they figure virginia and bermuda might join with them everybody would except maybe the puritans up in new england who doubtless can be counted on to side with the hotheads in parliament and i say the devil take those new englanders theyve started shipping produce in their own bottoms shutting us out ive seen their flags carrying lumber to the canaries and madeira theyre even sending fish to portugal and spain now when a few years past we were all but keeping them alive ten years ago they even made dutch coin legal tender in massachusetts since we handled the better part of their trade but now i say the hell with them his face turned hopeful but if there was an alliance of the other english settlements ill wager thered be a chance they might manage to stand up to cromwell for a while or at least hold out for terms like you say they need our shipping as much as we need them ive heard talk bermuda may be in favor of it nobody knows about virginia winston drank from his tankard but for now the needs right here at least thats what im counting on if i can help them hold out theyll remember who stood by them anyway ive got nothing to lose except maybe a few culverin ruyters eyed him in silence for a moment the rhythmic creaking of the boards sounded through the smoky gloom of the cabin finally he spoke lets be plain what are they paying you i told you winston reached for the flask ive spoken to bedford and im planning a deal for sugar contracts ill take it out in trade later ruyters slammed down his own tankard gods wounds they could just as well have talked to some of us ill warrant the dutch bottoms hereve got enough ordnance to fortify both of the breastworks along the west coast he looked up therere a good dozen merchantmen anchored in the bay right now and weve all got some ordnance ive even got a fine set of brass ninepounders they could borrow id as soon keep this an english matter for now theres no need for you dutchmen to get involved winston emptied the flask into his tankard the way i see it i can fortify the breastwork up on the point with what ive got on board itll help them hold off cromwells fleet for a while maybe soften the terms he turned and tossed the bottle out the open stern window which is just enough to get me signatures on some contracts then i take back the guns and cromwell can have the place what the pox its a free trade matter sir weve all got a stake in it ruyters look darkened he thought of the profits he had enjoyed over the years trading with the english settlements hed sold household wares cloth and liquor to colonists in virginia and the caribbees and hed shipped back to europe with furs and tobacco from north america cotton and dye woods from the caribbean like all dutch fluyts his ship was specially built to be lightly manned enabling him to consistently undercut english shippers then too he and the other dutch traders made a science of stowage and took better care of their cargos they could always sell cheaper give longer credits and offer lower freight rates than any english trader could but now that they had slaves to swap for sugar there would finally be some real profits i cant speak for the other men here but itd be no trouble for me to lend them a few guns too and id be more than willing to take payment in sugar contracts maybe you could mention it privately to bedford itd have to be unofficial if theyre going to be using dutch guns against the english navy im not sure why id want to do that as a gentleman sir we both have a stake in keeping free trade maybe you could just drop a word to bedford and ask him to bring it up with the assembly tell him we might mislay a few culverin if he could arrange to have some contracts drawn up whats in it for me well strike an arrangement sir word of honor ruyters look brightened to be settled later when i can return the favor maybe you can do something for me now if i agree you can name it sir ive been thinking i could use a good bosuns mate how about letting me have that crippled spaniard on the zeelander if youve still got him whats his name the one who had a limp after that fall from the yardarm when we were tacking in to nevis you dont mean vargas armando vargas thats the one ruyters squinted through the dim light hes one of the handiest lads aloft ive got bad leg or no a firstrate yardman well i think id like to take him on i didnt know you were shorthanded sir thats my bargain winston walked back to the window let me have him and ill see what i can do about talking to bedford i suppose you remember he used to be a navigator of sorts for the spaniards for that matter ill wager he knows as much as any man youre likely to come across about their shipping in the windward passage and their fortifications over there on the main ruyters eyes narrowed damn my soul what the devil are you planning i can always use a good man he laughed those are my terms youre a lying rogue ill stake my life he shoved back his chair but i still like the bargain for it all youve got a man have bedford raise our matter with the assembly ill see what i can do only its just between us for now till we see how many guns they need it goes without saying ruyters rose and extended his hand so well shake on it a bargain sealed he bowed your servant sir winston pushed open the cabin door and followed him down the companionway to the waist of the ship ruyters shallop was moored alongside its lantern casting a shimmering light across the waves the oarsmen bustled to station when they saw him emerge he bowed again then swung heavily down the rope ladder winston stood pensively by the railing inhaling the moist evening air and watching as the shallops lantern slowly faded into the midnight finally he turned and strolled up the companionway to the quarterdeck miss katherine bedford should be pleased he told himself in any case better they borrow dutch guns than mine not that the extra ordnance will make much difference if cromwell posts a fleet of warships with trained gunners with these planters manning their cannon the fleet will make short work of the island he started back for the cabin then paused to watch the moonlight breaking over the crests and listen to the rhythmic pound of light surf along the shore he looked back at the island and asked himself if katherines was a cause worth helping not if the americas end up the province of a few rich slaveholderswhich on barbados has got to be sure as the sunrise so just hold your own course and let this island get whatever it deserves he glanced over the ship and reflected again on his preparations for the hundredth time it wouldnt be easy but the plan was coming together the sight drafts were still safely locked away in the great cabin ready for delivery day after tomorrow when the transfer of the indentures became official and the work of outfitting the ship for transport of men was all but finished the gun deck had been cleared with the spare budge barrels of powder and the auxiliary round shot moved to the hold permitting sleeping hammocks to be lashed up for the new men stores of salt fish cheese and biscuit had been assembled in a warehouse facing carlisle bay and two hundred half pikes had been forged fitted with staffs and secured in the focsle together with all of anthony walronds new flintlock muskets everything was ready and now he finally had a pilot armando vargas had made jamaica harbor a dozen times back when he sailed with the spaniards he always liked to brag about it once hed even described in detail the lookout post on a hilltop somewhere west of jamaica bay if they could slip some men past those sentries on the hill the fortress and town would fall before the spaniards militia even suspected they were around then maybe he would take out time to answer the letter thatd just come from england he turned and nodded to several of the men as he moved slowly back down the companionway and into the comforting quiet of the cabin hed go up to joans tavern after a while share a last tankard and listen to that laugh of hers as he spun out the story of ruyters and the guns but now he wanted solitude hed always believed he thought best worked best alone he closed the large oak door of the great cabin then walked to the windows aft and studied the wide sea the caribbean was home now the only home left if there was any question of that before there wasnt anymore not after the letter he stood a moment longer then felt for the small key he always kept in his left breeches pocket beneath a board at the side of the cabin was a movable panel and behind it a heavy door double secured the key slipped easily into the metal locks and he listened for the two soft clicks inside were the sight bills just visible in the flickering light of the lantern and next to them was a stack of shipping invoices finally there was the letter its outside smeared with grease and the red wax of its seal cracked and half missing he slipped it out and unfolded it along the creases feeling his anger well up as he settled to read it one more time sir i shall never again have the pleasure to address you as my obedient son after many years of my thinking you perished there has late come word you are abroad in the caribbees a matter long known to certain others but until this day shielded from me for reasons i now fully comprehend the reputation i find you have acquired brings me no little pain being that so i am now advisd of a smuggler and brigand he paused to glance out the stern window once again remembering how the letter had arrived in the mail packet just delivered by the rotterdam it was dated two months past and it had been deposited at joans tavern along with several others intended for seamen known to make port in barbados though i had these many long years thought you dead by the hands of the spaniard yet i prayed unceasing to god it should not be so now upon hearing news of what you have become i am constrained to question gods will in that you have brought ignominy to my name and to the name of those other two sons of mine both dutiful i can find no room for solace nor can they he found his mind going back to memories of william and james both older hed never cared much for either of them and theyd returned his sentiment in full measure william was the firstheavy set and slow of wit with a noticeable weakness for sherry since the eldest son inherited everything he had by now doubtless taken charge of the two thousand acres that was winston manor becoming a country squire who lived off rents from his tenants and what of james that nervous image of lord harold winston and no less ambitious and unyielding probably by now he was a rich barrister the profession hed announced for himself sometime about age ten or maybe hed stood for parliament there to uphold the nowended cause of king charles that a son of mine should become celebrated in the americas for his contempt of law brings me distress beyond the telling of it though i reared you with utmost care and patience i oft had cause to ponder if you should ever come to any good end being always of dissolute and unruly inclination now i find your profession has been to defraud the english crown to which you should be on your knees in reverence and to injure the cause of honest merchants who are the lifeblood of this christian nation i am told your name has even reached the ears of his majesty causing him no small dismay and adding to his distresses at a time when the very throne of england is in peril from those who would as you set personal gain above loyalty and obedience he stopped not wanting to read more and crumpled the letter that was the end of england why would he want to go back ever if thered once been a possibility now it was gone the time had come to plant roots in the new world so what better place than jamaica and damned to england he turned again to the stern windows feeling the end of all the unease that had come and gone over the years this was it but after jamaica what he was all alone a white cloud floated past the moon with a shape like the beakhead of a ship for a moment it was a gargoyle and then it was the head of a white horse he had turned back still holding the paper when he noticed the sound of distant pops fragile explosions from the direction of the point he walked puzzling back to the safe and was closing the door the key already in the lock when he suddenly stopped the assembly room was somewhere near lookout point just across the bay it was too much of a coincidence with a silent curse he reached in and felt until his hand closed around the leather packet of sight bills the ones he would exchange for the indentures under them were the other papers he would need and he took those too then he quickly locked the cabinet and rose to make his way out to the companionway as he passed the table he reached for his pistols checking the prime and shoving them into his belt as he moved out into the evening air he moved aft to the quartergallery railing to listen again now there could be no mistaking up the hill behind lookout point there were flashes of light in the dark musket fire what do you suppose it could be capn john mewes appeared at the head of the companionway just pray its not what i think it is or we may need some powder and shot ourselves he glanced back toward the hill sound general muster every man on deck aye mewes turned and headed for the quarterdeck even as the bell was still sounding seamen began to appear through the open hatch some half dressed and groggy others were mumbling that their dice game had been interrupted winston met them on the main deck and slowly they formed a ragged column facing him now there was more gunfire from the hill unmistakable im going to issue muskets he walked along the line checking each seaman personally every other man seemed to be tipsy to every man here thats sober were going ashore and youll be under my command beggin yor pardon capn whats all that commotion up there apt to be a grizzled seaman peered toward the sounds as he finished securing the string supporting his breeches it might just be the inauguration of a new civil war hawkins winstons voice sounded down the deck so look lively we collect on our sight bills tonight chapter seven the jagged peninsula known as lookout point projected off the southwestern tip of barbados separating the windy atlantic on the south from the calm of the leeward coast on the west at its farthest tip situated on a stone cliff that rose some hundred feet above the entrance to carlisle bay were the breastwork and gun emplacements intended for harbor defense only its few projecting cannon all pointed out toward the channel leading into the bay past the line of coral reefs that sheltered the harbor on its southern side from the deck of the defiance at anchor near the river mouth and across the bay from the peninsula the gunfire seemed to be coming from the direction of the new assembly room a thatchedroof stone building up the hill beyond the breastwork constructed under the authority of governor dalby bedford it housed the general assembly of barbados which consisted of two representatives elected from each of the eleven parishes on the island all free men in possession of five acres or more could vote ballots being cast at the parish churches while winston unlocked the gun racks in the focsle and began issuing the muskets and the bandoliers of powder and shot john mewes ordered the two longboats lashed amidships readied and launched the seamen lined up single file at the doorway of the focsle to receive their muskets then swung down the rope ladders and into the boats winston took his place in one and gave command of the other to john mewes as the men strained against the oars and headed across the bay he studied the row of cannon projecting out over the moonlit sea from the top of the breastwork theyve never been used he thought wryly except maybe for ceremonial salutes thats what they call harbor defenses its a mercy of god the islands so far windward from the main that the spaniardsve never troubled to burn the place out he sat on the prow of the longboat collecting his thoughts while he tasted the air and the scent of the sea the whitecaps of the bay slipped past in the moonlight as they steered to leeward of the line of dutch merchantmen anchored near the shore he then noticed a bob of lanterns on the southeast horizon and realized it was an arriving merchantman with a heading that would bring it directly into the harbor he watched the lights awhile marveling at the dutch trading zeal that would cause a captain to steer past the reefs into the harbor in the hours after midnight he congratulated himself hed long ago given up trying to compete headon with the hollanders they practically owned the english settlements in the americas scarce wonder cromwells first order of business was to be rid of them the sound of the tide lapping against the beach as the two longboats neared the shore beneath the breastwork brought his attention back when they scraped into the shallows he dropped off the prow and waded through the kneehigh surf that chased up the sand in wave after wave ahead the beach glistened white till it gave way to the rocks at the base of the point john mewes puffed along close at his heels and after him came the first mate dick hawkins unshaven but alert musket at the ready close behind strode tall edwin spune masters mate a musket in each hand followed by the rest in all some twenty of winstons men had crossed the bay with him he ordered the longboats beached then called the men together and motioned for quiet are all muskets primed aye spurre stepped forward holding his two muskets up as though for inspection an every mans got an extra bandolier of powder an shot were ready for whatever the whoresons try he glanced up the rise puzzled still not understanding why the captain had assembled them but hugh winston liked having his orders obeyed good winston walked down the line spread out along the shore and wait im going up to see what the shootings about just stand ready till you hear from me but if you see me fire a pistol shot you be up that hill like jackbenimble is that clear you mean us against all that bleedin lot up there john mewes squinted toward the dark rise theres apt to be half their militia up there capn from the sound of it did i hear you question an order john you know ships rules they go for officers too he turned to the other men should we call a vote right here gods life mewes pushed forward remembering winstons formula for discipline on the defiance he didnt even own a catoninetails the lash used by most ship captains for punishment he never touched an offender he always just put trial and punishment to a show of hands by the menwhose favorite entertainment was keelhauling any seaman who disobeyed captains orders lashing a line to his waist and ducking him under the hull till he was half drowned i wasnt doin no questioning not for a minute i mustve just been mumbling in my sleep then try and stay awake im going up there now alone but if i need you youd better be there john with the men thats an order aye mewes performed what passed for a salute then cocked his musket with a flourish winston loosened the pistols in his belt checked the packet containing the sight bills and the other papers he had brought then headed directly up the rise the approach to lookout point was deserted but up the hill behind a new stack of logs he could see the shadowy outline of a crowd the barricade no more than fifty yards from the assembly room was in the final stages of construction as men with torches dragged logs forward others militia officers were stationed behind the logs with muskets and were returning pistol fire from the halfopen doorway of the assembly room above the din he could hear the occasional shouts of benjamin briggs who appeared to be in charge together with him were the members of the council and officers from their regiments the command of the militia was restricted to major landholders a field officer had to own at least a hundred acres a captain fifty a lieutenant twentyfive and even an ensign had to have fifteen on the barricade were strawhatted indentures belonging to members of the council armed only with pikes since the planters did not trust them with muskets winston recognized among them many whom he had agreed to take the firing was sputtering to a lull as he approached then briggs spotted him and yelled out youd best be gone sir before someone in the assembly room gets a mind to put a round of pistol shot in your breeches im not part of your little war that youre decidedly not sir so well not be requiring your services here tonight whats the difficulty winston was still walking directly toward them its a matter of the safety of barbados ive said it doesnt concern you those indentures concern me i dont want them shot tell that to the assembly sir we came here tonight offering to take dalby bedford under our care peacefully to protect him from elements on the island whore set to disown parliament but some of the hotheads in there mistook our peaceful purpose and opened fire on us maybe they think they can protect him better than you can another round of fire sounded from the doorway of the assembly room and thudded into the log barricade when two of the planters cursed and fired back the door was abruptly slammed shut its the assembly thats usurped rightful rule here sir as tonight should amply show when they no longer represent the true interests of barbados briggs glared at him were restoring proper authority to this island long overdue you and the council can restore whatever you like im just here to take care of my indentures before you manage to have some of them killed theyre not yours yet sir the situations changed were not letting them go whilst the islands unsettled the only unsettling thing i see here are all those muskets he reached into the pocket of his jerkin and lifted out the leather packet containing the sight drafts so were going to make that transfer right now well im damned if youll have a single man this is not the time agreed briggs looked around at the other members of the council behind them the crowd of indentures had stopped work to listen the sight bills are payable on demand weve settled the terms and im officially calling them in winston passed over the packet youve got plenty of witnesses herere the sight bills as of now the indentures are mine he pulled a sheaf of papers from the other pocket of his jerkin youre welcome to look over the drafts while i start checking off the men briggs seized the leather packet and flung it to the ground then he lifted his musket these indentures are still under our authority until we say no mans going to take them not even a series of musket shots erupted from the window of the assembly room causing briggs and the other planters to duck down behind the log barricade winston remained standing as he called out the first name on the sheet timothy farrell the redfaced irishman climbed around briggs and moved forward his face puzzled he remained behind the pile of logs as he hunkered down still holding his halfpike thats my name yor worship but master briggs farrell heres the indenture contract we drew up for your transfer winston held out the first paper from the sheaf ive marked it paid and had it stamped come and get it and youre free to go whats this yor worship he gingerly reached up for the paper and stared at it in the torchlight uncomprehending i heard you was like to be buying out my contract by my reckoning theres two more year left on it i did just buy it its there in your hand youre a free man farrell sat staring at the paper examining the stamped wax seal and attempting to decipher the writing a sudden silence enveloped the crowd punctuated by another round of musket fire from the assembly room after it died away winston continued now farrell if youd care to be part of an expedition of mine thatll be leaving barbados in a few days time thats your privilege starting tonight your payll be five shillings a week beggin yor worships pardon i reckon im not understandin what youve said youve bought this contract an youve already marked it paid with those sight bills he pointed to the packet on the ground beside briggs farrell glanced at the leather bundle skeptically then he looked back at winston an now youre sayin im free its stamped on that contract have somebody read it if you care to an i can serve yor worship for wage if i like his voice began to rise five shillings a week for now maybe more later if you holy mother mary an all the saints im free he crumpled the paper into his pocket then leaped up as he flung his straw hat into the air free i neer thought id stay breathin long enough to hear the word he glanced quickly at the assembly room then dismissed the danger as he began to dance beside the logs at the dirty end o dirty lane livd a dirty cobbler dick maclane that man still belongs to me briggs half cocked his musket as he rose farrell whirled and brandished his halfpike at the planter you can fry in hell you poxrotted bastard ive lived on your corn mush an water for three years till im scarce able to stand an sweated sunup to sundown in your blazin fields hoein your damnd tobacco and now your godcursed cane with not a farthing o me own to show for it or a change o breeches but his worship says hes paid me out an his paper says im free that means free as you are by god ill be puttin this pike in your bellyby god i willor any man here who says another word against his worship ill serve him as long as im standin or pray god to strike me dead he gave another whoop good jesus whos got a thirst im free jim carroll winstons voice continued mechanically sounding above the din that swept through the indentures present an most humbly at yor worships service a second man elbowed his way forward through the cluster of briggs indentures shoving several others out of his path heres your contract carroll its been stamped paid and youre free to go or you can serve under me if you choose youve heard the terms id serve you for a hapenny a year yor worship he seized the paper and gave a gaelic cheer a tear lining down one cheek ive naught to show for four years in the fields but aches an an empty belly ill die right here under your command before id serve another minute under that whoreson god damn you winston briggs fullcocked his musket with an ominous click if you think ill carroll whirled and thrust his pike into briggs face its free i am by god an its me youll be killin before you harm a hair o his worship if i dont gut you first briggs backed away from the pike still clutching his musket the other members of the council had formed a circle and cocked their guns you dont own these damned indentures yet nicholas whittington shouted weve not agreed to a transfer now youve got your sight drafts those were the terms if you want these men to stay tell it to them he checked the sheaf of papers and yelled out the next name tom darcy as a haggard man in a shabby straw hat pushed forward winston turned back to the huddle that was the council youre welcome to offer them a wage and see if theyd want to stay on since their contracts are all stamped paid i dont have any say in it anymore well i have a say in it sir whittington lifted his musket i plan to have an end to this knavery right now before it gets out of hand one more word from you and itll be your winston looked up and yelled to the crowd of indentures i gather youve heard whos on the list if those menll come up you can have your papers your contracts are paid and youre free to go any man who chooses to serve under me can join me here now whittington was knocked sprawling by the surge of the crowd as straw hats were flung into the air a milling mob of indentures waving halfpikes pressed forward papers from the sheaf in winstons hand were passed eagerly through the ranks the council and the officers of their militia had drawn together for protection still grasping their muskets in the confusion no one noticed the shaft of light from the doorway of the assembly room that cut across the open space separating it from the barricade one by one the members of the assembly gingerly emerged to watch leading them was anthony walrond wearing a brocade doublet and holding a long flintlock pistol puzzlement in his face briggs finally saw them and whirled to cover the assemblymen with his musket we say deliver up bedford or therell be hell to pay i swear it put down that musket you whoreson farrell gave a yell and threw himself across the barrel of the gun seizing the muzzle and shoving it in to the dirt there was a loud report as it discharged exploding at the breech and spewing burning powder into the night christ almighty walrond moved out into the night and several men from the assembly trailed after him dressed in plain doublets and carrying pistols what the devils this about nothing that concerns you winston dropped a hand to one of the guns in his belt id advise you all to go back inside till im finished we were just concluding a meeting of the assembly sir walrond examined winston icily then glanced toward the men of the council when these rogues tried to commandeer the room claiming theyd come to seize the governor to protect him i take it youre part of this conspiracy im here to protect my interests which gives me as much right as you have to be here i dont recall that youre elected to this body im here tonight in an advisory capacity captain not that its any of your concern walrond glanced back at the others all warily holding pistols to offer my views regarding the situation in england as he spoke dalby bedford emerged from the crowd walking behind him was katherine winston turned to watch thinking she was even more beautiful than he had realized before her face was radiant self assured as she moved through the dim torchlight in a glistening skirt and full sleeves she smiled and pushed toward him captain winston are you to be thanked for all this confusion only a part of it miss bedford i merely stopped by to enquire about my indentures since i got the idea some of your assemblymen were shooting at them anthony walrond stared at katherine may i take it you know this man it does you no credit madam i warrant you then he turned and moved down the path directly toward briggs and the members of the council and i can tell all of you this night is far from finished therell be an accounting here sirs you may depend on it laws have been violated you sir should know that best of all briggs stepped forward and dropped his hand to the pistol still in his belt since you and this pack of royalist agitators that calls itself an assembly would unlawfully steer this island to ruin the council of barbados holds that this body deserves to be dissolved forthwith and new elections held to represent the interests of the island against those whod lead us into a fools war with the commonwealth of england you sir speak now in the very same voice as the rebels there i presume youd have this island bow to the criminals in parliament whore now threatening to behead our lawful king gentlemen please dalby bedford moved between them and raised his hand i wont stand for this wrangling we all have to try to settle our differences like englishmen i for one would have no objection to inviting the council to sit with us in the assembly have a joint session and try to reason out whats the wisest course now i see no reason this body need share a table with a crowd of rebels wholl not bend a knee to the rightful sovereign of england walrond turned back to the members of the assembly i say you should this very night draw up a loyalty oath for barbados any man who refuses to swear fealty to his majesty should be deported back to england to join the traitors who would unlawfully destroy the monarchy no katherine abruptly pushed in front of him this island stayed neutral all through the civil war we never took a part either for king or parliament why should we take sides now with the war over and finished walrond looked down at her startled because the time has come to stand and be counted katherine why do you suppose the rebels may have seized england for now but thats no reason we in the americas have to turn our back on the king but theres another choice she drew a deep breath winston saw determination in her eyes as she turned to face the men of the assembly think about it we never belonged to england we belonged to the crown but the monarchys been abolished and the kings patents invalidated i say we should join with the other english settlements and declare the americas a new nation barbados should lead the way and declare our own independence thats the damnedest idea ive ever heard briggs moved forward shaking away the indentures who still crowded around him menacingly if we did that thered be war for sure weve got to stay english or cromwellll send the army to burn us out he turned to walrond rebel or no cromwell represents the might of england wed be fools to try to stand against him either for king or for some fool dream of independence he looked back at katherine whered you get such an idea girl itd be the end of our hopes for prosperity if we tried going to war with england thered be no room to negotiate you sir have no say in this youre apt to be on trial for treason before the weeks out walrond waved his pistol at briggs then turned back to katherine what are you talking about england is beholden to her king madam much the way i might remind you a wife is to her husband or dont you yet understand that its our place to revere and serve the monarchy as far as im concerned the kings only a man and sos a husband sir a wife takes an oath in marriage madam to obey her husband youd best remember that he turned and motioned the members of the assembly to gather around him as he stepped over to a large log and mounted it on the subject of obedience i say again an oath of loyalty to his majesty king charles should be voted in the barbados assembly this very morning we need to know where this island stands he stared back at dalby bedford much as a husband would do well to know what he can expect when he takes a wife youve got no authority to call a vote by the assembly briggs sputtered youre not elected to it he looked at walrond then at bedford this by god was the very thing we came here tonight to head off you sir have no authority to interfere in the lawful processes of this body walrond turned back to the assembly members now huddled in conference winston looked at katherine and found himself admiring her idealismand her brass openly defying the man she was supposed to marry she wanted independence for the americas he now realized while all anthony walrond wanted was to turn barbados into a government in exile for the king maybe to someday restore his fortune in england she was an independent woman herself too make no mistaking sir anthony walrond was going to have himself a handful in the future with the commonwealth and with her come to think of it though independence wasnt all that bad an idea why the hell not damned to england i think thereve been enough highhanded attempts to take over this island for one night he moved to confront walrond you have your brass captain to even show your face here he inspected winston with his good eye when you pillaged a ship of mine off nevis island broadcloth and muskets no more than two years past now that youve brought it up what i did was save the lives of some fifty men who were about to drown for want of a seaworthy longboat since you saved so much money on equipage i figured you could afford to compensate me for my pains it was theft sir by any law then the law be hanged hardly a surprising sentiment coming from you walrond shifted his pistol toward winstons direction you should be on tortuga with the other rogues of your own stripe rather than here on barbados amongst honest men your profession captain has trained you best for the end of a rope whats yours trained you for he stood unmoving get yourself elected to the assembly then make your speeches im tired of hearing about your king in truth i never had a very high opinion of him myself back off sirrah i warn you now walrond pointed his long pistol youre speaking your impertinences to an officer of the kings army ive dealt with a few thieves and smugglers in years past and i just may decide to mete out some more longoverdue justice here and now dalby bedford cleared his throat and stepped between them gentlemen i think theres been more heat here tonight than need be all around it could be well if we cooled off a day or so i trust the assembly would second my motion for adjournment of this session till weve had time to reflect on whats the best course for us this is scarcely a light matter we could be heading into war with england a prospect that does not deter certain of us from acting on principle sir walronds voice welled up again i demand this assembly take a vote right now on youll vote on nothing by god briggs yelled then drew his own pistol suddenly a fistfight erupted between two members of the assembly one for and the other opposing the monarchy then others joined in in the excitement several pistols were discharged in the fray good god winston thought barbados famous assembly has been reduced to this he noticed absently that the first gray coloring of dawn was already beginning to appear in the east itd been a long night whatll happen when day finally comes and news of all this reaches the rest of the island where will it end belay there cool down your ordnance above the shouts and bedlam a voice sounded from the direction of the shore winston turned to see the light of a swinging sea lantern approaching up the rise he recognized the ragged outline of johan ruyters still in the clothes he had worn earlier that night puffing up the hill ruyters topped the rise and surveyed the confusion his presence seemed to immediately dampen the melee as several assemblymen paused in embarrassment to stare the dutchman walked directly up to dalby bedford and tipped his widebrimmed hat your servant sir then he gazed around your most obedient servant gentlemen one and all he nodded to the crowd before turning back to address bedford though its never been my practice to intrude in your solemn english convocations i thought it would be well for you to hear what i just learned he drew a deep breath and settled his lantern onto the grass the kostverloren bound from amsterdam has just dropped anchor in the bay and captain liebergen called us all together in a rare sweat he says when dark caught him last evening he was no more than three leagues ahead of an english fleet great god help us walrond sucked in his breath aye that was my thinking as well ruyters glanced back if i had to guess id say your english parliaments sent the navy gentlemen so we may all have to be giving god a hand if were not to have the harbor taken by daylight for once a rumors proved all too true gods life how many were sailing bedford whirled to squint toward the dim horizon his maintopman thinks he mayve counted some fifteen sail half of them looked to be merchantmen but the rest were clearly menofwar maybe thirty guns apiece were all readying to weigh anchor and hoist sail at first light but its apt to be too late now id say with the guns theyve got and the canvas theyll have the harbor in a bottle by daybreak i dont believe you walrond gazed skeptically toward the east as you will sir ruyters smiled but if youd be pleased to send a man up to the top of the hill right over there id wager he just might be able to spy their topsls for himself winston felt the life suddenly flow out of him it was the end of his plans with the harbor blockaded hed never be able to sail with the indentures he might never sail at all god almighty you dont have to send anybody bedford was pointing toward the horizon dont you see it just beneath the gray cloudbank was an unmistakable string of flickering pinpoints mast lights the crowd gathered to stare in dismay finally bedfords voice came hard and determined weve got to meet them the question is whatre their damned intentions ruyters picked up his lantern and extinguished it by my thinking the first thing youd best do is man those guns down there on the point and then make your enquiries you cant let them into the bay weve got shipping there sir and a fortune in cargo therell be hell to pay i promise you if i lose so much as a florin in goods bedford gazed down the hill toward the gun emplacements at the ocean cliff aye but we dont yet know why the fleets come weve only had rumors at least one of those rumors was based on fact sir briggs had moved beside them i have it on authority from my broker in london that an act was reported from the council of state four weeks past to embargo our shipping till the assembly votes recognition of the commonwealth he even sent me a copy and this fleet was already being pulled together at the time i dont know how many menowar theyve sent but i heard the flagship was to be the rainbowe fifty guns he looked back at the assembly and the surest way to put an end to our prosperity now would be to resist he was rudely shouted down by several assemblymen royalists cursing the commonwealth the air came alive with calls for defiance well were going to find out what theyre about before we do anything one way or the other bedford looked around him weve got guns down there in the breastwork id say we can at least keep them out of the bay for now not without gunners you wont ruyters voice was somber whove you got here show me a man whos ever handled a linstock and ill give you leave to hang me and ill not be lending you my lads though id dearly love to itd be a clear act of war winston was staring down at the shore toward his own waiting seamen if the english navy entered carlisle bay the first vessel theyd confiscate would be the defiance god help me he paused a moment longer then walked to the edge of the hill and drew a pistol the shot echoed through the morning silence the report brought a chorus of yells from the shore suddenly a band of seamen were charging up the hill muskets at the ready led by john mewes winston waited till they topped the rise then he gestured them forward all gunnery mates report to duty at the breastwork down there at the point on the double he pointed toward the row of rusty cannon overlooking the bay master gunner tom canninges in charge several of the men gave a loose salute and turned to hurry down the hill winston watched them go then looked back at bedford how much powder do you have powder im not sure anybody knows well have to check the magazine over there bedford gestured toward a low building situated well behind the breastwork surrounded by its own stone fortification id say theres likely a dozen barrels or so winston glanced at mewes go check it john see if its usable aye mewes passed his musket to one of the french seamen and was gone and that rusty pile of round shot i see down there by the breastwork is that the best youve got thats all we have on the point theres more shot at jamestown and over at oistins no time he motioned to ruyters remember our agreement last night aye and i suppose theres no choice i couldnt make open sea in time now anyway the dutchmans eyes were rueful ill have some round shot sent up first and then start offloading my ninepound demiculverin all we need now is enough shot to make them think weve got a decent battery up here we can bring up more ordnance later may i remind you bedford interjected were not planning to start an allout war we just need time to try and talk reason with parliament to try and keep what weve got here winston noticed briggs and several members of the council had convened in solemn conference if an attack comes he found himself wondering which of them will be the first to side with parliaments forces and betray the island theres twenty budgebarrels capn mewes was returning i gave it a taste an ill wager its dry and usable winston nodded then motioned toward edwin spurre have the men here carry five barrels on down to the point so the gunnery mates can start priming the culverin be sure they check all the touch holes for rust aye spurre signaled four of the seamen to follow him as he started off toward the powder magazine suddenly he was surrounded and halted by a group of irish indentures timothy farrell approached winston and bowed so please yor worship wed like to be doin any carryin you need here an wed like to be the ones meetin them on the beaches you dont have to involve yourself farrell id say youve got little enough here to risk your life for aye yor worship thats as it may be but are we to understand that fleet out theres been sent by that whoreson archfiend oliver cromwell thats what we think now then beggin yor worships pardon wed like to be the men to gut every scum on board has yor worship heard what he did at drogheda i heard he sent the army aye when ireland refused to bow to his parliament he claimed we were papists who had no rights he led his puritan troops to irish soil yor worship and laid siege to our garrison city of drogheda then he let his soldiers slaughter our people three thousand men women and children an for it he was praised from the puritan pulpits in england farrell paused to collect himself my cousin died there yor worship wi his meggie an one of cromwells brave puritan soldiers used their little daughter as a shield when he helped storm an burn the church so they could murder the priests maybe that heretic bastard thinks weve not heard about it here he bowed again we dont know enough about primin and firin cannon but wi yor worships leave wed like to be the ones carryin all the powder and shot for you permission granted winston thumbed them in the direction of spurre the armada of sails was clearly visible on the horizon now and rapidly swelling as the first streaks of dawn showed across the waters english colors could be seen on the flagship it was dark brown and massive with wide creamcolored sails now it had put on extra canvas pulling away from the fleet bearing down on the harbor winston studied the manofwar marveling at its majesty and size how ironic he thought englands never sent a decent warship against the spaniards in the new world even after they burned out helpless settlements but now they send the pick of the navy against their own people damned to them that is the rainbowe bedford squinted at the ship shes a firstrank manofwar fifty guns she was king charles royal ship of war shell transport a good two hundred infantry winston felt his stomach tighten could it be thered be more than a blockade had parliament really sent the english army to invade the island im going down to the breastwork he glanced quickly at katherine then turned and began to make his way toward the gun emplacements edwin spurre and the indentures were moving slowly through the early halflight carrying kegs of powder i think we can manage with these guns capn canninge was standing by the first cannon his long hair matted against the sweat on his forehead ive cleaned out the touch holes and checked the charge delivered by the powder ladle we found theyre eighteenpounders culverin and theres some shot here that ought to serve then prime and load them on the double aye using a longhandled ladle he and the men began to shove precisely measured charges of powder twenty pounds into the muzzle of each cannon the indentures were heaving round shot onto their shoulders and stacking piles beside the guns winston watched the approaching sail wondering how and why it had suddenly all come to this was he about to be the first man in the americas to fire a shot declaring war against england he looked around to see dalby bedford standing behind him with katherine at his side you know what it means if we open fire on the rainbowe id guess its cromwells flagship now i do indeed itd be war i pray itll not come to that id like to try and talk with them first if we can keep them out of the bay the governors face was grim try once across her bow just a warning maybe shell strike sail and let us know her business care to hold one last vote in the assembly about this before we fire the first shot something tells me its not likely to be the last weve just talked theres no need for a vote no man here royalist or no is going to stand by and just hand over this place well negotiate but well not throw up our hands and surrender theres too much at stake winston nodded and turned to canninge theyre pulling close to range when youre ready lay a round across her bow then hold for orders aye canninge smiled and pointed toward a small gun at the end of the row its dark brass glistening in the early light ill use that little sixpounder well save the eighteenpounders for the work to come have you got range yet give me a minute to set her and ill wager i can lay a round shot two hundred yards in front of the bow he turned and barked an order seamen hauled the tackles rolling the gun into position then they levered the breech slightly upward to lower the muzzle jamming a wooden wedge between the gun and the wooden truck to set it in position winston took a deep breath then glanced back at bedford this may be the most damn foolhardy thing thats ever been done bedfords voice was grave its on my authority he turned back to canninge fire when ready the words were swallowed in the roar as the gunner touched a piece of burning matchrope to the cannons firing hole dark smoke boiled up from the muzzle acrid in the fresh morning air moments later a plume erupted off the bow of the english manofwar almost as though the ship had been waiting it veered suddenly to port winston realized the guns had already been run out theyd been prepared puffs of black smoke blossomed out of the upper gun deck and moments later a line of plumes shot up along the surf just below the point they fired when they dipped into a swell canninge laughed english gunnery still disappoints me a fearful hush dropped over the crowd and winston stood listening as the sound of the guns echoed over the point they probably dont suspect weve got any trained gunners up here this morning otherwise theyd never have opened fire when theyre right under our ordnance he glanced at bedford youve got their reply whats yours i suppose theres only one answer the governor looked back and surveyed the waiting members of the assembly several men removed their hats and began to confer together moments later they looked up and nodded he turned back what can you do to her is that authority to fire full authority then get everybody back up the hill now he watched as bedford gave the order and the crowd began to quickly melt away the irish indentures waited behind winston refusing to move he gestured a few of the men forward to help set the guns then turned back to canninge is there range aye just give me a minute to set the rest of these culverin winston heard a rustle of skirts by his side and knew katherine was standing next to him he reached out and caught her arm youve got a war now katherine whether you wanted it or not itll be the first time a settlement in the americas has ever fired on an english ship i guess thats the price youre going to have to pay for staying your own master but i doubt youll manage it we just might she reached and touched the hand on her arm then she turned and looked out to sea we have to try winston glanced toward the guns canninge and the men had finished turning them on the rainbowe using long wooden handspikes now they were adjusting the wooden wedge at the breech of each gun to set the altitude how does it look i know these eighteenpounders capn like i was born to one at this range i could lineofsight these whoresons any place you like how about just under the lower gun deck at the water line the first round better count aye thats what ive set them for he grinned and reached for a burning linstock i didnt figure we was up here to send a salute book two revolution chapter eight the declaration we find these acts of the english parliament to oppose the freedom safety and wellbeing of this island we the present inhabitants of barbados with great danger to our persons and with great charge and trouble have settled this island in its condition and inhabited the same and shall we therefore be subjected to the will and command of those that stay at home shall we be bound to the government and lordship of a parliament in which we have no representatives or persons chosen by us it is alleged that the inhabitants of this island have by cunning and force usurped a power and formed an independent government in truth the government now used among us is the same that hath always been ratified and doth everyway agree with the first settlement and government in this place futhermore by the above said act all foreign nations are forbidden to hold any correspondency or traffick with the inhabitants of this island although all the inhabitants know very well how greatly we have been obliged to the dutch for our subsistence and how difficult it would have been for us without their assistance ever to have inhabited these places in the americas or to have brought them into order we are still daily aware what necessary comfort they bring us and that they do sell their commodities a great deal cheaper than our own nation will do but this comfort would be taken from us by those whose will would be a law unto us however we declare that we will never be so unthankful to the netherlanders for their former help and assistance as to deny or forbid them or any other nation the freedom of our harbors and the protection of our laws by which they may continue if they please all freedom of commerce with us therefore we declare that whereas we would not be wanting to use all honest means for obtaining a continuance of commerce trade and good correspondence with our country so we will not alienate ourselves from those old heroic virtues of true englishmen to prostitute our freedom and privileges to which we are born to the will and opinion of anyone we can not think that there are any amongst us who are so simple or so unworthily minded that they would not rather choose a noble death than forsake their liberties the general assembly of barbados sir edmond calvert studied the long scrolled document in the light of the swinging ships lantern stroking his goatee as he read and reread the bold ink script liberty or death a memorable choice of words though one he never recalled hearing before would the actions of these planters be as heroic as their rhetoric or could the part about a noble death be an oblique reference to king charles bravery before the executioners axe it had impressed all england but how could they have heard the king had only just been beheaded and word could scarcely have yet reached the barbados assembly one thing was clear however barbados assembly had rebelled against the commonwealth it had rejected the authority of parliament and chosen to defy the navigation act passed by that body to assert englands economic control of its settlements in the new world wearily he settled the paper onto the table and leaned back in his sea chair passing his eyes around the timbered cabin and letting his gaze linger on a long painting of oliver cromwell hanging near the door the visage had the intensity of a puritan zealot with pasty cheeks heavylidded eyes and the short ragged hair that had earned him and all his followers the sobriquet of roundhead he had finally executed the king england belonged to cromwell and his puritan parliament now every square inch calvert glanced back at the declaration now lying next to his sheathed sword and its wide shoulder strap england might belong to parliament he told himself but the americas clearly didnt the tone of the document revealed a stripe of independence of courage he could not help admiring and now to appease cromwell ive got to bludgeon them into submission may god help me the admiral of the fleet was a short stocky lincolnshire man who wore the obligatory ensemble of englands new puritan leadership black doublet with wide white collar and cuffs a trim line of gray hair circled his bald pate and his face was dominated by a heavy nose too large for his sagging cheeks in the dull light of the lantern his thin goatee and moustache looked like a growth of pale foliage against his sallow skin his father george calvert had once held office in the court of king charles and for that reason he had himself many years past received a knighthood from the monarch but edmond calvert had gone to sea early had risen through merit and had never supported the king in fact he was one of the few captains who kept his ship loyal to parliament when the navy defected to the side of charles during the war in recognition of that he had been given charge of transporting cromwells army to ireland to suppress the rebellion there and he bore the unmistakably resigned air of a man weary of wars and fighting the voyage out had been hard for him as well as for the men and already he longed to have its business over and done to settle down to a table covered not with contentious proclamations but spilling over with rabbit pies blood puddings honeyed ham alas it would not soon be not from the sound of the islands declaration he lowered the wick of the lantern darkening the shadows across the center table of the great cabin and carefully rolled the document back into a scroll then he rose and moved toward the shattered windows of the stern to catch a last look at the island before it was mantled in the quick tropical night as he strode across the wide flooringplanks of the cabin he carefully avoided the remaining shards of glass mingled with gilded splinters that lay strewn near the windows since all ablebodied seamen were still needed to man the pumps and patch the hull along the waterline he had prudently postponed the repairs of his own quarters as he looked about the cabin he reminded himself how lucky he was to have been on the quarterdeck away from the flying splinters when the shelling began the first volley from the point had scored five direct hits along the portside one english seaman had been killed outright and eleven others wounded some gravely with time only for one answering round he had exposed the rainbowe s stern to a second volley from the breastwork on the point while bringing her about and making for open sea that had slammed into the ships gilded poop destroying the ornate quartergallery just aft of the great cabin together with all the leaded glass windows the island was considerably better prepared than he had been led to believe lord cromwell he found himself thinking will not be pleased when he learns of the wanton damage barbados rebels have wreaked on the finest frigate in the english navy through the ragged opening he could look out unobstructed onto the rising swells of the caribbean a storm was brewing out to sea to add to the political storm already underway on the island high dark thunderheads had risen up in the south and already spatters of heavy tropical rain ricocheted off the shattered railing of the quartergallery the very air seemed to almost drip with wetness he inhaled deeply and asked himself again why he had agreed to come out to the americas he might just as easily have retired his command and stayed home he had earned the rest edmond calvert had served the puritan side in the war faithfully for a decade and over the past five years he had been at the forefront of the fighting in reward he had been granted the command of the boldest english military campaign in history oliver cromwell was nothing if not audacious having executed the king he had now conceived a grand assault on spains lands in the new world the plan was still secret code named western design its purpose nothing less than the seizure of spains richest holdings barbados with its new sugar wealth would someday be merely a small part of englands new empire in the americas envisioned by cromwell as reaching from massachusetts to mexico to brazil but first there was the small matter of bringing the existing settlements in the americas back into step he had never been sure he had the stomach for the task now after realizing the difficulties that lay ahead in subduing this one small island he questioned whether he wanted any part of it he swabbed his brow clammy in the sweltering heat and wondered if all the islands of the caribbees were like this doubtless as bad or worse he told himself in dismay he had seen and experienced barbados only for a day but already he had concluded it was a place of fierce sun and halftamed forest hot and miserable its very air almost a smoky green there was little sign among the thatchedroof shacks along the shore of its reputed great wealth could it be the stories at home were gross exaggerations or deliberate lies it scarcely mattered now barbados had to be reclaimed there was no option on his left lay the green hills of the island all but obscured in sudden sheets of rain on his right the line of english warships he had ordered positioned about the perimeter of carlisle bay cannons run out and primed he had stationed them there in readiness at midmorning then the siege set he had summoned his vice admiral and the other commanders to a council on board the rainbowe they had dined on the last remaining capons and drawn up the terms of surrender to be sent ashore by longboat the island was imprisoned and isolated its capitulation they told each other was merely a matter of time except that time would work against the fleet too he reminded himself half those aboard were landsmen a thrown together infantry assembled by cromwell and the spaces below decks were already fetid packed with men too sick and scurvyravished to stir every day more bodies were consigned to the sea if the island could not be made to surrender in a fortnight two at most he might have few men left with the strength to fight the declaration told him he could forget his dream of an easy surrender yet he didnt have the men and arms for a frontal assault he knew it and he wondered how long it would take the islanders to suspect it as well he had brought a force of some eight hundred men but now half of them were sick and useless while the island had a free population of over twenty thousand and a militia said to be nearly seven thousand worst of all they appeared to have firstrate gunners manning their shore emplacements barbados could not be recovered by strength of arms it could only be frightened or lured back into the hands of england a knock sounded on the cabin door and he gruffly called permission to enter moments later the shadow moving toward him became james powlett the young vice admiral of the fleet your servant sir powlett removed his hat and brushed at its white plume as he strode gingerly through the cabin picking his way around the glass he was tall cleanshaven with hard blue eyes that never quite concealed his ambition from the start he had made it no secret he judged edmond calvert too indecisive for the job at hand has the reply come yet i heard the rebels sent out a longboat with a packet aye theyve replied but i warrant the tunell not be to your liking calvert gestured toward the declaration on the table as he studied powlett concerned how long he could restrain the vice admirals hot blood with cool reason theyve chosen to defy the rule of parliament and theyve denounced the navigation acts claiming they refuse to halt their trade with the dutchmen then weve no course but to show them how royalist rebels are treated is that what youd have us do the admiral turned back to the window and stared at the rainswept bay and how many men do you think we could set ashore now three hundred four thats all wed be able to muster whore still strong enough to lift a musket or a pike whilst the islands militia lies in wait for usgod knows how many thousandmen used to this miserable heat and likely plump as partridges whatever we can muster ill warrant itll be enough theyre raw planters not soldiers powlett glanced at the declaration and decided to read it later there were two kinds of men in the world he often asserted those who dallied and discussed and those who acted we should ready an operation for tomorrow morning and have done with letters and declarations all we need do is stage a diversion here in the harbor then set men ashore up the coast at jamestown calvert tugged at his wisp of a goatee and wondered momentarily how he could most diplomatically advise powlett he was a hotheaded fool then he decided to dispense with diplomacy those raw planters as youd have them managed to hole this flagship five times from their battery up there on the point so what makes you think they couldnt just as readily turn back an invasion and if they did what then sir he watched powletts face harden but he continued i can imagine no quicker way to jeopardize what little advantage we might have and that advantage sir is they still dont know how weak we really are weve got to conserve our strength and try to organize our support on the island we need to make contact with any here whod support parliament and have them join with us when we land the question now he thought ruefully is how much support we actually have sir edmond calvert never having been convinced that beheading the lawful sovereign of england would be prudent had opposed it from the start events appeared to have shown him right alive king charles had been reviled the length of the land for his arrogance and his papist sympathies dead youd think him a sovereign the equal of elizabeth given the way people suddenly began eulogizing him that very same day his execution had made him a martyr and if royalist sentiment was swelling in england in the wake of his death how much more might there be here in the americasnow flooded with refugees loyal to the monarchy he watched his secondincommand slowly redden with anger as he continued i tell you we can only reclaim this island if its divided our job now sir is to reason first and only then resort to arms we have to make them see their interests lie with the future england can provide well sir if youd choose that tack then you can set it to the test quick enough what about those men whove been swimming out to the ships all day offering to be part of the invasion id call that support aye it gave me hope at first then i talked with some of them and learned theyre mostly indentured servants they claimed a rumors going round the island that were here to set them free for all they care we could as well be spaniards calvert sighed i asked some of them about defenses on the island and learned nothing i didnt already know so i sent them back ashore one and all what we need now are fresh provisions not more mouths to feed thats the biggest question he told himself again wholl be starved out first a blockaded island or a fleet of ships with scarcely enough victuals to last out another fortnight he turned back to the table reached for the declaration and shoved it toward powlett i think youd do well to peruse this sir theres a tone of defiance here thats unsettling i dont know if its genuine or a bluff its the unknowns that trouble me now the damned uncertainties those uncertainties he found himself thinking went far beyond barbados according to the first steps of cromwells plan after this centerpiece of the caribbees had been subdued part of the fleet was to continue on to any other of the settlements that remained defiant but cromwells advisors felt that would probably not be necessary after barbados acknowledged the commonwealth the rest of the colonies were expected to follow suit then the western design could be set into motion with calverts shipboard infantry augmented by fighting men from the island the trouble with cromwells scheme he now realized was that it worked both ways if barbados succeeded in defying englands new government then virginia bermuda the other islands of the caribbees all might also disown the commonwealth there even was talk they might try attaching themselves to holland it would be the end of english taxes and trade anywhere in the americas except for that scrawny settlement of fanatic puritans up in new england there would surely be no hope for the western design to succeed and edmond calvert would be remembered as the man who lost englands richest lands while powlett studied the declaration skepticism growing on his face calvert turned back to the window and stared at the rainswept harbor where a line of dutch merchant fluyts bobbed at anchor good god thats the answer maybe we cant land infantry but we most assuredly can go in and take those damned dutchmen and their cargo theyre bound to have provisions aboard its our best hope for keeping up the blockade and taking them will serve another purpose too itll send the commonwealths message loud and clear to all hollands merchants that trade in english settlements is for england theres presumption here sir that begs for a reply the vice admiral tossed the declaration back onto the table i still say the fittest answer is with powder and shot theres been enough paper sent ashore already im still in command mr powlett whether you choose to approve or no therell be no more ordnance used till were sure theres no other way he walked back to the table and slumped wearily into his chair already waiting in front of him were paper and an inkwell what he asked himself would he write how could he describe the bright new future that awaited a full partnership between england and these american settlers the colonies in the caribbees and along the atlantic seaboard were merely englands first foothold in the new world someday they would be part of a vast empire stretching the length of the americas the holdings of spain would fall soon and after that england would likely declare war against holland and take over dutch holdings as well there was already talk of that in london the future was rich and wide and english i just have to make them see the future a future of partnership not defiance one thatll bring wealth to england and prosperity to her colonies they have to be made to understand that this declaration is the first and last thatll ever be penned in the americas he turned and dismissed powlett with a stiff nod then he listened a moment longer to the drumbeat of tropical rain on the deck above it sounded wild now uncontrollable just like the spirits of nature he sensed lurking above the brooding land mass off his portside bow would this dark lush island of the caribbees harken to reason or would it foolishly choose to destroy itself with war he sighed in frustration inked his quill and leaned forward to write the assembly room was crowded to capacity its dense humid air rank with sweating bodies above the roar of wind and rain against the shutters arguments sounded the length of the long oak table seated down one side and around the end were the twentytwo members of the assembly across from them were the twelve members of the council at the back of the room milled others who had been invited winston was there along with anthony walrond and katherine dalby bedford was standing by the window holding open the shutters and squinting through the rainswept dusk as he studied the mast lights of the warships encircling the harbor he wiped the rain and sweat from his face with a large handkerchief then turned and walked back to his chair at the head of the table enough gentlemen weve all heard it already he waved his hand for quiet let me try and sum up our declaration has been delivered which means weve formally rejected all their terms as they now stand the question before us tonight is whether we try and see if theres room for negotiation or whether we refuse a compromise and finish preparing to meet an invasion katherine listened to the words and sensed his uneasiness she knew what his real worries were how long would it be before the awkward peace between the council and the assembly fell apart in squabbling what terms could the admiral of the fleet offer that would split the island giving enough of the planters an advantage that they would betray the rest who would be the first to waver the opening terms sent ashore by edmond calvert had sent a shock wave across barbadosits standing assembly and council were both to be dissolved immediately in future englands new world settlements would be governed through parliament a powerless new council would be appointed from london and the assembly equally impotent would eventually be filled by new elections scheduled at the pleasure of commons added to that were the new navigation acts bringing high english prices and shipping fees the suddenly ripening plum of the americas would be plucked the terms signed by the admiral had been ferried ashore by longboat and delivered directly to dalby bedford at the compound members of council and the assembly had already been gathering in the assembly room by then anxious to hear the conditions read katherine remembered the worry on the governors face as he had finished dressing to go down and read the fleets ultimatum the first thing i have to do is get them to agree on something anything if they start quarreling again were good as lost then try to avoid the question of recognizing parliament shed watched him search for his plumed hat and rose to fetch it from the corner stand by the door i suspect most of the council would be tempted to give in and do that on the idea it might postpone a fight and give them time to finish this years sugar while they appeal to parliament to soften the terms aye the sugars all they care about thats why i think we best go at it backwards hed reached for his cane and tested it thoughtfully against the wide boards of the floor i think ill start by raising that business in the navigation acts about not letting the dutchmen trade not a man in the roomll agree to that not even the council ill have them vote to reject those then see if thatll bring us enough unity to proceed to the next step just as he had predicted the council and the assembly had voted unanimously to defy the new navigation acts they could never endure an english stranglehold on island commerce regardless of the other consequences they had immediately drafted their own reply to the admirals terms a declaration denouncing them and refusing to comply and sent it back to the fleet the question left unresolved to await this evenings session was whether they should agree to negotiate with parliament at all i say theres nothing to negotiate benjamin briggs rose to his feet and faced the candlelit room if we agreed to talk itd be the same as recognizing parliament are you saying the councils decided to oppose recognition bedford examined him in surprise perhaps the business about dissolving the council had finally made an impression after all unalterably sir weve talked it over and were beginning to think this idea of independence that came up a while back could have some merit briggs gazed around the room ill grant i was of a different mind before we heard the terms but now i say we stand firm if we bow to the rule of parliament where weve got no representation well never be rid of these navigation acts and thats the end of free trade free markets wed as well be slaves ourselves he pushed back his black hat revealing a leathery brow furrowed by the strain ill wager virginia will stand with us when their time comes but the fleets been sent here first so for now well have to carry the burden of resistance ourselves and so be it speaking for the council you know weve already ordered our militia out theyre to stay mustered till this things finished wed have the rest of the islands militia called up now those men controlled by the assembly and have them on the beaches by daybreak dalby bedford looked down the line of faces and knew he had gained the first step the council was with him but now he wondered suddenly what about the assembly as an interim measure eight hundred men had already been posted along the western and southern shorelines militia from the regiments commanded by the members of the council the small freeholders had not yet mustered many of the men with fiveacre plots were already voicing reservations about entering an allout war with england especially when its main purpose seemed to be preserving free markets for the big plantation owners sugar i think its time we talked about cavalry nicholas whittington joined in wiping his beard as he lifted his voice above the din of wind and rain id say theres apt to be at least four hundred horses on the island that we could pull together he glared pointedly across the table at the assemblymen brownfaced men in tattered waistcoats that means every horse in every parish we have to make a show of force if were to negotiate from strength i propose we make an accounting parish by parish any man with a nag who fails to bring it up for muster should be hanged for treason as she watched the members of the assembly start to mumble uneasily katherine realized that a horse represented a sizable investment for most small freeholders how much use would they be anyway she found herself wondering the horses on the island were mostly for pulling plows and the cavalry riding them would be farmers with rusty pikes as the arguing in the room continued she found herself thinking about hugh winston the sight of him firing down on the english navy through the mists of dawn had erased all her previous contempt never before had she seen a man so resolute she remembered again the way he had taken her arm there at the last why had he done it she turned to study him his lined face still smeared with oily traces of powder smoke and told herself they were a matched pair she had determination too hed soon realize that even if he didnt now at the moment he was deep in a private conference with johan ruyters who had asked to be present to speak for dutch trading interests the two of them had worked together all day through the sultry heat that always preceded a storm winston and his men had helped heave the heavy dutch guns onto makeshift barges and ferry them ashore to be moved up the coast with oxdrawn wagons now he looked bone tired she could almost feel the ache he must have in his back as she stood studying winston her thoughts wandered again to anthony he had worked all day too riding along the shore and reviewing the militia deployed to defend key points along the coast what was this sudden ambivalence she felt toward him he was tall like winston and altogether quite handsome more handsome by half than hugh winston come to that no it was something about winstons manner that excited her more than anthony did he was yes he was dangerous she laughed to realize she could find that appealing it violated all the common sense shed so carefully cultivated over the years again she found herself wondering what hed be like as a lover and sir what then after weve offered up our horses and our muskets and servants for your militia one of the members of the assembly suddenly rose and faced the council it was john russell a tall rawboned freeholder who held fifteen acres on the north side whos to protect our wives and families after that he paused nervously to clear his throat and peered down the table to be frank gentlemen were beginning to grow fearful of all these africans that certain of youve bought and settled here now with every white man on the island mustered and on the coast together with all our horses and our muskets well not have any way to defend our own if these new slaves decide to stage a revolt and dont say it cant happen remember that rising amongst the indentures two years ago though we promptly hanged a dozen of the instigators and brought an end to it weve taught no such lesson to these blacks if they were to start something say in the hills up in midisland wed be hard pressed to stop them from slaughtering who they wished with those cane knives they use he received supportive nods from several other assemblymen wed be leaving ourselves defenseless if we mustered every ablebodied man and horse down onto the shore if thats all thats troubling you then you can ease your minds briggs pushed back his hat and smiled all the blacksve been confined to quarters to the man for the duration besides theyre scattered over the island so theres no way they can organize anything theres no call for alarm i give you my solemn word theyre unarmed now and docile as lambs but what about those cane knives we see them carrying in the fields those have all been collected the africansve got no weapons theres nothing they can do save beat on drums which seems to keep them occupied more and more lately anyhow he looked around the room pleased to see that the reassuring tone in his voice was having the desired effect i think wed best put our heads to more pressing matters such as the condition of the breastworks here and along the coasts he turned toward winston youve not had much to say tonight sir concerning todays work i for one would welcome a word on the condition of our ordnance all eyes at the table shifted to winston now standing by the window and holding a shutter pried open to watch as the winds and rain bent the tops of the tall palms outside slowly he turned his lanky form seeming to lengthen and surveyed the room his eyes told katherine he was worried shed begun to know his moods the ordnance lent by the dutchmen is in place now he thumbed at ruyters for which id say a round of thanks is overdue hear hear the planters voices chorused and ruyters nodded his acknowledgement then he whispered something quickly to winston and disappeared out the door into the rain the seaman waited watching him go then continued youve got gunnerssome my men and some yoursassigned now at the point as well as at jamestown and over at oistins bay i figure theres nowhere else they can try a landing in force though they always might try slipping a few men ashore with longboats somewhere along the coast thats why youve got to keep the militia out and ready but if they do try landing in some spot where weve got no cannon what then sir briggs voice projected above the howl of the storm youve got ordnance in all the locations where they can safely put in with a frigate any other spot would mean a slow dangerous approach but if they try it your militia should be able to meet them at the waters edge and turn them back that is if you can keep your men mustered he straightened his pistols and pulled his cloak about him now if its all the same i think ill leave you to your deliberations ive finished what it was id offered to do one moment captain if you please anthony walrond stepped in front of him as the crowd began to part i think youve done considerably more than you proposed unless it included basely betraying the island winston stopped and looked at him im tired enough to let that pass are you indeed sir walrond turned toward the table we havent yet thanked captain winston for his other service that being whilst he was making a show of helping deploy the dutchmens ordnance he ordered a good fifty of his new men those irish indentures hes taken to swim out to the ships of the fleet and offer their services to the roundheads he turned to the room it was base treachery and reason enough for a hempen collar if more was required you sir can go straight to hell winston turned and started pushing through the planters angrily proceeding toward the door katherine stared at him disbelieving before he could reach the exit she elbowed her way through the crowd and confronted him is what he said true he pushed back his hair and looked down at her its really not your concern miss bedford then youve much to explain if not to me to the men in this room i didnt come down here tonight to start explaining he gestured toward the door if you want to hear about it then why not call in some of the men who swam out to the ships theyre back now and theyre outside in the rain or were im sure theyll be pleased to confess the full details i have no intention of responding to master walronds inquisition then we most certainly will call them in she pushed her way briskly to the doorway outside a crowd of indentures stood huddled in the sheets of rain timothy farrell who had appointed himself leader was by the door waiting for winston the planters watched as katherine motioned him in he stepped uncertainly through the doorway bowing and then he removed his straw hat deferentially can i be of service to yor ladyship you can explain yourself sir she seized his arm and escorted him to the head of the table is it true captain winston ordered you and those men out there to swim out to the ships and offer to consort with their forces we wasnt offerin to consort beggin yor ladyships pardon not at all thats not our inclination as im a christian farrell grinned no by the holy virgin what we did was offer to help them he glanced toward winston puzzling an whilst they were mullin that over we got a good look below decks an like i reported to his worship id say theyve not got provision left to last moren a fortnight an a good half the men sailin with them are so rotted with scurvy theyd be pressed to carry a halfpike across this room aye between decks theyre all cursin the admiral an sayin hes brought em out here to starve in the middle o this plagued suncooked wilderness she turned slowly toward winston you sent these men out as spies who else were we going to send he started again toward the door well you could have told us sir so some of the puritan sympathizers on this island could have swum out after them and seen to it that my men were shot or hanged from a yardarm pox on it but this changes everything briggs interjected his face flooding with pleasure this mans saying the fleets not got the force to try a landing you only believe half of what you hear winston paused to look around the room even if its true it probably just means theyll have to attack sooner before their supplies get lower and they lose even more men he pushed on toward the door desperate men do desperate things therell be an attempt on the island you can count on it and youll fight best if youre desperate too suddenly he stopped again and glanced back at briggs by the way i dont know exactly who your speech on the docile slaves was intended to fool your africans just may have some plans afoot i doubt they care overmuch who wins this war you or cromwell so look to it and good night he turned and gestured for farrell to follow as he walked out into the blowing night rain katherine watched him leave recoiling once more against his insolence or maybe admiring him for it she moved quickly through the milling crowd to the side of dalby bedford bent over and whispered something to him then turned and slipped out the door the burst of rain struck her in the face and the wind blew her hair across her eyes winston had already started off down the hill the crowd of indentures trailing after like puppy dogs she found herself thinking he certainly has a way with his men she caught up her long skirts and pushed through the crowd their straw hats and shoes now bedraggled by the downpour captain i suppose we owe you an apology and ive come to offer it she finally reached his side no one else thought of having some men swim out to spy on the fleet katherine no one else in there has thought of a lot of things theyre too busy arguing about who can spare a draft horse what do you mean she looked up thought of what first they should be offloading whats left of the food and supplies on those dutch merchantmen blockaded in the bay ruyters agreed just now to put his men on it tonight but im afraid its too late he stared through the rain toward the bay something tells me the fleets likely to move in tomorrow and commandeer whatever ships they can get their hands on its exactly what any good commander would do he continued bitterly therere enough supplies on those merchantmen flour and dried corn to feed the island for weeks particularly on the ships that made port the last few days and havent finished unlading believe me youre going to need it unless you expect to start living on sugar cane and horsemeat but this islands too busy fighting with itself right now to listen to anybody he turned and headed on through the cluster of indentures im going down to try and offload my own supplies tonight before its too late she seized her skirts and pushed after him well i still want to thank you hugh for what youve done for us he met her gaze smiled through the rain and raised his hand to stop her wait a minute before you go any furtherand maybe say something foolishyoud better know im not doing it for your little island of barbados but youre helping us fight to stay a free state if we can stand up to the fleet then we can secure home rule the first in the americas after us maybe virginia will do the same who knows then some of the other settlements will probably a free state he seemed to snort free for who these greedy planters nobody else herell be free he pulled his cloak tighter about him just so youll understand let me assure you im not fighting to help make barbados anything im just trying to make sure i keep my frigate besides barbadosll never be free to use that word you seem to like so much the most thatll ever happen here is itll change masters look around you its going to be a settlement of slaves and slaveholders forever owned and squeezed by a council or a parliament or a king or a somebody from now on youre wrong why did he try so hard to be infuriating home rule here is just a start someday therell be no more indentures and who knows maybe one day theyll even decide to let the slaves be free she wanted to grab him and shake him he was so shortsighted you just refuse to try and understand isnt there anything you care about i care about living life my own way it may not sound like much of a cause but its taken me long enough to get around to it ive given up thinking that one day ill go back home and work for the honor of the winston name or settle down and grow fat on some sugar plantation in the caribbees he turned on her almost shouting against the storm let me tell you something im through living by somebody elses rules right now i just want to get out out to a place ill make for myself so if getting there means i first have to fight alongside the likes of briggs and walrond to escape barbados then thats what itll be and when i fight make no mistake i dont plan to lose thats quite a speech how long have you been practicing it she seized his arm and the point i take it is that you like to run away from difficulties thats exactly right and i wish youd be good enough to have a brief word with the admiral of the fleet out there about it he was smiling again his face almost impish in the rain tell him theres a wellknown american smuggler whod be pleased to sail out of here if hed just open up the blockade for an hour or so well why not ask him yourself he might be relieved if only to be rid of you and your gunners she waited till a roll of thunder died away and after youve sailed away what then i plan to make my own way just as i said im heading west by northwest to maybe turn around a few things here in the caribbean but right now ive got more pressing matters namely keeping my provisions and those of the dutchmen out of the hands of the fleet he turned and continued toward the shore a dim expanse of sand shrouded in dark and rain so youd best go on back to the assembly room katherine unless you plan to gather up those petticoats and lend me a hand perhaps i just will she caught up with him matching his stride what since you think im so useless you might be surprised to know i can carry tubs of hollander cheese as well as you can she was holding her skirts out of the mud why shouldnt i we both want the same thing to starve the roundheads we just want it for different reasons its no place for a woman down here you said that to me once before when we were going out to briggs sugarworks frankly im a little weary of hearing it so why dont you find another excuse to try telling me what to do he stopped and looked down again waves of rain battered against the creases in his face all right katherine or katy as ive heard your father call you if you want to help then come on but youve got to get into some breeches if you dont want to drown his dour expression melted into a smile ill try and find you a pair on the defiance itll be a long nights work you can tell everyone im one of your seamen or one of the indentures he looked down at her bodice and exploded with laughter i dont think anybodys apt to mistake you for one of them but hadnt you best tell somebody where youll be what i do is my own business she looked past him toward the shore so be it a long fork of lightning burst across the sky illuminating the shoreline ahead of them the muddy road was leveling out now as they neared the bay the ruts which ran like tiny rapids down the hill had become placid streams curving their way seaward ahead the mast lanterns of the dutch merchantmen swayed arcs through the dark and the silhouettes of dutch seamen milled along the shore their voices muffled ghostlike in the rain then she noticed the squat form of johan ruyters trudging toward them pox on it we cant unlade in this squall and in the dark besides theres doubtless a storm brewing out there maybe even a huracan from the looks of the swell he paused to nod at katherine your servant madam then he turned back at winston theres little we can do now on my honor well ill tell you one thing you can do if youve got the brass and what might that be sir just run all the ships aground here along the shore that way they cant be taken and then we can unlade after the storm runs its course aye thats a possibility id considered in truth im thinking i might give it a try the zeelanders been aground before her keels fine oak for all the barnacles his voice was heavy with rue but ive asked around and most of the other men dont want to run the risk well youre right about the squall from the looks of the sea id agree we cant work in this weather so maybe ill just go ahead and run the defiance aground he studied the ship now rolling in the swell and straining at her anchor lines therell never be a better time with the bay up the way it is now gods blood its a quandary ruyters turned and peered toward the horizon the mast lights of the fleet were all but lost in the sheets of rain i wish i knew what those bastards are thinking right now but its odds theyll try to move in and pilfer our provisions as soon as the sea lets up moreover wed be fools to try using any ordnance on them bottled in the way we are theyve got us trapped since they surely know the battery up there on the point wont open fire on the bay while were in it he whirled on winston you wouldnt would you and risk putting a round through the side of these ships here not a chance aye theyll reason that out by tomorrow no doubt so grounding these frigates may be the only way we can keep them out of english hands damn it all id best go ahead and bring her up before the seas get any worse he bowed toward katherine your most obedient madam if youll be good enough to grant me leave now dont try anything foolish winston was eyeing him what are you suggesting dont go thinking youll make a run for it in the storm youll never steer past the reefs aye ive given that passing thought as well if i had a bit more ballast id be tempted he spat into the rain then looked back and id take odds youve considered the same but ive not got the ballast either or that spaniard of yours we agreed on dont forget our bargain my words always been my bond sir though i wonder if therell ever be any sugar to ship for that matter you may be lucky ever to see open seas again yourself just like the rest of us ruyters sighed aye every christian here tonights wishing hed never heard of barbados he nodded farewell and turned to wade toward a waiting longboat in moments he had disappeared into the rain well miss katy bedford unless the rest of the dutchmen have the foresight ruyters has those merchantmen out there and all their provisions will be in the fleets hands by sundown tomorrow he reached for her arm but not the defiance come on and ill get you a set of dry clothes and maybe a tankard of sack to warm you up were about to go on a very short and very rough voyage she watched as he walked to where the indentures were waiting he seemed to be ordering them to find shelter and return in the morning timothy farrell spoke something in return winston paused a moment shrugged and rummaged his pockets then handed him a few coins the irishmen all saluted before heading off toward the cluster of taverns over next to the bridge come on he came trudging back the longboats moored down here if it hasnt been washed out to sea yet wherere your men my gunnery mates are at the batteries and the rest of the lads are assigned to the militia i ordered john and a few of the boys to stay on board to keep an eye on her but the rest are gone his face seemed drawn have no fear in this sea itll be no trick to ground her once we weigh the anchor the swell should do the rest as he led her into the water the surf splashing against her shins she reflected that the salt would ruin her taffeta petticoats then decided she didnt care the thrill of the night and the sea were worth it directly ahead of them a small longboat bobbed in the water grab your skirts and ill hoist you in she had barely managed to seize the sides of her dress before a wave washed over them both she was still sputtering salt in her mouth as he swept her up into his arms and settled her over the side she gasped as the boat dipped crazily in the swell pounded by the sheets of rain he traced the mooring line back to the post at the shore where it had been tied and quickly loosened it then he shoved the boat out to sea and rolled over the side as easily as though he were dropping into a hammock the winds lashed rain against them as he strained at the oars but slowly they made way toward the dark bulk of the defiance he rowed into the leeward side and in moments john mewes was there reaching for the line to draw them alongside he examined katherine with a puzzled expression as he gazed down at them tis quite a night mlady by my life he reached to take her hand as winston hoisted her up welcome aboard no time for godfearin folk to be at sea in a longboat that ill warrant that its not john winston grasped a deadeye and drew himself over the side call the lads to station after i take miss bedford back to the cabin and find a dry change of clothes for her were going to weigh anchor and try beaching the ship aye mewes beamed as he squinted through the rain in truth ive been thinkin the same myself the fomicatin roundheadsll be in the bay and aimin to take prizes soon as the weather breaks he headed toward the quarterdeck but theyll never get this beauty god is my witness try hoisting the spritsail john and see if you can bring the bow about he took katherines hand as he helped her duck under the shrouds this way katy what do you have for me to wear she steadied herself against a railing as the slippery deck heaved in the waves but winston urged her forward he was still gripping her hand as he led her into the companionway a dark hallway beneath the quarterdeck illuminated by a single lantern swaying in the gusts of wind we dont regularly sail with women in the crew his words were almost lost in a clap of thunder as he shoved open the door of the great cabin what would you say to some of my breeches and a doublet what would you say to it he laughed and swept the dripping hair out of his eyes as he ushered her in id say i prefer seeing women in dresses but well both have to make do he walked to his locker seeming not to notice the roll of the ship and flipped open the lid take your pick while i go topside he gestured toward the sideboard and theres port and some tankards in there howll i loosen my bodice send for your maid as always there was a scream of wind down the companionway as he wrenched open the door then slammed it again behind him she was still grasping the table trying to steady herself against the roll of the ship when she heard muffled shouts from the decks above and then the rattle of a chain she reached back and began to work at the knot in the long laces that secured her bodice english fashions which she found absurd in sweltering barbados required all women of condition to wear this heavy corset which laced all the way up the back over their shift this morning it had been two layers of whitest linen with strips of whalebone sewn between and dainty puffed sleeves attached but now it was soaked with salt water and brown from the sand and flotsam of the bay she tugged and wriggled until it was loose enough to draw over her head she drew a breath of relief as her breasts came free beneath her shift and then she wadded the bodice into a soggy bundle and discarded it onto the floor of the cabin her wet shift still clung to her and she looked down for a moment taking pleasure in the full curve of her body next she began unpinning her skirt at the spot where it had been looped up stylishly to display her petticoat the ship rolled again and the lid of the locker dropped shut as the floor tilted back to an even keel she quickly stepped out of the soaking dress and petticoats letting them collapse onto the planking in a dripping heap in the light of the swinging lamp the onceblue taffeta looked a muddy gray the ship suddenly pitched backward followed by a low groan that sounded through the timbers as it shuddered to a dead stop the floor of the cabin lay at a tilt sloping down toward the stern she stepped to the locker and pried the lid back open inside were several changes of canvas breeches as well as a fine striped silk pair she laughed as she pulled them out to inspect them in the flickering light what would he say if i were to put these on she wondered theyre doubtless part of his vain pride without hesitating she shook out the legs and drew them on under her wet shift there was no mirror but as she tied the waiststring she felt their sensuous snugness about her thighs the legs were short intended to fit into hose or boots and they revealed her fine turn of ankle next she lifted out a velvet doublet blue and embroidered with gold buttons down the front she admired it a moment mildly surprised that he would own such a fine garment then laid it on the table while she pulled her dripping shift over her head the rush of air against her skin made her suddenly aware how hot and sultry the cabin really was impulsively she walked back to the windows aft and unlatched them outside the sea churned and pounded against the stern while dark rain still beat against the quartergallery she took a deep breath as she felt the cooling breeze wash over her clammy face and breasts she was wondering how her hair must look when she heard a voice you forgot your port she gasped quietly as she turned hugh winston was standing beside her holding out a tankard well do you care to take it he smiled and glanced down at her breasts my but that was no time at all she reached for the tankard then looked back toward the table where her wet shift lay grounding a ships no trick you just weigh the anchor and pray she comes about getting her afloat agains the difficulty he leaned against the window frame and lifted his tankard so heres to freedom again someday katy mine yours she started to drink then remembered herself and turned toward the table to retrieve her shift i dont expect youll be needing that she continued purposefully across the cabin well sir i didnt expect oh dont start now being a coquette i like you too much the way you are a stroke of lightning split down the sky behind him he drank again then set down his tankard and was moving toward her im not sure i know what you mean take it as a compliment i despise intriguing women he seemed to look through her though you do always manage to get whatever youre after one way or other going about it your own way a clap of thunder sounded through the open stern windows id also wager youve had your share of experience in certain personal matters for which i suppose theres your royalist gallant to thank thats scarcely your concern is it youve no claim over me she settled her tankard on the table reached for his velvet doubletat least it was dryand started draping it over her bare shoulders nor am i sure i relish bluntness as much as you appear to its my fashion ive been out in the caribbees too long dodging musket balls to bother with a lot of fancy court chatter theres bluntness and theres good breeding i trust you at least havent forgotten the difference i suppose you think you can enlighten me well since im wearing your breeches which appear meant for a gentleman perhaps itd not be amiss to teach you how to address a lady she stepped next to him her eyes mischievous try repeating after me yours is a comely shape madam on my life that delights my very heart and your fine visage might shame a cherubim she suppressed a smile at his dumbfounded look then continued those eyes fire my thoughts with promised sweetness and those lips are like petals of the rose gods blood he caught her open doublet and drew her toward him if its a fop youd have me be i suppose the rest could probably go something like begging to be kissed they seem fine and soft are they kind as well he slipped his arms about her and pulled her against his wet jerkin after the first shock she realized he tasted of salt and gunpowder as a sudden gust of rain from the window extinguished the sea lamp she felt herself being slowly lowered against the heavy oak table in the center of the cabin now his mouth had moved to her breasts as he halfkissed halfbit her nippleswhether in desire or merely to tease she could not tell finally she reached and drew his face up to hers im not in love with you captain winston never expect that i could never give any man that power over me she laughed at his startled eyes but i wouldnt mind if you wanted me katy ive wanted you for a fortnight he drew back and looked at her i had half a mind not to let you away from this ship the last time you were here this time i dont plan to make the same mistake except i dont like seeing you in my own silk breeches i think they fit me very nicely maybe its time i showed you what i think he abruptly drew her up and seized the string at her waist in a single motion he pulled it open and slipped away the striped legs then he admired her a moment as he drew his hands appreciatively down her long legs now id like to show you how one man whos forgot his london manners pays court to a woman he pulled her to him and kissed her once more then without a word he slipped his arms under her and cradled her against him he carried her across the cabin to the window and gently seated her on its sill now the lightning flashed again shining against the scar on his cheek he lifted her legs and twined them around his shoulders bringing her against his mouth a glow of sensation blossomed somewhere within her as he began to tease her gently with his tongue she tightened her thighs around him astonished at the swell of pleasure the cabin was dissolving leaving nothing but a great consuming sensation that was engulfing her readying to flood her body as she arched expectantly against him he suddenly paused dont stop now she gazed at him her vision blurred he smiled as he drew back if you want lovemaking from me youll have to think of somebody besides yourself i want you to be with me katy bedford not ahead he rose up and slipped away his jerkin then his rough wet breeches he toyed with her sex bringing her wide in readiness then he entered her quickly and forcefully she heard a gasp and realized it was her own voice it was as though she had suddenly discovered some missing part of herself for an instant nothing else in the world existed she clasped her legs about his waist and moved against him returning his own intensity now the sensation was coming once more and she clung to him as she wrenched against his thighs all at once he shoved against her powerfully then again and she found herself wanting to thrust her body into his merge with him as he lunged against her one last time then the lightning flared and the cabin seemed to melt into white after a moment of quiet he wordlessly took her in his arms for the first time she noticed the rain and the salt spray from the window washing over them god knows the last thing i need now is a woman to think about he smiled and kissed her id probably be wise to pitch you out to sea this minute while i still have enough sense to do it but i dont think i will i wouldnt let you anyway im not going to let you so much as move you can just stay precisely where you are she gripped him tighter and pulled his lips down to hers if anything i should have done with you here and now then come on well go outside together he lifted her through the open stern window onto the quartergallery the skies were an open flood she looked at him and reached to gently caress his scarred cheek what was that you were doingat the first i never knew men did such things her hand traveled across his chest downward do do women ever do that too he laughed its not entirely unheard of in this day and age then you must show me how ill wager no puritan wife does it i didnt know you were a puritan you certainly dont make love like one im not i want to be as far from them as i can be her lips began to move down his chest then come away with me he smoothed her wet hair to jamaica jamaica she looked up at him in dismay my god what are you saying the spaniards ill manage the spaniards he reached down and kissed her again you know after this morning up on the point id almost believe you she paused and looked out at the line of warships on the horizon dull shadows in the rain but nobodys going to leave here for a long time now i will and the english navys not going to stop me he slipped his arms around her and drew her against him why not forget youre supposed to wed anthony walrond and come along were alike you and me hugh you know i cant leave she slid a leg over him and pressed her thigh against his but at least ive got you here tonight i think i already fancy this so lets not squander all our fine time with a lot of talk chapter nine ive changed my mind ill not be part of it serina pulled at his arm and realized she was shouting to make herself heard above the torrent around them in the west the lightning flared again take me back now directly ahead the wide thatched roof of the mill house loomed out of the darkness atiba seemed not to hear as he circled his arm about her waist and urged her forward a sheet of rain off the buildings eaves masked the doorway and he drew her against him to cover her head as they passed through inside the packed earthen floor was sheltered and dry the warmth of the room caused her misgivings to ebb momentarily the close darkness was like a protective cloak shielding them from the storm still the thought of what lay ahead filled her with dread the jesuit teachers years ago in brazil had warned you could lose your soul by joining in pagan african rituals though she didnt believe in the jesuits religion she still feared their warning she had never been part of a true yoruba ceremony for the gods she had only heard them described and that so long ago she had forgotten almost everything when atiba appeared at her window a dark figure in the storm and told her she must come with him she had at first refused outright in reply he had laughed lightly kissed her then whispered it was essential that she be present he did not say why instead he went on to declare that tonight was the perfect time no cane was being crushed the mill house was empty the oxen in their stalls the entire plantation staff ordered to quarters benjamin briggs and the other branco masters were assembled in bridgetown holding a council of war against the ingles ships that had appeared in the bay at sunrise when finally shed relented and agreed to come he had insisted she put on a white shiftthe whitest she hadsaying in a voice she scarcely recognized that tonight she must take special care with everything tonight she must be yoruba surely youre not afraid of lightning and thunder he finally spoke as he gestured for her to sit the false lightness still in his tone dont be it could be a sign from shango that he is with us tonight the heavens belong to him he turned and pointed toward the mill just as in this room near this powerful iron machine of the branco the earth is sacred to ogun thats why he will come tonight if we prepare a place for him she looked blankly at the mill although the rollers were brass the rest of the heavy framework was indeed iron the metal consecrated to ogun she remembered atiba telling her that when a yoruba swore an oath in the great palace of the oba in ife he placed his hand not on a bible but on a huge piece of iron shaped like a tear and weighing over three hundred pounds the very existence of yorubaland was ensured by iron oguns metal made possible swords tipped arrows muskets if no iron were readily at hand a yoruba would swear by the earth itself from whence came ore i wish you would leave your yoruba gods in africa where they belong how she asked herself could she have succumbed so readily to his preto delusions she realized now that the yoruba were still too few too powerless to revolt she wanted to tell him to forget his gods his fools dream of rebellion and freedom he glanced back at her and laughed but our gods our orisa are already here because our people are here he looked away his eyes hidden in the dark and waited for a roll of thunder to die away the wind dropped suddenly for an instant and there was silence except for the drumbeat of rain our gods live inside us passed down from generation to generation we inherit the spirit of our fathers just as we take on their strength their appearance whether we are free or slave they will never abandon us he touched her hand gently tonight at last perhaps you will begin to understand she stared at him relieved that the darkness hid the disbelief in her eyes she had never seen any god anywhere nor had anyone else his gods were not going to make him or her any less a slave to the branco she wanted to grab his broad shoulders and shake sense into him tonight was the first maybe the last time that briggs hall would be theirs alone why had he brought her here instead for some bizarre ceremony finally her frustration spilled out what if i told you i dont truly believe in your ogun and your shango and all the rest any more than i believe in the christian god and all his saints he lifted her face up but what if you experienced them yourself could you still deny they exist the christians claim their god created everything in the world again the anger flooding over her like the rain outside she wanted to taunt him if thats true maybe he created your gods too the christian god is nothing where is he where does he show himself our orisa create the world anew every day rework it change it right before our eyes thats how we know they are alive his gaze softened youll believe in our gods before tonight is over i promise you how can you be so sure because one of them is already living inside you i know the signs he stood back and examined her i think you are consecrated to a certain god very much like you which is as it should be he reached down and picked up a cloth sack he had brought as the lightning continued to flare through the open doorway he began to extract several long white candles finally he selected one and held it up then with an angry grunt pointed to the black rings painted around it at oneinch intervals do you recognize this its what the branco call a bidding candle did you know they used candles like this on the ship they sold a man each time the candle burned down to one of these rings i wanted ogun to see this tonight he struck a flint against a tinderbox then lit the candle shielding it from the wind till the wick was fully ablaze next he turned and stationed it on the floor near the base of the mill where it would be protected from the gale she watched the tip flicker in the wind throwing a pattern of light and shadow across his long cheek highlighting the three small parallel scars his eyes glistened in concentration as he dropped to his knees and retrieved a small bag from his waistband he opened it dipped in his hand and brought out a fistful of white powder then he moved to a smooth place on the floor and began to dribble the powder out of his fist creating a series of curved patterns on the ground what are you doing im preparing the symbol of ogun will drawings in the dirt lure your god he did not look up merely continued to lay down the lines of white powder letting a stream slip from his closed fist take care what you say i am consecrating this earth to ogun a yoruba god will not be mocked i have seen hunters return from an entire season in the forest emptyhanded because they scorned to make offerings i dont understand the christians say their god is in the sky where are these gods of africa supposed to be she was trying vainly to recall the stories her mother dara and the old babalawo of pernambuco had told but there was so much especially the part about africa that she had willed herself to forget first you claim they are already inside you and then you say they must come here from somewhere both things are true the orisa are in some ways like ordinary men and women he paused and looked up just as we are different each of them is also shango desires justicethough wrongs must be fairly punished he is humane ogun cares nothing for fairness he demands vengeance how do you know what these gods are supposed to want you dont have any sacred books like the christians perhaps the christians need their books we dont our gods are not something we study theyre what we are then why call them gods because they are a part of us we cannot reach except through them they dwell deep inside our selves in the spirit that all the yoruba peoples share he looked down and continued to lay out the drawing as he spoke but i cant describe it because it lies in a part of the mind that has no words he reached to take more of the white powder from the bag and shifted to a new position as he continued to fashion the diagram which seemed to be the outline of some kind of bush you see except for olorun the sky god all our orisa once dwelt on earth but instead of dying they became the communal memory of our people when we call forth one of the gods we reach into this shared consciousness where they wait if a god comes forth he may for a time take over the body of one of us as his temporary habitation he paused and looked up thats why i wanted you here tonight to show you what it means to be yoruba he straightened and critically surveyed the drawing his eyes revealed his satisfaction on the ground was a complex rendering of an african cotton tree the representingimage of ogun its trunk was flanked on each side by the outline of an elephant tusk another symbol of the yoruba god he circled it for a moment appraising it then went to the cache of sacred utensils he had hidden behind the mill that afternoon and took up a stack of palm fronds carefully he laid a row along each side of the diagram thats finished now next ill make the symbol for shango its simpler he knelt and quickly began to lay down the outline of a doubleheaded axe still using the white powder from the bag the lines were steady flawless she loved the lithe deft intensity of his body as he drew his sacred signsnothing like the grudging branco artists who had decorated the cathedral in pernambuco with catholic saints all the while halfdrunk on portuguese wine where did you learn all these figures he smiled ive had much practice but i was first taught by my father years ago in ife the drawing was already done he examined it a moment approved it and laid aside the bag of white powder she picked it up and took a pinch to her lips it had the tangy bitterness of cassava flour now ill prepare a candle for shango he rummaged through the pile but in a way its for you too so ill find a pure white one not a bidding candle what do you mean for me too he seemed not to hear as he lit the taper and placed it beside the symbol next he extracted a white kerchief from his waistband and turned to her ive brought something for you a gift here let me tie it he paused to caress her his fingertips against her cinnamon skin then he lovingly pulled the kerchief around her head he lifted up her long hair still wet from the rain and carefully coiled it under the white cloth finally he knotted it on top african style tonight you may discover you truly are a yoruba woman so it is well that you look like one abruptly above the patter of rain came the sound of footfalls in the mud outside she glanced around and through the dark saw the silhouettes of the yoruba men from the slave quarters the first three carried long bundles swathed in heavy brown wraps to protect them from the rain they entered single file and nodded in silence to atiba before gathering around the diagrams on the floor to bow in reverence after a moment the men carrying the bundles moved to a clear space beside the mill and began to unwrap them as the covering fell away the fresh goatskin tops of three new drums sparkled white in the candlelight she watched the drummers settle into position each nestling an instrument beneath his left arm a curved wooden mallet in his right hand from somewhere in her past there rose up an identical scene years ago in brazil when all the yoruba men and women had gathered to dance then as now there were three hourglassshaped instruments all held horizontally under the drummers arm as they were played the largest the iya ilu was almost three feet long and was held up by a wide shoulder strap just as this one was tonight the other two the bata and the gogo were progressively smaller and neither was heavy enough to require a supporting strap the man holding the iya ilu tonight was obewole his weathered coffee face rendered darker still by the contrast of a short grey beard his muscles were conditioned by decades of swinging a long iron sword in the fields he could wield a cane machete as powerfully as any young warrior he shifted the shoulder strap one last time then held out the mallet in readiness and looked toward atiba for a signal to begin when atiba gave a nod a powerful drum roll sounded above the roar of the gale then obewole began to talk with the drum a deeptoned invocation to the ceremonial high gods of the yoruba pantheon eleggua and olorun omi tutu a eleggua omi tutu a mi ileis olorun modu pue as the drum spoke directly to the gods the line of men passed by atiba and he sprinkled each with liquor from a calabash flinging droplets from his fingertips like shooting stars in the candlelight each man saluted him their babalawo by dropping their heads to the ground in front of him while balanced on their fists then swinging their bodies right and left touching each side to the floor in the traditional yoruba obeisance the office of babalawo embodied all the struggles the triumphs the pride of their race when the last man had paid tribute all three drums suddenly exploded with a powerful rhythm that poured out into the night and the storm obewoles mallet resounded against the skin of the large iya ilu producing a deep measured cadencethree strokes then rest repeated again and again hypnoticallyalmost as though he were knocking on the portals of the unseen next to him the men holding the two smaller drums interjected syncopated clicks between the iya ilus throaty booms the medley of tempos they blended together was driving insistent as the sound swelled in intensity the men began to circle the drawing for ogun ponderously shuffling from one foot to the other in time with the beat it was more than a walk less than a dance atiba began to clang together two pieces of iron he had brought their ring a call to ogun the men trudged past him single file the soles of their feet never leaving the earth using this ritual walk they seemed to be reaching out for some mighty heart of nature through the force of their collective strength they had come tonight as individuals now they were being melded into a single organic whole by the beat of the iya ilu their spirits unified some of them nodded to obewole as they passed a homage to his mastery but he no longer appeared to see them instead he gazed into the distance his face a mask and methodically pounded the taut goatskin with ever increasing intensity ogun cyuba bai ye baye tonu suddenly a chant rose up through the dense air led by the young warrior derin who had devoted his life to ogun his cropped hair emphasized the strong line of his cheeks and his long powerful neck as he moved now raising one shoulder then the other in time with the drums his body began to glisten with sweat in the humid night air all the while atiba stood beside the mill still keeping time with the pieces of iron he nodded in silent approval as the men in the line began to revolve their bare feet now slapping against the packed earth arms working as though they held a bellows this was the ritual call for ogun warrior and iron worker as they whirled past the design on the floor each man bent low chanting imploring ogun to appear while the sound soared around them the dance went on and on and the atmosphere of the mill house became tense with expectation suddenly derin spun away separating himself from the line his eyes acquiring a faraway vacant gaze as he passed by the musicians the drumming swelled perceptibly and serina sensed a presence rising up in the room intense and fearsome without warning the clanging of iron stopped and she felt a powerful hand seize hers ogun is almost here atiba was pointing toward derin his voice a hoarse whisper can you sense his spirit emerging soon he may try to mount derin she studied the dancers puzzling what do you mean mount him the orisa can mount our mind and body almost like a rider mounts a horse ogun wants to displace derins spirit and become the force that rules him but derins self must first leave before ogun can enter since its not possible to be both man and god at once his own spirit is trying to resist to ward off the god sometimes it can be terrifying to watch he studied the men a few moments in silence yes derins body will be the one honored tonight hes the youngest and strongest here its only natural that ogun would choose him dont be surprised now by what you see and darahis voice grew sternyou must not try to help him no matter what may happen at that instant the young warriors left leg seemed to freeze to the ground and he pitched forward forfeiting his centering and balance he began to tremble convulsively his eyes terrorstricken and unfocused his body reeling from a progression of unseen blows against the back of his neck he was still trying to sustain the ritual cadence as he pitched backward against the mill now the drums grew louder more forceful and his entire body seemed to flinch with each stroke of obewoles mallet his eyes rolled back into his head showing only a crescent of each pupil while his arms flailed as though trying to push away some invisible net that had encircled his shoulders he staggered across the floor a long gash in his shoulder where the teeth of the mill had ripped the flesh and began to emit barking cries almost screams as he struggled to regain his balance youve got to stop it she started pulling herself to her feet but before she could rise atiba seized her wrist and silently forced her down none of the other men appeared to take notice of derins convulsions several were in fact themselves now beginning to stumble and lose their balance but they all continued the solemn dance as though determined to resist the force wanting to seize their bodies at that moment the measured booms of the large iya hu drum switched to a rapid syncopated beat a knowing trick by obewole intended to throw the dancers off their centering the sudden shift in drumming caused derin to lose the last of his control he staggered toward the drummers shouted something blindly then stiffened and revolved to face atiba his eyes were vacant but his sweatdrenched body had as sumed a mystical calm he stood silent for a moment glared fiercely about the mill house then reached for the long iron machete atiba was holding out for him obi meye lori emo ofe he was intoning in a deep powerful voice declaring he would now reveal who he was ogun he abruptly brandished the machete about his head and with a leap landed astride the diagram atiba had traced in the dirt the other men hovered back to watch as he launched a violent dance slashing the air with the blade while intoning a singsong chant in a voice that seemed to emanate from another world the drums were silent now as all present knelt to him even those older and more senior derin the man was no longer present his body belonged to the god and his absent eyes burned with a fierceness and determination serina had never before seen she gripped atibas hand feeling her fingers tremble now more than ever she was terrified the pounding of rain on the roof seemed almost to beckon her out into the night away from all this but then she began to understand that the men around her were no longer slaves in the mill room of a plantation in the english caribbees they were yoruba warriors invoking the gods of their dark land now derin was finishing the ritual chant that proclaimed him the earthly manifestation of ogun the words had scarcely died away when atiba stepped forward and demanded he speak to the men offer them guidance for the days ahead when derin merely stood staring at him with his distant eyes atiba grabbed him and shook him finally above the sound of wind and rain derin began to shout a series of curt phrases his voice came so rapidly and with such unearthly force serina found she could not follow what is he saying she gripped atibas hand tighter ogun demands we must right the wrongs that have been set upon us that we must use our swords to regain our freedom and our pride he declares tonight that his anger is fierce like the burning sun that sucks dry the milk of the coconut and he will stand with us in the name of vengeance that victory will be ours but only if we are willing to fight to the death as worthy warriors atiba stopped to listen as derin continued to intone in a deep chilling voice when he had concluded his declaration he abruptly turned and approached serina he stood before her for a moment then reached out with his left hand and seized her shoulder tearing her white shift she gasped at the tingle in her arm realizing his fingers were cold and hard as iron his eyes seemed those of a being who saw beyond the visible into some other world she wanted to pull away but his gaze held her transfixed send this one back where she belongs to the compounds of your wives yoruba warriors do not hold council with women she will lead you to the voice seemed to be receding back into derins body now to be calling from some faraway place suddenly he leaped backward circled the machete about his head and with a powerful stroke thrust it into the earth buried halfway to the hilt he stared down for a moment in confusion as though incredulous at what he had just done then tremulously touched the dark wooden handle finally he seized his face in his hands staggered backward and collapsed atiba sprang to catch him as he sprawled across the remains of the trampled palm fronds several other men came forward their eyes anxious ogun has honored us tonight with his presence he looked about the dark room and all the men nodded in silent agreement at that moment a long trunk of lightning illuminated the open doorway followed by a crack of thunder that shook the pole supporting the thatched roof serina felt a chill sweep against her forehead that is the voice of shango he too demands to be heard we must continue atiba turned to serina even though it displeases ogun your presence here tonight is essential you were once consecrated to shango perhaps you were never told but you are yoruba your lineage is sacred to him how do you know she felt the chill in the room deepening shango animates your spirit as a babalawo i can tell it must have been divined the day you were born and sanctified by a ceremony to olorun the high god there are signs but i must not reveal to you what they are no i wont have any part of this its pagan terrifying she wrapped her arms about her shivering from the cold i only came here to please you ill watch but thats all atiba motioned to the drummers but shango will not be denied you have nothing to fear most of his fire tonight is being spent in the skies the drums began again their cadence subtly changed from before the lightning flashed once more closer now as he urged her toward the dancers we must know the will of shango but we are all men of ogun shango would never come and mount one of us he will only come to you his consecrated as the line of men encircled her and pushed her forward into the crowd of halfnaked bodies sweating in the candlelight atibas face disappeared in the tumult of heaving chests and arms she tried to yell back to him to tell him she would never comply but her voice was lost in the drumming and the roar of the rain she was moving now with the line of men before she realized what she was doing she had caught the hem of her swaying white shift and begun to swing it from side to side in time with the booms of the iya ilu drum it was a dance figure she remembered from some lost age a joyous time long ago she would dance for her love of atiba but not for his gods now the rhythm of the drums grew more dizzying as though pulling her forward it was increasingly hard to think only through the dance could she keep control stay centered on her own self only by this arcing of her body as the movement of her hips flowed into her swaying torso could she suddenly she saw herself in pernambuco being urged gently forward by her yoruba mother as the slaves drummed in the cool evening air it was sunday and all the preto had gathered to dance the black women in ornate portuguese frocks of bright primary colors and the men in tightfitting trousers the drums were sounding and the plantation air was scented by a spray of white blossoms that drifted down from the spreading tree the senhor de engenho was there the white master clapping and leering and calling something to dara about her mulata daughters new frock he was watching her now waiting soon very soon he would take her lightning flashed again and she felt its warmth against her icy skin she wanted to laugh to cry to stay in that world of faraway whose warmth beckoned but now she felt her own will beginning to ebb something was happening no please no she forced her long fingernails into her palm and the pain seemed to restore some of the awareness she had felt slipping from her desperately she tore herself away from the dance and seized the center post of the mill gasping for air and digging her nails into the wood until she felt one snap then she pulled away the african kerchief and threw back her head swirling her hair about her face till it caught in her mouth all at once she was thirsty hungry yearning for a dark presence that hovered over her body like a lover again the blossoms of pernambuco drifted down tiny points of fire as they settled against her face and she began to hum a simple portuguese song she had known as a child it was spring in brazil and as she looked up she saw the face of the old yoruba babalawo dara come he was reaching toward her beckoning her away from the portuguese master saying something about shango she did not understand and the sight of his sad eyes and high black cheeks filled her with love but now there was a youthfulness in his face as though he were here and powerful and young her old babalawo had come back there was the same glistening black skin the same three facemarks cut down his cheek the powerful eyes she had somehow forgotten over the years she gasped as he pulled her back into the circle of dancers he was atiba his clanmarks were atibas and so was his voice lightning illuminated the doorway and its whiteness washed over her bleaching away the mill the moving bodies the face of atiba as she stumbled back among the dancers her mind seemed to be thinning turning to pale mist merging with the rain boguo yguoro ache semilenu shango the men were moving beside her now intoning their singsong chant she suddenly recalled the longforgotten yoruba verses and wanted to join in but the words floated away she was no longer part of the men in the room she was distant observing from some other world instead of the sweating bodies there was the fragrance of frangipani and the faces of preto slaves on the pernambuco plantation as they gathered around at the moment of her birth to praise her light skin daras warm nourishing breast was against her lips and the world was bright and new she gasped for breath but the air was wet oppressive its heaviness was descending over her then her left leg seemed to catch in a vise as though it belonged to the deep earth she wrenched her body to look down and felt a crack of thunder pound against her back the world was drifting up through her drowning her in white she is floating borne by the drums while a weight has settled against her back a stifling weariness that insists the dance must stop yet some power propels her on swirls about her forces her forward she senses the touch of wet skin as she falls against one of the dancers but no hands reach out to help only the drums keep her alive but they too are fading leaving her as the world starts to move in slow motion a white void has replaced her mind her breath comes in short bursts her heart pounds her hands and feet are like ice she is ready now to leave to surrender to be taken then a voice comes a voice only she can hear whose yoruba words say her mind can rest that her body is no longer to struggle she holds her eyes open but she no longer sees a powerful whiteness has settled against her forehead okunrin t o lagbara a hard voice cut through the room silencing the drums shango the yoruba men fell forward to touch the feet of the tall mulata who towered over them demanding worship her eyes glowed white illuminating the darkness of the room her arm stretched out toward atiba as she called for her scepter he hesitated a moment as though stunned that she was no longer dara then rose to hand her a large stone that had been chipped into the form of a doubleheaded axe he had fashioned it himself in anticipation of just this moment as he offered the sacred implement her left hand shot out and seized his throat she grabbed the axe head with her right hand and examined it critically then she roughly cast him aside against the mill while the men watched she raised the stone axe above her head and began to speak opolopo ise io wa ti enikan ko le da se afi bi o ba ir oluranlowo the voice of shango was telling them that the yoruba must join with the other men of africa if they would not all die as slaves otherwise they and their children and their childrens children for twenty generations would be as cattle to the branco even so he would not yet countenance the spilling of innocent blood not until yoruba blood had been spilled they must not kill those among the branco who had done them no hurt only those who would deny their manhood suddenly she turned and glared directly at atiba the voice grew even harsher atiba son of balogun bi owo eni ko te eku ida a ki ibere iku ti o pa baba eni it was the ancient call to arms of ife no man who has not grasped his sword can avenge the death of his father but atiba sensed there was a deeper more personal message the voice had now become that of balogun himself clearly unmistakably he felt his heart surge with shame her last words were still ringing when a sphere of lightning slid down the centerpole of the roof and exploded against the iron mill rings of fire danced across the rollers and dense dark smoke billowed in the room atiba had already sprung to catch her as she slumped forward sending her stone axe clattering across the packed floor olorun ayuba bai ye baye tonu through the smoke he quickly began to intone a solemn acknowledgement to the yoruba high god then he lifted her into his arms and pressed his cheek against hers as he led the men out she was only dimly aware of a whisper against her ear you are truly a woman of the yoruba and tonight you have brought us shangos power with him to help us we will one day soon plant our yams where the brancos compounds stand as they started down the pathway single file the lightning had gone now there was only the gentle spatter of caribbean rain against their sweating faces as they merged with the night chapter ten as the bell on the rainbowe struck the beginning of the first watch edmond calvert stood on the quarterdeck studying the thin cup of crescent moon that hung suspended in the west in another hour it would be gone and the dense tropical dark would descend the time had arrived to commence the operation he reflected grimly on how it had come to this the ultimate responsibility he knew must be laid at the door of a greedy parliament before the monarchy was abolished the american settlements had been the personal domain of the king and they had suffered little interference from commons scarce wonder parliaments execution of charles was received with so much trepidation and anger hereyesterday hed heard that in virginia the assembly had just voted to hang anyone heard defending the recent traitorous proceedings in england what these americans feared naturally enough was that parliament would move to try and take them over they were right and the richest prize of all was not virginia not massachusetts but the sugar island of barbados why else had he been sent here first how could oliver cromwell have so misjudged these colonists he thought all they needed was intimidation and expected the fleet to manage that handily what hed failed to understand was the strong streak of independence that had developed here over the years especially in barbados instead of acting sensibly the islanders had met the fleet with a cannon barrage and a declaration stating that they would fight to the death for their liberty what was worse they had steadfastly refused to budge even so he had tried every means possible to negotiate a surrender hed started a propaganda campaign sending ashore letters and posters warning that resistance was foolhardy that they needed the protection of england but dalby bedfords reply was to demand that the island be allowed to continue governing itself by its own elected assembly when everyone knew parliament would never agree yet for a fortnight they had continued their fruitless exchange of letters cajolery threatsneither side willing to relent what else he asked himself was left to do now add to that invasion fever was becoming rife in the fleet this morning he had hung out the flag of council summoning the captains of all the ships aboard the rainbowe for a final parlay and over a luncheon table groaning with meat and drink from the fourteen captured dutch merchant fluyts the men had done little else save brag of victory finally his last hope of avoiding bloodshed gone he had reluctantly issued orders it had come to thisengland and her most populous american colony were going to war he then spent the afternoon watch on the quarterdeck alone pensively studying the flying fish that glided across the surface of the tranquil blue caribbean hardest to repress was his own anguish at the prospect of sending english infantry against a settlement in the americas these new world venturers were not rebel papist irishmen against whom cromwell might well be justified in dispatching his army they were fellow protestants as he turned and ordered the anchor weighed he experienced yet another disquieting reflectionunless there was some weakness in the island he did not yet know it could win are we ready to issue muskets now and bandoliers of powder and shot vice admiral james powlett was coming up the companionway with a purposeful stride he heard powletts question and decided to pass the decision on issuing of arms to the invasion commander colonel richard morris now waiting beside him wearing breastplate and helmet deep wrinkles from fifty years of life were set in morris brow and the descending dark did not entirely obscure the worry in his blue eyes or the occasional nervous twitch in his dutchstyle goatee a seasoned army officer he had chafed for days waiting to take his men ashore on board the ships he and his infantry were under naval command on land he would be in total charge his impatience could not have been greater during the forenoon watch he had personally visited each of the troop ships and picked some two hundred of the fittest infantry for the invasion he had organized them into attack squadrons appointed field commanders and held a briefing for the officers then the men had been transferred in equal numbers to the rainbowe the marston moor and the gloucester where the captains had immediately ordered them down to the alreadycrowded gun decks to await nightfall well issue no arms till its closer to time morris squinted at powlett through the waning moonlight ill not have some recruit light a matchcord in the dark down there between decks and maybe set off a powder keg though id scarcely fault any man who did considering the conditions youve placed my infantry under in truth sir i think were all a trifle weary of hearing your complaints about how the navy has been required to garrison your men powlett scowled may i remind you that while youve seen fit to occupy yourself grumbling the navy has arranged to replenish our water and provisions courtesy of all the butterboxes who were anchored in the bay in fact i only just this afternoon finished inventorying the last dutch fluyt and securing her hatches powlett paused to watch as the rainbowe began to come about her bow turning north she would lead the way along the coast the other two warships following astern and steering by a single lantern hanging from her maintopmast their destination was the small bay off the settlement at jamestown up the coast from carlisle bay what this navy has done sir morris voice was rising is to seize and pilfer the merchantmen of a nation england has not declared war on we dont need letters of marque to clear our american settlements of these dutchmen powlett continued theyve grown so insolent and presumptuous theyre not to be suffered more if we dont put a stop to them theyll soon make claim to all the americas so that no nation can trade here but themselves besides its thanks to these interloping hollanders that weve now got fresh water and meat enough to last for weeks aye so im told though my men have yet to see a sliver of this dutch meat we hear about theres been time needed to inventory sir ive had the beef we took cut into quarter pieces and pickled and put aboard the provision ships and the pork and mutton cut into half pieces and salted weve got enough in hand now to sit and watch this island starve if it comes to that morris chewed on his lip and thought bitterly of the noonday council of war called aboard the rainbowe all the fleet captains had gorged themselves on fresh pork and fat mutton washing it down with fine brandy and sackall taken from the captains larder of the kostverloren the treatment of my men on this voyage has been nothing short of a crime he continued angrily it cries to heaven i swear it the infantrymen had been confined to the hold for the entire trip on dungeonlike gun decks illuminated by only a few dim candles since naval vessels required a far larger crew than merchant ships owing to the men needed for the gun crews there was actually less space for extra personnel than an ordinary merchantman would have afforded a frigate the size of the rainbowe already had two watches of approximately thirty men each together with twentyfive or more specialistscarpenters cooks gunnery mates how morris wondered could they expect anything save sickness and misery on a ship when they took aboard an additional hundred or two hundred landsmen sure to be seasick for the whole of the voyage need anyone be surprised when his soldiers were soon lying in their own vomit surrounded by sloshing buckets of excrement and too sick to make their way to the head up by the bowsprit where the seamen squatted to relieve themselves scarce wonder more men died every day whats your latest estimate of their strength here on this side of the island morris turned back to powlett trying to ignore the stench that wafted up out of the scuttles assuming the intelligence youve been getting is worth anything i can do without your tone sir the vice admiral snapped we have it on authority that the rebels have managed to raise some six thousand foot and four hundred horse but their militias strung out the length of the coast any place we make a landingunless its bungledwe should have the advantage of surprise and numbers all you have to do is storm the breastwork and spike their ordnance it should be a passing easy nights work nothings easy the trickll be to land the men before they can alert the entire island morris turned back to calvert ill need flintlocks for the first wave not matchlocks if were to have the benefit of surprise and ive got a feeling well need every advantage we can muster we can manage that easily enough id guess weve got nearly two hundred flintlocks and about six hundred matchlocks so i can issue every man you have a musket and pike and a bandolier with twelve rounds of powder and shot as well as six yards of matchcord for the matchlocks so what youre saying is weve got mostly matchlocks morris voice was grim thats all their militiall have depend on it that was doubtless true morris told himself it would be an oldstyle war but plenty deadly for it all from the time some two centuries earlier when the musket came into general use the most common means for firing had been to ignite a small amount of powder in an external container the powder pan which then directed a flash through a tiny hole in the side of the barrel igniting the powder of the main charge the powder pan of a matchlock was set off using a burning matchcord a powderimpregnated length of cotton twine kept lit in readiness for firing the gun the technique differed very little from the way a cannon was fired a smoldering end of the matchcord was attached to the hammer or cock of the gun which shoved it into the powder pan whenever the trigger was pulled an infantryman using a matchlock musket carried several yards of matchcord prudently burning at both ends matchlocks were cheap and simple and the mainstay of regular infantry throughout europe there was however an improved type of firing mechanism recently come into use called the flintlock much preferred by sportsmen and anyone wealthy enough to afford it the flintlock musket ignited the powder in the external pan by striking flint against steel when the trigger was pulled and it was a concealable weapon which could also be used in rainy weather since it did not require a burning cord a flintlock cost three or four times as much as a matchlock and required almost constant maintenance by a skilled gunsmith morris suspected that whereas a few of the rich royalist exiles on barbados might own flintlocks most of the poorer planters probably had nothing more than cheap matchlocks wed also be advised to offload some provisions once we get ashore in case we get pinned down morris looked coldly at powlett im thinking a few quarters of that pickled beef you took from the dutchmen wouldnt be amiss in time sir for now i can let you have twenty hogsheads of water and ill set ashore some salt pork from our regular stores what if i offered to trade all that for just a few kegs of brandy morris appealed to calvert i warrant the mend sooner have it calvert glanced at powlett knowing the vice admiral had hinted at their noonday council he preferred keeping all the dutch brandy for the navys men id say we can spare you a couple of kegs it should be enough for a day or twos supply but ill not send it ashore till the breastwork is fully secured now the rainbowe was entering the outer perimeter of the small bay at jamestown and the admiral excused himself to begin giving orders for reefing the mainsail through the dark they could see the outline of the torchlit breastwork a low brick fortress outlined against the palms its all but certain to be bristling with ordnance morris thought and what if their militias waiting for us somewhere in those damned trees how many men will i lose before daylight he inhaled the humid night air then turned to powlett we should start bringing the men up on deck weve got to launch the longboats as soon as we drop anchor before the militia in the breastwork has time to summon reinforcements powlett nodded and passed the order to the quartermaster then ill unlock the focsle so we can begin issuing muskets and bandoliers the infantrymen emerged from the hold in companies each led by an officer the general mismatch of body armor the breast and back bespoke what a ragtag army it was also the helmets or pots for those fortunate enough to have one were a mixture of all the age had produced some with flat brims some that curled upward front and back some were too large for their wearers others too small doublets too were a rainbow of colors many with oldfashioned ruffstaken from dead or captured royalists during the civil warand the rest plain and patched with rough country cloth the night perfume of the tropical shore and the sea was obliterated by the stench of the emerging soldiers their faces were smeared with soot from the beams of the gun decks where they had been quartered and they smelled strongly of sweat and the rankness of the hold as they set grimly to work readying their weapons a row of longboats along midships was unlashed and quietly lowered over the side the two other warships which had anchored astern of the rainbowe also began launching their invasion craft kegs of water salt pork and black powder were assembled on deck and readied to be landed after the first wave of the assault the guns of the warships were already primed and run out set to provide artillery support if necessary when the longboats neared the beach but with luck the breastwork could be overrun and its gun emplacements seized before the militia had a chance to set and fire its ordnance once the jamestown fortress was disabled there would be a permanent breach in the islands defenses a chink not easily repaired the longboats had all been lowered now and they bobbed in a line along the port side of the rainbowe next rope ladders were dropped and the infantrymen ordered to form ranks at the gunwales those assigned to lead the attack all armed with flintlocks were ordered over the side first they dropped down the dangling ladders one by one grumbling to mask their fear the second wave men with matchlocks were being issued lighted matchcord which they now stood coiling about their waists as they waited to disembark edmond calvert watched silently from the quarterdeck heartsick with them went his last hope for negotiation now it was a state of war england against her own settlements in the new world katy all im trying to say is youll jeopardize your chances for a proper marriage if this goes on much more i only hope you have some idea of what youre about dalby bedford leaned back in his chair and studied the head of his cane troubled by his conflicting emotions the night sounds from the compound outside crickets and whistling frogs filtered in through the closed jalousies he loved his daughter more than life itself whats more he had vowed long ago never to treat her as a child and now now that she no longer was a child what to do it was too late to dictate to her the time for that was years ago she was a woman nowshe was no longer his little girl she was no longer his theyd always been best of friends in the evenings theyd often meet in the forecourt of the compound where after she was old enough to understand such things they would laugh over the latest gossip from london what pompous lord had been cuckolded whose mistress had caused a scene at court he had never thought to warn her that as a woman she might someday have desires of her own but now he was still her father still worried over her still wanted the right thing for her and she was throwing away her best chance to secure a fine marriageall for the company of a man whose rough manner he could not help but despise however much he might respect his courage and talent hugh winston was the antithesis of everything dalby bedford stood for he was impulsive contemptuous of law and order how could katy be attracted to him be so imprudent had she learned nothing in all their years together dalby bedford found himself puzzled disturbed andyes he had to admit ita trifle jealous katy you know ive never tried to interfere in what you choose to do but in truth i must tell you im troubled about this winston your carousing about with a smuggler is hardly demeanor fitting our position here i fear its already been cause for talk she set down the leather bridle she was mending and lifted her eyes sensing his discomfort youd suppose there were more important things for the island to talk about especially now what happens to you is important to me i should hope its important to you as well young woman she straightened her skirt and the edge of her crinoline petticoat glistened in the candlelight hughs a smuggler when im out with him but hes captain winston when the militia needs a batch of raw tenacre freeholders drilled in how to form ranks and prime a musket i thought it was captain winston and not a smuggler whos been working night and day helping keep trained gunners manning all the breastworks along the coast theres no arguing with you katy i gave that up long ago im just telling you to mind yourself he swabbed his brow against the heat of early evening and rose to open the jalousies a light breeze whispered through the room and fluttered the curtains ill grant you hes been a help to us for all his want of breeding but what do you know about him no man who lives the way he does can be thought a gentleman youve been out riding with him half a dozen times once all the way over to the breastwork at oistins in fact you must have passed right by the walrond plantation its not gone unnoticed you can be sure he settled back into his chair with a sigh and laid aside his cane these last few days he had realized more than ever how much he depended on katherine anthony walronds a man of the world but you cant push him too far im just telling you to try and be discreet in faith my greater worry is that that id sooner you were here with me more now between us i think the fleets going to try and invade soon if not tonight then tomorrow or the day after for certain talk has run its course and if weve got to fight the english army on our own beaches god help us he could sense the unity on the island dissolving many of the smaller planters were growing fearful and morale in the militia was visibly deteriorating half the men would just as soon have done with the constant alerts and dwindling supplies there was scarcely any meat to be had now and flour was increasingly being hoarded and rationed cassava bread was finding its way onto the tables of english planters who a fortnight earlier would have deemed it fit only for indentureswhile the indentures themselves god knows were being fed even less than usual without the steady delivery of provisions by the dutch shippers there probably would be starvation on barbados inside a month and with all the new africans on the island many militiamen were reluctant to leave their own homes unprotected little wonder so many of the smaller freeholders were openly talking about surrender katy i hate to ask this but i do wish youd stay here in the compound from now on its sure to be safer than riding about the island no matter who youre with i thought i was of age and therefore free to come and go as i wish aye that you are youre twentythree and twice as stubborn as your mother ever was i just dont want to lose you too the way i lost her he looked at her his eyes warm with concern sometimes you seem so much like her only i think she truly loved bermuda which ill warrant you never really did it always seemed so tame she knew how much he cherished those few years of happiness before his long stretch of widowerhood in barbados theres a wildness and a mystery about this island i never felt there aye you were of your own opinion even then but still ive always been regretful i agreed to take this post he paused and his look darkened especially considering what happened on the trip down if only id taken your mother below decks when the firing began shed still be with us but she wanted to see the canoes she picked up the bridle again i did too well youve been a comfort to a dull old manno dont try and deny itmore than any father has a right to expect i suppose you became a woman that day your mother died no question of it the sparkle returned to his eyes youd never do anything i told you after that may god curse you with a daughter of your own someday katy bedford then youll know what its like at that moment she wanted nothing so much as to slip her arms around his neck and tell him she would be his dutiful daughter forever but she was no longer sure it was true now admit it to me katy this is no time for pretense youre smitten with this winston arent you i can see the change in you he watched as she busied herself with the bridle trying not to look surprised i realize youre a woman now i suppose i can understand how a man like him might appeal to you and i guess theres nothing wrong with having a bit of a dalliance god knows its fashionable in london these days but your winstons a curious fellow and therere doubtless a lot of things about him neither of us knows he looked at her im sure your mother wouldnt have approved any more than i do what does she have to do with this she knew he always invoked her mothers alleged oldfashioned views any time he couldnt think of a better argument perhaps youre right what you do now is on my head not hers he paused not wanting to meet her eyes ill grant you i might have sowed a few wild oats myself when i was your age and i cant say ive entirely regretted it the fact is as i get older thats one of the few things from my early years i remember at all after a while all other memories fade his voice drifted away and now the way things have come to pass these days may be the last either of us has left to he raised his hand suddenly as though to silence himself from down the hill came the faint crack of a musket then another and another three shots they both waited listening in the dim candlelight as the night sounds of crickets and frogs resumed once more finally he spoke well there it is she rose and walked over behind his chair she hesitated for a moment then slipped her arms around his neck and nuzzled her cheek against his there were so many things shed wanted to say to him over the years now suddenly it was almost too late and still she couldnt find the words she wanted to hold him now but something still stopped her silently he touched her hand then reached for his cane and stood ive ordered the carriage horses kept harnessed in case he was already halfway to the door i suppose id best go down to the point first just to be sure i want to go with you she grabbed the bridle and ran after him to let him get away with so much still unsaid no youll stay here and for once thats an order he took her hand and squeezed it i didnt tell you that five members of the assembly have already called for surrender five out of twentytwo i wonder how many morell be ready to join them after tonight if the assembly votes to give in katy you know itll probably mean a trial in london for me he kissed her on the cheek youll have to look out for yourself then and thatll be time aplenty to go chasing around the island in the dark he drew back in the meantime youd best decide what you plan to do about this winston fellow if that happens dont go losing your heart to him hes a rogue wholl not do the right thing by you or any woman mark it a father still can see a few things hes already got one woman that ship of his and a seaman like that never has room for anyone else she had to concede that in truth there was something to what he said up till now shed been managing to keep things in balance but was she starting to let desire overrule that better judgment for the hundredth time she warned herself to keep her head in the first place i dont wish to marry hugh winston so its just as well isnt it that hes got his ship i see all too well what he is im going to marry anthony and try and make the best of things her eyes hardened and secondly were not going to lose you just have to delay the assembly from voting a surrender hugh thinks the militia can drive them back aye we may hold out for a time weve got trained gunners for every breastwork on the west and south coasts but how long before some of the militia starts defecting then what can we do with guns at our backs as well he exhaled pensively by the way on the subject of winston ive noticed something a trifle incongruous about that man he appears to know a lot more about cannon and fortifications than a seaman reasonably ought probably as much or more even than anthony walrond has he ever said where he learned it he never talks much about his past she had found herself increasingly puzzled and not a little infuriated by winstons secretiveness probably the only woman he ever confided in was joan fuller but sometimes i get the idea he may have learned a lot of what he knows from a frenchman now and then he slips and uses a french name for something id almost guess he helped a band of frenchmen set up defenses somewhere in the caribbean once dalby bedford quietly sucked in his breath and tried to mask his dismay the only band of frenchmen to fit that description would be the little settlement of planters on the french side of st christopher or the cowkillers on tortuga and hugh winston hardly looked like a planter well maybe its just as well we dont know katy he reached for his hat now mind yourself and make sure all the servants have muskets dont open the door to anyone he pecked her quickly on the cheek just be glad your friend winstons frigate is aground his other woman is beached for now try and keep her that way suddenly james their stooping whitehaired irish servant pushed through the doorway from the paneled entry foyer the night breeze set the candles flickering excellency he bowed nervously pardon me excellency theres a gentleman to see you he just rode into the compound all in a sweat claims hes come up from mistress fullers place the assembly had voted to place hugh winston in command of the gunnery crews for the cannon emplacements at the four major breastworks along the coast lookout point bridgetown and jamestown on the west and oistins bay on the south in line with that responsibility he had taken the front room of joans tavern and converted it into a meeting place for his gunnery officers several of joans rickety pine tables had been lashed together to form a desk from that makeshift post he assigned the daily watches for each of the breastworks and monitored supplies he also maintained close communication with the commanders of the field militia both infantry and cavalry who were drawn from the ranking planters and royalist officers in each parish the militia itself had individual field command posts in each of the parish churches the tavern was a comfortable rendezvous place for the men assigned to the guns mostly seamen or former seamen who had gained their experience with heavy ordnance on a gun deck joans familiar clapboard establishment enjoyed a commanding view of the harbor and unlike the parish churches offered the finest food and grog remaining on the island joan presided over the accommodations making sure necessary amenities were always at hand she also kept a close eye on the loyalties of those who gathered tonight however the tavern was all but empty save for winston his quartermaster john mewes and his masters mate edwin spurre since all gunnery mates were on alert and at their posts at the various breastworks along the coast the three of them were waiting for the signal horses saddled and ready the night was clear and humid and a light breeze had just sprung up in the south winston leaned against the doorjamb half in and half out exhausted from a daylong ride reviewing gun emplacements along the shore john mewes was stationed outside on the porch tankard in hand keeping an eye on the sentry post atop lookout point a system of lantern signals had been arranged to alert the bridgetown command post to any change in the disposition of the fleet ive got a feelin about tonight capn word from up on the point at midday was they were holdin a big meetin aboard the rainbowe an then she got underway and made about a league out to sea along with the troop ships mewes took a nervous puff from the long stem of his white clay pipe id say its odds theyre planning a little surprise for us tonight moren likely somewhere along the west coast ive got the same feeling john he strolled across the narrow porch and stared up the hill toward the sentry post stationed at the north end of the point what was the latest signal same as usual five flashes on the quarter hour meanin no sightings mewes reached to tap his pipe against the heavy beam at the corner of the building i told tonights watch to report anything that moved but theyll be hard pressed to see much beyond the bay here then you stay lively too and try not to get too thirsty winston lifted a flintlock musket he had brought ashore from the defiance and tested the lock by the light of a candle lantern next he started polishing the barrel with a cloth he had borrowed from joan ive got an idea they may try and land up at jamestown or maybe even farther north then hadnt we best advise the militia commanders to double the security on the breastwork up that way i spoke with walrond up at jamestown late this afternoon we both figure thats the most likely location hes already ordered up reinforcements for tonight he drew a musket patch from his pocket and began to clean the sooty powder pan of the musket i didnt see any militia moving out from around here nobody was to move till dark we dont want the fleets puritan spies here to know were ready wed lose our chance to catch their infantry in a noose betwixt you an me id just as soon they never got around to landing infantry mewes shifted up his trousers a man could well get his balls shot off amidst all that musket fire winston pulled back the hammer of the musket checking its tension sometimes i wonder why the hell i keep you on john id wager most of joans girls have more spirit for a fight aye id sooner do my battlin on a feather mattress ill own it so the better question is why i stay on under your command could be the fine caliber of men youre privileged to ship with aye that crew of gallowsbait are a rare species of gentility as im a christian he started to laugh then it died in his throat gods wounds was that a signal up at the point looked to be winston flipped over the musket and examined the barrel then he selected a charge holdera tiny metal flaskfrom among the twelve strung from the bandolier draped over his shoulder and began pouring its black powder into the muzzle three longs and a short that means a mast lantern putting in at jamestown right he fitted a patch over the ramrod and began to tamp in the powder probably the rainbowe aye thats the signal mewes shoved the pipe into his pocket want me to fetch the muskets tell joan to give you those two leaning in the corner at the back i just got through priming them mewes vaulted the steps leading to the open tavern door seconds later joan appeared holding the two flintlocks what is it darlin her eyes were bloodshot with fatigue are we finally due for some company right on schedule the surfs been down all day i figured theyd try it tonight he finished tapping the ball down the muzzle of the musket then placed the gun carefully on the step i guess that means i win our wager gods blood i never thought itd come to this i was sure theyd never have the brass to try it she passed him the muskets so well be going to war after all id wager you another shilling youll not hold them off darlin save thered be no way to collect if i won all wagers are off now this ones too hard to call he handed one of the flintlocks to john mewes then cocked the other and aimed it into the dark night air ready john aye mewes cocked the musket and aimed it at the sliver of moon on the western horizon tell me again the signal for jamestowns one shot a count of five another shot a count of ten and then the third thats it fire when ready winston squeezed the trigger and the powder pan flashed in the dark five seconds later mewes discharged the second musket then after ten seconds winston fired the third the one he had just loaded all right john get the horses aye mewes disappeared around the side of the tavern headed for the makeshift stable located at the rear approximately a minute later the signal of three musket shots was repeated by militiamen in the field command post at black rock on the road to jamestown shortly after there again came a faint repetition of the pattern of shots farther north the prearranged signal was moving quickly up the coast mewes emerged from the dark leading two speckled mares he patted one on the side of her face muttered an endearment then passed the reins to winston im ready to ride all right john ill see you at jamestown put spurre in charge here and go up to the governors compound to tell bedford if hes not there then try the assembly room if theyre meeting tonight tell them to adjourn and get every man up to jamestown on the double we may need them all mewes bellowed instructions through the doorway then he seized the saddle horn of the smaller horse and pulled himself up aye ill be up there myself soon as i can manage depend on it joan stood beside winston watching as he vanished into the dark well now thats most curious she cocked back her head and her eyes snapped in the lantern light im surprised youd not take the opportunity to go up to his excellencys compound yourself seein youre so well acquainted with the family these days all in the line of duty duty my arse you whoremaster but youll get what you deserve from that one on my honor she thinks shes royalty itself she held the reins while he mounted dont say i didnt give you a friendly warning im warned he vaulted into the saddle as edwin spurre emerged through the doorway to assume lookout duty edwin prime and ready the muskets in case they try to attack on two fronts do you know the signals aye capn joan handed up the reins godspeed you know if you let those puritan hypocrites take over the island therell be a lot of wives thinkin they can finally close me down just because theyve got nothing better to fret about well win he looked at joan a moment and reached out to take her hand tonight he felt almost like he was defending the only home he had left now he had no ship and jamaica seemed farther away than ever he leaned over in the saddle and kissed her she ran her arms around his neck then drew back and pinched his cheek show those roundhead bastards a thing or two about how to shoot love im counting on you though damned if i know why just keep the grog under lock and key till i get back he waved lightly then reined the mare toward the road north as the horse clattered across the loose boards of the bridge he glanced over his shoulder up the hill toward the compound whatll happen to bedford and katy he wondered to himself if we cant hold off the attack itll be the tower and a trial for him not a doubt probably charged with leading a rebellion and what about her more riders were joining him now militiamen who had been waiting for the signal the distance to jamestown was several miles and they were all riding hard none spoke other than a simple greeting each man thinking of the stakes no one wanted to contemplate what would happen should they lose well win he kept telling himself as he spurred his mare by god we have to chapter eleven jeremy walrond slid his hand down the long steel barrel of the flintlock letting his fingers play across the latin motto engraved along the top ante ferit quam flamma micet it strikes before the flash is seen the piece had been given to him on his twelfth birthday by his brother anthony and it was superbcrafted in holland with a fine flemish lock and carved ivory insets of hunting scenes in the stock with it he had once in a stroke of rare luck brought down a partridge in flight now through a dismaying and improbable chain of events he must turn this work of artistry against a fellow human being it was true he had been part of the royalist cause in the civil war a clerk helping direct the transport of supplies but he had never been near enough to the lines to fire a musket or to have a musket fired at him the thought of battle brought a moistness to his palms and a dull hollow ache in his gut while the men around him in the trenchall now under his commandreinforced their courage with a large onionflask of homemade killdevil he gazed over the newly mounded earth and out to sea ashamed at his relief there was as yet no flash of lantern no telltale red dots of burning matchcord the only moving lights were the darting trails of fireflies those strange night creatures that so terrified newcomers to the caribbees in a few more moments the last of the moon now a thin lantern would drop beneath the western horizon causing the coast and the sea to be swallowed in blackness after that happened he told himself he might see nothing more hear nothing more till the first musket ball slammed home war he meditated was mans greatest folly excused in the name of abstractions like liberty and country and dignity but what dignity was there for those who died with a musket ball in their chest no beast of the earth willfully killed its own kind only man who then styled himself the noblest of gods creatures he loosened his hot lace collar hoping to catch some of the onagain offagain breeze that had risen in the south and now swept the pungent smell of bridgetowns harbor up along the coast aside from the rattle of militiamens bandoliers and occasional bursts of gallows laughter the only sounds were night noisesthe clack of foraging land crabs the chirps and whistles of crickets and toads the distant batter of surf and spray against the sand inland the green hills of barbados towered in dark silence he looked out to sea once more and realized the surf was beginning to rise as wave after frothy wave chased up the crystalline sand of the shore now bleached pale in the last waning moonlight the ships were out there he knew waiting he could almost feel their presence both the trench and the breastwork were back away from the shoreback where the sand merged with brown clay and the first groves of palms heralds of the hardwood thickets farther upland through the palms he could barely discern the silhouettes of the gunners as they loitered alongside the heavy ordnance holding lighted linstocks fifteen cannon were there tonight ranging in gauge from nine to eighteenpound shot shielded on the sea side by a headhigh masonry wall cut with battlements for the guns though the original jamestown gun emplacement had been built two decades earlier as a precaution against spanish attack that threat had faded over the years and gradually the planters of barbados had grown complacent they had permitted the fort to slowly decay its guns to clog with rust from the salt air how ironic he thought that now an english attack not spanish had finally occasioned its first repairs over the past fortnight the old cannon had been cleaned of rust and primed and new dutch guns all brass had been hauled up by oxcart from carlisle bay and set in place now six of these small demiculverin had just been removed from the breastwork and hauled to safety inland at first word of the invasion he heard the murmur of approaching voices and looked up to see two shadowy figures moving along the dirt parapet that protected the trench one was tall and strode with a purposeful elegance the other lumbered itll be a cursed dark night once weve lost the moon and thats when theyre apt to start launching the longboats damn winston if hes not in place by then are his men over where theyre supposed to be the hard voice of benjamin briggs drifted down the silhouette that was anthony walrond merely nodded silently in reply jeremy rose and began climbing up the parapet his bandolier rattling anthony turned at the noise recognized him and motioned him forward are your men ready yes sir anthony studied him thoughtfully a moment watch yourself tonight lad he paused then looked away do remember to take care that i will jeremy broke the silence between them but im not afraid truly he patted his bandolier for emphasis causing the charge holders to clank one against the other he knew he owed his assignment of the rank of ensignwhich normally required holdings of at least fifteen acresand the leadership of a squad solely to the influence of his older brother who commanded the vital jamestown defenses by unanimous consent of the assembly jeremys militiameneight in numberwere all small freeholders with rusty matchlocks and no battle experience he had been too ashamed to tell anthony he didnt desire the honor of being an officer it was time to prove he was a walrond jeremy we all know fear but we learn to rise above it youll make me proud tonight ill lay odds he reached and adjusted the buckle of the shoulder strap holding jeremys sword now have your men light their matchcord and ready the prime on their muskets jeremy gave his brother a stiff salute and passed the order into the trench a burning taper was handed slowly down the line of men and each touched it to the tip of his matchcord then threaded the glowing fuse through the serpentine cock of his musket he secretly rejoiced he had a newstyle flintlock at least there would be no lighted matchcord to betray his own whereabouts in the dark he stood for a moment watching his men prepare then glanced back at the squat outline of benjamin briggs what he wondered was he doing here tonight briggs was gazing down at the parapet now critically scuffing his boots against the soft earth this trench of yours will do damned little to protect these lads from cannon fire if somebody in the fleet takes a mind to shell the breastwork i pray to god it was worth the time and trouble a crew of indentures as well as many of winstons new men had worked aroundtheclock for three days digging the trench the idea had come from anthony walrond im betting on an invasion not an artillery duel anthony nodded toward jeremy one last time a light farewell then turned back to briggs an open shelling with their big ordnance would be foolhardy right now its too dark to try and fire on our emplacements add to that we have word the commander in charge of the army is a roundhead rogue named dick morris i know him all too well he doesnt believe in a lot of cannon fire when a few men can achieve what he wants hell just try to land enough men to overrun and disable our guns well and all may almighty god damn our luck that its come down to this the last thing we need is war with england but if its fight we must then i say give them our all and dont let them catch us short briggs gazed past jeremy down the trench do all these men have enough matchrope powder and shot anthony felt himself nearing his limit of tolerance for civilians all the planter had found to do since arriving was denigrate their readiness weve managed to get bandoliers and the twelve apostles for all the menhe deliberately used the irreverent battlefield nickname for the dozen chargeholders of musket powder on a standard bandolierand theres plenty of matchcord with what we got from the dutchmen before they were seized he tightened his eyepatch and surveyed the line of ragged planters and indentures marshalled down the trench trying to envision them under attack the picture was discouraging at the very least how many here have ever taken musket fire he wondered this bunker will likely be overrun by the first wave of morris infantry god curse cromwell for sending him hes tenacious as an english bulldog and crafty as a fox hell land the pick of his troops and the minute they open fire its odds this line of farmers will panic and run for those green hills weve got superiority of numbers but it doesnt mean a thing what we need and dont have is nerve experience and most of all the will to fight ill wager not one man in ten here tonight has all three id like to know sir whats your true opinion of the plan thats been worked out briggs turned to walrond hating the mans arrogance and his royalist politics yet respecting his military experience he had led a royalist attack at the battle of marsten moor that was still remembered as one of the most daring maneuvers of the civil war do you think we can catch their landing force in a bind the way were hoping anthony moved away from the edge of the trench taken all for all its about the best we can do if it succeeds well and good but if it fails were apt to end up jeremy tried to hear the rest but anthonys voice faded into the dark as he and briggs moved on down the parapet the night was closing in again having drained their flask of killdevil the militiamen were grumbling nervously as they waited in a line down the trench backs to the newly turned earth again the sounds of the dark swelled up around them the chirps and whistles the monotonous pendulum of surf in the distance war was it mainly waiting maybe there would be no landing how preposterous all this would seem then tomorrow he would wake in his featherbed dreaming he was back in england laughing at the absurdity of it all sense would prevail the fleet would hoist sail a volley of musket fire exploded from the direction of the breastwork shouts then clustered points of light the tips of burning matchcord on the infantrys muskets suddenly appeared along the shore the first attackers had crept up behind the cannon and fired into the gunners with flintlocks so there would be no smoldering ignition match on their muskets to betray them those in the second wave had somehow masked their lighted matchcord until their longboats pulled into the surf now after the surprise attack on the gun emplacement they were splashing ashore holding their muskets high jeremy watched as the flickering red dots spread out along the shore in disciplined rows for a moment he had the impression jamestown was being attacked by strings of fireflies that had emerged from the deep caribbean sea prepare to fire he heard a voice giving the order and was vaguely astonished to realize it was his own the trench sounded with the clicks of powder pans being opened and hammers being readied take aim that was the phrase he had started practicing it five days before when he was assigned the command but now what next aim where the fireflies were inching up the shore in deadly rows there looked to be hundreds they would spew lead shot the moment the militias trench was revealed he knew that the order to fire the first round must come from anthony why was he waiting the roundhead infantry must be no more than fifty yards down the shore he felt his palm grow moist against the ivory of the stock and for a moment he thought he smelled an acrid stench of fear down the trench more muskets blazed from the rear of the brick fortress followed by screams and shouts of surrender in the jumble of musket fire and lanterns he could tell that the jamestown breastwork had been circled and seized its gunners overwhelmed its cannon still directed impotently out toward the dark sea only two culverin had been fired he watched heartsick as the invading infantrymen breastplates shining in the lantern light swarmed over the guns the militia manning the cannons had been sacrificed deliberately to draw in the rest of the invading force he felt his anger welling up in war the men who actually fought counted for nothing where was the rest of the militia were they waiting at the right perimeter as they were supposed to be he knew that the plan all along had been to let the guns be seized but now that it had happened he felt a demoralizing pang of loss and defeat why should the gunners be exposed to a musket attack surely there was some other way give fire he heard anthonys command and felt his heart jump the infantry was practically in pistol range this was going to be near to murder the trigger felt cold against his finger as he sighted into the dark directly toward one of the approaching tips of fire the gun flashed and kicked upward the parapet was suddenly bathed in light as the long line of muskets around him discharged he gasped for breath as the air in the trench turned to smokeburning charcoal and saltpeter the points of light danced in chaos and then he heard screams the man next to him a grizzled frightened freeholder had clambered up the loose dirt of the parapet to gain a better view of the fighting at the breastwork jeremy realized that this man too had never witnessed a battle before then came a row of flashes from where the red dots had been like the long string of exploding rockets fired over the thames on st georges day the freeholder beside him suddenly groaned and pitched backward his smoking matchlock plowing into the soft dirt of the parapet as he sprawled downward into the trench then another man farther down screamed and doubled over his gun halfcock your muskets disengage your match jeremy heard himself shouting prepare to recharge anthony had coached him that one of the primary duties of a field officer was to call out orders for priming and loading since men in battle often forgot crucial steps with a live matchcord attached to the hammer it was all too easy to set off a musket while you were ramming in the charge prime your pan he tried to bellow above the din as he began pouring priming powder from a flask on his bandolier into the flintlocks powder pan close your pan prepare to scour as he and the men quickly cleaned the barrels of their muskets then began to ram in more powder and shot he kept glancing toward the approaching infantry they too had paused to reload he could see the outlines of the men now and hear the shouts of officers which men were officers at the end of one row of infantrymen stood a tall man in a silver helmet who seemed to be issuing the commands for reloading he must be one jeremy realized hes faster at reloading than the others hes almost ready that man tall and comely would make a passing good companion to share a hunt afield and stalking grouse on a dewladen morning if we were both back in england now except hes here to kill me you he shouted a challenge as he climbed up the parapet readying his flintlock there were shouts from the militiamen behind him warning him to come down but he did not hear did not want to hear the officer in the silver helmet looked up and spotted the outline of the brash youth standing atop the parapet brandishing a musket he knew jeremy watched as the man drew up his musket and took aim he waited a moment in fascination savoring what it was like to face death then drew up his own flintlock and sighted the mans chest down the barrel there was a flash of light and a whistle past his ear the sound of a hurried horsefly then he squeezed the trigger the roundhead officer opened his mouth noiselessly and seemed to wilt backward he fumbled for his musket as it clattered against a jagged lump of coral beside him then sprawled onto the sand still as death his helmet circling in drunken arcs down the slope toward the surf sir mind you take cover in the flush sweeping over him he scarcely felt the hands tugging at his boots he was still gripping his flintlock knuckles white as the other militiamen dragged him back into the trench he lay panting at once dazed and exhilarated astonished at the sensations of his own mind and body the most curious thing of all was his marvelous new awareness of being alive he was adrift in a new realm of the spirit untroubled by the cacophony of musket discharges from all sides were turnin the whoresons back there were more shouts now even some cheers finally the din of battle cut through his reverie prepare to reload he was shouting again almost more to himself than to the others trying to be heard above the crack of musket fire that sounded down the length of the shoreline everywhere there were flashes yells screams the air in the trench was rancid and opaque with black smoke as he began reloading his musket he suddenly felt a new closeness almost a mystical union with the ragged planters around him they were a fraternity of men standing together defending their land why had anthony never told him that war could be like this could teach you brotherhood as well as hate he was priming his powder pan again trying to control the shake of his hands as he tilted the powder flask when he looked up to see that more red tips were emerging from the darkness of the sea another wave of roundhead infantry had landed in longboats there was no longer any purpose in calling out a loading sequence some men were priming now some ramming in powder and shot some threading their matchcord into the hammer some firing again all the discipline he had been taught so carefully by anthony was irrelevant most frightening of all while the first wave of infantry had dropped back to reload a fresh line of musketmen was advancing toward the parapet guns primed and ready fire and fall back in orderly fashion it was the voice of anthony the call to abandon the trench meant that all the roundhead infantry had landed now they were to be drawn inland with a feigned retreat the plan worked out was to resist strongly until all the infantry were ashore to damage them as much as possible using the protection of the parapet and then to fall back into the trees luring them away from their longboats when their lines were thinned hugh winston would lead a cavalry charge that would drive a wedge along the shore between the infantry and the sea cutting off their escape next the longboats would be driven off and the invading infantry slowly surrounded they would be harassed by irregular fire and with luck soon lose heart cut off from their escape route the demoralized invaders would have no choice but to surrender then so the strategy went commander morris and the admiral of the fleet would seek to negotiate jeremy fired blindly into the dark then reached down for his pike as he touched it his eyes met those of the dying freeholder lying beside him blood now streamed from a gash in the mans tattered jerkin while a red rivulet flowed in pulses from the corner of his mouth the sight flooded him with anger no he heard himself yelling as he groped down his bandolier for another chargeholder no retreat he turned to the startled men around him reload i say no retreat but thats the orders yor worship a bearded militiaman had already begun to scramble up the back side of the trench devil take the orders look he seized the militiamans jerkin and yanked him back then pointed to the dying freeholder at their feet aye thats roland jenkins may god rest his soul im like to be the one tellin his wife the freeholder gave a quick glance but theres nothin to be done yor worship orders are to retreat and i say damn the orders he was yelling to all the men now there are men here wounded and dying im staying with them what kind of soldiers are we to leave these men to die its wrong therere higher orders to be obeyed i say no an well all end up like this poor sod yor worship theres no helpin a man whos gone to meet his god the man threw his musket onto the fresh dirt at the bottom of the trench and turned to begin clambering to safety for my own part i can do just as well not greetin the almighty for a few years more jeremy seized his pike and marched down the trench ill gut any man who tries to run im in command here and i say we stand and fight now reload the men stared at him in disbelief do it i say he brandished the pike once more for emphasis then flung it down and seized a chargeholder on his bandolier without so much as a glance at the other men he began pouring the grainy black powder into the barrel of his musket the world was suddenly a white deafening roar later he remembered mainly the flash how as the smoke seared his eyes he recalled his own negligence that he had forgotten to scour the barrel it was a fools mistake a childs mistake he was still wiping his eyes seared and powderburned when he felt the musket being ripped from his hands as he groped to seize it back rough hands shoved him sprawling against the soft dirt of the trench his face plowed into the earth which still smelled fresh musky and ripe full of budding life weve got another one sor a brash voice sounded near his ear a right coxcomb this rebel damn you jeremy struck out only half aware of the cluster of infantrymen surrounding him just hold yourself lad there were shouts as several of the wounded militiamen were disarmed he tried to struggle but more hands brusquely wrestled him down this ones not taken any shot hes lively as a colt lets have some of that rope he felt his arms being pulled behind him and a rough cord lashed around his wrists there were sounds of a brief conference then a voice came kindly almost at his ear this is a firstclass fowling piece youre carrying ill wager youve brought down many a plump woodcock with it havent you lad a pause then again the gentle voice whats your name son damned to you whats your name there was a sickening hollowness in his gut again the fear and now hatredfor them and for himself its better for the time if i ask the questions and you answer them the voice emanated from a man wearing a silver helmet and sporting a short goatee why didnt you run like the rest of the rebels he laughed lightly as he moved closer jeremy felt a palm cup beneath his chin and felt his head being twisted upward by my word i think your musket misfired your face is black as a moors ill warrant youd have run too if you could have seen the way could it be youre naught but a coward too lad like all the rest the speaker turned to a young blueeyed man standing nearby well sir whod have reckoned itd be this easy you can tell admiral calvert this islands as good as his for the taking this militia of theirs is nothing but a batch of scared planters who scatter like rabbits the minute they hear a gunshot and a few young gallants like this one who scarcely know how to prime a musket theres no reason to fall back and hold this position wed as well just go on after them chase them back to bridgetown and have done with it jeremy felt a flush of victory they had fallen into the trap they thought barbados wouldnt fight in minutes theyd be surrounded by the militia and begging to surrender as soon as the counterattack began he would i think wed best take this one back to the ship to find out who he is and if he knows anything it was the man standing next to the goateed commander its a damned bother to have prisoners to feed but ill warrant this engagements got three days at most to go before they all throw down their arms and sue for peace damn your smug eyes jeremy reached down and seized his pike which had been lying unnoticed against the side of the trench he turned and faced the commander youll never even get back to your ship men died here tonight and they didnt die in vain by all thats holy what say lad pray whos to stop us the commander glanced at the pike seeming to ignore it he waved back several infantrymen who had quickly leveled their muskets at jeremy your bold militia here has taken to its heels one and all a bloody lot of royalist cowards therere braver men on barbados than you know youll not take me or any prisoners back to the ship youll see bridgetown soon enough all right at the point of a gun perhaps thats so lad but not at the point of a pike now put it away this little engagements over the man with the goatee was studying him with admiration youre a brave one lad too brave by my life or too foolish you dont suppose theres something behind this lads bluster the other man turned to the commander could it be their militia mightve run on purpose to thin out our lines for a counterattack the shouting had died down now as strings of captured militiamen were being assembled and placed under guard some were joking with their captors clearly relieved to be out of the battle jeremy suspected several had deliberately surrenderedsmall freeholders who didnt care a damn whether cromwells fleet took the island or not as he watched them with contempt he felt ashamed to be one of them suddenly the horror of it all swept over him and he flung down the pike in disgust now thats a good lad the commander nodded then turned to the other man vice admiral powlett for once you may be right in truth i was beginning to wonder the same thing this could all have been too easy by half with your permission sor ill put the young gallant here in with the rest of the rebels one of the infantrymen had seized jeremys arms no leave him here a minute the commander was pointing toward jeremy the lads no planter he doubtless knows more of whats going on than these others do something he said just now troubles me should i bring up the men and start to move in sir a captain of the infantry appeared out of the smoky haze that now enveloped the shoreline hold a while and keep your lines together its too quiet jeremy looked up and saw the goatee next to his face now tell me lad theres been enough killing here for one night as im a christian is there going to have to be more if you dont tell me itll be on your head i swear it this night is on your head sir and the roundhead rebels whove stolen the crown of england and now would try to steal barbados too the man waved the words aside lad im too old for that let your royalist rhetoric lie dead where it deserves to be my name is morris and if you know anything youll know ive seen my time fighting your royalists in the damned civil war but thats over thank god and i have no wish to start it up again now give me your name my name is for men i respect a sprightly answer lad on my honor theres spark about you the name on this musket looks to be walrond sor if i make it out right one of the infantrymen was handing the flintlock to morris walrond morris reached for the gun and examined it closely running his hand along the stock and studying the name etched on the lock a fine royalist name by chance any kin to sir anthony walrond my brother and hes your brother you dont mean it morris goatee twitched with surprise as he moved next to jeremy and studied his face god is my witness its scarcely a name you need blush to give out england never bred a braver finer soldier royalist or no is he your commander here tonight you couldnt have one better i have never heard my brother speak well of you sir anthony walrond speak well of a man whod rid england of his precious king morris laughed hed sooner have god strike him dead hes never had a good word to say for a puritan in his life but hes a worthy gentleman for it all and an honorable soldier in the field he turned to an officer standing nearby essex regroup the men i think wed best just hold this breastwork for now it could well be anthony walronds in command of this militia if he is you can wager hed not countenance a retreat unless he planned to counterattack i know his modus operandi and his pride aye sir as you will the captain turned and shouted men fall back and regroup form lines at the breastwork and reload now if you like master walrond i still can order all these men to march off into the dark and let your militia ambush and kill half of themlikely losing a hundred of their own in the trade would you really have me do it is this damned little island worth that much blood over and above whats already been spilt here tonight jeremy gazed down at the line of dead militiamen bodies torn by musket balls beyond them the roundhead infantry was collecting its own dead among them the man he himself had killed now it all seemed so pointless a blaze of musket fire flared from a position just north of the breastwork and a phalanx of whooping and yelling militiamen opened a charge down the north side of the beach jeremy watched morris eyes click the kindly man was suddenly gone with an oath he yelled for the prisoners to be hurried to the longboats and the devil take the wounded the infantry at the breastwork was returning the fire of the attacking militia but they were now badly outnumbered jeremy made out what could have been the tall form of anthony wielding a musket as he urged the militia forward then he was passed by a wall of men on horseback the cavalry the lead horse a bay gelding was ridden by a tall man holding a pistol in each hand the infantry holding the breastwork began retreating down the south steps on the side opposite the attackers jeremy could make out morris now ordering his men to make for the longboats get along with you rebel a pike punched him in the back and he was shoved in with the other prisoners now they were being hurried stumbling and confused in the direction of the water part of the barbados militia had already swarmed over the abandoned breastwork while others were riding along the shore muskets blazing hurrying to seal off the escape route to the longboats they intercepted the retreating infantry midway down the beach and the gunfire gave way to the sound of steel against steel as empty muskets were discarded in favor of pikes and swords jeremy felt the warm surf splash his legs and he looked up to see the outline of the waiting boats he and the rest of the prisoners were on the far south side of the breastwork away from the fighting forgotten now he was a prisoner of war directly ahead two longboats were being towed in through the surfwide hulking forms in the dim light with sails furled and rows of oarsmen midships as he watched them approach he suddenly remembered his lost flintlock a gift from anthony and the thought of its loss completed his mortification get in or be damned to you several infantrymen were splashing through the surf behind him now halfpikes raised urging on malingerers with the blades jeremy felt the hard gunwale of the longboat slam against his shoulder then hands reaching down for him and grabbing his arms he was yanked up wet and shivering in the freshening wind then shoved sprawling onto the boards one move any of you and therell be a pike in your guts an infantryman began tying the prisoners hands as jeremy felt the rough cords against his wrists he looked up and glanced over the side the retreating infantry had drawn itself into a protective circle kneedeep in the surf yelling for its longboats to be brought in closer at the perimeter of the circle two scrawny soldiers struggled to keep their footing in the pounding surf they both seemed weak almost staggering and when a large wave slammed against their backs they toppled headlong into the spray the barbados militiamen were there pulling them up and dragging them back through the surf to the beach so therell be prisoners on both sides he realized with relief now therell be hostages onshore too the battle seemed to be thinning now no one wanted to fight waist deep in the dark churning sea the barbados militiamen were slowing in their chase turning back to congratulate themselves that the invasion had been repelled finally as the longboats rowed closer and the infantrymen began pulling themselves aboard the militia halted content to end the rout by hurling curses above the roar of the surf at least we spiked most of the cannon and damn the rebels two officers were talking in the bow of the boat jeremy realized that both sides were planning to claim victory were there any wars ever lost he wondered though weve bloody little else to show for a nights work an oarsman in a dark woolen cap mumbled under his breath save this fine new collection of bellies to fill the man suddenly reached and ripped off a piece of jeremys lace collar this coxcombll learn soon enough what tis like to live on salt pork and slimy water same as the rest of us he flung the lace back in jeremys direction no fancy meat pies and brandied puddings for you lad a seamans fare will soon take the fat out of those cheeks ill warrant itll do you good young rebel ahead the proud bow of the rainbowe loomed above them in the dark lanterns dangling from its masts seamen in the longboat tossed a grapple over the bulwark of the mother ship and then a rope ladder was dropped jeremy felt his hands being untied next he was urged up the ladder shoved onto the deck and immediately surrounded by jeering seamen shirtless and wearing black stocking caps this is the one sir powlett was standing over him pointing next to him stood admiral edmond calvert i certainly can see hes a man of breeding just as you said calvert studied jeremys ornate doublet in the flickering lantern light aye powletts voice suddenly rose twould seem hes the brother of sir anthony walrond i say we strip him and put him to work carrying slops out of the gun deck as an example to all royalists not for a minute sir not so long as im in command of this fleet calvert seemed to bellow at powlett almost too loudly a seaman was roughly yanking jeremy to his feet and calvert turned on him you there release that young gentleman unless youd like a timely taste of the cat on your back he then approached and bowed ceremoniously admiral edmond calvert sir your most obedient servant jeremy stared in confusion and disbelief as the admiral continued walrond is it not jeremy walrond and im honored he turned and signaled to his quartermaster have brandy sent to my cabin perhaps master jeremy walrond would care to share a cup with us the seamen parted doffing their caps to the admiral as he escorted jeremy up the companionway toward the great cabin i can scarcely tell you master walrond how grateful i am to have the privilege of speaking face to face with a man of breeding from this island he reached to steady jeremy as he lost his footing in a roll of the ship then he smiled and gestured him ahead down the lanternlit walkway toward the stern first thing well try and locate some dry breeches for you and a brandy to drive off the chill he was still smiling as he shoved open a heavy wooden door the great cabin was empty save for colonel richard morris now seated at the center table and rubbing the dirt off jeremys flintlock musket morris laid it carefully across the table in front of him when he saw them enter calvert smiled toward him then continued i understand master walrond youve already made the acquaintance of our infantry commander morris rose and nodded as calvert gestured jeremy toward an ornately carved oak chair after weve all made ourselves comfortable master walrond i hope you and i and captain morris here can become better acquainted weve got much to talk over tonight he flashed a quick look at morris as he smiled mind you strictly as gentlemen chapter twelve katherine was relieved when she finally spotted him standing among the gunners his face and leather jerkin covered in a dark veneer of grime if anyone would know the truth behind the rumor spreading over the island that jeremy walrond had been killed surely hugh would she watched for a time collecting her composure after the ride up from bridgetown then tied her mare to the trunk of a bulletscarred palm and began working her way down the sandy slope toward the breastwork the midafternoon sun seared the jamestown emplacement with the full heat of the day and most of the gunners and militiamen were now shirtless and complaining about the need for rest as she neared the stone steps leading up to the guns the air rang with the sounds of hammering iron against iron and she realized winston and the men were still working to extract the spikes from the touch holes of the large english culverin he looked out to study the three english warships offshore barely visible through the smoke that mantled the bay then turned to thomas canninge his master gunner i think weve still got range tom try another round as soon as youre set and see if you cant hole them one last time canninge and his gunners were struggling to set one of the dutch demiculverin hammering a wooden wedge out from under the breech in order to elevate the muzzle aye looks like theyve started coming about but i think we might still give the whoresons one more taste all the large cannon in the breastwork had been disabled by the invading roundheads their infantry had overrun the guns long enough to drive a large iron nail deep into each guns touch hole the small opening in the breech through which the powder was ignited the facility would have been defenseless had not six of the dutch demiculverin been hauled out of the fort and hidden in a palm grove up the hill just prior to the attack as soon as the invasion was repelled and the breastwork cleared winston had summoned teams of horses to bring the small dutch cannon back his gunners had opened fire on the fleet at the first light of dawn catching the three english frigates which were still anchored within range and preparing for a long leisurely shelling of the jamestown settlement an artillery duel commenced as the warships immediately returned the fire but when winstons gunners honed their targeting they had prudently hoisted anchor and retired to the edge of range now while the militiamen worked with hammers and drills to finish removing the spikes from the large culverin the battle had become mostly noise and smoke katy gods life he finally noticed her as she emerged at the top of the steps his startled look quickly melted into a smile this is a surprise hugh i came to find out everythings fine weve got two of the spiked guns almost cleared and if we can keep fire cover with these dutch demis we should have all of them back in operation by nightfall he walked over to where she stood so move on back out of range itll not be much longer i think theyve decided to give up on the shelling toms already holed the rainbowe twice with these little ninepounders probably didnt do much harm but at least the roundheads know were here he glanced up as a puff of smoke rose from the gun deck of the warship nearest the shore the marsten moor round of fire before he finished the warning the men had already dropped their hammers and were plunging behind a pile of sandbags winstons hard grip sent her sprawling with him behind the mound of earthbrown sacks he rolled across her then covered her face with his sweaty jerkin this is how we brave fighting men stay alive an eighteenpound shot slammed against the base of the breastwork shaking the brick foundation beneath them after a few anxious moments the men clambered nervously over the bags to resume work she was still brushing the dirt from her riding habit when winston suddenly whirled on her his eyes fierce now you listen to me katy you cant stay down here its still too damned dangerous if you want to get killed therere lots of better ways his back was toward the sea when the second burst of black smoke erupted from the gun deck of the marsten moor hugh without thinking she reached for him together they rolled twice across the soft earth into the safety of the shielding bags as they lay next to the militiamen and gunners a round of cannon fire clipped the side of a battlement next to where they had been standing and hurtled a deadly spray of brick fragments into the sandbags several shards of brick ripped into the cloth and showered them with white grains he seemed embarrassed now as he slipped his arm under her and quietly hoisted her to her feet around them the militiamen were again returning to work on the disabled cannon i dont know whether to thank you katy or order you clapped in the brig for coming here in the first place but either way you cant stay so kindly wait up the hill till the sound of a forceful hammer stroke followed by a clear ring produced a cheer from the group of men who had been diligently hammering on one of the spiked cannon got her cleared yor worship one of the militiamen yelled toward winston fit as the day she was cast he abruptly turned and headed through the crowd to inspect the breech of the gun after scrutinizing the reopened touch hole he motioned toward a waiting gunner ladle in about five pounds of powder and see how she fires tom canninge called from the other end of the breastwork ive got the altitude about set on this little ninepounder capn its the best of the lot then see if you cant put a round through her portside gun deck his voice was increasingly strained good as done canninge ordered the demiculverin shifted a few degrees to the left then motioned for a linstock and lightly applied the burning end to the touch hole the gun roared and kicked backward in a cloud of dense oily smoke while the men squinted against the sun to watch a large hole splintered open along the portside bow of the marsten moor just above the waterline moments later a mate in the maintop began to unfurl topsls and after that the mainsail dropped in preparation to make for open sea lets give her a sendoff masters winston led the cheers and katherine realized he was deliberately trying to boost morale next he yelled down the sweating line of men hear me now our good master canninge has just earned us all a tot of killdevil by chance i think a keg may have arrived this morning on a cart that found its way up from bridgetown we should take a look up by that large tree on the left he paused and waited for the hoorahs to subside under my command the men always drink first then officers he waved a dismissal as you will masters as the gunners and militiamen threw down their tools and began to bustle in the direction of the liquor he turned to katherine and his voice dropped now that were both still alive maybe we can talk why dont we try and find some shade ourselves you seem exhausted as she looked at him realizing that even his brown eyes seemed pale she found herself almost reluctant to raise the matter of jeremy maybe he had enough to worry about bonetired is more the word but weve got the fleet out of range for a while now we just have to worry about what theyll think to try next hearing the open concern in his voice she wrapped a consoling arm about his waist as they walked down the stone steps of the abandoned breastwork but the invasion failed this round is won isnt it if you can call that massacre last night winning then i suppose you could say so he heaved a weary sigh planters make poor soldiers katy as best i can tell we lost eighteen men killed outright and a lot more were wounded some of them will doubtless die too given this heat so all we did was drive the roundheads back to sea for a while but at a terrible cost he looked down they took some prisoners two longboats full probably about thirty men though we dont really know yet whos captured or missing or just gone off to hide well thats not so many true enough we managed to take a few prisoners ourselves maybe half a dozen or so i guess maybe you didnt hear jeremy walrond has disappeared we think he was taken prisoner thank god then hes not dead she stopped still but captured poor jeremy hed probably sooner have been killed he was so proud anthonys proud too and hes taking it very hard when we heard jeremy was missing i offered to take the command here to let him go back to bridgetown and see if he was with the wounded then somebody suggested that jeremy probably had surrendered and anthony threatened to kill the man it was plain he needed some rest she stood silent for a moment then looked away sadly what do you think will happen now winston followed her gaze out toward the horizon maybe everybody will try to negotiate some more its getting complicated all of a sudden with prisoners now part of it unfortunately we didnt manage to take any officers just infantrymost of them so weak from scurvy the fleets probably just as glad to have them gone before they died anyway whatll happen to jeremy you dont suppose theyd hang him i doubt that he waved his hand so far its a civilized war but they may ask a price to send him back if they find out hes anthonys brother its very bad what do you suppose we can do not much i can think of maybe theyll just try to wait us out a bit he reached down and lightly brushed some of the dirt and sand from her hair then he wiped his brow glanced at the sun and urged her on toward the grove of trees id guess its a matter now of who can hold out longest he slipped his arm about her waist and glanced down and howre you holding up katy i suppose im fine she leaned against him trying to ignore the heat and the stares of some of the men finally she gave a mirthless laugh no do you want the truth im more worried than ever isnt it odd just when we seem to be standing firm she looked up at his smokesmeared cheeks can we go hide away from here i think your morale could do with a boost too youre looking at a somewhat disoriented breastwork commander make that acting commander but anthonys supposed to be back around now to relieve me whenever he gets here we can ride back over to bridgetown if i can manage to locate a horse he helped her down beneath the shade of a spreading manchineel tree kicking away several of the poisonous apples that lay rotting around the trunk then he flopped down beside her this is one of the hardest things ive ever tried katy holding defenses together when half the men truly dont care a damn whether we win or lose but its the only thing i know to do tell me if you can think of anything better is that all youve thought about lately hugh she ran a hand along his thigh its all i care to think about for the time being she pulled back sharply well commander please dont think i have nothing else to occupy my mind with except you but that doesnt mean ive just forgotten you entirely i havent forgotten you either katy gods life he picked up a twig and tapped it against one of the poison apples tell me what does the governor of barbados think about his only daughter keeping company with the likes of me i do what i choose she pressed against him anyway its not what he says that troubles me its what i say to myself ive always been able to control my feelings but somehow not with you and i hate myself for it i truly do im probably a poor choice for the object of your feelings she laughed and squeezed his hand god help me as if i didnt already know that whod ever have thought id be going about half in love with a man like you i thought you once said you werent interested in falling in love he kissed her lightly probably a safe idea i dont know how many of us are going to live through this before she could respond he rose on one elbow and pointed toward a pair of horses approaching from the south it looks like we may get back to bridgetown after all i think thats briggs and hes brought anthony with him its odds they both distrust me only slightly more than they hate each other but its enough to make them allies for a while well theyre welcome to have back this command any time they want it then we can ride in together i dont think anthonys going to like that idea but its your affair god knows i know better than to try and give you advice she laughed then youre starting to understand me better than i thought let me just have a word with anthony about the condition of the ordnance and make some gunnery assignments he began to pull himself up then maybe well retire down to the defiance for a while ive missed her he stooped and kissed the top of her head as he rose to his feet and ive missed you too truly anthony walrond reined in his dun mare and stared dumbly toward the shore as he and briggs emerged from the trees the night before it had been a melee of muskets commands screams now it was a smoky landscape strewn with lost helmets and bandoliers and stained with dark splotches where men had fallen in its peacefulness it made the battle seem scarcely more than a violent dream a lost episode that existed only in mans flawed memory not in time battles he reflected were always a matter of chance you plan strategies for days devise elaborate tactics try to guess what you would do if you were the foe but in the end little of it really matters a man panics or a horse stumbles or your musket fails to fire and suddenly nothing happens the way you thought it becomes a contest of bravery luck happenstance whether you win or lose its likely as not for reasons you never envisioned in a way last nights episode was no different dick morris and his roundheads lost more men than they should have since they only expected militia at the breastwork the parapet caught them by surprise also they seemed deceived at first by the feigned retreat the bird limping and flopping away from her nest to lure the fox except this time the fox suddenly grew wise the limping bird somehow bungled its part caused the fox to smell a trap which left no recourse but to launch a bloody counterattack directly on the breastwork jeremy they claimed he was surrounded and taken while reloading his musket holding his position but why he knew the orders he disobeyed he disobeyed anthony was still gripping the reins his knuckles white when briggs broke the silence as usual its a good thing i rode over to check wherere the men is that them drinking in the shade whilst the breastwork is left unattended he drew his horse alongside anthonys and squinted against the sun winston has a peculiar idea of discipline by my life these men are not a gang of your african cane cutters hes got enough sense to know he cant work them all day in the sun ill wager full half of them would just as soon not be here at all now youre beginning to sound like him briggs spotted the tall seaman walking up the shore and reined around and in truth sir im starting to question whether either of you should be kept in charge of this breastwork well after last night i propose you could just as well put a scullery wench in command here at jamestown for all the difference it would make walrond was studying the breastwork as they neared the shore theres not likely to be another attempt at a landing along here itd be too costly and morris knows it no commander in the english army would be that foolhardy doubtless he thought hed managed to spike all our ordnance and he just planned to sit back and shell the settlement here all day today it looks as if they took a few rounds of shot this morning but the shelling seems over id guess winstons lads managed to hold their own aye god be praised for the dutchmen and their demi culverin briggs touched his black hat toward the approaching figure your servant captain how goes it our gunners put some shot into the rainbowe and the marsten moor before they weighed anchor and made way out to sea id venture the better part of the ordnance here should be serviceable again by nightfall he nodded to walrond any news of the prisoners this morning all the field commanders brought in reports the royalists voice was matteroffact as best we can tell twentynine of our men were taken out to the rainbowe last night and jeremy was among their number the way somebody said there was no mistake about that it appears likely he looked away to cover his embarrassment and spotted katherine walking toward them up the beach he adjusted his eyepatch in anger and glanced back sharply at winston could it be the rumors were all too true if so then damn him damn her i trust miss bedford has already been informed a few minutes ago well sir i fancy her dismay did not go uncomforted he swung down from the saddle i can assume duties here now and relieve you sir she has to be taken home this is scarcely the place for a woman youre welcome to have it i just need to make a few gunnery assignments of my own men but id advise you to let the lads cool off a bit before starting them working again he turned to hold the reins of briggs horse as the planter began dismounting one other thing before i go id like a word with you master briggs considering whats happened id like it if youd convey a message from me to the council speak your mind sir briggs eased himself out of the saddle and dropped down his heavy boots settled into the loose sand i lost three seamen last night good men when we charged the breastwork theyll be buried tomorrow with all the others killed it was a hard night for us all sir dont try my patience master briggs im not in the mood he paused to wait as katherine joined the circle katherine your servant anthony coldly doffed his hat in greeting here to review the militia i came to find out about jeremy im still hoping there must be some mistake he abruptly turned away well now that i know i suppose ill go back she looked at him elegant and cool even now and told herself she should be more embarrassed than she felt having him see her here with hugh what was he really thinking katy wait im glad youre here winston motioned her forward ignoring anthonys pained look perhaps itd be well for you to hear this too maybe you can convey what i want to say to the assembly for whatever good it may do he turned back i want to tell you all that ive concluded this militia is untrained undisciplined and whats worse uninterested in getting shot all to hell defending barbados i hear them asking each other why theyre fighting at all were holding them off nicely sir briggs interjected im proud of hear me i tell you we were just lucky last night morris men might well have held the breastwork if they hadnt panicked the next time round we may not be as fortunate he fixed briggs squarely what you and the council have to decide is whether youre willing to do whats necessary to win were doing everything we can its not enough next time morris will doubtless try and land every man he has when he does i wonder if this militia will even bother to meet them i dont agree with you there sir briggs was frowning but then i suppose you figure youve got some idea nobody else has thought of yet do you want to hear it id like to hear it anthony walrond had finished hobbling his mare and stepped next to them all right first i say prune out the small freeholders send any of them home who want to go he turned to walrond then get rid of any of the royalists who dont have battle experience they want to give orders but they dont know what theyre about the rest of the men dont like it he paused carefully i dont like it either youre presumptuous sir if i may say anthony glared you may say what you please but if you dont do something about morale this wars as good as over it most certainly will be if we dismiss most of the militia which is what it would mean if we did what you just said i didnt say you dont need a militia you just need men in it whore ready to stand and fight briggs examined him quizzically but if we dismissed all these halfhearted freeholders thered be scarcely any free men left on the island to take their place thats right youd have to make some free men he gestured toward the hills inland do you realize therere hundreds of first class fighting men here now men with battle experience who could massacre morris forces if given a chance and more to the point if you gave them something to fight for who do you mean you know who these new africans theyve got battle experience i can tell just by looking at them i dont know how many of them have ever handled a musket but id wager a lot of them can shoot make them part of your militia and morris infantrymenll never know what hit them im damned if well arm these savages and let them loose on the island next thing theyd try and take over itd be the end of slavery which means the end of sugar doesnt have to be let them work for wage and start treating them like men then instead of worrying about having them at your back youd have them holding your defenses thats about the damnedest idea ive ever come across briggs spat into the sand then youve got a choice you can have slavery or you can win independence either you get them to help or you end up a slave to the commonwealth yourself he glanced at katherine then back at briggs as he continued and the same goes for your indentures how in hell do you expect this island to hold out against england when half the men here would just as soon see you lose but give the slaves and the indentures a stake in this and youll have a good ten or fifteen thousand fighting men here morris has maybe three four hundred hell never take barbados i want you to tell that to the council ill be party to no such undertaking briggs squinted through the sunshine then give my regards to the admiral when you sit down to sign the surrender i give you a week at most he turned and touched katherines arm katy if youd like me to see you home then wait over there by that shade tree while i make gunnery assignments atiba moved noiselessly along the wet sand of the shore crouched low the wind in his face just as he had once stalked a wounded leopard in the forest three days north of ife this part of the harbor was almost deserted now only two frigates remained and they were both lodged in the sand immobile one was the great stinking ship that had brought him to this forlorn place he hated it had vowed never to be on it again furthermore tonight its decks were crowded with drinking singing branco the other one would have to supply what he neededthe one belonging to the tall ingles branco with the mark on his cheek he secured the stolen machete in his waistwrap and waded into the water when the first salty wave curved over him he leaned into it with his shoulder and began to swimout away from the shore circling around to approach the ship from the side facing the sea as he swam he thought again of what he must do it was not a mission of his choosing he had finally agreed to come because there was no other way to placate the elders until last night he had not realized how much they feared the arms of the branco we must be like the bulrush not like brittle grass tahajo the oldest and hence presumed the wisest had declared a bulrush mat will bend a grass mat breaks to pieces do not be brittle grass atiba be like the bulrush do what we ask of you tahajos wisdom is known throughout ife obewole the strongest of them all had next conceded his own fear remember its said you cannot go to war with only a stick in your hand you must carry a crossbow atiba had intended the meeting in his hut to be their final council of war last evening was carefully chosen auspicious it was the fourth night of the new moon on the island of barbados in ife it would have been the fourth day of a new month and also the last day of the weeka cycle of four days dedicated to major gods of the yoruba pantheon shango obatala orunmila and ogun the appearance of the new moon was important and signified much by telling the beginning of the month it scheduled which days would be market days which were sacred what god was responsible for the birth of a child they had waited quietly in his thatched hut as twilight settled across the fields of cane swallows twittered among the tall palms and the halflight was spotted with darting bats the heat of the long day still immersed the hillside on the far western horizon where the sea disappeared into the caribbean mist three of the great ships of the ingles fleet had begun preparing their sails they too seemed to be waiting for the appearance of the new yoruba moon he began with a review of their weapons there would be difficulties since the cane knives had been removed from the slave quarters on most of the plantations and secured in the great house it would be necessary to break in and take them back which meant the advantage of surprise would be lost for spears they would have to try and seize some of the pikes the branco now had in readiness to protect the island from the fleet again that meant bloodshed also their numbers were still uncertain all the yoruba had agreed to rise up and final preparations had been coordinated across the island using the iya ilu drum but the other men of africa what of them the ibo nursed historic hatreds toward the yoruba and their response to the plan for rebellion had been to shift on their feet spit on the ground and agree to nothing there were also ashanti and mandingo these he trusted even less than the ibo command would be difficult there were too many languages too many loyalties too many ancient grievances the men in the hut finally concluded that only the yoruba could be relied upon when the day of war comes you only trust your own blood your own gods after the moon had disappeared hed cast the cowries praying ogun would presage the defeat of the branco the men required an omen and an omen there had been at that exact moment the silence of the night was rent by sounds of gunfire rising up from the western shore faint staccato pops through the trees they were as drumbeats that carried no words yet their message was unmistakable ogun the god of war had spokennot through the pattern in the cowries on a tray but with his own voice fear suddenly gripped the men in the hut what was oguns purpose in answering the cowries this way thus their council of war had dissolved in meaningless talk and confusion finally the misgivings of the elders emerged there must be they said no rising against the branco unless success was assured the elder tahajo recalled the famous proverb aki ida owo le ohun ti ako le igbea man should not attempt to raise up something he cannot lift the other men had nodded gravely taking his mouthing of this commonplace to demonstrate great sagacity then young derin in a flagrant breach of etiquette amongst a council of elders had dared to cite an opposing parable bi eya ba di ekun eran ni ikpa dze when the wild cat becomes a leopard it can devour great beasts we must become brave like the leopard he urged when the branco see our boldness they will quake with fear as we go to war against them tahajo had listened tolerantly then countered again alak atanpo oju ko le ita eran pahe who has only his eyebrow for a crossbow can never kill an animal so it had continued long into the night atiba had no choice but to wait until the elders decided finally they agreed that ogun would have them go to war only if they had weapons to match those of the branco that was the message in the gunfire that had erupted the moment the cowries were cast atiba must assure them he could find muskets or there would be no rebellion he stroked silently on through the surf now the dark outline of the brancos ship loomed above him still deserted soon he would find what he had come to learn he grasped a saltencrusted rope ladder which dangled from the side and pulled out of the water he did not bother using the rungs instead he lifted himself directly up his feet were noiseless as he dropped onto the deck a quick reconnaissance revealed only one sentry a fat branco snoring loudly in a chair on the high deck at the back of the ship he slipped up the companionway gripping each weathered board with his toes and stood over the man wondering if he should kill him lest he waken suddenly and sound an alarm then he remembered the words of shango that night in the mill house it would be a bad omen to spill innocent blood before the rebellion even began shango had declared he would only countenance the killing of men who threatened harm also lying beside the man was an empty flask which surely had contained the strong wine made from cane this snoring branco would not soon awaken he turned and inched his way back down the companion way the only sounds now were the gentle splash of surf against the side of the ship and the distant chirp of crickets from the shore he moved stealthily along the creaking boards until he reached the locked door at the front of the ship the place where the branco captains stored their weapons he tried to still his heart feeling it begin to race with anticipation if there were weapons here muskets or pikes they would be easy to seize when the moment came to rise up there would be no need to storm the plantation houses for guns and spears and their plans could proceed in total secrecy till the moment the branco slaveholders were surprised and cut down he recalled the rumor that the branco who owned this ship had bought and freed two hundred white slaves and then had given some of them weapons to fight the warriors of the ingles fleet surely he had more muskets and pikes than any of the branco planters how many would be left he slipped the machete from his waistband and wedged it silently under a hinge on the heavy wooden door the wood was old and the nails pulled easily when the three hinges had been removed he laid the machete on the deck and lifted the door around the interior of the focsle was dark but he dared not try to make a light the risk was too great that he might set off any gunpowder stored here instead he felt his way forward the space was crowded with racks and in them were rows of new pikes and halfpikes hundreds then his hand touched a row of long steel cylinders musket barrels ogun had answered their prayers this ship had an arsenal that would equip an entire army a cache that would ensure their victory the second week following seven days hence the time sacred to ogun he would bring the men and they would overwhelm the ship seize the weapons he had turned to grope his way back to the deck when he first saw the two silhouettes against the dim light of the doorway a tall man was there blocking his exit and next to him was the outline of a branco woman john what in the name of hell are you doing in the focsle the voice sounded tired and annoyed is this how you stand watch hugh take care it was the voice of the branco woman he remembered from the first night in the boiling house he froze against a wall and reached for his machete it was missing like a fool hed left it outside quietly he lifted one of the pikes from the rack and inched slowly toward the figures in the doorway through the dark came a shout from the other end of the deck the sleeping branco had awakened gods wounds capn im watching this ship like a hawk over a henhouse theres no need to be carry in on the man laughed lest you upset the lady john is that you the tall mans voice quickened then by jesus whos atiba lunged toward the doorway his pike aimed at the tall shadow the man had already feinted back against the shrouds he carried no sword but a pistol had appeared in his right hand as though by magic with the other he shoved the branco woman back against the shrouds out of reach the pike missed him tangled in a knot of lines dangling from the mast and was lost then the glint of his machete caught atibas notice and he dropped toward the darkness of the deck he rolled twice bringing himself within reach of its wooden handle he was on his feet swinging for the man when he heard the crack of the pistol and felt a tremor in his wrist the tip of the machete blade sang into the night but the stump was still left and still deadly now the fight would be at close quarters he told himself he welcomed thatand sprang for the dark silhouette he was thrusting the blade upward toward the tall mans neck when he heard an unexpected click from the pistol barrel followed by a hard voice it was a threat that needed no translation no by god or ill blow your bloody head off the hot muzzle of the pistol was against his cheek but his blade was against the mans throat meu deus briggs yoruba the man quickly switched to portuguese felicitacao senhor youre every bit as fast as id thought shall we call it a draw it was the branco the one who had freed his slaves the last man on the island he wished to kill shango would be incensed i think one of us must die he held the broken blade hard against the flesh and he could almost feel the pulse of blood just beneath the skin its both of us or neither by jesus think about that your pistol had only one bullet it is gone take a look and youll see therere two barrels the tall man had not wavered shall i just blow the thievin bastard to hell capn it was the voice of the man who had been asleep from the corner of his eye atiba could see him standing by the foremast there was the click of a flintlock being cocked no john hes like to slit my throat in the bargain with whats left of his godcursed machete the words were in english then the man switched back to portuguese a trade senhor a life for a life in ife we say we cannot dwell in a house together without speaking to one another but if you betray me you will answer for it to all my clan remember that the broken machete slowly pulled away then dropped to the deck hold the musket on him john i dont know whether to trust these africans again portuguese life for life agreed he lowered the pistol then slipped it into his belt with an easy motion he pulled down a lantern hanging from the shrouds and struck a flint to it a warm glow illuminated the open door of the focsle and the tanned face of the branco woman now atiba the yoruba you be gone and ill forget you were ever here briggs would likely have you whipped into raw meat for his dogs if he ever found out about this the branco was looking into his eyes but you probably already know that i salute your courage senhor truth is i once thought about having you help me help you he studied the brancos face for what purpose if you werent too stubborn to take orders id planned to train you into a firstclass fighting man maybe make you secondincommand for a little war of my own against the spaniards the man was outlined in the pale light id hoped we might fight together instead of against each other that is a strange idea for a branco he was studying the scar on the tall mans cheek but then you have the mark on your cheek like the clan sign of a yoruba perhaps the place you got it taught you something of brotherhood as well it was a long time past though maybe it did at that i do know im still a brother to any man i like you were once in that category senhor till you came on my ship trying to knife me now youd best tell me what youre doing here i wanted to see your ship well youve seen it you also tore off some hinges i will replace them for you he smiled wrapping a razor preserves its sharpness the man seemed momentarily startled then a look of realization spread through his eyes finally he turned and spoke in english to the fat branco holding the musket john fetch a hammer and some fresh nails from below decks you know where ships carpenter keeps them whatre you saying capn the fat branco had not moved youd have me go aft an the musket im holdin on the bastard whos to handle that whilst im gone ill take it the branco woman stepped forward give it to her youd best keep a close eye capn the fat man hesitated i think this oned be a near match for you just fetch the hammer john aye he reluctantly passed the musket and began backing slowly toward the hatch leading to the lower deck atiba watched him disappear into the dark then turned back to winston you do not own slaves senhor yet you do nothing about those on this island who do what goes on here is not my affair other men can do what they like in ife we say he who claps hands for the fool to dance is no better than the fool he glanced back at the arsenal stored in the dark room behind him if you do nothing to right a wrong then are you not an accomplice the man suddenly seemed to understand everything without a word he walked over and shoved the door against the open focsle let me give you some wisdom from this side of the wide ocean my friend i think all the drumming ive been hearing and now this means youre planning some kind of revolt im not going to help you and im damned if youre going to use any of my muskets he reached up and adjusted the lantern ive done everything i can to end slavery nobody on this island listens to me so whatever you do is up to you but without weapons we have no chance of winning our freedom youve got no chance in any case but if you steal some of these muskets of mine youll just manage to kill a lot of people before you have to surrender and be hanged he watched the fat man emerge from the hatch id hate to see you hanged atiba the yoruba whats the savage got to say for himself capn the man was carrying a hammer was he plannin to make off with a few o those new flintlocks we got up at nevis i think he was just exploring john the words were in english now help him put the door back and show him how to fix the hinges as you will capn but keep an eye on him will you hes like to kill the both of us if he takes a mind katy keep him covered god but hes frightening what were you two talking about wed best go into that later he glanced at mewes john give him the hammer the fat branco reluctantly surrendered the tool then warily reached to hold the hinges in place there was a succession of quick powerful strokes and the door was aligned and swinging better than before now go on back to briggs plantation and pray to whatever gods you have that he doesnt find out you were gone tonight he picked up the broken machete and passed it over take this youre going to need it you know we will need more than this atiba reached for the handle turned the broken blade in the light then slipped it into his waistband thats right what you need is to leam how to wait this island is about to be brought to its knees by the new government of england in a way its thanks to you when the government on this island falls something may happen about slavery though im not sure what he took down the lantern from the shrouds but if you start killing whites now i can assure you youre not apt to live very long no matter who rules i will not continue to live as a slave i can understand that but you wont be using my flintlocks whilst getting yourself killed he held the lantern above the rope ladder and gestured for atiba to climb down into the shallow surf never ever try stealing muskets from my ship mark it well atiba threw one leg over the gunwale and grasped a deadeye to steady himself i think you will help us when the time comes you speak like a yoruba he slipped over the side with a splash and vanished into the dark gods blood capn but thats a scary one mewes stared after him nervously i got the feelin he seemed to know you ive seen him a time or two before he retrieved the musket from katherine and handed it back to mewes then he doused the lantern come on katy lets have a brandy i could use two as they entered the companionway leading aft to the great cabin he called back by the way john itd be just as well not to mention to anybody that he was here can i depend on you aye as you will he slipped his arm about katherines waist and pushed open the door of the cabin it was musty and hot ive got a feeling that african thinks hes coming back for the muskets katy but ill not have it whatll you do she reached back and began to loosen the knot on her bodice sensing a tiny pounding in her chest i plan to see to it he gets a surprise instead he lit the lamp then pulled off his sweaty jerkin and tossed it into the corner enough lets have a taste of you he circled his arms around her and pulled her next to him as he kissed her he reached back and started unlacing her bodice then he whispered in her ear welcome back aboard chapter thirteen with every step jeremy took the wooded trail leading inland from oistins bay felt more perilous more alien why did the rows of stumps once so familiar no longer seem right why had he forgotten the spots in the path where the puddles never dried between rains only congealed to turgid glue he had ridden it horseback many a time but now as he trudged up the slope his boots still wet from the surf he found he could remember almost nothing at all this dark tangle of palms and bramble could scarcely be the direction home but the way home it was the upland plantation of anthony walrond was a wooded hundred and eighty acre tract that lay one mile inland from the settlement around oistins bay itself a haphazard collection of clapboard taverns and hewnlog tobacco sheds on the southern windward side of the island the small harbor at oistins was host to an occasional dutch frigate or a small merchant vessel from virginia or new england but there was not enough tobacco or cotton to justify a major landing it was however the ideal place to run a small shallop ashore from a ship of the fleet he reached a familiar arch of palms and turned right starting the long climb along the weedclogged path between the trees that led up to the house as he gripped his flintlock and listened to the warbling of night birds and the menacing clatter of land crabs he reflected sadly that he was the only man on barbados who knew precisely what lay in store he had received a full briefing from the admiral of the fleet aboard the rainbowe what would anthony do when he heard he tried to sort out once more what had happened beginning with that evening now only two days past when admiral calvert had passed him the first tankard if i may presume to say its a genuine honor to share a cup with you master walrond calverts dark eyes had seemed to burn with determination as he eased back into his sea chair and absently adjusted his long white cuffs hed been wearing a black doublet with wide white epaulettes and a pristine bib collar all fairly crackling with starch and to finally have a word with a man of breeding from this infernal settlement jeremy remembered taking a gingerly sip of the brandy hoping perhaps it might somehow ease the pain of his humiliation still ringing in his ears were the screams of dying men the volleys of musket fire the curses of the roundhead infantry in the longboat but the liquor only served to sharpen his horrifying memory of the man he had killed less than an hour before his finger on the trigger of the ornate flintlock now resting so innocently on the oak table between them the question we all have to ask ourselves is how long this damnable state of affairs can be allowed to go on englishmen killing their own kind calvert had posed the question more to the air than to the others in the room colonel morris his face still smeared with powder smoke had shifted his glance back and forth between them and said nothing he clearly was impatient at being summoned to the great cabin when there were wounded to attend why jeremy had found himself wondering was morris present at all where was the brash vice admiral the man who had wanted him imprisoned below decks what was the hidden threat behind calverts toocordial smiles but the admiral betrayed nothing as he continued the civil war is over may almighty god forgive us for it and i say its past time we started healing the wounds jeremy had listened as the silence once more settled around them for the first time hed become aware of the creaking of the boards as the rainbowe groaned at anchor after so much death hed found himself thinking you begin to notice the quietness more your senses are honed could it be even creatures of the field are the same does the lowly hare feel life more exquisitely when hounds baying on its scent it hovers quivering in the grass he wondered what he would do if the musket on the table were primed and in his hands would he raise it up and destroy this man who had come to conquer the last safe place on earth left for him as he tried to still the painful throb in his temples calvert continued im a plainspeaking seaman master walrond nothing more though my father served in your late kings court watching his catholic queen prance amongst her halfdressed jezebels i never had any part of it but ive seen dead men enough whose spilled blood is on that kings head for all his curls and silks calvert had suddenly seemed to remember himself and rose to pour a tankard for morris he took another sip from his own then turned back and theres apt to be more killing now here in the americas before this affairs finished but to what purpose sirrah i ask you we both know the island cant hold out forever weve got her bottled now with this blockade and the bottles corked whats more i know for a fact youre all but out of meat and bread whilst weve made free with all the victuals these interloping hollanders in carlisle bay kindly had waiting to supply us so my menll be feasting on capon and port whilst your planters are starving with nothing in the larder save tobacco and cane youve never troubled to grow enough edibles here since you could always buy from these hollanders and now its going to be your downfall calverts eyes had flashed grimly in the lantern light when morris had stirred as though to speak hed silenced the commander with a brisk wave of his hand then continued but were not planning just to wait and watch that i can promise you colonel morris here will tell you hes not going to sleep easy till this island is his at the break of day hell commence his first shelling right here at jamestown where hes spiked the ordnance youll see that spot breastwork and the rest turned to rubble by nightfall tomorrow no colonel morris is not of my mind hes not a country angler whod sit and wait for his line to bob hes a man wholl wade in and take his perch with both hands calvert had sighed and risen to open the windows at the stern cool air washed over them bringing with it the moans of wounded men from the deck above jeremy noted the windows had been severely damaged by cannon fire and temporarily repaired with wood rather than leaded glass calvert listened glumly for a moment then shoved the windows closed and turned back but whats the point of it master walrond by all thats holy youll never take barbados blockade or no jeremy had tried to meet the glare in calverts eyes well never surrender to cromwell and this rabble army ah but take you we will sir or im not a christian the only question is when he had paused to frown and how am i to be forced to humble this place till theres nothing left to shell her ports burn her crops i daresay youre not fully aware whats in store for this island but its time somebody heard and listened i came here with peace in mind praying your governor and assembly would have the sense to recognize the commonwealth if i was met with defiance my orders were to bring barbados to its knees man and boy to see every pocket of resistance ferreted out more than that youd best know ill not be staying here forever therell be others to follow and that young stalwart you met out on decks my vice admiral may well claim the only way to keep the island cooperative is to install a permanent garrison believe me when i tell you hed as soon hang a royalist as bag a partridge think on that what its apt to be like here if you force me to give him free rein jeremy had felt calverts eyes bore into him but master walrond i think barbados the americas deserve better he glanced toward morris and ill warrant our commander here feels much the same neither of us wants fire and sword for this place nor i feel safe in thinking does anyone on this island but someone here has got to understand our purpose and harken to reason or its going to be damnation for your settlement and for the rest of the americas then thats what itll be if you think youve got the means to attempt it jeremy had pulled himself upright in the chair but you try landing on this island again and well meet you on the beaches with twice the men youve got just like tonight but why be so foolhardy lad ill grant therere those on this island who have no brief for the commonwealth well and good but know thisall we need from the americas is cooperation plain as that we dont ask servitude he lowered his voice in gods name sir this island need merely put an end to its rebellious talk agree to recognize parliament and we can dispense with any more bloodletting then calvert had proceeded to outline a new offer its terms were more generoushed hammered home time and againthan anyone on the island had any cause to expect the point he had emphasized most strongly was that jeremy walrond stood at the watershed of history on one side was war starvation ignominy on the other moderation and a new future ahead the log gables of the walrond plantation house rose out of the darkness on his left through the trees were the thatched leantos of the indentures a scattering of smoky fires told him some of the servants or their women were still about frying corn mush for supper the indentures few remaining turkeys and pigs were penned now and the pathway was mostly quiet the only sounds came from clouds of stinging gnats those pernicious merrywings whose bite could raise a welt for a whole day their tiny bugles sending a chorus through the dark in the evening stillness the faint stench of rotting corn husks wafted from a pile in which pigs rooted behind the indentures quarters while the more pungent odor of human wastes emanated from the small vegetable patches farther back he heard occasional voices in the dark curses from the men and the irish singsong of women but no one in the indenture compound saw or heard him pass ahead the halfshuttered windows of the plantation house glimmered with the light of candles it meant he realized with relief that anthony was home that hed lit the pewter candelabra hanging over their pine dining table he stopped for a moment to think and to catch his breath then moved on past the front portico toward the servants entrance at the rear of the house there was good reason not to announce his arrival publicly what he had to say was for anthony and anthony alone as he passed one of the windows he could just make out a figure seated at the table tankard in hand the man wore a white kerchief around his neck and a doublet of brown silk puffed at the shoulders his dark brown hat rested next to him on the table its white plume glistening in the dull light as he pushed on he noticed that the chimney of the log cookroom in back of the house gave off no smoke meaning anthonys servants had already been dismissed for the night good the time could not have been better ahead now just at the corner was the back doorway it was ajar and unlatched as usual the help had been careless as they crept away with meat scraps from anthonys table to season their own bland meal he paused at the first step and tried to think how he would begin for no reason at all he found himself staring up at the stars the heavens in the caribbees always reminded him of one dusk many years ago when he had first seen london from afara jewel box of tiny sparklers hinting of riches intrigues delicious secrets what waited there amidst those london lights he had pondered those thousands of flickering candles and cab lanterns was it as joyful as it seemed or was misery there too as deep and irreducible as his own that answer never came but now this canopy of stars above the caribbees mantled a place of strife and despair wrenching as man could devise he gently pushed open the splitlog door and slipped through the back hallway was narrow and unlighted but its walls were shadowed from the blaze of distant candles he remembered that anthony always lit extra tapers when he was morose as though the burning wicks might somehow rekindle his own spirit as he moved through the roughhewn archway leading into the main room he saw the seated figure draw back with a start and reach for the pistol lying on the table by god what suddenly the chair was kicked away and the man was rushing forward with open arms jeremy gods life its you where in heavens name have you been anthony wrapped him in his arms we heard youd been taken by morris and the roundheads he drew back and gazed in disbelief and joy are you well lad were you wounded ive been with admiral calvert on the rainbowe he heard his own voice and its sound almost made him start youve been anthonys eyes narrowed slightly then you managed to escape did you commandeer a longboat for the love of god lad what happened what happened he almost laughed at the question would that any man ever knew he found himself thinking what ever happens save that life flows on of its own will and drags you with it willynilly without a word he carefully settled his flintlock in the corner next to the rack that held anthonys own gunsthree matchlocks and two flintlocksand slumped into a vacant chair by the table ive a thirst he glanced distractedly about the room barely remembering it for the past two daysnow it seemed like an entire agelife had been a ship is there brandy aye theres a flask in the sideboard as always anthony examined him curiously jeremy rarely drank anything stronger than madeira wine what is it lad for gods sake lets have it all of it with a tankard in his hand jeremy discovered that the first part of the story fairly tumbled forththe roundhead captain he had killed the anger the dismay the loose discipline of the men in the trench he even managed to confess straight out the circumstances of his capture that he had ignored the call to retreat only to have his musket misfire finally he reached the part where he first met admiral calvert then the tale seemed to die within him well lad what happened next you say morris knew who you were aye and he spoke of you jeremy looked at his brother with considerable respect to tell it truthfully a roundhead schemer thats dick morris whod not speak the truth even if he knew how anthony leaned forward and examined his tankard but im beginning to grow fearful he may have the last say in this matter truth or no he looked up what did you see of their forces lad can they mount another landing they can they will theyve got the dutch provisions and calvert claims they could hold out for weeks but he says hell not wait he plans to invade aye id feared as much if he does i say god help us this damned militia is plagued with more desertions every day these freeholders seem to think theyve done all they need after jamestown theyre saying let somebody else fight the next time when there isnt anybody else were having trouble keeping enough men called up just to man the breastworks he scratched at his eyepatch distractedly i suppose we can still meet them if they try another assault but itll be a pitched battle as god is my witness jeremy drank off the tankard rose and walked shakily to the sideboard the onionflask of brandy was still over half full he wished he could down it all then and there i heard their plans from admiral calvert he finished pouring and set down the bottle after a deep drink he moved back to his chair without meeting anthonys gaze i would all the assembly and council could have heard what he said what did that roundhead criminal do threaten you and then send you home in hopes youd somehow cozen me anthony looked up jeremy that mans a base traitor to his king his father was in charles court and edmond calvert was knighted for no more cause than being george calverts son then when prince rupert and the navy declared their support for the king he took his ship and defected to parliament it wasnt a threat suddenly the words came again out poured calverts story of cromwells plans for the island if it defied him the assembly and council would be dismissed and powlett set up as governor a garrison would be installed moreover powlett might well see fit to reward loyal puritan islanders with the estates of recalcitrant royalists anthony walrond stood to lose all his acres again the elder walrond listened thoughtfully till the story was finished then he slowly drained his tankard its the final humiliation cromwell may god damn him cant rest content merely to strike off the head of his most royal majesty now he must needs reduce all that kings loyal subjects to nothing but it neednt be jeremy put down his tankard his hands quivered as though to match the flicker of the candles theres something you havent told me yet isnt there lad you havent said why they set you ashore you didnt escape did you anthony studied him with sudden dismay ill wager you were sent back why was it aye the reason is this he rose and reached into the pocket of his doublet the letter was still there waiting its wax seal warm against his shirt its for you he found himself wishing it had been lost though he believed with all his heart the message meant salvation it was a gift of god yet something about it now seemed the work of the devil what is it jeremy anthony stared at the envelope some kind of threat to try and frighten me too he looked up and bristled they can spare their ink and paper admiral calvert asked me to deliver this he and captain morris said that whilst you were their staunchest foe they also knew you for a gentleman they said you were the only man on the island they felt they could trust that you alone could prevent this place being brought to ruin by cromwellwhich would probably mean fighting all over the americas for years when they just want to settle this and be gone are they asking me to be a traitor to the island theyve made an offer a private offer they said the assembly cant be made to reason that itd sooner bring ruination to the island than agree to a compromise this is damned knavery to presume id be party to disloyalty but think ont jeremy drank again and felt his boldness renewed why should you sacrifice yourself helping the greedy puritans on this island the council scorns to listen to you and youve still not been elected to the assembly id say youve received naught but contempt from the day you arrived his voice rose make no mistake on it therell be a new regime here after the island surrenders which itll have to eventually right now calvert and morris just want to keep barbados out of the hands of this man powlett anthony turned the envelope in his hand so what does this cursed letter of calverts say merely that youre a reasonable man that youre surely sensible of the ruin a total war would mean and that hes got terms to offer you that are truly in the best interest of barbados if only youd give them ear i suppose he made you privy to these most generous terms anthony tossed the letter onto the rough pine boards in front of him if youd use your influence to work for peace and convince your windward regiment here in this parish to cooperate hell take steps to thwart the designs of powlett if the island laid down its arms then thered be no garrison of troops hell guarantee it and thered be amnesty for all the planters its more damnd roundhead lies thats not the voice of cromwell thats the voice of an admiral who fears he cant take this place by force so hed try doing it by deceit anthonys face reddened does the man have the cheek to think ive no scruples whatsoever but hes promised more hed form a new council and make you its head he and youd appoint the others together of course theyd needs be men of moderate stripe whod stood for peace but you could both work together to ensure the treaty was kept powlett might still have to serve as governor for a time but hed not be able to do anything without the approval of your new council its all a deception lad anthony sighed wistfully would it were true youre young and i fear to say still a bit gullible these are promises made in the moonlight and shrugged away at sunrise im old enough to know theres been enough killing jeremy choked back a lump of guilt that rose in his chest but the letters not addressed to me its to you what harm in reading it morris would like to arrange a meeting unarmed to discuss its terms a meeting anthony seemed to spit out the words aye here along the coast at oistins hes to come ashore by longboat tomorrow night alone to hear what you have to say jeremy took another drink of brandy and its fire burned through him theres no harm in that for sure it could be the beginning of peace lad talk sense theyll not hold to these conditions youve described once the island is disarmed itll be the end for every free man here he said hed give you all the terms in writing signed jeremy noticed his tankard was dry he wanted to rise for more brandy but the room swirled about him its our chance dont you see if barbados goes down fighting therell be no terms no concessions just more needless deaths if you dont hear them out itll be on our heads ill not do it but whats the council ever done for you for that matter what has bedford done anthony stared into the empty tankard in his hand and his voice grew bitter hes let katherine take up company with the criminal who robbed our ship at nevis whilst were at this very time negotiating a marriage portion and made me a laughing stock in the bargain if you must know he looked up in truth thats the most dalby bedfords done for me as of late jeremy felt his face grow flush with embarrassment then i say you owe it to decency to hear what morris has to offer tomorrow night otherwise therell just be more killing next itll be starvation too please i entreat you to think on it anthony picked up the letter and turned it in his hand liberty or death his voice was strangely subdued thats what the assembly claimed they wanted but it turns out that was just talk they dont even want liberty enough to stand and fight for it thats all too clear now he pushed open the wax seal with his thumb and unfolded the paper jeremy watched his face as he began to read my lord i send this to you as one who is master of a great deal of reason and truly sensible of the ruin of the island if it should longer be obstinate only after appeal to your lordship could i satisfy mine own conscience that i had done my duty in avoiding what i can the shedding of blood and the ruin of this island for although i may by some be looked upon as an enemy yet really i do you office of a friend in urging your lordship and those engaged with you to judge of the necessity of your lordships and their giving their due obedience to the state of england or else to suffer yourselves to be swallowed up in the destruction which a little time must inevitably bring upon you which i cannot suppose rational men would wish my lord may it please you to know that i am not ignorant of the interests of this island and very well know the impossibility of its subsistence without the patronage of england it is clear to me that god will own us in our attempts against this island as he hath hitherto done and yet to show you that i would endeavour what i can to avoid the shedding of blood and the loss of estates i have thought fit to send this to your lordship to offer you such reasonable conditions as may be honourable for the state to give anthony studied the terms carefully they were just as described by jeremy calvert was offering a leniency most uncharacteristic of cromwell the island would be beholden to parliament to be sure but it would not be humiliated moreover he suddenly thought when charles ii moved to restore the monarchy this islands strength and arms would be intact ready to help throw off the yoke of cromwells oppression with a surge of pleasure he realized this could well be a strategic retreat in the finest military sense if calvert were willing to honor these generous terms the fight could still be won another day particularly if anthony walrond controlled the new council of barbados chapter fourteen ive always called it little island since nobodys ever troubled giving it a name she reined in her mare and directed winstons gaze toward the atoll that lay a few hundred yards off the coast the waters along the shore shimmered a perfect blue in the bright midday sun at low tide like now you can wade a horse right through the shallows does anybody ever come out here he drew in his gelding and stared across the narrow waterway the island was a curious anomaly there was a high rocky peak at its center the lookout katherine had described and yet the shores were light sand and verdant with palms little island was less than a quarter mile across and shaped like an egg almost as though god had seen fit to set down a tiny replica of barbados here off its southern shore looking west you could see the forested coast of the mother island while to the east there was the road leading to oistins and the atlantic beyond never ive ridden out here maybe a dozen times but theres never been a soul he turned and surveyed the coast what else is around this place nothing much really just the walrond plantation up the coast inland a mile or so about halfway between here and oistins good christ im beginning to understand it all he laughed wistfully ill wager youve probably come out here with that gallant of yours then he looked at her his eyes sardonic didnt he get his fancy silk breeches wet riding across the shallows hugh not another word try to understand she turned and studied him these occasional flares of jealousy did he mean them she wasnt sure maybe it was all just a game to him playing at being in love but then she asked herself what was she doing perhaps wanting to have everything a lover and a husband but why couldnt you besides hugh would be gone soon better to enjoy being in love with him while she could i mean that and anthony must never learn we came here he was silent for a moment letting the metrical splash of the surf mark the time somehow shed managed to get away with her little game so far anthony walrond was too busy rallying his royalists to take much notice of anything else or maybe he was willing just to turn his blind eye to it all katy tell me something how exactly am i supposed to fit into all this you think you can have an amour with me and then wed a rich royalist when im gone i suppose you figure hell be governor here someday himself so you wont even have to move out of the compound hugh im in love with you there i said it but im going to marry anthony its the sensible thing for me to do love neednt have anything to do with that she urged her horse forward as a white egret swooped past then turned back brightly lets ride on over the islands truly a lovely spot whether you decide to use it or not he stared after her in amazement maybe she was right maybe life was just being sensible taking whatever you could but that was also a game two could play so back to business the island time was growing short and he knew there was no longer any means to finish lading the stores on the defiance without everyone in bridgetown suspecting something was afoot the frigate was aground directly in front of the main tobacco sheds in full view of every tavern around the harbor but there was still a way to assemble what was neededusing an old trick he had learned years ago you pull together your stores in some secluded haven to be picked up the night you make your break it had been a week since the invasion at jamestown and now what seemed to be a battle of nerves was underway what else could it be a new set of terms had been sent ashore by the commander of the fleet terms the assembly had revised and sent back only to have them rejected after that there had been quiet was barbados being left to starve quietly in the sun or hed begun to wonder was something else afoot maybe even a betrayal could it be some puritan sympathizers in the assembly were trying to negotiate a surrender behind bedfords back even katherine was worried and the governor had taken the unprecedented step of arming his servants a turn for the worse seemed all too likely given the condition of the islands morale but shed insisted they not talk about it today she touched coral lightly across the rump with her crop and the mare stepped eagerly into the crystalline blue water of the shallows happy to escape the horseflies nipping at its shanks winston spurred his mount and splashed after her ahead of them little island stood like a tropical mirage in the sea youre right about one thing im damned if this place isnt close to paradise theres not a lovelier spot in the caribbees the bottom was mostly gravel with only an occasional rivulet of sand see over there it looks to be a school of angelfish he was pointing off to the left toward an iridescent mass of turquoise and yellow that shimmered just beneath the surface i had no idea there was any place like this along here tell me are you sure theres enough draft on the windward side for me to put in and lade when we reach those rocks up ahead we can tie the horses and walk the shore then i suppose you can decide for yourself captain she watched as the glimmer of fish darted forward to be free like that able to go anywhere do anything i remember one place where the bottom seems to drop almost straight down you could probably anchor there good thing we came early he glanced up to the sky then at her she detected a smile this may take a while what was he thinking did he feel the freedom of this place too she loved being here alone with him just the two of them what a proper scandal it would make if anybody found out maybe the real reason i told you about this spot was to lure you out here and then keep you here all to myself he started to laugh then stopped id probably be an easy captive betwixt your designs and the guns of the english navy oh for gods sake dont be so dreary and melancholy im sure youll be gone from barbados soon enough never fear if thats what you want she sensed she had pressed him too hard but maybe youll remember me once in a while after youve sailed off to get yourself killed by the spaniards well im not done with barbados yet i can promise you that what did he mean she wished hed continue but then his horse stumbled against a rock and he glanced down distracted when he looked up again they were already nearing the shallows of the island if i can get a good cart and a couple of draft horses ill wager i can bring the other stores ill need out here with no trouble at all its mainly hogsheads of water were short now and maybe a few more barrels of salt pork his gelding emerged from the water threw back its head and snorted then broke into a prance along the sandy beach no more than two days work the way i figure it ill have a few of the indentures give my boys a hand her mare had already trotted ahead into the shade of a tall palm whose trunk emerged from behind a rocky embankment she slipped from the saddle and glanced back at winston he was still staring down the shoreline in delight if youd care to tether your frolicking horse captain we can walk around to the other side why dont we swim it he pulled his mount alongside hers and dropped onto the sand his eyes suddenly sparkling while the horse nuzzled curiously at the salty wetness on its legs he collected the reins and kneeled down to begin hobbling it can you make it that far have you gone mad from the heat they were alone miles from anything he was all hers now no gunnery mates no seamen to swim what a sensible no romantic idea he laughed and began to tie a leather thong to her mares forelegs katy you should know better than to try being coy with me ill wager you can swim like a fish you probably learned for no other reason than its not ladylike he finished with the mare and rose up facing her his face was like fine leather against the blue of the sky besides i think id like seeing you out of that bodice remember youre not on your quarterdeck today so i neednt harken to your every wish she slipped her hands beneath his jerkin and ran them slowly across the muscles on his sides the feel of him reminded her of their first night together as she ran her fingers upward toward his shoulders his lips came down to hers you might get used to it if you tried it once his voice was almost a whisper as he kissed her he wrapped her in his arms and deftly pulled the knot at the base of her bodice so get yourself out of this thing and lets try the water he wiggled the laces open and slipped it over her head she wore nothing beneath and her breasts emerged milkywhite in the sunshine he paused to examine her then continued why stand about in this heat when theres a cool lagoon waiting he stepped away slipped off his jerkin and tossed it across his saddle he was reaching down to unbuckle his boots when she stopped him she dropped to her knees slipped her hands around his waist and nuzzled her face against his thighs then she released him and bent down let me unbuckle your boots what i enjoy doing things for you sometimes he seemed startled shed suspected he wouldnt like it but he didnt pull away come on then he quickly stepped out of the boots as she laid them against the trunk of the palm she noticed they were still smeared with powder residue from that day at the jamestown breastwork were going to see how far around this island we can swim pretend thats an official order from the quarterdeck he pulled his pistols from his waist and secured them on his saddle then he unbuckled his belt and glanced at her i dont know about you but dont plan to try it in my breeches he solemnly began slipping off his canvas riding trousers she watched for a moment then reached for the waist of her skirt she found herself half wishing he couldnt see her like this plain and in the sunlight she liked her body but would he would he notice that her legs were a trifle too slim or that her stomach wasnt as round as it should be now he was leading the way down the incline toward the lagoon the white sand was a warm textured cushion against their bare feet as they waded into the placid waters around the island on the windward side the waves crashed against the shore but here the lagoon remained serene as she noticed the brisk wind against her skin she suddenly didnt care what he thought she felt like the most beautiful woman alive when she was younger she could ride and shoot as well as any lad on the island then one day she awoke to find herself cloaked in a prison of curves and bulges with a litany in her ears about all the things she wasnt supposed to be seen doing anymore it infuriated her why did men have things so much easier like winston he moved the same way he handled his flintlock pistols with a thoughtless poise as he walked now his shoulders were slightly forward and his broad back seemed to balance his stride but even more she loved the hard rhythm of his haunches trim and rippled with muscles she stopped to watch as he splashed into the shallows god forgive me she thought how i do adore him what id most like right now is just to enfold him to capture him in my arms and never let good god what am i saying the water was deliciously cool and it deepened quickly before she knew she felt the rhythm of the waves against her thighs katy the time has come he turned back and admired her for a second then thumped a spray of water across her breasts lets see if you really can swim abruptly he leaned forward dipped one shoulder and stroked powerfully the curves of his body blended with the ripples as he effortlessly glided across the surface a startled triggerfish darted past orange in the sun he stroked again then yelled over his shoulder im still not sure i can always believe everything you say nor i you hugh though truly you say little enough she leaned into the water fresh and clean against her face she gave a kick and another stroke and she was beside him the sea around them seemed a world apart from the bondage of convention he was right for wanting to swim so today to repay me for showing you this spot i want you to tell me everything all the things youve been holding back unlike you whos held nothing back like this island and what it means to you she just ignored him the best way to handle hugh when he was like this and stroked again staying even the taste of salt on her lips the white sands of the shoreline were gliding past now and behind them the palms nodded lazily in the sun then she rolled over and kicked drifting through the blue he rolled over too and reached to take her hand they slid across the surface together as one body she was lost in the quiet and calm almost dreaming when she saw his face rise up how far can you see from those rocks up there he was pointing toward the craggy rise in the center of the island id like to go up after a while and have a look you want to know everything about this place all at once is that the only thing you care about not quite he pulled next to her ill grant youve proved you can swim and damned well he smiled wryly its doubtless a good thing to know how to do we may all be needing to swim out of here soon god help us not a word remember your promise her eyes flashed as she flung a handful of water then she looked past him at the white sand and the line of green palms lets go ashore for a while that spot up there at the treesits too beautiful to pass the afternoon sun had begun to slant from the west as they waded out onto the sparkling sand his arm circled around her waist the breeze urged a sprightly nip against their skin hugh i love you truly she leaned against him to feel his warmth i dont know what i should do he was subdued and quiet as they stepped around a gleaming pile of shells then he stopped and quietly enfolded her in his arms its only fair to tell you ive never before felt about a woman the way i feel about you he kissed her softly the troubling part is i ought to know better he turned and led her on in silence till they reached the shade of a low palm she dropped down onto the grass and watched him settle beside her a large conch shell lay nearby like a petrified flower she picked it up and held it toward the sun admiring its iridescent colors then tossed it back onto the grass and looked at him i meant it when i said i wanted you to tell me everything he glanced up and traced his fingertips across the gentle curve at the tops of her white breasts are you sure you want to hear it yes i do she thought she detected a softness in his eyes almost a yielding he leaned back in the grass i guess you think theres a lot to tell yet somehow it all adds up to nothing to lying here under a palm on an empty island with a price on my head in england and little to show for all the years he looked out to sea and shaded his eyes as he studied a sail at the horizon it seems im something different to everybody so which story do you want to hear why not try the real one she pushed him onto his back and raised on her elbow to study his face it was certainly older than its years why wont you ever tell me about what happened when you first came out here what was it about that time that troubles you so much its not a pretty tale before i came i never even thought much about the new world he smiled at the irony of it now it all started when i was apprenticed and shipped out to the caribbean for not being royalist enough where to well he paused automatically then decided to continue in truth it was tortuga back when the providence company had a settlement on the island but wasnt that burned out by the spaniards we all heard about it i thought everybody there was killed how did you survive as it happens id been sort of banished by then since i didnt get along too well with the puritans there theyd sent me over to the north side of hispaniola to hunt probably saved my life thats where i was when the spaniards came on hispaniola she stared at him do you mean to say you were once one of the cowkillers it was said slowly and casually he waited to see how she would respond but there was only a brief glimmer of surprise in her eyes then what some people say is true id never believed it till now she laughed i suppose i should be shocked but im not he smiled guardedly well in those days they only hunted cattle until toward the last he paused a moment then looked at her sharply but yes thats who i was with however katy dont credit quite everything you may hear about me from the walronds but you left them at least that tells me something about you she held his hand lightly against her lips the calluses along the palm were still soft from the water why did you finally decide to go he pulled her next to him and kissed her on the mouth twice then he ran his fingers down her body across her smooth waist till he reached the mound of light chestnut hair at her thighs ive never told anyone katy im not even sure i want to tell you now he continued with his fingertips on down her skin why wont you tell me she passed her hand across his chest beneath the bronze she could feel the faint pumping of his heart i want to know all about you to have all that to think about when youre gone were so much alike in so many ways i feel i have a right to know even the smallest little things about you i tried to shoot one of them one of the cowkillers he turned and ripped off a blade of grass then crumpled it in his hand and looked away well im sure thats not the first time such a thing has happened i expect you had good reason after all the difference was who i tried to kill he rolled over and stared up at the vacant sky it was deep blue flawless what do you mean who was it you probably wouldnt know he glanced at her ever hear of a man who goes by the name of jacques le basque good god she glanced at him in astonishment isnt he the one whos been pillaging and killing spaniards in the windward passage for years now in bridgetown they say the spaniards call him the most bloodthirsty man in the caribbean im surprised he let you get away with it i didnt escape entirely unscathed winston laughed you see he was leader of the cowkillers back then i suppose he still is so what happened one foggy morning we had a small falling out and i tried a pistol on him it misfired he pushed back her hair and kissed her on the cheek did you know katy that the sun somehow changes the color of your eyes makes them bluer she grabbed his hand and pushed him back up youre trying to shift the topic i know your tricks dont do that with me tell me the rest what do you suppose after i made free to kill him he naturally returned the favor winston stroked the scar on his cheek his pistol ball came this close to taking off my head thats when i thought it healthy to part company with him and his lads he traced his tongue down her body and lightly probed a nipple it blushed pink then began to harden under his touch no you dont not yet youll make me lose track of things she almost didnt want him to know how much she delighted in the feel of his lips it would give him too much power over her could she she wondered ever have the same power over him she had never yet kissed him all over the way she wanted but she was gathering courage for it what would he do when she did she reached up and cradled his face in her hands the tongue that had been circling her nipple drew away and slowly licked one of her fingers she felt herself surrendering again and quickly drew her hand back talk to me some more tell me why you tried to kill him who the man you just said she frowned knowing well his way of teasing yes hugh winston was quite a tease in everything just now this jacques le basque him why did i try to kill him he pecked at her nose and she sensed a tenseness in his mouth i scarcely remember its as though the fog that moming never really cleared from my mind as best i recall it had something to do with a frigate he smiled the lines in his face softening then he slipped an arm beneath her and drew her next to him her skin was warm from the sun still days like this make up for a lot in life just being here with you trouble is i worry im beginning to trust you more than i probably ought i think i trust you too she turned and kissed him on the lips testing their feel the tenseness had vanished as mysteriously as it had come she kissed him again now with his lips meeting hers and she wanted to crush them against her own gone now all the talk he had won he had made her forget herself once again i also love you and i know you well enough by now to know for sure thats unwise she moved across him her breasts against his chest would he continue to hold back to keep something to himself something he never seemed willingor ableto give only recently had she become aware of it as she learned to surrender to him more and more fully she had slowly come to realize that only a part of him was there for her then the quiet of the lagoon settled around them as their bodies molded together a perfect knowing he pulled her against his chest hard as he knew she liked to be held and she moved against him instinctively she felt herself wanting him ready for that most exquisite moment of all she slipped slowly downward while he moved carefully to meet her her soft breasts were still pillowed against his chest she gasped lightly a barely discernible intake of breath and closed her eyes as she slowly received him her eyes flooded with delight and she rose up till her breasts swung above him like twin bells this is how i want to stay forever she bent back down and kissed him full on the mouth say youll never move not even like this now the feel of her and the scent of her as she enclosed him and worked her thighs against him fully awoke his own desire it had begun that need both to give and to take and he sensed in her an intensity matching his own so alien yet so alike gradually he became aware of a quickening of her motions against him and he knew that at this instant he had momentarily ceased to exist for her he had lost her to something deeper she leaned closer not to clasp him but to thrust her breasts against him wordlessly telling him to touch the hard buds of her nipples then the rhythms that rippled her belly shifted downward strong and driven with small sounds of anticipation she again rose above him then suddenly cried aloud and grasped his body with her hands to draw him into her totally this was the moment when together they knew that nothing else mattered as he felt himself giving way to her he felt her gasp and again thrust against him as though to seize and hold the ecstasy that had already begun to drift beyond them but it had been fleeting ephemeral and now they were once more merely man and woman in each others arms amidst the sandand gently waving palms finally she reached up and took his hands from her soft breasts her eyes resigned and bewildered he drew her to him and kissed her gently to comfort her for that moment now lost to time then he lifted her in his arms and lay her against the soft grass her body open to him he wanted this woman more than anything the afternoon sky was azure now the hue of purest lapis lazuli and its scattering of soft white clouds was mirrored in the placid waters of the lagoon he held her cradled in his arms half dozing her face warm against his chest time his voice sounded lightly against her ear what darling its time we had a look around he sat up and kissed her weve got to go back where we left the horses and get our clothes and boots he turned and gazed toward the dark outcrop of rocks that rose up from the center of the island then id like to go up there to try and get some idea what the shoreline looks like on the windward side want to swim back she stared up at him then rubbed her face against his chest as she rose she was holding his hand and almost dancing around him you swim back if you like for myself i think im getting a bit old for such what if i just walked the shore oh youre old to be sure youre ancient but mostly in your head she grabbed his hand come on well just part way he rose abruptly then reached over and hoisted her into his arms he bounced her lightly as though she were no more weighty than a bundle of cane and laughed at her gasp of surprise what do you know maybe im not as decrepit as i thought he turned and strode toward the shoreline still cradling her against his chest put me down youre just showing off thats right they were waist deep when he balanced her momentarily high above the water and gave a shove she landed with a splash and disappeared only to resurface sputtering careful katy or youll frighten the angelfish he ducked the handful of water she flung at him and dived head first into the sea a moment later he emerged stroking come on then you wanted to swim shall we race youll regret it she dived after him like a dolphin and when she finally surfaced she was already ahead she yelled back dont think ill let you win in the name of pride he roared with laughter and moved alongside her whose pride are we talking about mine or yours and they swam he was always half a length behind her yelling that he would soon pass her but when they reached the point along the shore even with their clothes she was still ahead now shall i carry you ashore captain she let her feet touch the sandy bottom and turned to watch him draw next to her youre most likely exhausted damn you he stood up beside her breathing heavily no seaman ever lets himself get caught in the water now i know why he seized her hand and glanced at the sun it was already halfway toward evening come on were wasting time i want to reconnoiter this damned island of yours before its too dark she pulled him back and kissed him one last time the waters of the lagoon still caressing them hugh this has been the loveliest day of my life ill remember it always she kissed him again and now he yielded enfolding her in his arms can we come back soon maybe if you can find time amidst all your marriage negotiations he ran his hand over her smooth buttocks then gave her a kiss that had the firmness of finality but now we go to work katy come on the horses watched them expectantly snorting and pawing with impatience while they dressed again she finished drawing the laces of her bodice then walked over and whispered to her mare we can take the horses if you think they could use a stretch he gazed up toward the outcrop i suppose they can make it coral can go anywhere you can then let her prove it he reached down and untied the hobble on his geldings forefeet then he grabbed the reins and vaulted into the saddle lets ride the route up the islands center spine was dense with scrub foliage but the horses pushed their way through the afternoon was silent save for the occasional grunts of wild hogs in the underbrush before long they emerged into the clear sunshine again the horses trotting eagerly up a grassy rise with only a few large boulders to impede their climb when they reached the base of the rocky outcropping that marked the edge of the plateau he slipped from the saddle and tied his mount to a small green tree no horse can make that he held corals reins as she dismounted lets walk behind them now the long shore of barbados stretched into the western horizon the south side toward oistins bay was shielded by the hill this could be a good lookout post he took her arm and helped her over the first jagged extrusion of rock now the path would be winding but the way was clear merely a steep route upward ill wager you can see for ten leagues out to sea from up there at the top ive always wondered what oistins looked like from here i never got up this far before she ran a hand fondly down the back of his jerkin it was old and brown and sweatencrusted she knew now that he had fancy clothes secreted away but he seemed to prefer things as worn and weathered as he could find the harbor must be beautiful this time of the afternoon if you know where to look upland you might just see your walrond gallants plantation he gestured off to the left didnt you say its over in that direction somewhere she nodded silently relieved he hadnt said anything more they were approaching the top now a rocky plateau atop the rough outcrop in front of them up we go katy he seized a sharp protrusion and pulled himself even then he reached down and took her hand she held to his grip as he hoisted her up over the last jagged rocks its just like her voice trailed off what he glanced back at her oh god hugh i dont believe it she was pointing toward the southeast and the color had drained from her face he whirled and squinted into the afternoon haze at sea under full sail with a heading of north by northeast were eight english warships tawnybrown against the blue caribbean their guns were not run out instead their decks were crowded with steelhelmeted infantry they were making directly for oistins bay the breastwork why arent they firing he instinctively reached for the handle of the pistol in the lefthand side of his belt ive not heard a shot wheres walronds windward regiment theyre just letting them land oh hugh how could the windwards do this to the island theyre the staunchest royalists here why would they betray the rest of us weve got to get back to bridgetown as hard as we can ride to pull all the militia together and try to get the men down from jamestown but ive heard no warnings she watched the english frigates begin to shorten sail as they entered the bay suddenly she glanced down at his pistols whats the signal for oistins youre right he slipped the flintlock from the left side of his belt and handed it to her its four shotstwo together followed by two apart though i doubt theres anybody around close enough to hear lets do it anyway theres a plantation about half a mile west down the coast ralph warner hes in the assembly he pulled the other pistol from his belt now after you fire the first barrel pull that little trigger there below the lock and the second one revolves into place but first check the prime thats the first thing i did she frowned in exasperation ill wager i can shoot almost as well as you can isnt it time now you learned to trust me katy after whats just happened youre about the only person on barbados i trust at all get ready he raised the gun above his head and there was the sharp crack of two pistol shots in rapid succession then she quickly squeezed off the rest of the signal she passed back the gun then pointed toward the settlement at oistins look do you see them that must be some of the windward regiment down by the breastwork thats their regimental flag theyve probably come down to welcome the fleet your handsome fiance seems to have sold his soul and his honor the royalist bastard he paused and caught her arm from the west came two faint cracks of musket fire then again the signal lets get back to bridgetown as fast as these horses will take us im taking command of this militia and im going to have anthony walronds balls for breakfast he was almost dragging her down the incline come on its one thing to lose a fair fight its something else to be cozened and betrayed nobody does that to me by christ i swear it she looked apprehensively at his eyes and saw an anger unlike any she had ever seen before it welled up out of his very soul that was what really moved him honor you kept your word finally she knew she grasped for the saddle horn as he fairly threw her atop her horse the mare snorted in alarm at the sudden electricity in the air a moment later winston was in his saddle and plunging down the brushy incline hugh lets ride together dont she ducked a swinging limb and then spurred coral alongside why would anthony do it and what about jeremy hell be mortified youd better be worrying about the assembly thats your fathers little creation would they betray him some of them were arguing for surrender theyre worried about their plantations being ruined if theres more fighting more war well you can tell them this theres going to be war all right if i have to fight with nobody helping me but my own lads he spurred his horse onto the grassy slope that led down to the sand moments later the frightened horses were splashing through the shallows ahead was the green shore of barbados by christ therell be war like theyve never seen mark it by sunrise tomorrow this god damned island is going to be in flames chapter fifteen your servant sir anthony walrond stood in the shadow of the oistins breastwork his hand resting lightly on his sword edmond calvert was walking slowly up the beach from the longboat flanked by james powlett and richard morris the hour was half past three in the afternoon exactly as agreed there had to be enough light to get the men and supplies ashore and then the timely descent of darkness to shield them your punctuality i trust portends your constancy in weightier concerns and yours sir i pray may do the same calvert slipped off his dark hat and lightly bowed a greeting then he turned and indicated the two men behind him youve met vice admiral powlett and i understand colonel morris is not entirely unknown to you weve had some acquaintance in times past walrond nodded coldly in the direction of morris but did not return the commanders perfunctory smile the old hatred born of years of fighting in england flowed between them then shall we to affairs calvert turned back and withdrew a packet from his waistcoat the supplies we agreed on are ready ive had my chief purser draw up a list for your inspection walrond took the papers then glanced out toward the ships so its finally come to this he thought wistfully but god is my witness we truly did all any man could ask theres no turning back now as he thumbed open the wax seal of the packet he noted absently that it was dated today friday had all this really come to pass since only sundown monday when he had first met powlett received the initial set of terms from edmond calvert and begun negotiations he had tried his best to counsel reason to the assembly he told himself to arrange an honorable treaty that would preserve the militia but a handful of hotheads had clamored for hopeless defiance and prevailed the only way to save the island now was to force it to surrender as quickly and painlessly as possible victory lay in living to fight another day he gazed back at the ships of the fleet and thought of the road that had brought them to this the defection of his own regiment once the finest fighting men in england the royalist windwards monday at sundown he had commandeered the back room of the dolphin tavern which stood hard by the shore of oistins bay and met powlett through the night emissaries had shuttled terms back and forth between the tavern and the rainbowe berthed offshore by the time the flagship hoisted anchor and made way for open sea at dawn anthony walrond held in his hand a document signed by edmond calvert it provided for the end of the blockade the islands right to keep its arms and rule itself in local matters and a full amnesty for all the price as price there must be was an agreement to recognize the commonwealth and the appointment of a new governor and council by calvert tuesday he had summoned a trusted coterie of his royalist officers to the dolphin and set forth the terms they had reviewed them one by one debated each then agreed by show of hands that none more favorable could reasonably be obtained healths were drunk to the eventual restoration of charles ii to the throne and that night a longboat was dispatched to the rainbowe carrying a signed copy of the agreement wednesday as agreed edmond calvert had ordered a duplicate copy of the terms forwarded to the assembly indicating it was his last offer no mention was made of the secret negotiations that had produced the document at that meeting of the assembly dalby bedford had risen to declare he would not allow his own interests to be the cause of a single new death that he would accept the terms and resign forthwith if such was the pleasure of the assemblywhich was he said a democratic body that must now make its own decision whether to continue fighting or to negotiate he next moved that the document be put to a vote it was narrowly approved by the assembly an honorable peace seemed within reach but then the fabric so carefully sewed was ripped apart a committee was formed to draw up the statement of the assemblys response in an atmosphere of hot spirits and general confusion several of the more militant members had managed to insert a new clause into the treaty that the legal and rightful government of this island shall remain as it is now established by law and our own consent the response was then carried by voice vote and sent back to calvert a gauntlet flung across the admirals face the defiant faction in the assembly exulted and drank toasts to the destruction of any who would have peace on the original terms that night calvert had delivered a new message to anthony walrond inviting him to join with the forces of the commonwealtha move he said that would surely induce the assembly to show reason with this invitation he had inserted an additional offer he would endeavor to persuade oliver cromwell to restore the sequestrated estates in england of any royalist officer who consented to assist on thursday anthony held another meeting of the officers of the windward regiment and they voted enthusiastically to defect to the side of the fleet after all they reasoned had not an honorable peace already been refused by the extremists in the assembly that night he so advised edmond calvert demanding as conditions a supply of musket shot and fifty kegs of musket powder this morning just before dawn a longboat from the rainbowe had returned calverts replya signed acceptance of the terms with feelings mixed and rueful he had ordered an english flag hoisted above the breastwork at oistins the agreedupon signal to calvert then to ensure security he ordered that no militiaman be allowed to leave oistins till the ships of the fleet had put in and landed their infantry the rainbowe led the eight warships that entered the bay at midafternoon anthony had seen edmond calvert mount the quarterdeck to watch as the guns in the breastwork were turned around and directed inland part of his conditions then the admiral had ordered a longboat lowered and come ashore these supplies all have to be delivered now before dark anthony was still scrutinizing the list or my menll not be in the mood to so much as lift a halfpike what matter calvert told himself its done the barbados landing is achieved the island is ours youll have the first load of powder onshore before sundown he gestured toward the paper your musket shot and the matchcord are on the marsten moor but i think we can have the bulk offloaded by then too what of the rest of the powder sir walrond squinted at the list with his good eye that was our main requirement some of these regiments had little enough to start with and i fear well be needing yours if theres any fighting to be done good christ calvert cast a dismayed look toward morris had i but known how scarcely provisioned their forces were i might well not have well sir what of the powder anthonys voice grew harder we can choose to halt this operation right now if ive ordered ten kegs sent ashore surely that should be adequate for the moment youll have the rest by morning my word of honor he squinted toward the horizon how much time do you think weve got to deploy the infantry less than wed hoped we heard the signal for oistins being sent up the coast about half an hour past walrond turned and followed calverts gaze the sun was a fiery disc above the western horizon an emblem of the miserable caribbees ever reminding him of the england he had lost if their militia plans to meet us theyll likely be assembling at bridgetown right now its possible theyll be able to march some of the regiments tonight which means they could have men and cavalry here on our perimeter well before dawn then weve got to decide now where the best place would be to make a stand calvert turned and motioned morris forward the commander had been watching apprehensively as his tattered troops disembarked from the longboats and waded in through the surf what say you sir would you have us hold here at oistins or try to march along the coastal road toward bridgetown while theres still some light morris removed his helmet and slapped at the buzzing gnats now emerging in the evening air hoping to obscure his thoughts did the admiral realize he wondered how exposed their men were at this very moment why should anyone trust the loyalties of anthony walrond and his royalists it could all be a trap intended to lure his men onshore he had managed to muster almost four hundred infantrymen from the ships but half of those were weak and vomiting from scurvy already even with just the militia he could see his own forces were outnumbered if walronds regiments turned on them now the entire commonwealth force would be in peril could they even manage to make their way back to the ships caution thats what the moment called for now and that meant never letting the windward regiment or any island militia gain a position that would seal off their escape route well need a garrison for these men room for their tents he glanced carefully at walrond im thinking it would be best for now if we kept our lads under separate command each of us knows his own men best as you will sir anthony glanced back smelling morris caution its the first mark of a good commander he told himself but damn him all the same he knows as well as i weve got to merge these forces i propose we march the men upland for tonight to my plantation you can billet your officers in my tobacco sheds and encamp the men in the fields will it be ground we can defend morris was carefully monitoring the line of longboats bringing his men ashore helmets and breastplates glistened in the waning sun youll not have the sea at your back the way you do now should we find need for a tactical retreat aye but well have little else either morris looked back at calvert id have us offload some of the ship ordnance as soon as possible were apt to need it to hold our position here especially since ill wager theyll have at least twice the cavalry mustered that these windwards have got youll not hold this island from the shores of oistins bay sir much as you might wish anthony felt his frustration rising weve got to move upland as soon as we can id have us camp here for tonight morris tried to signal his disquiet to calvert those will be my orders very well sir walrond continued squinting toward the windward regiments cavalry their horses prancing as they stood at attention and dont forget the other consideration in our agreement the assembly is to be given one more opportunity to accept the terms you are obliged to draft one final communication for bedford beseeching him to show himself an englishman and persuade the assembly to let us reach an accord as you will sir calvert turned away biting his tongue before he said more keep an even keel he told himself therell be time and plenty to reduce this island sir anthony walrond with it the works already half done now to the rest after weve brought them to heel well have time enough to show them how the commonwealth means to rule the americas time and plenty may god help them all shango can you hear me she knelt beside her mat her voice pleading how she wondered did you pray to a yoruba god really pray was it the same as the christian god but shango was more he was more than just a god he was also part of her she knew that now but must he always wait to be called evoked must he first seize your body for his own before he could declare his presence work his will then the hard staccato sounds came again the drums their yoruba words drifting up over the rooftop from somewhere in the distance and flooding her with dread wrenching her heart tonight they proclaimed the island will be set to the torch and the branco will be consumed in the fires the men of the yoruba on plantations the length of the island were ready this was the day consecrated to ogun the day the fields of cane would be turned to flame even now atiba was dictating final orders words that would be repeated again and again by the drums after the fires began while the branco were still disorganized and frightened they would attack and burn the plantation houses no man who owned a preto slave would be left alive with all the powerful branco slaveholders dead the drums proclaimed the white indentures would rise up and join with the yoruba together they would seize the island oh shango please she gripped the sides of the thin mattress make him understand no white will aid them to the branco the proud yoruba warriors are merely more preto black and despised make him understand it will be the end of his dream to rise up now will mean the slaughter of his people and ensure slavery forever in truth the only one she cared about was atiba to know with perfect certainty that she would see him hanged probably his body then quartered to frighten the others was more than she could endure his rebellion had no chance what could he hope to do not even ogun the powerful god of war could overcome the brancos weapons and cunning or his contempt for any human with a trace of african blood atiba had hinted that he and his men would somehow find muskets but where this afternoon only hours ago she had heard another signal cross the island the musket shots the branco had devised to sound an invasion alert following that many groups of cavalry had ridden past headed south the sight of them had made her reflect sadly that atiba and his yoruba warriors had no horses afterward she had learned from the white servants that the soldiers of the ingles fleet had again invaded the island this time on the southern coast this meant that all the barbados militiamen surely must be mobilized now every musket on the island would be in the hands of a white there would be no cache of guns to steal moreover after the battleregardless of who wonthe soldiers of the fleet would probably help the militiamen hunt down atiba and his men no branco wanted the island seized by african slaves shango stop them ogun has made them drunk for the taste of blood but the blood on their lips will soon be their own slowly sadly she rose she pulled her white shift about her then reached under the mat to retrieve the small wand she had stolen from atibas hut she untied the scarf she had wrapped around it and gazed again at the freshly carved wood the double axe then she held it to her breast and headed tiptoeing down the creaking back stair she had no choice but to go to the one place she knew she could find shango i say damn their letter benjamin briggs watched as the mounted messenger from oistins disappeared into the dark down the road between the palms still holding the white flag above his head i suppose theyd now have us fall back and negotiate when weve got the men and horse ready to drive them into the sea its addressed to me presumably a formality doubtless its meant for the entire assembly bedford turned the packet in his hand and moved closer to the candles on the table its from admiral calvert the front room of nicholas whittingtons plantation house was crowded with officers of the militia there were few helmets most of the men wore the same black hats seen in the fields muskets and bandoliers of powder and shot were stacked in the comer intermittent gusts of the night breeze washed the stifling room through the open shutters the afternoons mobilization had brought together less than three thousand men half the militias former strength they had marched west from bridgetown at sunset and now they were encamped on the whittington plantation grounds in fields where tobacco once had grown the plantation was a thousand acre tract lying three miles to the southwest of anthony walronds lands near the southern coast well weve got a quorum of the assembly here colonel george heathcott stepped forward rubbing at his short beard he was still stunned by anthony walronds defection to the roundheads we can formally entertain any last minute proposals theyd care to make i trust this time the assembly will discern treachery when they see it briggs interjected i warned you this was likely to happen when you lose your rights tis small matter whether you hand them over or give them up at the point of a musket barrel theyre gone and thats the end of it either way aye ill wager theres apt to be a walrond hand in this too regardless who authored it just another of his attempts to cozen the honest men of this island tom lancaster spat toward the empty fireplace he thought ruefully of the cane he had in harvestfive hundred acres almost half his lands had been plantedand realized that now the fate of his future profits lay with an untrustworthy militia and the assembly half the voting members of which were men with fewer than a dozen acres hes sold the future and liberty of this island for forty pieces of silver or for the governorship heathcott interjected mark it not so long as ive got breath briggs complexion was deepening in the candlelight as he began wondering what the commonwealths men would do with his sugar confiscate it and ruin him in the bargain i say we fight to the last man no matter what dalby bedford finished scanning the letter and looked up i think we should hold one last vote theres what are the terms briggs interrupted they seem to be the same i presume he thought we might surrender now that theyve landed bedford hesitated was independence worth the killing sure to ensue if they went to wara war that had now become planter against planter but it does appear hes willing to negotiate then lets hear it briggs glanced about the room though id have every man here remember that weve got no guarantees other than calverts word and anything he consents to will still have to be approved by parliament if youll allow me sir bedford motioned for quiet then lifted a candlestick from the table and held it over the parchment to the right honorable etc my lordi have formerly sent you many invitations to persuade you to a fair compliance with that new power which governs your native country thereby preserving yourself and all the gent of this island from certain ruin and this island from that desolation which your and their obstinacy may bring upon it although i have now been welcomed by a considerable part of the island with my commission publishedthat being to appoint your governor for the state of englandyet i am still the same reasonable man as before and hold forth the same grace and favor to you i formerly did being resolved no change of fortune shall change my nature thus i invite you to accept this same commission as the others have donein recognition that we each now possess considerable portions of this noble island briggs stepped forward i already see theres deceit in it they hold oistins not an acre more with the men and horse weve got let me read the rest bedford interrupted therere only a few lines more he lifted the candle closer and continued therefore i am bound in honour as well as good nature to endeavour your preservations to which purpose i have enclosed the articles which the windward regiment have accepted if you have any exceptions to these articles let me know them by your commissioners and i shall appoint fit persons to consider them by ratifying this negotiation you will prevent further effusion of blood and will preserve your persons and estates from ruin if you doubt mine own power to grant these articles know i shall engage not only mine own but the honour of the state of england which is as much as can be required by any rational man and so i rest your servant admiral edmond calvert briggs reached for the letter whats his prattle about honor by god this islands been betrayed by the very men who speak about it most he gazed around at the members of the assembly theyve already heard our exceptions and their reply was to invade i propose we settle this with arms and then talk of honor theres a threat in that letter for all the soothing words a grizzled assembly member spoke up fingering his bandolier calverts saying were in a war against the might of england with our own people divided aye but when you find out a dog youd kick will bite back you learn to stand clear of him briggs waved him down he thought again of the years of profits that lay just ahead if only english control could be circumvented weve but to teach cromwell a sound lesson and hell let us be but does this dog you speak of have enough bite to drive back a fullscale invasion heathcott peered around him at the other members the darkbeamed room grew silent as his question seemed to hang in the air no one knew the full strength of the invading forces now that they had been merged with the windwards and more importantly whether the barbados militia would have the stomach to meet them hes here yor worships at that moment a thin wiry servant in a brown shirt appeared at the doorway behind him in the hallway another man had just been ushered in he was hatless and wearing a powdersmeared jerkin his face was drawn but his eyes were intense hugh winston was now in full command of the barbados militia commissioned by unanimous vote of the assembly your servant captain bedford nodded a greeting were waiting to hear what youve managed to learn my lads just got back they say the roundheads havent started moving upland yet theyre still encamped along the shore at oistins and together with the windwards theyre probably no more than a thousand strong by god we can stop them after all briggs squinted through the candlelight what are they doing now preparing to march doesnt appear so at least not yet they look to be waiting while they offload some of the heavy ordnance from the marsten moor their ninepounders the guns have already been hoisted up on deck and made ready to bring ashore there you have it gentlemen briggs growled theyd try to lull us with talk of negotiation whilst they prepare to turn their ships guns against our citizens bedfords eyes narrowed and he held up the letter then what shall our answer be for my own part i say if we want to stay our own masters well have to fight there were grave nods among the assembled men as bedford turned to winston how does it stand with the militia id say weve got just about all the infantry and horse were likely to muster ive gone ahead and issued whats left of the powder and shot he was still standing by the doorway weve got to move on out tonight and deploy around their position with whatever men horse and cannon we can manage lest the weather change by morning and end our mobility he thumbed toward the east therere some dark clouds moving in fast and i dont care for the looks of them theres some wind out of the west too off the ocean though that may slow them down a bit what do you mean briggs eyed him it means the bays doubtless picked up a little chop by now so calvert and his officers may decide to wait till dawn to offload those heavy guns it could give us just enough time then i take it youd have us move out now in the dark heathcott nervously peered out the window widening the half open shutters if we do weve got a chance to deploy cannon on their perimeter and then hit them at dawn while theyre still unprepared before they have a chance to fortify their position with that ship ordnance theyll have the bay at their back and no heavy guns to speak of save whats in the breastwork then i formally move that we draft a reply to this letter and send it over by one of our cavalry lest they mistake our resolve bedfords voice was hard and then we let captain winston move on out with the men aye i second the motion heathcott scrambled to his feet his eyes ablaze lets prepare a response right now and get on with it its done whittington turned to a plump irish serving girt who had been standing agog in the kitchen doorway watching this meeting of the barbados assembly in her masters parlor and ordered quill and paper to be brought from his study gentlemen bedford quieted the buzz in the room i propose we say something along the lines of the following i have read your letter and acquainted the council and assembly with it and now return their resolution to you in which they do continue with much wondering that what is rightfully theirs by lawbeing the governing of this island as it presently isshould be denied them aye briggs inteijected and make mention of anthony walrond if you please lest he think were not sensible that hes sold the island for his personal gain patience sir bedford gestured for quiet i would also add the following neither hath the treachery of one man so far discouraged us nor the easiness of certain others being seduced by him so much weakened us as that we should accept a dishonorable peace and for the procuring of a just peace none shall endeavor more than the lawful assembly of barbados or your servant governor dalby bedford well phrased as im a christian whittington gravely nodded his approval they can mull over it all night if they choose but therell be no mistaking our resolve come the morrow bedford called for a show of hands every man in the room signified approval done he quickly penned the letter signed it with a flourish and passed it to whittington have one of your servants call in the captain of the horse well send this down to oistins right now he can have his man take along the safeconduct pass calvert sent with his letter while whittington rang for the servants bedford motioned toward winston now captain youve got your approval to move the militia i propose we all move with it he turned once more to the room the men were already stirring donning bandoliers and sorting out their muskets this meeting of the barbados assembly is hereby adjourned it may be the last we ever hold if we dont succeed tomorrow may god preserve democracy in the americas lets all say a prayer gentlemen as we ride winston turned without a word and led the way as the group of blackhatted men moved out into the evening air a crisp breeze had sprung up from the east providing a cooling respite from the heat of the day horses neighed and pawed in the lantern light while the night was alive with the rattle of bandoliers he strode to a circle of men waiting by the cistern at the side of the house and called for the officers he was passing orders to mount and ride when a buzz of confusion rose up from the direction of the assemblymen emerging from the house there were murmurs and pointing gods life its peculiar heathcott was gazing toward the north in the direction of the upland plantations ive never seen anything like it winston turned to look across the horizon a dull glow flickered out of the dark before he had time to puzzle over what it might be he heard a chorus of shouts from the servants quarters at the rear of the house master whittington theres a fire in the southern sixty in the cane damn me whittington trotted past the side of the house to look at the base of the hill the red tongues of flame could be seen forking upward in the dark i was fearful something just like this might happen what with all these careless militiamen idling about the militias not camped down there sir briggs had moved alongside him to look suddenly his eyes went wild gods blood is that another fire were seeing there in the north whittington watched the whip of flames a moment longer as though disbelieving and then his body seemed to come alive weve got to get some of these men down there and dig a break in the cane fields stop it before it reaches this house im more worried about it reaching our heavy ordnance winston gazed down the road toward the militias encampment weve got to get our men and gun carriages mobilized and out of here i demand that some of these layabouts stay to try and save my cane whittington pointed toward the crowd of militiamen at the foot of the rise theyre doubtless the ones responsible that little cane fire will bum itself out soon enough winston raised his hand weve got to move these men and supplies now we cant wait around fighting cane fires damn me god damn me briggs voice was shrill as he pushed his way through the crowd toward winston im beginning to think that glow we see in the north might well be a blaze on some of my acres well even if it is theres not much we can do now damned if theres not briggs peered again at the horizon then back at winston ive got to take my men over as quick as we can ride maybe we can still save it youll not have a single horse or man winston raised his hand as soon as i brief my field commanders were moving on oistins we have to be in position with our cannon before dawn if we dont attack them before theyve managed to offload the ordnance well forfeit what little chance weve got are you mad sir we let these fires go unattended and we could well lose everything briggs gazed around at the assemblymen theres the looks of a conspiracy in this its apt to be some sort of uprising of the indentures or maybe even these damned africans which means that weve got to protect our homes winston watched in dismay as the assembled men began to grumble uncertainly several were already calling for their horses the night took on an air of fear let me tell you this gentlemen winstons voice sounded above the din weve got but one chance to stop the invasion and thats to move our heavy guns and militia tonight you have to decide whether youre going to do it damn me sir its a matter of priorities briggs voice was almost a shout if were burned out itll take us years to rebuild reckoning with parliament would be nothing compared with the effects of a fire or a slave uprising ill wager theres some kind of islandwide rebellion afoot like we had a few years back he was untying the reins of his horse from the porch railing im riding home and taking my indentures he glared at winston the few ive got left ive got a house and a sugar mill and i intend to protect them i need that horse winston stood unmoving tonight this nag belongs to me sir briggs swung heavily into the saddle youll get her when im done not a minute before several of the other militiamen were nervously mounting having realized with alarm that their own plantation houses were unprotected winston whirled on bedford cant we stop this if every man here with a house to worry about abandons us ill have nobody save my own men am i expected to fight walronds regiment and the commonwealth all by myself i cant stop them bedford shook his head maybe we can reassemble in the morning assuming this rebellion matter can be contained but mornings going to be too late by then the sea may let up and theyll have their heavy ordnance in place winston felt his gut tighten as he watched the cavalry and militia begin to disperse into the night theyll slice us to ribbons with cannon fire if we try to storm their position then this is not an army its a militia bedford sighed no man here can be ordered to fight well youve lost it before you even began he gave the governor a quick salute then seized the reins of his gelding the horse was still lathered from the run back from little island to bridgetown if its going to be every man for himself ive got my own affairs to look to so damned to them and to their sugar and slaves where are you going bedford stared at him gloomily if this wars as good as lostwhich it isthen ive got to get the defiance afloat as soon as i can he vaulted into the saddle and gave his horse the spur the americas just swapped liberty for sugar they can have it chapter sixteen they had waited in the open field to watch as the moon broke above the eastern horizon sending faint pastel shimmers through the rows of cane the first shadow cast by the moon on this the fourth day of the yoruba weekthe day sacred to ogunwas the signal to begin may ogun be with you son of balogun tahajo ancient and brittle as the stalks around them bent over and brushed atibas dusty feet his voice could scarcely be heard above the chorus of crickets tonight at the first coming of dark when i could no longer see the lines in the palm of my hand i sacrificed a cock to ogun as a prayer that you succeed atiba looked at him with surprise secretly annoyed that tahajo had performed the sacrifice without his knowledge but the old man had the prerogatives of an elder what did the sacrifice foretell i could not discern atiba in truth i could not the signs were mixed but they seemed to hold warning concern showed in his aged eyes know that if you do not succeed there will be no refuge for any of us remember what the elders of ife once warned when our young men called for a campaign of war against the fulani in the north they declared the locust can eat the locust can drink the locust can gobut where can the grasshopper hide we are like grasshoppers my son with no compounds or women to return to for shelter if we fail we will not fail atiba held up his new machete its polished iron glistened in the light of the moon ogun will not turn his face from us then i pray for you atiba he sighed you are surely like the pigeon who feeds among the hawks fearless of death tonight tahajo we are the hawks a hawk has talons the old man looked up at the moon what do you have we will have the claws of a leopard of steel before the sun returns atiba saluted him in traditional fashion then turned to obewole the tall drummers arms were heavy with bundles of straw ready to be fired and hurled among the cane is everything prepared the straw is ready obewole glanced around at the expectant faces of the men as he stepped forward as we are you alone have the flint atiba called for quiet next he intoned an invocation a whisper under his breath then circled the men and cast a few drops of water from a calabash toward the four corners of the world we will fire this field first he stood facing them proud of the determination in their faces these men he told himself are among the finest warriors of ife tonight the branco will learn how a yoruba fights for his people the west wind is freshening now and it will carry the flames to the other fields those in the direction of the rising moon next we will fire the curing house where the branco keeps the sweet salt we have made for him with our own hands then we will burn his mill house obewole cast a nervous glance at atiba the mill house shelters the great machine made of the sacred iron of ogun is it wisdom to bring shangos fire to that place sacred to ogun you know good obewole that in ife we say do not expect to find a man wearing white cloth in the compound of a palmoil maker atibas face was expressionless oguns spirit is not in the mill house tonight he is here with us the drummer bowed in uncertain acknowledgement and turned to begin distributing the straw bundles down the line of men the young warrior derin was first and he eagerly called for two atiba watched silently till each man had a sheaf of straw then he intoned one last prayer as the words died away into silence he produced a flint and struck it against the blade of his machete a shower of sparks flew against the bundle held by obewole after the brown stalks had smoldered into flame the drummer walked slowly down the line of men and with a bow to each fired the rest serina settled the candle carefully atop the iron frame supporting the rollers then stood for a moment studying the flickering shadows it cast across the thatched ceiling of the mill house from the gables above her head came the chirp of crickets mingled with the occasional night murmurs of nesting birds the room exuded an eerie peacefulness again it called to mind the sanctuary of whitewash and frangipani scent that had been her home in pernambuco once before the magic of this deserted mill house had transported her back to that place of long ago back to gentle afternoons and soft voices and innocence to the love of her yoruba mother dara and the kindliness of an old babalawo so much like atiba shangos spirit had taken her home he had come to this place that night and he had lifted her into his being and taken her back and here for the first time she had understood his awesome power shango the great terrifying god of west africa was now here in the caribbees to guard his people one day she told herself even the christians would be on their knees to him carefully she unwrapped the wandits wood carved with an african womans fertile shape then topped with a double headed axeand placed it beside the candle atiba had made it with his own hands and he always kept it hidden in his hut as part of his babalawos cache of sacred implements the mill had not turned since the day the great ships of the ingles appeared in the bay before the night of the storm traces of white cassava flour were still mingled with the fine dust on the floor the place where atiba had drawn shangos sign was she squinted in the candlelight was there near the square comer of the iron frame nothing remained now of the symbol save a scattering of pale powder but across the room near the post by the doorway lay the small bag of cassava flour he had used it must she told herself have been knocked there during the ceremony perhaps it was not empty timorously she picked it up and probed inside some flour still remained dry and fine as coral dust as she drew out a handful and let it sift through her fingers the idea camealmost as though shango had whispered it to her in the dark the drawing of the doubleheaded axe shangos sign had it somehow summoned him that night beckoned him forth from the ancient consciousness of africa to this puny room she stood for a moment and tried again to breathe a prayer what precisely had atiba done how had he drawn the symbol her legs trembling she knelt with a handful of the white powder and carefully began laying down the first line it was not as straight as she had wished nor was its width even but the flour flowed more readily than she had thought it might the symbol atiba had drawn was still etched in her memory it was simple powerful it almost drew itself the crossed lines their ends joined formed two triangles meeting at a common point and then down the middle the bold stroke that was its handle the drawing came into form so readily she found herself thinking that shango must be guiding her hand urging her on in this uncertain homage to his power she stood away and taking the candle studied the figure at her feet the white seemed to undulate in the flickering light she held the candle a moment longer then reached out and placed it directly in the center of the double axehead perhaps it was a gust of wind but the wick suddenly flared brighter as though it now drew strength from the symbol it illuminated the mill the walls of the room all glowed in its warm quivering flame was it imagination or was the candle now giving off that same pale radiance she remembered from languorous afternoons long ago in brazilthe halflight of mist and rainbows that bathed their courtyard in a gossamer sheen when an afternoon storm swept overhead she backed away uneasy and disturbed groping blindly toward the mill frame when her touch caught the hard metal she slipped her hand across the top till her grasp closed on the wand the stone axe at its tip was strangely warm now as though it had drawn heat from the iron or perhaps it had been from the candle she clasped it against her shift feeling its warmth flow into her first it filled her breasts with a sensation of whiteness then it passed downward till it mingled in her thighs it was a sensation of being fulfilled brought to completeness by some essence that flowed out of shango she glanced back at the flickering candle now it washed the drawing with a glow of yellow and gold the candle too seemed to be becoming part of her she wanted to draw its fiery tip into her body to possess it sweat poured down her thighs and in its warmth she felt the desire of shango as she clasped the wand ever more tightly against her breasts she gasped then shuddered the white presence was entering her taking her body for its own she sensed a heat in her eyes as though they might now bum through the dark a heaviness was growing in her legs and she planted her feet wide apart to receive and support the burden she felt swelling in her breasts the room was hot and cold and dark and light she no longer saw anything save whiteness then she plunged the wand skyward and called out in a distant voice resonant e wa nibi shango the flames billowed along the edge of the field and the crackling of the cane swelled into a roar as a carpet of red crept up the hillside clusters of gray rats scurried to escape lending a chorus of highpitched shrieks to the din as the night breeze quickened from the west it whipped the flames toward the dense unharvested acres that lay beyond suddenly the urgent clanging of a bell sounded from the direction of the main compound and soon after silhouettes appeared at the perimeter of the indentures quarters the circle of thatchedroof huts beside the pathway leading to the sugarworks figures of strawhatted womenthe men were all gone away with the militiastood out against the moonlit sky is they watched in fearful silence never had a fire in the fields erupted so suddenly now atiba wanted to shout join us throw off your chains free yourselves he had not been able to enlist their help sooner for fear a traitor among them might betray the revolt but now now they would see that freedom was within their grasp he tried to call to them to beckon them forward give me the words mighty ogun tell me the words that will make the branco slaves join us but the prayer passed unanswered he watched in dismay as the women began one by one to back away to retreat toward their huts in awe and dread still they had done nothing to try and halt the flames so perhaps there still was hope if they were afraid to join the rebellion neither would they raise a hand to save the wealth of their branco master also these were but women women did not fight women tended the compounds of warriors when the men returned the rebellion would begin they would seize their chance to kill the branco master who enslaved them he signaled the other yoruba who moved on quickly toward the curing house where the pots of white sugar waited the sky had taken on a deep red glow as the lowlying clouds racing past reflected back the ochre hue of flames from fields in the south across the island the men of the yoruba had honored their vows they had risen up atiba noticed the savor of victory in his mouth that hardening of muscle when the foe is being driven before your sword fleeing the field it was a strong taste dry and cutting a taste he had known before something entered your blood at a moment like this something more powerful more commanding than your own self as they pushed through the low shrubs leading toward the sugarworks he raised his hand and absently touched the three clan marks down his cheek their shallow furrows reminding him once again of his people tonight he told himself all the men of ife would be proud atiba son of balogun i must tell you my thoughts old tahajo had moved forward ahead of the others i do not think it is good this thing you would have us do now what do you mean atiba eased his own pace slightly as though to signify deference a yoruba may set fires in the forest to drive out a cowardly foe it is all part of war but we do not fire his compounds the compounds that shelter his women the curing house where sugar is kept is not the compound of the brancos women atiba quickened his stride again to reassert his leadership and to prevent the other men from hearing tahajos censure however misguided its a part of his fields together they nourish him like palm oil and salt together they must be destroyed but that is not warfare atiba that is vengeance the old man persisted i have set a torch to the fields of an enemybefore you were born the fulani once forced such a course upon us by breaking the sacred truce during the harvest festivalbut no yoruba would deliberately burn the seed yams in his enemys barn this barn does not hold his yams it holds the fruits of our unjust slavery the two are not the same atiba you are like that large rooster in my eldest wifes compound who would not suffer the smaller ones to crow my words are no more than summer wind to you the old man sighed you would scorn the justice shango demands this is a fearsome thing you would have us do now then i will bear shangos wrath on my own head ogun would have us do this and he is the god we honor tonight it is our duty to him he moved on ahead leaving tahajo to follow in silence the thatched roof of the curing house was ahead in the dark a jagged outline against the rosy sky beyond without pausing he opened the door and led the way all the men knew the room well standing before them were long rows of wooden molds containers they had carried there themselves while a branco overseer with a whip stood by these were placed here with our own hands those same hands will now destroy them he looked up what better justice could there be he sparked the flint off his machete against one of the straw bundles and watched the blaze a moment in silence this flame he told himself would exact the perfect revenge revenge the word had come unbidden yes truly it was revenge but this act was also justice he recalled the proverb one days rain makes up for many days drought tonight one torch would make up for many weeks of whippings starvation humiliation mark me well atiba held the burning straw aloft and turned to address the men these pots are the last sugar you will ever see on this island this and the cane from which it was made all will be gone never to return the forests of the orisa will thrive here once more he held the flaming bundle above his head a moment longer while he intoned a verse in praise of ogun and then flung it against the thatched wall behind him where it splayed against a post and disintegrated they all watched as the dryreed wall smoldered in the halfdarkness then blossomed with small tongues of fire quickly he led them out again through the narrow doorway and into the cool night the west wind whipped the palm trees now growing ever fresher already the flame had scaled the reed walls of the curing house and now it burst through the thatched roof like the opening of a lush tropical flower as they made ready to hurry on up the path toward the mill room the drum of hoofbeats sounded through the night next came frantic shouts from the direction of the great house it was the voice of benjamin briggs atiba motioned them into the shadows where they watched in dismay as a scattering of white indentures began lumbering down the hill toting buckets of water and shovels headed for the burning fields the yoruba men all turned to atiba disbelieving the male branco slaves had not risen up they had come back to aid in the perpetuation of their own servitude as atiba watched the fire brigade he felt his contempt rising and his anger could they not see that this was the moment but instead of turning their guns on their enemy setting torch to his house declaring themselves freethe branco slaves had cravenly done as briggs commanded they were no better than their women the branco chief has returned to his compound like him all the branco masters on the island must now be trembling in fear atiba felt his heart sink as he motioned the men forward finally he understood the whites serina had been right color counted for more than slavery now more than ever they needed the muskets from the ship quickly we must burn the mill then go and seize the guns theres no time to lose the mill house was only a short distance farther up the hill they left the path and moved urgently through the brush and palms toward the back of the thatched building it stood silent waiting a dark silhouette against the glowing horizon atiba there is no longer time for this obewole moved to the front of the line and glanced nervously at the darkening skies heavy clouds obscured the moon and the wind had grown sharp we must hurry to the ship as soon as we can and seize the brancos guns this mill house is a small matter the guns are a heavy one the others will be there soon waiting for us no this must burn too we will melt forever the chains that enslave us he pressed quickly up the slope toward the low thatched building from the center of the roof the high pole projected skyward still scorched where the lightning of shango had touched it the night of the ceremony then hurry the flint obewole held out the last bundle of straw toward atiba as they edged under the thatched eaves theres no time to go in and pray here atiba nodded and out of his hand a quick flash like the pulse of a caribbean firefly shot through the dark shango was with her part of her as serina dropped to her knees before the drawing of the axe she no longer knew who she was where she was unnoticed the dull glow from the open doorway grew brighter as the fires in the cane fields beyond raged shango nibo lo nlo shango she knelt mumbling sweat soaking through her shift the words came over and over almost like the numbing cadence of the christian rosary blotting out all other sounds she had heard nothingnot the shouts at the main house nor the ringing of the fire bell nor the dull roar of flames in the night air but then finally she did sense faint voices in yoruba and she knew shango was there but soon those voices were lost blurred by the distant chorus of crackling sounds that seemed to murmur back her own whispered words the air around her had grown dense suffocating dimly painfully she began to realize that the walls around her had turned to fire she watched mesmerized as small flametips danced in circles of red and yellow and gold then leapt and spun in pirouettes across the rafters of the heavy thatched roof shango had sent her a vision it could not be real then a patch of flame plummeted onto the floor beside her and soon chunks of burning straw were raining about her feebly fear surging through her now she attempted to rise her legs refused to move she watched the flames in terror for a moment and then she remembered the wand still in her outstretched hand without thinking she clasped it again to her pounding breast as the room disappeared in smoke she called out the only word she still remembered shango the collapse of the burning thatched wall behind her masked the deep sonorous crack that sounded over the hillside damn me benjamin briggs dropped his wooden bucket and watched as the dark cloudbank hovering in the west abruptly flared then a boom of thunder shook the night sky its sound seemed to unleash a pentup torrent as a dense sheet of island rain slammed against the hillside around him with the force of a mallet the fires that blazed in the fields down the hill began to sputter into boiling clouds of steam as they were swallowed in wave after wave of the downpour the night grew suddenly dark again save for the crisscross of lightning in the skies for once a rain when we needed it itll save the sugar by my life he turned and yelled for the indentures to reclaim their weapons and assemble try and keep your matchcord dry he watched with satisfaction as the men faces smeared with smoke lined up in front of him weve got to round up the africans now and try and find out whos responsible for this god is my witness i may well hang a couple this very night to make an example i think i saw a crowd of them headed up toward the mill house just before the rain started in the indentures tanned face was emerging as the rain purged away the soot like as not they were thinkin theyd fire that too god damn them all we lose the mill and were ruined he paused then his voice came as a yell gods blood the curing house some of you get over there quick they mightve tried to fire that as well ive got a fortune in white sugar curing out he looked up and pointed at two of the men their straw hats dripping in the rain you and you move or ill have your hide see theres nothing amiss aye yor worship the men whirled and were gone now lads briggs turned back to the others a half dozen men were left all carrying ancient matchlock muskets keep an eye on your matchcord and lets spread out and collect these savages he quickly checked the prime on his flintlock musket and cocked it weve got to stop them before they try to burn the main house he stared through the rain then headed up the hill in the direction of the mill house and stay close to me theyre rampaging like a pack of wild island hogs something was slapping at the smoldering straw in her hair and she felt a hand caress her face then an arm slide beneath her the room the mill all were swallowed in dark blinding smoke now she was aware only of the heat and the closeness of the powerful arms that lifted her off the flamestrewn floor then there were other voices faraway shouts in the same musical language that she heard whispered against her ear the shouts seemed to be directed at the man who held her urging him to leave her to come with them to escape while there was time yet still he held her his cheek close against her own slowly atiba rose holding her body cradled against him and pushed through the smoke the heat was drifting away now and she felt the gentle spatters of rain against her face as sections of the watersoaked thatched roof collapsed around them opening the room to the sky the sound of distant gunfire cut through the night air as he pushed out the doorway into the dark she felt his body stiffen painfully as though he had received the bullets in his own chest but no the firing was down the hill somewhere along the road leading to the coast the cold wetness of the rain and the warmth of the body she knew so well awoke her as though from a dream you must go she heard her own voice why had he bothered to save her instead of leading his own men to safety she was nothing now the revolt had started they must fight or be killed hurry before the branco come as she struggled to regain her feet to urge him on to safety she found herself wanting to flee also to be with him in death as in life if he were gone what would there be to live for we have failed he was caressing her with his sad eyes did you hear the thunder it was the voice of shango now he looked away and his body seemed to wither from some grief deep within i somehow displeased shango and now he has struck us down even ogun is not powerful enough to overcome the god who commands the skies it was because i wanted to protect you he looked down at her quizzically i didnt know you were in the mill house till i heard you call out shangos name why were you there tonight alone i was praying she avoided his dark eyes wishing she could say more praying that you would stop before it was too late i knew you could not succeed i was afraid you would be killed he embraced her then ran his wide hand through her wet singed hair sometimes merely doing what must be done is its own victory ill not live a slave never he held her again tenderly then turned away remember always to live and die with honor let no man ever forget what we tried to do here tonight he was moving down the hill now his machete in his hand no she was running after him halfblinded by the rain dont try to fight any more leave you can hide well escape a yoruba does not hide from his enemies i will not dishonor the compound of my father i will stand and face the man who has wronged me no please she was reaching to pull him back when a voice came out of the dark from the pathway down below halt by god it was benjamin briggs squinting through the downpour so its you i might have known you were behind this ill stake my life stop where you are by jesus or ill blow you to hell like the other two savages who came at my men she found herself wondering if the musket would fire the rain was still a torrent then she felt atibas hand shove her aside and saw his dark form hurtle down the trail toward the planter grasping his machete he moved almost as a cat bobbing weaving surefooted and deadly the rain was split by the crack of a musket discharge and she saw him slip momentarily and twist sideways his machete clattered into the dark as he struggled to regain his balance but he had not slowed his attack when he reached briggs he easily ducked the swinging butt of the musket then his left hand closed about the planters throat and together they went down in the mud to the sound of briggs choked yells when she reached them they were sprawled in the gully beside the path now a muddy flood of water from the hill above atibas right arm dangled uselessly but he held the planter pinned against the mud with his knee while his left hand closed against the throat there were no more yells only deathly silence no dont she was screaming her arms around atibas neck as she tried to pull him away he glanced up at her dazed and his grip on briggs throat loosened slightly the planter lay gasping and choking in the rain dara atiba was looking past her and yelling a warning when the butt of the matchlock caught him across the chest she fell with him as three strawhatted indentures swarmed over them both by god ill hang the savage with my own hands briggs was still gasping as he began to pull himself up out of the mud he choked again and turned to vomit then he struggled to his feet tie the whoreson down hes like a mad dog hes been shot yor worship one of the indentures was studying the blood on his hands from where he had been holding atibas shoulder would you have us attend to this wound i shot the savage myself briggs glared at them no credit to the lot of you then he well nigh strangled me hes still strong as a bull dont trouble with that shot wound ill not waste the swathing cloth he paused again to cough and rub his throat hes going to have a noose around his neck as soon as the rain lets up briggs walked over to where atiba lay his arms pinned against the ground and a pike against his chest may god damn you sir i just learned you managed to burn and ruin a good half the sugar in my curing house he choked again and spat into the rain then he turned back would you could understand what im saying you savage but mark this every black on this islands going to know it when i have you hanged you can be sure itll put a stop to any more of these devilish plots as im a christian serina felt her eyes brimming with tears in trying to save him she had brought about his death but everything she had done had been out of devotion would he ever understand that still perhaps there was time are you well master briggs she turned to the planter her cinnamon fingers stroked lightly along his throat aye and i suppose theres some thanks for you in it he looked at her puzzling at the wet singed strands of hair across her face i presume the savage was thinking to make off with you to use you for his carnal lusts when i haply put a halt to the business i have you to thank well you were some help to me in the bargain ill own it so theres an end on the matter he glanced at atiba then back at her see to it these shiftless indentures tie him up like he was a bull wound or no hes still a threat to life to yours as well as mine even as he spoke a dark shadow seemed to drop out of the rain she glanced up and just managed to recognize the form of derin his machete poised above his head like a scythe it flashed in the lantern light as he brought it down against the arm of one of the indentures holding atiba the strawhatted man screamed and doubled over what happened next was blurred shrouded in the dark atiba was on his feet flinging aside the other indentures then he seized his own machete out of the mud with his left hand and turned on briggs but before he could move derin jostled against him and grabbed his arm there were sharp words in yoruba and atiba paused a frozen silhouette poised above the planter by christ ill briggs was drawing the long pistol from his belt when atiba suddenly turned away the gun came up and fired but the two yoruba warriors were already gone swallowed in the night well go after them god damn you the planter was shouting at the huddled terrified indentures not a man on this plantation is going to sleep till both those heathens are hanged and quartered as the indentures gingerly started down the hill in the direction atiba and derin had gone briggs turned and still coughing headed purposefully up the pathway toward the remains of the mill room the burnedaway roof had collapsed entirely leaving the first sugar mill on barbados open to the rainits wide copper rollers sparkling like new chapter seventeen heave masters winston was waist deep in the surf throwing his shoulder against the line attached to the bow of the defiance the seas as high as its likely to get therell never be a better time to set her afloat joan fuller stood on deck by the bulwark along the waist of the ship supporting herself with the mainmast shrouds as she peered down through the rain she held her bonnet in her hand leaving her yellow hair plastered across her face in watersoaked strands at winstons request she had brought down one of her last kegs of killdevil it was waiting safely lashed to the mainmast a visible inducement to effort heave ho the cadence sounded down the line of seamen as they grunted and leaned into the chop tugging on the slippery line incoming waves washed over the men leaving them alternately choking and cursing but the rise in sea level brought about by the storm meant the defiance was already virtually afloat helped by the men it was slowly disengaging from the sandy mud with each wave the bow would bob upward then sink back a few inches farther into the bay shes all but free masters winston urged them on heave for your lives by god he glanced back at john mewes and yelled through the rain howre the stores mewes spat out a mouthful of foam theres enough water and salt pork in the hold to get us up to nevis island mayhaps if the damned fleet doesnt blockade it first he bobbed backward as a wave crashed against his face theres talk the whoresons could sail north after here aye they may stand for virginia when theyve done with the caribbees but theyll likely put in at st christopher and nevis first just to make sure they humble every freeborn englishman in the americas winston tugged again and watched the defiance slide another foot seaward but with any luck well be north before them he pointed toward the dim mast lanterns of the english gunships offshore all we have to do is slip past those frigates across the bay the men heaved once more and the weathered bow dipped sideways then all at once as though by the hand of nature the defiance was suddenly drifting in the surf a cheer rose up and winston pushed his way within reach of the rope ladder dangling amidships as he clambered over the bulwark joan was waiting with congratulations you did it on my honor i thought this rottedout tub was beached for keeps she bussed him on the cheek though i fancy you mightve lived longer if itd stayed where it was mewes pulled himself over the railing after winston and plopped his feet down onto the wet deck he winked at joan and held out his arms no kiss for the quartermaster yor ladyship i was workin too by my life get on with you you tub of lard she swiped at him with the waterlogged bonnet she held you and the rest of this crew of layabouts might get a tot of killdevil if youre lucky which is more than you deserve considering how much some of you owe me already try heaving her out a little farther masters winston was holding the whipstaff while he yelled from the quarterdeck shes coming about now well drop anchor in a couple of fathoms nothing more while the hull drifted out into the night and surf winston watched john mewes kneel by the bulwark at the waist of the ship and begin to take soundings with a length of knotted rope two fathoms capn by the looks of it what do you think thats enough to drop anchor john i want to keep her in close no sense alerting the roundheads were afloat mewes shouted toward the portside bow and a seaman began to feed out the anchor cable winston watched as it rattled into the surf then he made his way along the rainswept deck back to the starboard gallery at the stern and shoved another large anchor over the side it splashed into the waves and disappeared its cable whipping against the taffrail that ought to keep her from drifting there may be some maintopman out there in the fleet whod take notice whereas fully half the commonwealths ships had sailed for oistins bay to assist in the invasion a few of the larger frigates had kept to station their ordnance trained on the harbor all aboard masters theres a tot of killdevil waiting for every man down by the mainmast winston was calling over the railing toward the seamen now paddling through the dark along the side of the ship johns taking care of it any man whos thirsty come topside well christen the launch the seamen sounded their approval and began to scramble up many did not wait their turn to use the rope ladders instead they seized the rusty deadeyes that held the shrouds found toeholds in the closed gunports and pulled themselves up within reach of the gunwales winston watched approvingly as the shirtless hoard came swarming onto the deck with menacing ease these were still his lads he told himself with a smile they could storm and seize a ship before most of its crew managed even to cock a musket good men to have on hand given what lay ahead whenre you thinkin youll try for open sea joan had followed him up the slippery companionway to the quarterdeck theres a good halfdozen frigates hoveto out there doubtless all with their bleedin guns run out and primed ill wager theyd like nothing better than catchin you to leeward this squalls likely to blow out in a day or so and when it does were going to pick a dark night weigh anchor and make a run for it by then the roundheads will probably be moving on bridgetown so we wont have a lot of time to dally about he looked out toward the lights of the english fleet id almost as soon give it a try tonight damn this foul weather she studied the bobbing pinpoints at the horizon skeptically do you really think you can get past them he smiled care to wager on it ive had a special set of short sails made up and if its dark enough i think we can probably slip right through otherwise well just run out the guns and take them on joan looked back you could be leaving just in time ill grant you therere apt to be dark days ahead here what do you thinkll happen with this militia now barbados heroic freedom fighters id say theyll be disarmed and sent packing back to the cane and tobacco fields where theyd probably just as soon be anyway the grand american revolution is finished tonight when the militia should be moving everything theyve got up to oistins theyre off worrying about cane fires letting the roundheads get set to offload their heavy guns by the time the rains let up and there can be a real engagement the english infantryll have ordnance in place and therell be nothing to meet them with they cant be repulsed its over he looked at her so the only thing left for me is to get out of here while i still can and stand for jamaica that daft scheme she laughed ruefully and brushed the dripping hair from her face youd be better off going up to bermuda for a while or anywhere till things cool off youve not got the men to do anything else maybe i can still collect a few of my indentures and maybe youll see puritans dancin at a papist wedding she scoffed let me tell you something those indentures are going to scatter like a flock of hens the minute the militias disbanded theyll not risk their skin goin off with you to storm that fortress over at villa de la vega if you know whats good for you youll forget jamaica dont count me out yet theres still another way to get the men i need he walked to the railing and gazed out into the rain ive been thinking i might try getting some help another place and where pray could that be youre not going to think much of what i have in mind he caught her eye and realized shed already guessed his plan thats a fools errand for sure kindly dont go prating it about the truth is im not sure yet what ill do whos to say youre a lying rogue hugh winston youve already made up your mind but if youre not careful youll be in a worse bind than this beggin yor pardon capn it looks as if weve got a visitor mewes was moving up the dark companionway to the quarterdeck he spat into the rain then cast an uncomfortable glance toward joan mayhaps youd best come down and handle the orders winston turned and followed him onto the main deck through the dark a white horse could be seen prancing in the gusts of rain along the shore a woman was in the saddle waving silently at the ship oblivious to the squall aye permission to come aboard get her the longboat john he thumbed at the small pinnace dangling from the side of the ship just dont light a lantern mewes laughed id give a hundred sovereigns to the man who could spark up a candle lantern in this weather winston looked up to see joan slowly descending the companionway from the quarterdeck they watched in silence as the longboat was lowered and oarsmen began rowing it the few yards to shore well this is quite a sight if i may say her voice was contemptuous as she broke the silence suddenly she began to brush at her hair attempting to straighten out the tangles ive never known her ladyship to venture out on a night like this she turned and glared at winston though ive heard talk she managed to get herself aboard the defiance once before in a storm youve got big ears enough to keep track of your follies do you suppose your lads dont take occasion to talk when theyve a bit of killdevil in their bellies you should be more discreet or else pay them better i pay them more than theyre worth now well they were most admirin of your little conquest or was the conquest hers joan why dont you just let it rest he moved to the railing at midships and reached down to help katherine up the rope ladder whats happened this is the very devil of a night hugh she was about to throw her arms around him when she noticed joan she stopped dead still then turned and nodded with cold formality your servant madam your ladyships most obedient joan curtsied back with a cordiality hewn from ice they examined each other a moment in silence then katherine seemed to dismiss her as she turned back to winston please wont you come back and help just for tonight he reached for her hand and felt it trembling help you what do you mean his voice quickened dont tell me the roundheads have already started marching on bridgetown not that we know of but now that the rains put out the cane fires a few of the militia have started regrouping with their horses she squeezed his hand in her own maybe we could still try an attack on the oistins breastwork at dawn you dont have a chance now that the rains have begun you cant move up any cannon the roads are like rivers but theyve got heavy ordnance the roundheads have doubtless got those cannons in the breastwork turned around now and covering the road if wed have marched last evening we couldve moved up some guns of our own and then hit them at first light before they expected an attack but now its too late he examined her sadly her face was drawn and her hair was plastered against her cheeks its over katy barbados is lost but you said youd fight even if you had nobody but your own men briggs and the rest of them managed to change my mind for me why should i risk anything they wont she stood unmoving still grasping his hand then youre really leaving i am he looked at her i still wish youd decide to go with me god knows suddenly she pulled down his face and kissed him on the lips lingering as the taste of rain flooded her mouth finally she pulled away i cant think now at least about that but for gods sake please help us tonight let us use those flintlocks youve got here on the ship theyre dry the roundhead infantry probably has mostly matchlocks and theyll be wet with your muskets maybe we can make up for the difference in our numbers he examined her skeptically just exactly whose idea is this katy who do you suppose nobody else knows youve got them anthony walrond knows winston laughed ill say one thing it would be perfect justice then use them to arm our militia with your guns maybe ill be needing those flintlocks where im going joan pushed forward with a scowl give me leave to put you in mind madam that those muskets belong to hugh not to the worthless militia on this island she turned on winston dont be daft you give those new flintlocks over to the militia and youll never see half of them again you know that as well as i do he stood studying the locked focsle in silence ill grant you that id be a perfect fool to let the militia get hold of them hugh what happened to all your talk of honor katherine drew back i thought you were going to fight to the last i told you he paused as he gazed into the rain for a long moment finally he looked back id say there is one small chance left if we went in with a few men before it gets light maybe we could spike the cannon in the breastwork then at least it would be an even battle would you try it he took her hand ignoring joans withering glare maybe i do owe anthony walrond a little farewell party in appreciation for his selling this island and me with it to the god damned roundheads then youll come how about this if i can manage to get some of my lads over to oistins before daybreak we might try paying them a little surprise he grinned it would be good practice for jamaica then stay and help us fight how can we just give up when theres still a chance they cant keep up their blockade forever then well be done with england have a free nation here he shook his head in resignation then turned up his face to feel the rain he stood for a time the two women watching him as the downpour washed across his cheeks theres no freedom on this island anymore there may never be again but maybe i do owe anthony walrond and his windwards a lesson in honor he looked back all right but go back up to the compound youd best stay clear of this before she could respond he turned and signaled toward mewes john unlock the muskets and call all hands on deck dalby bedford was standing in the doorway of the makeshift tent peering into the dark he spotted winston trailed by a crowd of shirtless seamen walking up the road between the rows of rainwhipped palms gods life is that who it looks to be what the plague the knave had the brass to come back colonel george heathcott pushed his way through the milling crowd of militia officers and moved alongside bedford to stare as though we hadnt enough confusion already the governors plumed hat and doublet were soaked while the storm had swept the island he had taken command of the militia keeping together a remnant of men and officers but now only two hours before dawn the squall still showed no signs of abating even with the men who had returned the ranks of the militia had been diminished to a fraction of its former strengthsince many planters were still hunting down runaways or had barricaded themselves and their families in their homes for safety several plantation houses along the west coast had been burned and through the rain random gunfire could still be heard as slaves were being pursued though the rebellion had been routed a few pockets of africans armed with machetes remained at large the recapture of the slaves was now merely a matter of time but that very time bedford realized might represent the difference between victory and defeat those men with him are all carrying something heathcott squinted through the rain at the line of men trailing after winston by god id venture those could be muskets maybe hes managed to locate a few more matchlocks for us he heaved a deep breath though theyll be damned useless in this rain your servant captain bedford bowed lightly as winston ducked under the raised flap at the entrance of the leanto shelter here to join us i thought we might come back over for a while he glanced around at the scattering of officers in the tent who wants to help me go down to the breastwork and see if we can spike whatever guns theyve got if we did that maybe you could muster enough men to try storming the place when it gets light youre apt to be met by five hundred men with pikes sir and anthony walrond at their head heathcotts voice was filled with dismay three or four for every one weve got we dont have the men to take and hold that breastwork now not till some more of the militia get back if those guns arent spiked by dawn youd as well just go ahead and surrender and have done with it he looked around the tent mind if i let the boys come in out of the rain to prime their muskets muskets heathcott examined him youll not be using matchlocks not in this weather i doubt a man could keep his matchcord lit long enough to take aim i sure as hell dont plan to try taking the breastwork with nothing but pikes winston turned and gestured for the men to enter the tent dick hawkins led the way unshaven shirtless and carrying two oilcloth bundles after him came edwin spurre cursing the rain as he set down two bundles of his own over a dozen other seamen followed this tent is for the command sir heathcott advanced on winston i dont know what authority you think you have to start bringing in your men we cant prime muskets in the rain sir youre no longer in charge here and weve all had quite his glance fell on the bundle spurre was unwrapping the candle lantern cast a golden glow over a shiny new flintlock the barrel was damascened in gold and the stock was fine italian walnut inlaid with mother of pearl both the serpentine cock and the heel plate on the stock were engraved and gilt good god where did that piece come from from my personal arsenal winston watched as spurre slipped out the ramrod and began loading and priming the flintlock then he continued these muskets dont belong to your militia theyre just for my own men here tonight if you can keep them dry heathcotts voice quickened maybe you could they should be good for at least one round before the lock gets damp winston turned to heathcott they wont be expecting us now so if your men can help us hold the breastwork while we spike those cannon we might just manage it and these guns heathcott was still admiring the muskets we wont use them any more than we have to winston walked down the line of officers theres apt to be some handtohand fighting if their infantry gets wind of whats afoot and tries to rush the emplacement while were still up there how many of your militiamen have the stomach for that kind of assignment the tent fell silent save for the drumbeat of rain the officers all knew that to move on the breastwork now would be the ultimate test of their will to win the question on every mans mind was whether their militia still possessed that will but the alternative was most likely a brief and ignominious defeat on the field followed by unconditional surrender they gathered in a huddle at the rear of the tent a cluster of black hats while winstons men continued priming the guns damnd wellmade piece this one edwin spurre was admiring the gilded trigger of his musket i hope she shoots as fine as she feels he looked up at winston i think we can keep the powder pan dry enough if we take care theyve all got a cover thats been specially fitted winston laughed only the best for sir anthony lets make sure he finds out how much we appreciate the gun smithing he paid for its a risk sir damned if its not heathcott broke from the huddle and approached winston but with these flintlocks we might have an advantage theyll not be expecting us now maybe we can find some men to back you up we could use the help but i only want volunteers winston surveyed the tent and they cant be a lot of untested farmers wholl panic and run if the roundheads try and make a charge well and good bedford nodded then turned to heathcott ill be the first volunteer were running out of time winston reached for a musket then lets get on with it rain now all about them engulfing them the dense caribbean torrent that erases the edge between earth sky and sea winston felt as though they were swimming in it the gusts wet against his face soaking through his leather jerkin awash in his boots the earth seemed caught in a vast ephemeral river which oscillated like a pendulum between ocean and sky in the caribbees this water from the skies was different from anywhere else he had ever known the heavens like a brooding deity first scorched the islands with a whitehot sun then purged the heat with warm remorseless tears why had he come back to oistins to chance his life once more in the service of liberty the very thought brought a wry smile he now realized there would never be liberty in this slaveowning corner of the americas too much wealth was at stake for england to let go of this shiny new coin in cromwells exchequer the puritans who ruled england would keep barbados at any cost and they would see to it that slavery stayed no coming back now was a personal point principle if youd go back on your word there was little else you wouldnt scruple to do as well maybe freedom didnt have a chance here but you fought the fight you were given you didnt betray your cause the way anthony walrond had there look to be lighted linstocks up there capn theyre ready edwin spurre nodded toward the tall outline of the breastwork up ahead it was a heavy brick fortification designed to protect the gun emplacements against cannon fire from the sea the flicker of lantern light revealed that the cannon had been rolled around directed back toward the roadway in open view weve got to see those linstocks are never used he paused and motioned for the men to circle around him their flintlocks were still swathed in oilcloth we need to give them a little surprise masters so hold your fire as long as you can anyway were apt to need every musket if the windwards realize were there and try to counterattack do you really think we can get up there capn dick hawkins carefully set down a large brown sack holding spikes hammers and grapplesthe last used for boarding vessels at sea its damned high were going to have to circle around and try taking it from the sea side which is even higher but that way they wont see us also we cant have bandoliers rattling so weve got to leave them here just take a couple of chargeholders in each pocket therell not be time for more anyway he turned and examined the heavy brick of the breastwork now look lively before they spot us hawkins silently began lifting out the grapplesheavy barbed hooks that had been swathed with sailcloth so they would land soundlessly each with fifty feet of line winston picked one up and checked the wrapping on the prongs would it catch and hold maybe between the raised battlements he watched as hawkins passed the other grapples among the men eighteen of them all together then they moved on through the night circling around toward the seaward wall of the fortification behind them the first contingent of volunteers from the barbados militia waited in the shadows as soon as the gunners were overpowered by winstons men they would advance and help hold the breastwork while the guns were being spiked in the rainy dark neither winston nor his seamen noticed the small band of men skin black as the night who now edged forward silently through the shadows behind them they had arrived at the defiance earlier that evening only to discover it afloat several yards at sea then they had watched in dismay as winston led a band of seamen ashore in longboats carrying the very muskets they had come to procure could it be the guns were already primed and ready to fire prudently atiba had insisted they hold back they had followed through the rain biding their time all the fivemile trek to oistins then they had waited patiently while winston held council with the branco chiefs finally they had seen the muskets being primed which meant they could have been safely seized all along but now time was running out how to take the guns it must be done quickly while there still was dark to cover their escape into hiding atiba watched as winston and the men quietly positioned themselves along the seaward side of the breastwork and began uncoiling the lines of their grapples suddenly he sensed what was to happen next perhaps now there was a way to get the guns after all wait and be ready he motioned the men back into the shadows of a palm grove then he darted through the rain winston was circling the first grapple above his head intended for the copestone along the top of the breastwork when he heard a quiet portuguese whisper at his ear you will not succeed senhor the ingles will hear your hooks when they strike against the stone what the pox he whirled to see a tall black man standing behind him a machete in his hand a life for a life senhor was that not what you said atiba glanced around him the seamen stared in wordless astonishment do you wish to seize the great guns atop this fortress then let my men do it for you this is best done the yoruba way where the hell did you come from winstons whisper was almost drowned in the rain from out of the dark remember my skin is black sometimes that is an advantage even on an island owned by the white ingles briggs will kill you if he catches you here atiba laughed i could have killed him tonight but i chose to wait i want to do it the ingles way with a musket he slipped the machete into his waistwrap i have come to make a trade what do you mean look around you atiba turned and gestured out of the palms emerged a menacing line of black men all carrying cane machetes my men are here we could kill all of you now senhor and simply take your muskets but you once treated me as a brother so i will barter with you fairly as though today were market day in ife i and my men will seize this branco fortress and make it an offering of friendship to yourather than watch you be killed trying to take it yourselfin trade for these guns he smiled grimly a life for a life do you recall the revolt you started is as good as finished just like i warned you would happen winston peered through the rain you wont be needing any muskets now perhaps it is over but we will not die as slaves we will die as yoruba and many branco will die with us not with my flintlocks they wont winston examined him and noticed a dark stain of blood down his shoulder atiba drew out his machete again and motioned the other men forward then see what happens when we use these instead he turned the machete in his hand it may change your mind before winston could reply he turned and whispered a few brisk phrases to the waiting men they slipped their machetes into their waistwraps and in an instant were against the breastwork scaling it as the seamen watched in disbelief a host of dark figures moved surely silently up the sloping stone wall of the breastwork their fingers and toes caught the crevices and joints in the stone with catlike agility as they moved toward the top gods blood capn what in hells this about dick hawkins moved next to winston still holding a grapple and line are these savages im damned if i know for sure but i dont like it his eyes were riveted on the line of black figures now blended against the stone of the breastwork they had merged with the rain all but invisible in what seemed only moments atiba had reached the parapet along the top of the breastwork followed by his men for an instant winston caught the glint of machetes reflecting the glow of the lighted linstocks and then nothing by god no therell be no unnecessary killing he flung his grapple upward then gestured at the men lets go topside quick the light clank of the grapple against the parapet was lost in the strangled cries of surprise from atop the breastwork then a few muted screams drifted down through the rain the sounds died away almost as soon as they had begun leaving only the gentle pounding of rain it is yours senhor the portuguese words came down as atiba looked back over the side but come quickly one of them escaped us i fear he will sound a warning there will surely be more branco soon damn your eyes winston seized the line of his grapple tested it and began pulling himself up the face of the stone wall there was the clank of grapples as the other men followed the scene atop the breastwork momentarily took his breath away all the infantrymen on gunnery duty had had their throats cut their bodies now sprawled haphazardly across the stonework one gunner was even slumped across the breech of a demiculverin still clasping one of the lighted linstocks its oilsoaked tip smoldering inconclusively in the rain the yoruba warriors stood among them wiping blood from their machetes good christ winston exploded and turned on atiba there was no need to kill all these men you just had to disarm them it is better atiba met his gaze they were branco warriors is it not a warriors duty to be ready to die you bloodthirsty savage atiba smiled so tell me what are these great ingles guns sitting all around us here meant to do save lives or kill men by the hundreds men whose face you never have to see my people do not make these so who is the savage my ingles friend damn you there are rules of war ah yes you are civilized he slipped the machete into his waistwrap someday you must explain to me these rules you have for civilized killing perhaps they are something like the rules your christians have devised to justify making my people slaves winston looked at him a moment longer then at the bodies lying around them there was nothing to be done now best to get on with disabling the guns dick haul up that sack with the spikes and lets make quick work of this aye hawkins seized the line attached to his waist and walked to the edge of the parapet at the other end resting in the mud below was the brown canvas bag containing the hammers and the spikes moments later the air rang with the sound of metal against metal as the seamen began hammering small naillike spikes into the touchholes of each cannon that was the signal for the barbados militiamen to advance from the landward side of the breastwork to provide defensive cover a life for a life senhor atiba moved next to winston we served you now it is time for your part of the trade youre not getting any of my flintlocks if thats what you mean dont make us take them atiba dropped his hand to the handle of his machete and dont make my boys show you how they can use them winston stood unmoving theres been killing enough here tonight so you are not after all a man who keeps his word you are merely another branco he slowly began to draw the machete from his belt i gave you no word and i wouldnt advise that winston pushed back the side of his wet jerkin clearing the pistols in his belt out of the dark rain a line of barbados planters carrying homemade pikes came clambering up the stone steps colonel heathcott was in the lead good job captain by my life he beamed from under his gray hat we heard nary a peep but you were too damned quick by half bedfords just getting the next lot of militia together now hell need as he topped the last step he stumbled over the fallen body of a commonwealth infantryman a tin helmet clattered across the stonework gods blood what he peered through the half light at the other bodies littering the platform then glared at winston you massacred the lads we had some help heathcott stared past winston noticed atiba and stopped stone still then he glanced around and saw the cluster of africans standing against the parapet still holding machetes good god he took a step backward and motioned toward his men form ranks therere runaways up here and theyre armed careful before winston could finish he heard a command in yoruba and saw atiba start forward with his machete no by god winston shouted in portuguese before atiba could move he was holding a cocked pistol against the yorubas cheek i said theres been enough bloodshed dont make me kill you to prove it in the silence that followed there came a series of flashes from the dark down the shore followed by dull pops two of the planters at the top of the stone steps groaned twisted and slumped against the stonework with bleeding flesh wounds then a second firing order sounded through the rain it carried the unmistakable authority of anthony walrond on the double masters the fireworks are set to begin winston turned and shouted toward the seamen still hammering in the spikes spurre get those flintlocks unwrapped and ready it looks like walrond has a few dry muskets of his own aye capn he signaled the seamen who had finished their assigned tasks to join him and together they took cover against the low parapet on the landward side of the breastwork heathcott and the planters pikes at the ready nervously moved behind them winston felt a movement and turned to see atiba twist away he stepped aside just in time to avoid the lunge of his machetethen brought the barrel of the pistol down hard against the side of his skull the yoruba groaned and staggered back against the cannon nearest them as he struggled to regain his balance he knocked aside the body of the commonwealth infantryman who lay sprawled across its barrel the smoldering linstock still in his dead grasp the man slid slowly down the wet side of the culverin toward the breech finally he tumbled forward onto the stonework releasing his grasp on the handle of the lighted linstock later winston remembered watching in paralyzed horror as the linstock clattered against the breech of the culverin scattering sparks the oilsoaked rag that had been its tip seemed to disintegrate as the handle slammed against the iron and a fragment of burning rag fluttered against the shielded touch hole a flash shattered the night as a tongue of flame torched upward for a moment it illuminated the breastwork like midday in the stunned silence that followed there were yells of surprise from the far distance in the direction of the english camp no one had expected a cannon shot moments later several rounds of musket fire erupted from the roadway below the approaching barbados militiamen had assumed they were being fired on from the breastwork but now they had revealed their position almost immediately their fire was returned by the advance party of the windward regiment suddenly one of the yoruba waiting at the back of the breastwork shouted incomprehensibly broke from the group and began clambering over the parapet there were more yells and in moments the others were following him atiba who had been knocked sprawling by the cannons explosion called for them to stay but they seemed not to hear in seconds they had vanished over the parapet and into the night you betrayed us senhor he looked up at winston you will pay for it with your life not tonight i wont winston was still holding the pistol praying it was not too wet to fire not tonight but soon he shoved the machete unsteadily into his waistwrap winston noticed that he had difficulty rising but he managed to pull himself up weakly then his strength appeared to revive our war is not over amid the gunfire and confusion he turned and slipped down the landward side of the breastwork winston watched as he disappeared into the rain how many more left to spike masters he yelled back toward the men with the hammers as he spoke more musket fire sounded from the plain below weve got all but two capn hawkins shouted back through the rain these damned little demiculverin our spikes are too big then the hell with them weve done what we came to do he motioned toward heathcott lets call it a night and make a run for it now fine job i must say heathcott was smiling broadly as he motioned the cringing planters away from the wall well hold them yet while the seamen opened sporadic covering fire with their flintlocks the militia began scrambling down the wet steps when the column of walronds windward regiment now marching up from the seaside realized they were armed it immediately broke ranks and scattered for cover in moments winston and heathcott were leading their own men safely up the road toward the camp they met the remainder of the barbados militia midway a bedraggled cluster in the downpour you can turn back now sirs heathcott saluted the lead officer who was kneeling over a form fallen in the sand you gave us good cover when we needed you but now its done the ordnance is spiked at sunup well drive the roundheads back into the sea good christ the officers voice was trembling as he looked up rain streaming down his face wed as well just sue for peace and have done with it what heathcott examined him what do you mean he was leading us dalby bedford the windwards caught him in the chest when they opened fire he seemed to choke on his dismay the islands no longer got a governor chapter eighteen above the wide hilltop the midmorning rain had lightened momentarily to fine mist a golden awning shading the horizon a lone figure hatless and wearing a muddy leather jerkin moved slowly up the rutted path toward the brick compound reserved for the governor of barbados behind him lay the greenmantled rolling hills of the island beyond shrouded in drizzle and fog churned the onceplacid caribbean the roadway was strewn with palm fronds blown into haphazard patterns by the nights storm and as he walked a new gust of wind sang through the trees trumpeting a mournful lament then a stripe of white cut across the new thunderheads in the west and the sky started to darken once again more rain would be coming soon he told himself yet more storm that would stretch into the night and mantle the island and sea he studied the sky wistfully thinking over what had passed would that the squalls could wash all of it clean the way a downpour purged the foul straw and offal from a cobblestone london street but there was no making it right anymore now the only thing left was to try and start anew in a place far away would she understand that the gate of the compound was secured and locked as though to shut out the world beyond he pulled the clapper on the heavy brass bell and in its ring heard a foreboding finality sir the voice from inside the gate was nervous fearful he knew it was james the irish servant who had been with katherine and the governor for a decade miss bedford by the saints captain winston is that you sir the mistress said youd gone back over to oistins i just came from there hows the fighting the voice revealed itself as belonging to a short thinhaired man with watery eyes weve not heard from his excellency since he sent that messenger down last night then after that mistress just take me to miss bedford he quickly cut off what he realized could grow into an accounting of the entire household for the past fortnight how do i go about telling her he asked himself that its the end of everything she had everything she hoped for that theres no future left here is she expecting you captain james eyes narrowed as he pushed wide the heavy wooden door leading into the hallway i pray nothings happened to shes not expecting me just tell her ive come aye your worship as you please he indicated a chair in the reception room then turned to head off in the direction of the staircase katherine was already advancing down the wide mahogany steps she was dressed in a calico bodice and full skirt her hair bunched into moist ringlets of its own making her bloodshot eyes told winston she had not slept hugh what is it why have you come back she searched his face in puzzlement then her eyes grew wild oh god whats happened she stumbled down the rest of the steps tell me katy there was some shooting and he told her first that dalby bedford was dead then how it happened next he explained that since the island no longer had a seated governor the assembly had elected to accept in full the terms set forth by the admiral of the fleet he told it as rapidly as he could hoping somehow to lessen the pain she listened calmly her face betraying no emotion finally she dropped into a tall bulky chair and gazed around for a moment as though bidding farewell to the room maybe its better this way after all she looked down without the humiliation of the tower and a public trial by cromwell winston watched her marveling there still was no hint of a tear nothing save her sad eyes bespoke her pain as she continued its ironic isnt it both of them my mother years ago and now killed by a gun when all they ever wanted for the world was peace she tried to smile these are dangerous times to be about in the americas captain youre right to always keep those flintlocks in your belt she turned away and he knew she was crying the servants had gathered james and the two women huddled by the staircase unable to speak katy i came as soon as i could to tell you god only knows whats to happen now but you cant stay here theyll figure out in no time youve had a big hand in this youll likely be arrested im not afraid of them or cromwell himself she was still gazing at the wooden planks of the floor well you ought to be he walked over and knelt down next to her chair its over these planters we were fighting for gave the island away so i say damned to them theres more to the americas than barbados he paused and finally she turned to gaze at him there were wet streaks down her cheeks maybe now youll come with me well make a place somewhere else she looked into his eyes and silently bit her lip it was almost as though he had never truly seen her till this moment his heart went out to her as he continued i want you with me theres another island katy if youre willing to try and help me take it i dont she seemed unsure what she wanted to say she looked at him a moment longer then around at the room the servants finally she gazed down again still silent katy i cant make you come nor can i promise itll be easy but youve got to decide now theres no time to wait for anything weve both got to get out of here im going to collect as many of my indentures as possible then try and run the blockade tonightrain storm no matter who knows if ill make it but its my only hope he rose to his feet his muddy boots had left dark traces on the rug its yours too if you want it surely you know that her voice came like a whisper as she looked up we tried didnt we truly we did you cant give liberty to the americas if these puritans only want it for themselves its got to be for everybody remember what i said they could have freed the africans in return for help and they might have won if i ever doubted that god knows i dont anymore not after what i saw last night but they wanted slaves and theres no mobilizing an island thats only half free so they got what they deserve he walked to the sideboard a flask of brandy was there with glasses he lifted the bottle and wearily poured himself a shot then he turned and hoisted the glass we gave it our best but we couldnt do it alone not here he drank off the liquor and poured in more give me some of that she motioned toward the bottle he quickly filled another glass and placed it in her hands the servants watched astonished as she downed it in one gulp then turned back to winston how can i go just yet therere his papers here everything what he did mustnt just be forgotten he created a democratic nation an assembly all of it here in the americas someday nobody gives a damn about that anymore he strode over with the flask and refilled her glass youve got to get out of here this is the first place theyre apt to look for you you can stay at joans place till were ready to go joan she stared at him disbelieving you mean joan fuller shes the only person left here i trust she despises me she always has no more than youve despised her so make an end on it i katy theres no time to argue now the damned roundheads are going to be in bridgetown by dark ive got to go down to the ship before the rain starts in again and sort things out weve got to finish lading and get ready to weigh anchor before its too late he watched as she drank silently from the glass her eyes faraway finally he continued if you want ill send joan to help you pack up he emptied the second glass of brandy then set it back on the sideboard when he turned back to her he was half smiling i suppose ive been assuming youre going with me just because i want you to so badly well she looked again at the servants then around the room at last she turned to winston hold me he walked slowly to the chair and lifted her into his arms he ran his hands through her wet hair then brought up her lips at last he spoke does that mean yes she nodded silently then ive got to go just pack what you think youll want but not too many silk skirts and bodices you wont be needing them where were going try and bring some of those riding breeches of yours she hugged him tighter i was just thinking of our little island when was that yesterday just yesterday but therere lots of islands in the caribbean yesterday she drew back and looked at him and tomorrow this time tomorrow well be at sea or well be at the bottom of the bay out there he kissed her one last time ill send joan quick as i can so please hurry before she could say more he stalked out into the rain and was gone the sand along the shore of the bay was firm beaten solid by the squall the heavy thunderheads that threatened earlier had now blanked the sun bringing new rain that swept along the darkened shore in hard strokes ahead through the gloom he could make out the outlines of his seamen kegs of water balanced precariously on their shoulders in an extended line from the thatchedroof warehouse by the careenage at the river mouth down to a longboat bobbing in the surf after the raid on the oistins breastwork he had ordered them directly back to bridgetown to finish lading a streak of white cut across the sky and in its shimmering light he could just make out the defiance safely anchored in the shallows canvas furled nodding with the swell joan she had said nothing when he asked her to go up and help katherine shed merely glared her disapproval while ordering the girls to bring her cloak joan was saving her thoughts for later he knew thered be more on the subject of katherine the only sounds now were the pounding of rain along the shore and the occasional distant rumble of thunder he was so busy watching the men he failed to notice the figure in white emerge from the darkness and move toward his path when the form reached out for him he whirled and dropped his hand to a pistol senhor desculpe the rainmantled shadow curtsied portuguese style he realized it was a woman briggs mulata the one joan seemed so fond of before he could reply she seized his arm faga o favor senhor will you help us i beg you there was an icy urgency in her touch what are you doing here he studied her still startled her long black hair was coiled across her face in tangled strands and there were dark new splotches down the front of her white shift im afraid hell die senhor and if hes captured who winston tried unsuccessfully to extract his arm from her grasp i know he wanted to take the guns you have but they were for us to fight for our freedom he wished you no harm good god so she had been part of it too he almost laughed aloud thinking how benjamin briggs had been cozened by all his slaves even his halfafrican mistress you mean that yoruba atiba tell him he can go straight to hell do you have any idea what he had his men do last night she looked up puzzled her eyes still pleading through the rain no i dont suppose you could he shrugged it scarcely matters now but his parting words were an offer to kill me no more than a few hours ago so i say damned to him he is a man no more than you but no less he was bom free yet now he is a slave his people are slaves she paused and when she did a distant roll of thunder melted into the rain he did what he had to do for his people for me all he and his people managed was to help the commonwealth bring this island to its knees how because he led the yoruba in a revolt against slavery she gripped his arm even tighter if he helped defeat the planters then i am glad perhaps it will be the end of slavery after all winston smiled sadly its only the beginning of that accursed trade he might have stopped itwho knowsif hed won but he lost so thats the end of it for him for barbados but you can save him she tugged winston back as he tried to brush past her i know you are leaving take him with you he belongs to briggs he glanced back same as you do theres nothing i can do about it right now i doubt good master briggs is of a mind to do anything but hang him then if his life has no value to anyone here take him as a free man a web of white laced across the thunderhead in its light he could just make out the tall masts of the defiance waving against the dark sky like emblems of freedom god damn you benjamin briggs god damn your island of slaveholders where is he derin has hidden him not too far from here when atiba fainted from the loss of blood he brought him up there she turned and pointed toward the dark bulk of the island in a grove of trees where the branco could not find him then he came to me for help whos this derin one of the yoruba men who was with him wherere the others there mustve been a dozen or so over at oistins this morning some were killed near there the others were captured derin told me they were attacked by the militia atiba only escaped because he fainted and derin carried him to safety the others stayed to fight to save him and they were taken her voice cracked i heard master briggs say the ones who were captured obewole and the others would be burned alive tomorrow burned alive all the planters have agreed that is what they must do it is to be made the punishment on barbados for any slave who revolts so the rest of the africans will always fear the branco such a thing would never be allowed on english soil this is not your england senhor this is barbados where slavery has become the lifeblood of all wealth they will do it bedford would never allow he stopped and felt his heart wrench good christ now theres no one to stop them damn these bloodthirsty puritans he turned to her can you get him down here without being seen we will try if you can do it ill take him and derin too in for a penny in for a pound his smile was bitter pox on it ill take them both senhor she dropped to her knees tell me how i can thank you just be gone before my boys get wind of this he pulled her to her feet and glanced toward the rainswept line of seamen carrying water kegs theyll not fancy it you can be sure ive got worries enough as is god knows muito muito obrigada senhor she stood unmoving tears streaming down her cheeks just go he stepped around her and moved on down the shore toward the moored longboat where the men were working now john mewes was standing alongside minimally supervising the seamen as they stacked kegs mingled with his own men were several of the irish indentures damn this squall capn well not be able to get under way till she lets up its no weather for a christian to be at sea that i promise you i think its apt to ease up around nightfall he checked the clouds again whatre we needing once we get this laded therell be water aboard and to spare he wiped the rain from his eyes and glanced at the sky god knows the whole of the islands seen enough water to float to seatis salt pork were wanting now and biscuit can we get any cassava flour theres scarcely any to be had the islands half starved capn did you check all the warehouses along here aye we invited ourselves in and rifled what we could find but theres pitiful little left save batches of moldy tobacco waitin to be shipped damn then well just have to sail with what weve got winston turned and stared down the shore there had not been any provisions offloaded from europe since the fleet arrived there were no ships in the harbor now save the defiance and the zeelander the zeelander whens the last time you saw ruyters this very mornin ast happens he came nosing by to enquire how it was were afloat and i told him it mustve been the tide lifted her off mewes turned and peered through the rain toward the dutch frigate whatre you thinking im thinking he still owes me a man a spaniard by the name of vargas which ive yet to collect that damned butterboxll be in no mood to accommodate you i swear it all the same we made a bargain i want you and some of the boys to go over and settle it he thumbed at the zeelander lodged in the sand not two hundred yards down the beach in the meantime i have to go back up to joans and collect a few things why dont you try and find ruyters get that spaniard however you have to do it and maybe see if hell part with any of their biscuit aye ill tend to it he turned to go and john winston waved him back aye we may be having some company before we weigh anchor remember that yoruba we caught on board a few nights back aye i recollect the heathen well enough ive not seen him since thank god though some of the lads claim there was one up at oistins this mornin who sounded a lot like him same man ive a mind to take him with us and maybe another one but dont say anything to the boys just let him on board if he shows up youre the captain but id sooner have a viper between decks as that godless savage theyre sayin he and a bunch of his kind gutted a good dozen englishmen this mornin like they was no bettern so many spaniards well thats done and past just see he gets on board and the boys keep quiet about it theyll not be likin it by my life thats an order aye mewes turned with a shrug whistled for some of the seamen then headed through the rain down the shore toward the beached hulk of the zeelander shes here darlin joan met him at the door in back with the girls how is she winston threw off his wet cape and reached for the tankard of sack she was handing him i think shes starting to understand hes dead now i guess it just took a while now i think its time you told me a few things yourself whyre you taking her ist because youre worried the roundheads might send her back home to be hanged is that the reason you want to hear damn your eyes hugh winston youre not in love with her are you he smiled and took a sip from the tankard youd best beware of her love she sighed that ones not for you shes too independent and i doubt she even knows what shes doin half the time and how about me think i know what im doing he pulled back a chair and straddled it doubtless not given what youre plannin next she plopped into a chair but ive packed your things you whoremaster the girlsre already sorry to see the lot of you leavin i think theyve taken a fancy to a couple of your lads she laughed but theyd have preferred you most of all god knows ive had to keep an eye on the jades day and night he turned and stared out in the direction of the rain maybe youll decide to come over someday and open shop on jamaica this place has bad times coming she leaned back and poured a tankard of sack for herself thats a fools dream but youre right about one thing therere dark days in store here not a doubt who knows how itll settle out the wind seemed to play against the doors of the tavern then they swung open and a sudden gust coursed through the room spraying fine mist across the tables winston damn me if i didnt figure id find you here benjamin briggs pushed into the room shook the rain from his wide hat and reached for a chair im told you were the last to see that yoruba of mine that he tried to kill you this moming much as he aimed to murder me he was at oistins true enough winston glanced up thats what i heard theyre claiming he and those savages of his brutally murdered some of cromwells infantry he shook his hat one last time and tossed it onto the table weve got to locate him maybe you have some idea where he is now he didnt trouble advising me of his intended whereabouts well hes a true savage by my soul a peril to every christian on this island he sighed and looked at winston i dont know whether youve heard but the roundheads have already started disarming our militia well soon have no way to defend ourselves i think i winged him last night but that heathen is apt to come and kill us both if we dont hunt him down and finish the job while weve still got the chance he lowered his voice i heard about those flintlocks of yours i was hoping maybe youd take some of your boys and we could go after him whilst things are still in a tangle over at oistins winston sat unmoving remember what i told you the other day about freeing these africans well now i say damned to you you can manage your slaves any way you like but itll be without my flintlocks thats scarcely an attitude thatll profit the either of us at the moment briggs signaled to joan for a tankard of killdevil peculiar company you keep these days mistress fuller twould seem the captain here cares not tuppence for his own life well so be it ill locate that savage without him if i needs must he took a deep breath and gazed around the empty room but lest my ride down here be for naught id as soon take the time right now and settle that bargain we made joan poured the tankard and shoved it across the table to him you mean that woman you own aye the mulatto wench im thinking i might go ahead and take your offer of a hundred pounds and damned to her what i said was eighty joan stared at him coldly aye eighty a hundred who can recall a shilling here or there he took a swig what say we make it ninety then and have an end to the business joan eyed him i said eighty though i might consider eightyfive but not a farthing more youre a hard woman to trade with on my honor he took another draught from the tankard then eightyfive it is but only on condition we settle it here and now in sterling ill not waste another days feed on her winston glanced at joan then back at briggs do you know where she is the planters eyes narrowed up at my compound where else in gods name would she be winston took a drink and looked out the doorway into the rain i heard talk she was seen down around here this morning maybe shes run off he turned to joan id encourage you to pay on delivery damn you sir our bargains been struck briggs settled his tankard with a ring i never proposed delivering her with a coach and four horses joan sat silently listening finally she spoke youd best not be thinkin to try and swindle me ill advance you five pounds now on account but youll not see a penny of the rest till shes in my care as you will then he turned and spat toward the corner shell be here word of honor joan glanced again at winston then rose and disappeared through the shuttered doors leading into the back room after briggs watched her depart he turned toward winston you sir have studied to plague me from the day you dropped anchor i usually cut the deck before i play a hand of cards well sir ill warrant cromwells got the deck now for this hand at least well see what you do about him cromwell can be damned ill manage my own affairs as will we all make no mistake he took another drink aye well come out of this well be selling sugar to the dutchmen again in a years time i swear it they cant keep that fleet tied up here forever he looked at winston and when its gone youd best be on your way too sir mark it ill make note joan moved back through the room five pounds she handed briggs a small cloth bag count it if you like that makes her mine youll see the balance when shes safe in this room youve got a trade he took the bag and inventoried its contents with his thick fingers ill let this tankard serve as a handshake he drained the last of the liquor as he rose as he clapped his soaking hat back onto his head he moved next to where winston sat and you sir would be advised to rethink helping me whilst theres time that savage is apt to slit your throat for you soon enough if hes not tracked down and then burned alive like youre planning for the rest of them briggs stopped and glared thats none of your affair sir were going to start doing what we must how else are we to keep these africans docile in future somethings got to be done about these revolts he whirled abruptly and headed for the door at that moment the battered louvres swung inward and a harried figure appeared in the doorway eyes frantic disoriented a few seconds passed before anyone recognized jeremy walrond his silk doublet was wet and bedraggled his cavaliers hat waterlogged and drooping over his face before he could move briggs pistol was out and leveled at his breast not another step you whoreson bastard or ill blow you to hell his voice boomed above the sound of the storm damn me if i shouldnt kill you on sight except i wouldnt squander the powder and shot he squinted through the open doorway wheres anthony id have him come forward and meet me like a man the royalist miscreant jeremys face flooded with fear heshes been taken on board the rainbowe i swear it his voice seemed to crack by powlett by who a man named powlett the vice admiral i think hes to be the new governor well damned to them both briggs lowered the pistol guardedly then shoved it back into his belt theyre doubtless conspiring this very minute how best to squeeze every farthing of profit from our sugar trade i i dont know whats happening theyve made the windwards as much as prisoners powletts already disarmed the regiment and colonel morris is leading his infantry on the march to bridgetown right now he stepped gingerly in through the doorway i came down to try and find miss bedford at the compound they said she might be i doubt katherine has much time for you winston looked up from his chair so youd best get on back to oistins before i decide to start this little war all over again oh for gods sake let the lad be hes not even wearin a sword joan interjected then beckoned him forward dont let this blusterin lot frighten you darlin come on in and dry yourself off ive got to warn katherine he edged nervously toward joan as though for protection his voice was still quavering we didnt expect this theyd agreed to terms they said they lied winston drew out one of his pistols and laid it on the table before him and your gullible ambitious royalist of a brother believed them haply some others of us took our own precautions katherines safe so you can go on back to your roundheads and tell them theyll never find her but i meant her no harm it was to be for the best i swear it i want her to know that he settled at a table and lowered his face into his hands i never dreamed it would come to this he looked up who could have tis no matter now joan moved to him her voice kindly youre not to blame twas sir anthony that led the defection its always the old fools who cause the trouble hes the one who should have known but you dont understand what really happened i was the one who urged him to it talked him into it because admiral calvert assured me none of this would happen you planned this with calvert briggs roared with that damned roundhead you let him use you to cozen walrond and the windwards into defecting jeremy stifled a sob then turned toward joan his blue eyes pleading would you tell katherine i just wanted to stop the killing none of us ever dreamed jeremy katherine was standing in the open doorway leading to the back is it really true what you just said he stared at her in disbelief and his voice failed for a second then suddenly the words poured out katherine youve got to get away he started to rush to her but something in her eyes stopped him please listen i think powlett means to arrest you i heard him talking about it theres nothing we can do you and anthonyve got the windwards she examined him with hard scorn i fancy you can do whatever you choose doubtless hell have himself appointed governor now just as hes probably been wanting all along no he never jeremys voice seemed to crack finally he continued a man named powlett the vice admiral is going to be the new governor morris is marching here from oistins right now i only slipped away to warn you ive been warned she was turning back toward the doorway goodbye jeremy you always wanted to be somebody important here well maybe youve managed it now youve made your mark on our times you gave the americas back to england congratulations maybe cromwell will declare himself king next and then grant you a knighthood katherine i dont want it he continued miserably im so ashamed i only came to ask you to forgive me and to warn you that youve got to get away ive heard that part already she glanced back now just leave but whatll you do again he started to move toward her then drew back its none of your affair she glared at him the better question is what you and anthonyll do now after youve betrayed us all i thought you had more honor i thought anthony had more honor he stood for a moment as though not comprehending what she had said then he moved forward and confronted her how can you talk of honor in the same breath with anthony after what you did made a fool of him jeremy you have known me long enough to know i do what i please it was time anthony learned that too well he should have broken off the engagement weeks ago that much ill tell you and he would have save he thought youd come to your senses and start behaving honorably he glanced at winston i see he was wrong i did come to my senses jeremy just in time ill take hughs honor over anthonys any day she turned and disappeared through the doorway jeremy stared after her then faced winston damn you you think i dont know anything youre the i think youd best be gone winston rose slowly from his chair give my regards to sir anthony tell him i expect to see him in hell he pulled a musket ball from his pocket and tossed it to jeremy and give him that as thanks from me for turning this island and my ship over to the roundheads the next one he gets wont be handed to him the doors of the tavern bulged open and standing in the rain was an officer of the commonwealth army behind him were three helmeted infantrymen holding flintlock muskets your servant gentlemen the man glanced around the room and noticed joan and ladies youve doubtless heard your militia has agreed to lay down its arms and that includes even those whod cravenly hide in a brothel rather than serve for your own safety were here to collect all weapons till order can be restored theyll be marked and returned to you in due time he motioned the three infantrymen behind him to close ranks at the door well commence by taking down your names in the silence that followed nothing could be heard but the howl of wind and rain against the shutters dark had begun to settle outside now and the room itself was lighted only by a single flickering candle in a holder on the back wall the officer walked to where joan was seated and doffed his hat my name is colonel morris madam and you i presume are the you betrayed us jeremy was almost shouting you said we could keep our muskets that we could master walrond is that you morris turned and peered through the gloom good christ lad what are you doing here youre not supposed to leave oistins he paused and inspected jeremy i see youve not got a weapon so ill i forget i came across you but youve got to get on back over to oistins and stay with the windwards or ill not be responsible he turned to briggs and who might you be sir my name sir is benjamin briggs i am head of the council of barbados and i promise you i will protest formally to parliament over this incident youve no right to barge in here and just pass me that pistol and therell be no trouble its hotheads like you that make this necessary morris reached into briggs belt and deftly extracted the long flintlock its gilded stock glistening in the candlelight he shook the powder out of the priming pan and handed it to one of the infantrymen the name with this one is to be he glanced back briggs sir i believe you said damn you this treatment will not be countenanced i need that pistol briggs started to move forward then glanced warily at the infantrymen holding flintlock muskets we all regret its necessary just as much as you morris signaled to the three infantrymen standing behind him their helmets reflecting the dull orange of the candles while i finish here search the back room and take care theres apt to be a musket hiding behind a calico petticoat in a place like this winston settled back onto his chair i wouldnt trouble with that if i were you therere no other guns here except for mine morris glanced at him startled then he saw winstons flintlock lying on the table youre not giving the orders here whoever you are and ill kindly take that pistol id prefer to keep it so itd be well if youd just leave now before theres trouble that insubordinate remark sir has just gotten you put under arrest morris moved toward the table winston was on his feet the chair he had been sitting on tumbled across the floor i said youd best be gone before morris could respond a woman appeared at the rear doorway ill save you all a search im not afraid of cromwell and im surely not frightened of you katherine no jeremys voice was pleading and who might you be madam morris stared in surprise my name is katherine bedford sir which means i suppose that youll want to arrest me too are you the daughter of dalby bedford he was my father and the last lawfully selected governor this island is likely to know then i regret to say i do have orders to detain you there are certain charges madam of aiding him in the instigation of this rebellion that may need to be answered in london katherine jeremy looked despairingly at her i warned you is that why youre here master walrond to forewarn an accused criminal morris turned to him then i fear there may be charges against you too he glanced at briggs you can go sir but im afraid well have to hold your pistol for now and take these others into custody youre not taking miss bedford or anybody into custody winston pulled back his watersoaked jerkin to expose the pistol in his belt morris stared at him and who sir are you check your list of criminals for the name winston he stood unmoving im likely there too is that hugh winston sir morris eyes narrowed and he glanced nervously at the three men behind him holding muskets then he looked back we most certainly have orders for your arrest youve been identified as the gunnery commander for the rebels here to say nothing of charges lodged against you in england my first priority is miss bedford but ill be pleased to do double duty and arrest you as well fine now see that pistol winston thumbed toward the table look it over carefully therere two barrels both primed its part of a pair the other one is in my belt thats four pistol balls the man who moves to arrest miss bedford gets the first but if you make me start shooting im apt to forget myself and not stop till ive killed you all so why dont you leave now colonel morris and forget everything you saw here he glanced back at katherine im sure miss bedford is willing to forget she saw you shes had a trying day damn your impudence sir morris turned and gestured at the men behind him go ahead and arrest her one of the helmeted infantrymen raised his flintlock and waved katherine forward no jeremy shouted and lunged toward the soldier you cant i never meant the shot sounded like a crack of thunder in the close room black smoke poured from the barrel of the musket and jeremy froze where he stood a quizzical expression on his face he turned to look back at katherine his eyes penitent then wilted toward the floor a patch of red spreading across his chest almost simultaneous with the muskets discharge the pistol in winstons belt was already drawn and cocked it spoke once and the infantryman who had fired dropped a trickle of red down his forehead as the soldier behind him started to raise his own musket the pistol gave a small click rotating the barrel and flared again the second man staggered back against the wall while his flintlock clattered unused to the floor now the rickety table in front of winston was sailing toward the door and the pistol that had been lying on it was in his hand the table caught the third infantryman in the groin as he attempted to raise his weapon and sent him sprawling backward his musket rattled against the shutters then dropped morris looked back to see the muzzle of winstons second flintlock leveled at his temple katy lets go winston motioned her forward well probably have more company any minute now youre no better than a murderer sir morris finally recovered his voice i didnt fire the first shot but by god ill be the one who fires the last that i promise you he glanced back katy i said lets go take whatever you want but hurry hugh theyve killed jeremy she stood unmoving shock in her face he wouldnt let me handle this my way winston kept his eyes on morris but its too late now he tried to stop them he did it for me she was shaking oh jeremy why in gods name katy come on winston looked back joan get her things weve got to move out of here now joan turned and pushed her way through the cluster of irish girls standing fearfully in the rear doorway youll hang for this sir morris eyed the pistol the remaining infantryman still sat against the wall his unfired musket on the floor beside him the way youd planned to hang miss bedford no doubt he motioned toward briggs care to collect those muskets for me ill have no hand in this sir the planter did not move youve earned a noose for sure ill do it katherine stepped across jeremys body and assembled the three muskets of the infantrymen she carried them back then confronted morris you sir have helped steal the freedom of this island of the americas its impossible to tell you how much i despise you and all you stand for id kill you myself if god had given me the courage maybe hugh will do it for me ill see the both of you hanged madam or im not a christian i hope you try joan emerged through the crowd toting a large bundle she laid it on a table by the door then turned to winston heres what we got up at the compound this afternoon she surveyed the three bodies sadly master jeremy was a fine lad maybe hes finally managed to make his brother proud of him ill wager its all he ever really wanted she straightened good christ i hope they dont try and shut me down because of this it wasnt your doing winston lifted the bundle with his free hand katy can you manage those muskets id carry them through hell then lets be gone he waved the pistol at the infantryman sitting against the wall get up you and the colonel here are going to keep us company where do you think you can go briggs still had not moved theyll comb the island for you theyll look a long time before they find us on barbados he shoved the pistol against morris ribs lets be off colonel therell be my men all about morris glared youll not get far well get far enough he shifted the bundle under his arm darlin godspeed i swear ill miss you joan kissed him on the cheek then turned to katherine and mind you watch over him in that place hes headed for jamaica no he knows where i mean she looked again at winston theres no worse spot in the caribbean dont worry youll hear from me winston kissed her back then urged morris forward see that you stay alive she followed them to the door and dont try anything too foolish i always take care he turned and bussed her on the cheek one last time then they were gone chapter nineteen as winston and katherine led their prisoners slowly down the shore the defiance stood out against the dark sky illuminated by flashes of lightning as it tugged at its anchor cables the sea was up now and winston watched as her prow dipped into the trough of each swell as though offering a curtsy they had almost reached the water when he spotted john mewes waiting by the longboat ahoy capn he sang out through the gusts of rain whatre you doin impressing roundheads to sail with us now weve already got near to fifty of your damnd indentures are they on board aye them and all the rest youre the last he studied katherine and morris in confusion though id not expected youd be in such fine company then we weigh anchor in this squall mewes voice was incredulous we cant put on any canvas now itd be ripped off the yards weve got to the roundheads are already moving on bridgetown well try and use those new short sails winston urged morris forward with his pistol then turned back to mewes any sign of that african we talked about ive seen naught of him and thats a fact he peered up the beach hoping one last cursory check would suffice now that the rain had intensified it was no longer possible to see the hills beyond but i did manage to get that spaniard from ruyters the one named vargas he laughed though i finally had to convince the ol king of the butterboxes to see things our way by bringin over a few of the boys and some muskets good hes on board now safe as can be an happy enough to leave that damnd dutchman truth to tell claimed he was sick to death of the putrid smell of the zeelander now that shes been turned into a slaver then to hell with the african we cant wait any longer tis all to the good if you want my thinkin mewes reached up and adjusted morris helmet then performed a mock salute he watched in glee as the english commanders face flushed with rage youre not takin these two damnd roundheads aboard are you damn you sir morris ignored mewes as he glared at winston then looked down at the pistol he had seen a doublebarrelled mechanism like this only once beforeproperty of a spanish diplomat in london a dandy far more skilled dancing the bourree than managing a weapon but such a device in the hands of an obvious marksman like winston nothing could be more deadly theres been quite enough get in the longboat ill do no such thing morris drew back i have no intention of going with you wherever it is you think youre headed i said get in if you like it here so much you can swim back after we weigh anchor winston tossed his bundle across the gunwale seized morris by his doublet and sent him sprawling after it then he turned to the infantryman you get in as well without a word the man clambered over the side winston heaved a deep breath then took the muskets katherine was carrying and handed them to mewes katy this is the last youre apt to see of barbados for a long while please lets dont talk about it she seized her wet skirts and began to climb over the side winston steadying her with one hand i suppose i somehow thought i could have everything but i guess ive learned differently he studied her in confusion for a moment then turned and surveyed the dark shore one last time all right john prepare to cast off aye mewes loosened the bow line from its mooring and tossed it into the longboat together they shoved the bobbing craft and its passengers deeper into the surf whats your name winston motioned the infantryman forward as he lifted himself over the gunwales macewen yor worship he took off his helmet and tossed it onto the boards his hair was sandy his face scottish then take an oar macewen and heave to aye sor the scotsman ignored morris withering glare and quickly took his place you can row too colonel winston waved the pistol barbados is still a democracy for at least a few more hours morris said nothing merely grimaced and reached for an oar katherine laid her cheek against winstons shoulder and looked wistfully back toward the shore everything we made the commonwealths going to take away now everything my father and i and all the others worked so hard for together he held her against him as they moved out through the surf and across the narrow band of water to the ship in what seemed only moments the longboat edged beneath the quartergallery and the defiance was hovering above them john have the boys drop that short sail and weigh anchor as soon as were aboard this westerly off the coast should get us underway and past the blockade well just keep her close hauled till weve doubled the point then run up some more canvas itll be a miracle if we manage to take her by the point in this sea and in the dark besides mewes was poised in the bow of the longboat when we get aboard ill take the helm you just get the canvas on her aye he reached up and seized a notch beneath a gunport pulling the longboat under the deadeyes that supported the mainmast shrouds as he began mounting the rope ladder he tossed the line up through the rain winston had taken katherines arm to help her up when he heard a buzz past his ear then through the rain came a faint pop the report of a musket gods blood he turned back to look dimly through the rain he could make out a line of helmeted infantrymen along the shore muskets in hand they were disorganized without a commander but standing alongside them and yelling orders was a heavy man in a wide black hat benjamin briggs he betrayed us he brought them right down to the bay i wonder what hes figuring to get in return doubtless a place in the new government weve got to before he could finish katherine had caught his arm and was pointing over in the direction of the river mouth hugh wait do you see that theres someone out there in the surf i thought i noticed it before more damned infantry he turned to stare theyd not try swimming after us theyd wait for longboats i cant tell its over there on the left i think someones trying to wade out he squinted through the rain a figure clad in white was waist deep in the surf holding what seemed to be a large bundle thats no roundhead ill wager its likely briggs mulata though shes just a little too late ive a mind to leave her he paused to watch as a wave washed over the figure and sent it staggering backward then another bullet sang past and he heard the shouts of benjamin briggs maybe i owe a certain planter one last service capn weve got to get this tub to sea mewes was crouching behind the bulwarks of the defiance those damnd roundheads along the shore dont have many muskets yet but theyre apt to be gettin reinforcements any time now so if its all the same i dont think id encourage waitin around all night john how are the anchors ive already weighed the heavy one up by the bow he called down say the word and we can just slip the cable on that little one at the stern maybe weve got time he pushed the longboat back away from the side of the defiance as he reached for an oar morris threw down his helmet and dove into the swell in moments the commander was swimming toward shore aye hes gone yor worship hes a quick one to be sure the scottish infantryman gave only a passing glance as he threw his weight against the oar youll na be catching him on my faith and what about you with yor worships leave id as soon be stay in on with you he gave another powerful stroke with the oar whereer youre bound tis all one to me what were you before a seaman a landsman yor worship ill own it i was took in the battle of dunbar and impressed into the roundhead army made to come out here to the caribbees but ive had a bellyful of these roundheads and their stinking troop ships i swear it i kept my pigs better at home id serve you like you was the king himself if youd give me leave macewen wasnt it aye yor worship at your service then heave to winston pulled at the other oar through the dark they could just make out the bobbing form now neck deep in the surf she was supporting the black arms of yet another body senhora winston called through the rain the whiteclad figure turned and stared blankly toward them she seemed overcome with exhaustion unsure even where she was espere um momento well come to you he was shouting now in portuguese a musket ball sang off the side of the longboat as several infantrymen began advancing down the shore in their direction the scotsman hunkered beside the gunwales but did not miss a stroke of his oar as they neared the bobbing heads in the water here senhora winston reached down and grasped the arms of the body serina was holding it was atiba while katherine caught hold of her shoulders and pulled her over the gunwale macewen helped winston hoist the yoruba unconscious onto the planking he was still bleeding his breath faint he is almost dead senhor and they have killed derin serina was half choked from the surf at first i was afraid to try bringing him but then i thought of what would happen if they took him and i knew i had she began mumbling incoherently as she bent over the slumped form of atiba her mouth against his as though to urge breath back into him katy the minute were on board take them straight down to the cabin and see if you can get a little brandy into him maybe itll do some good ill try but i fear its too late already lets just get underway she turned to look at the deck of the defiance where a line of seamen had appeared with muskets the firing from the shore slowed now as the infantry melted back into the rain to avoid the barrage from the ship by the time their longboat was hoisted up over the side and lashed midships morris had retreated to safety with his men while mewes ordered the remaining anchor cable slipped and the mainsail dropped katherine ushered serina through the companionway to the great cabin followed by seamen carrying atiba then the mast groaned against the wind a seaman on the quarterdeck unlashed the helm and in moments they had begun to pull away that was easy mewes spat in the general direction of the scuppers then hoisted up his belt as he watched the rainswept shore begin to recede could be morris is just saving us for the frigates winston was studying the bobbing mast lights off their portside bow he probably figures they heard the gunfire and will realize somethings afoot theyve got their share of ordnance that much ill warrant theres at least one twodecker still on station out there the gloucester i sailed on her once back when i first got impressed by the damnd navy twentyodd years back shes seen her years at sea but shes got plenty of cannon between decks for all that i think youd better have the portside guns primed and ready to run out just in case but i figure once we get past the point well be clear after that we can steer north and ride this coastal westerly right up to speightstown maybe heaveto there till the storm eases he turned and headed down the deck im going aft to take the whipstaff get the yardmen aloft and damn the weather i want the maintop and all braces manned aye you never know mewes yelled the gunnery orders through the open hatch then marched down the deck giving assignments katherine was standing at the head of the companionway leading to the great cabin as winston passed on his way to the quarterdeck ive put the african in your cabin along with the mulatto woman she caught his arm as he headed up the steps shes delirious and i think hes all but dead hes got a bad musket wound in his shoulder even if he dies now itll be better than what briggs and the planters had planned he looked at her face and pushed aside a sudden desire to take her into his arms just to know she was his at last but see if you can clean his wound with brandy id hate to lose him now after all the trouble we went to bringing him aboard why did you do it hugh after all he tried to kill you once on this very deck i was here remember who understands why we do anything maybe i like his brass maybe i dont even know the reason anymore he turned and headed up the steps serina lifted his cheek against her own the salt from her tears mingling with the sea water in his hair the wound in his shoulder was open now sending a trickle of blood glistening across his chest his breathing was in spasms shango can you still hear me try washing his wound with this katherine was standing above her in the dim light of the candlelantern holding a gray onionflask of brandy why are you helping me senhora serina looked up her words a blend of english and portuguese you care nothing for him or for me i i want to katherine awkwardly pulled the cork from the bottle and the fiery fumes of the brandy enveloped them because the senhor told you to do it that is the real reason she finally reached and took the bottle he is a good man he risked his life for us he did not need to no other branco on this island would have then you can repay him by doing what he asked he said to clean the wound serina settled the bottle onto the decking beside the sleeping bunk then bent over and kissed the clan marks on atibas dark cheek as she did the ship rolled awkwardly and a high wave dashed against the quartergallery quickly she seized the neck of the flask and secured it till they had righted i think we will have to do it together together never fear senhora atibas black skin will not smudge your white ingles hands i never thought it would katherine impulsively reached down and ripped off a portion of her skirt then she grabbed the flask and pulled back his arm while serina held his shoulder forward she doused the wound with a stream of the brown liquor then began to swab away the encrusted blood with the cloth his skin felt like soft leather supple to the touch with hard ripples of muscles beneath the sting of the brandy brought an involuntary jerk atibas eyes opened and he peered startled through the gloom dont try to move quickly serina bent over him whispering softly into his ear you are safe you are on the brancos ship he started to speak but at that moment another wave crashed against the stern and the ship lurched sideways atibas eyes flooded with alarm and his lips formed a word dara serina laid her face next to his dont talk please just rest now she tried to give him a drink of the brandy but his eyes refused it then more words came faint and lost in the roar of the wind and the groaning of the ancient boards of the defiance finally his breath seemed to dissolve as unconsciousness again drifted over him katherine watched as serina gently laid his head against the cushion on the bunk then fell to her knees and began to pray mumbling foreign words not portuguese she found herself growing more and more uneasy something about the two of them was troubling almost unnatural finally she rose and moved to watch the sea through the stern windows though the waves outside slammed ever more menacingly against the quartergallery as the storm was worsening noticeably she still longed for the wind in her face again she recalled her first night here with hugh when they had looked out through this very window together in each others arms what would it be like to watch the sea from this gallery now she wondered when the ocean and winds were wild she sighed and pulled open the latch what she saw took her breath away off the portside bearing down on them was the outline of a tallmasted english warship with two gun decks before she could move there were shouts from the quarterdeck above then the trampling of feet down the companionway leading to the waist of the ship hed seen it too and ordered his gun crews to station she pulled back from the window as a wave splashed across her face and a chill swept the room numbing her fingers she fumbled a moment trying to secure the latch then gave up and turned to head for the door if were all to die she told herself i want to be up with hugh on the quarterdeck oh god why now after all weve been through as she passed the lantern she noticed serina still bent over the african still mumbling the strange words do you know whats about to happen to us all the frustration was more than she could contain come back over here and take a look when the mulatto merely stared at her with a distant glazed expression she strode to where she knelt and took her arm pulling her erect while she was leading her toward the open window she heard a deep groaning rise up through the timbers of the frigate and knew the cannon were being run out winston had ordered a desperate gamble a possible ordnance duel with a warship twice the burden of the defiance moving the guns now when the seas were high only compounded their danger if one broke loose from its tackles it could hurtle through the side of the ship opening a gash that would surely take enough water to sink them in minutes do you see senhora she directed serinas gaze out the open windows if you want to pray then pray that that manofwar doesnt catch us your african may soon be dead anyway along with you and me too what will they do the mulatto studied the approaching warship her eyes only half seeing i expect theyll pull alongside us if they can then run out their guns and she felt her voice begin to quiver then i will pray please do that she whirled in exasperation and quickly shoved her way out the door and into the companionway as she mounted the slippery ladder to the quarterdeck she felt john mewes brush past in the rain bellowing orders aloft she looked up to see men perched along the yards clinging to thin ropes in the blowing rain as they loosened the topgallants the defiance was putting on every inch of canvas in weather where any knowing seaman would strike sail and heaveto good god katy i wish youd go back below decks the gloucester must have spied our sail when we doubled the point winstons voice sounded through the rain he was steering the ship all alone now his shoulder against the whipstaff off the portside the english warship a gray hulk with towering masts was rapidly narrowing the distance between them hugh i want to be up here with you she grabbed onto a shroud to keep her balance theyre planning to try and sink us arent they unless we heaveto which i have no intention of doing so theyll have to do just that if they expect to stop us and id say they have every intention of making the effort look he pointed through the rain now the line of gunport covers along the upper gun deck were being raised theyre making ready to start running out their eighteenpounders what can we do first put on all the canvas weve got then get our own guns in order if we cant outrun them well have to fight do you think we have a chance she studied the ship more closely it seemed to have twice the sail of the defiance but then it was heavier and bulkier except for the rainbowe cromwell had not sent his best warships to the americas this one could be as old as hughs ive outrun a few menofwar before but not in weather like this then i want to stay up here and that mulatto woman you took on board frightens me almost as much as this then stay for now but if they get us in range i want you below he glanced aloft where men clinging to the swaying yards had just secured the main topsls as the storm worsened more lightning flashed in the west bringing prayers and curses from the seamen the weathers about as bad as it could be ive never had the defiance under full sail when its been like this i never want to again after the topgallants were unfurled and secured they seemed to start picking up momentum the gloucester was still off their portside but far enough astern that she could not use her guns and she was no longer gaining maybe we can still outrun them she moved alongside winston theres a fair chance he was holding the whipstaff on a steady course but theyve not got all their canvas on yet they know its risky he turned to study the warship and she saw the glimmer of hope in his eyes but he quickly masked it in good weather they could manage it but with a storm like this maybe not he paused as the lightning flared again still if they decide to chance the rest of their sail she settled herself against the binnacle to watch the gloucester then she noticed the warships topsls being unfurled winston saw it too the next lightning flash revealed that the gloucester had now begun to run out her upper row of guns as the distance between them slowly began to narrow once more looks as if theyre going to gamble whats left of their running rigging katy i think youd best be below no i winston turned and yelled toward the main deck john pass the order if they pull in range tell canninge to just fire at will whenever the portside guns bear same as when that revenue frigate royale once tried to board us maybe he can cripple their gun deck long enough to try and lose them in the dark aye a muted cry drifted back through the howl of rain hugh i love you she touched the sleeve of his jerkin i think i even know what it means now he looked at her her hair tangled in the rain katy i love you enough to want you below besides its not quite time to say our farewells yet i know whats next theyll pull to windward of us and just fire away theyll shoot away our rigging till were helpless and then theyll hole us till we take on enough water to go down its not going to be that easy dont forget weve got some ordnance of our own just pray they cant set theirs in this sea lightning flashed once more glistening off the row of cannon on the english warship they had range now and katherine could see the glimmer of lighted linstocks through the open gunports gracious lord for what we are about to receive make us truly thankful john mewes was mounting the quarterdeck to watch this looks to be it capn just keep on praying john and get back down on deck i want every inch of sail on those yards aye id like the same save i dont know where exactly weve got any more to put on unless i next hoist my own linen he crossed himself then headed down the companion way suddenly a gun on the gloucester flared sending an eighteenpound round shot through the upper sails of the defiance inches from the maintop then again and this time the edge of the focsle ripped away spraying splinters across the deck john tell canninge hed better start firing the second his guns bear and hed best be damned quick on it too even as he spoke a roar sounded from below and the deck tilted momentarily sideways katherine watched as a line of shot splintered into the planking along the side of the gloucester between her gun decks damn he came close winston studied the damage but not close enough again the lightning flashed nearer now a wide network across the heavens and she saw the gloucesters captain standing on his own quarterdeck nervously staring aloft at the storm katy please go below this is going to get very bad if they catch this deck therell be splinters everywhere not to mention the gloucesters guns flamed again she felt the deck tremble as an eighteenpound shot slammed into the side of the defiance up near the bow john lets have some more of those prayers winston yelled down again and while youre at it tell canninge to give them another round the second hes swabbed out hes got to hurt that upper gun deck soon or were apt to be in for a long night hugh cant we she stopped as she saw a figure in a bloodstained white shift slowly moving up the companionway good christ he had seen it too katy try and keep her the hell off the quarterdeck and out of the way while he threw his shoulder against the whipstaff and began shouting more orders to mewes on the main deck serina mounted the last step she moved across the planking toward them her eyes glazed even more than before come below senhora katherine reached out for her you could be hurt the mulatas hand shot up and seized her arm with an iron grip katherine felt her feet give way and the next thing she knew she had been flung sideways against the hard rope shrouds e pada nibi the voice was deep chilling then she turned and advanced menacingly on winston god damn you he shoved her back then reached to help katherine katy are you all right just watch out for her i wager shes gone mad after all thats happened if we get time ill have some of the boys come and take her below again the gloucesters guns flared and a whistle sang across the quarterdeck as the shot clipped the railing next to where they were standing serina stared wildly at the shattered rail then at the english manofwar her eyes seemed vacant as though looking through all she saw good christ katy take a look at those skies winston felt a chill in his bowels as the lightning blossomed again the wind is changing i can feel it somethings happening if we lose a yard or tear a sail theyll take us in a minute all it needs is one quick shift too much strain as if in response to his words the hull shuddered then pitched backward and katherine heard a dull crack from somewhere in the rigging christ winston was staring aloft his face washed in the rain she followed his gaze the mainmast had split just below the maintop the topsail had fallen forward into the foremast and had ripped through the foresail a startled maintopman was dangling helplessly from the side of his round perch then something else cracked and he tumbled toward the deck landing in the middle of a crowd of terrified seamen huddled by the focsle door i knew we couldnt bear full sail in this weather weve just lost a good half of our canvas he looked back youve got to go below now please and see if you can somehow take that woman with you were in very bad trouble if i was a religious man id be on my knees praying right now the gloucesters guns spoke once more and a shot clipped the quartergallery only feet below where they were showering splinters upward through the air atiba serina was staring down over the railing toward the hole that had been ripped in the corner of the great cabin beneath them then she looked out at the warship and the hard voice rose again iwo ko lu oniran li oru o nlu u li ossan finally her eyes flared and she shouted through the storm shango oyinbo io je once more the lightning came later he wondered if he might have been praying after all he remembered how the fork of fire slid down the mainmast of the gloucester then seemed to envelop the maintop sending smoke billowing through the topsls above next it coiled about the mainmast shrouds in moments her main topsl was aflame as though shed been caught with firearrows soon a tongue of the blaze flicked downward and ignited her main course after that the shrouds began to smolder almost immediately her seamen began furling the other sails and all open gunports were quickly slammed down to stop any shreds of burning canvas from accidentally reaching the gun deck next the helmsman threw his weight against the whipstaff to try and take her off the wind she was still underway like a crippled fireship bearing down on them and for a moment winston thought they were in even greater danger than before but then the gloucesters mainmast slowly toppled forward as the shrouds gave way tearing into the other rigging and she heeled it was impossible to see what followed because of the rain but moments later burning spars were drifting across the waves it was the hand of providence as im a christian john mewes was mounting the quarterdeck solemn and subdued a crowd of stunned seamen were following him to gain a better view astern the roundhead whoresons were tempting fate they shouldve known better than puttin to sea with topmasts like those in this damnd weather heaven knows i could have told them there was a murmur of assent from the others they stood praising the beneficence of god and watched as the last burning mast disappeared into the rain after winston had lashed the whipstaff in place and ordered the sails shortened he collapsed against the binnacle it was a miracle hugh katherine wrapped an arm about him her bodice was soaked with rain and sweat i think i was praying when id all but forgotten how ive heard of it happening god knows but ive never before seen it just think if wed had taller masts we could well have caught it ourselves now the mood was lightening as congratulations began to pass among the men it was only then katherine noticed the white shift at their feet the mulatto was crumpled beside the binnacle still as death john have somebody come and take that woman below winston glanced down she looks to have fainted aye i was near to faintin myself truth to tell finally winston pulled himself up and surveyed the seamen i say well done masters one and all so lets all have a word of thanks to the almighty and see if we can locate a keg of brandy this crew has earned it katherine leaned against him as she watched the cheering men head for the main deck where can we go now hugh therell soon be a price on our heads in every english settlement from virginia to bermuda from the shape of our rigging id guess were going nowhere for a day or so weve got to heaveto till the weather lets up and try to mend those sails after that i figure wed best steer north hope to beat the fleet up to nevis where we can careen and maybe lay in some more victuals and then are you really going to try your scheme about jamaica with just the men youve got here not just yet youre right about the men we dont have enough now he lowered his voice so im thinking well have to make another stop first where theres only one place i know of where we can still find what well be needing he slipped his arm about her waist a little island off the north coast of hispaniola you dont mean tortuga the cowkillers now katy theres no better time than now to start learning what theyre called over there on that side of the caribbean i know the englishmen here in the caribbees call them the cowkillers but over there we were always known by our french name whats that sort of an odd one you see since we cured our meat indianstyle on those greenwood grills they called boucans most seamen over there knew us as the boucaniers and thats the name we kept when we started sailing against the spaniards you mean thats right try and remember it buccaneer book three tortuga jamaica chapter twenty the sun emerged from the distant edge of the sea burning through the fine mist that hung on the horizon katherine was standing on the high quartergallery by the railing at the stern the better to savor the easterly breeze that tousled her hair and fluttered the cotton sleeves of her seamans shirt the quiet of the ship was all but complete with only the rhythmic splash of waves against the bow and the occasional groan from the masts she loved being on deck to watch the dawn out of the sweltering gloom of the great cabin this morning when the first light of day brightened the stern windows shed crept silently from their narrow bunk leaving hugh snoring contentedly shed made her way up to the quarterdeck where john mewes dozed beside the steering house where he was to monitor the weathered grey whipstaff lashed secure on a course due west now she gazed out over the swells past the occasional white caps that dotted the blue and tasted the cool moist air during the voyage she had learned how to read the cast of the sea the sometimes fickle caribbean winds the hidden portent in the color of clouds and sun shed even begun practicing how to take latitude with the quadrant suddenly a porpoise surfaced along the stern then another and together they began to pirouette in the wake of the ship like spirited colts was there any place else in the world she wondered quite like the caribbean she never tired of watching for the schools of flying fish that would burst from the seas surface like flushed grouse seemingly in chase of the great barracuda that sometimes flashed past the bow and near the smaller islands where shallow reefs turned the coastal waters azure she had seen giant sea turtles green leatherbacks and rustybrown loggerheads big as tubs and floating languorously on the surface the wildness of the islands and sea had begun to purge her mind her memory fresh mornings like this had come to seem harbingers of a new life as well as a new day even as the quick goldenhued sunsets promised hughs warm embrace after barbados theyd made sail for nevis island and as they neared the small logandclapboard english settlement along its southern shore the skies had finally become crystalline and dry heralding the end of the autumn rainy season they lingered in the islands reefbound harbor almost three weeks while winston careened the defiance and stripped away her barnacles scorched the lower planks with burning branches to kill shipworm then caulked all her leaky seams with hemp and pitch finally hed laded in extra barrels of salt beef biscuit and fresh water they were all but ready to weigh anchor the day a dutch merchantman put in with word that the commonwealth fleet had begun preparations to depart barbados why so soon they puzzled where were cromwells warships bound for now wherever the fleets next destination it scarcely mattered the american rebellion was finished after word spread through nevis and st christopher that barbados had capitulated all the planters talk of defiance evaporated if the largest english settlement in the americas could not stand firm they reasoned what chance did the small ones have a letter pledging fealty to commons was dispatched to the fleet by the assembly of those two sister islands that step taken they hoped calvert would bypass them with his hungry army and sail directly for virginia whose blustering royalists everyone now expected to also yield without a murmur still after news came that the troops were readying to move out katherine had agreed with winston that they shouldnt chance being surprised at nevis who could tell when the commonwealths warships might suddenly show themselves on the southern horizon the next morning they weighed anchor heading north for the first two hundred leagues then steering due west that had been six days ago youre lookin lovely this morning mlady john mewes groggy voice broke the silence as he started awake then rose and stretched and ambled across the quarterdeck toward the bannister where she stood id say there she is sure as im a christian he was pointing south in the direction of the dim horizon where a greygreen land mass had emerged above the dark waters the pride of the spaniards what is it john why thats apt to be none other than hispaniola yor ladyship plain as a pikestaff an right on schedule he bellied against the bannister and yawned doesnt look to have budged an inch since last i set eyes on her she smiled then that must mean were nearing tortuga by the map i remember its just off the north coast around latitude twenty aye well likely be raisin the old turtle any time now though in truth id as soon neer see the place again why do you say that tis home and hearth of the finest assembly of thieves as youre eer like to cross this side of newgate prison an thats the fact of the matter are you trying to make me believe youve actually been there john she regarded him carefully john mewes she had come to realize was never at a loss for a story to sharethough his distinction between truth and fancy was often imprecise ayetwas some years past as the sayin goes when the merchantman i was quartermaster on put in for a week to careen he spat into the sea and hitched up the belt on his breeches what exactly was it like a brig out of portsmouth a beamy two master with damnd seams thatd opened on us wide as a dutch whores cunny beggin yor ladyships pardonwhich is why we had to put in to caulk her tortuga john aye the turtle like i was sayin shes the sodom of the indies make no mistake fair enough from afar i grant you but try and put in an youll find out soon enough shes natural home for the rogue whod as soon do without uninvited company thats why that nest of pirates has been there so long right under the very nose of the poxrotted spaniards mind you shes scarcely more than twenty or thirty miles tip to tip but the north sides a solid cliff lookin down on the breakers whilst the others just about nothing save shallow flats an mangrove thickets theres only one bay where you can put in with a frigate a spot called basse terre there on the souththat is if you can steer through the reefs that line both sides of the channel goin into it but once youre anchoredtis a passing good harbor for it all fine sandy bottom with draft thatll take a seventygun brig so thats how the cowkillers the buccaneers have managed to keep the island theres only one spot the spaniards could try and land infantry and to get there youve got to go through a narrow passage in the reefs easy to cover with cannon id say thats about the size of it no bottom drops anchor at tortuga unless those rogues say you aye he turned and began to secure a loose piece of line dangling from the shroud supporting the mizzenmast then too theres your matter of location you see mlady the island lays right athwart the windward passage betwixt hispaniola and cuba which is one of the spaniards main shippin lanes couldnt be handier if youre thinkin to lighten a papist merchantman now and again mewes voice trailed off as he glanced up to see winston emerge at the head of the companionway half asleep and still shirtless under his jerkin following after him was atiba wearing a pair of illfitting seamans breeches his bare shoulders glistening in the suns early glow when he spotted mewes he gave a solemn bow yoruba style ku abo senhor aye qu ava it is mewes nodded back then turned to katherine now for your edification that means greetings or such like since ive been teachin him english ive been pickin up a few of the finer points of that african gabble of his what with my natural gift for language gods life you are learning fastly senhor mewes atiba smiled and since you are scholaring my tongue so well mayhaps i should cut some of our clan marks on your mug like mine it is a damnable great ceremony of my country pox on your damnable great ceremonies mewes busied himself with the shroud ill just keep my fine face the way it is and thank you kindly all the same winston sleepily kissed katherine on the forehead she gave him a long hug then pointed toward the south john claims thats hispaniola one and the same the queen of the greater antilles take a good look katy i used to hunt cattle in those very woods that mountain range over in midisland means we should raise tortuga any time now he turned and began unlashing the whipstaff then motioned atiba forward want to try the helm for a while to get the feel of her my damnable shoulder is good senhor i can set a course with this stick or cut by a sword as better than ever well see soon enough he watched atiba grasp the long hardwood lever and test it i just may need you along to help me reason with my old friend jacques hugh tell me some more about what hes like katherine took another look at the hazy outline of hispaniola then moved alongside them jacques le basque winston smiled and thought back nobody knew where jacques was from or who he was they were all refugees from some other place and most went by assumed nameseven he had been known simply as anglais id guess hes french but i never really knew all that much about him though we hunted side by side for a good five years he thumbed toward the green mountains but i can tell you one thing for sure jacques le basque created a new society on northern hispaniola and tortuga what do you mean katy you talked about having an independent nation in the americas a place not under the thumb of europe well he made one right over there we boucaniers were a nation of sortsshipwrecked seamen runaway indentures half of them with jail or a noose waiting in one of the other settlements but any man alive was welcome to come and go as he liked katherine examined his lined face hugh you told me you once tried to kill jacques over some misunderstanding but you never explained exactly what it was about winston fell silent and the only sound was the lap of waves against the bow maybe he told himself the time has come he took a deep breath and turned to her remember how i told you the spaniards came and burned out the providence companys english settlement on tortuga as it happened i was over on hispaniola with jacques at the time or i probably wouldnt be here now well the spaniards stayed around for a week or so and troubled to hang some of jacquess lads who happened in with a load of hides when we found out about it he called a big parlay over what we ought to do all the hunters camefrench english even some dutchmen every man there hated the spaniards and we decided to pull together what cannon were left and fortify the harbor at basse terre in case they got a mind to come back and then after some time went by jacques got the idea we ought not just wait for them that wed best try and take the fight back so he sent word around the north side of hispaniola that any man who wanted to help should meet him on tortuga when everybody got there he announced we needed to be organized like the spaniards then he stove open a keg of brandy and christened us les freres de la cote the brotherhood of the coast after wed all had a tankard or two he explained he wanted to try and take a spanish ship you mean he sort of declared war on spain as a matter of fact thats how it turned out he smiled jacques said wed hunted the spaniards cattle long enough now we would hunt the whoreson spaniards themselves wed sail under our old name of boucanier and he swore that before we were through nobody would remember the time it only meant cow hunters wed make it the most dreaded word a spaniard could hear john mewes was squinting toward the west now past the bowsprit abruptly he secured a last knot in the shroud then headed down the companionway and past the seamen loitering by the mainmast and that was the beginning when the cowkillers became sea rovers and pirates for some reason the story made her vaguely uneasy you were actually there a part of it i was there winston paused to watch mewes so then you joined them no particular reason not to the damned spaniards had just murdered some of ours katy not to mention about six hundred english settlers i figured why not give them a taste back besides it looked to be the start of a grand adventure we got together as many arms as we could muster muskets and axes and put to sea us against the spaniards capn care to come forward an have a look mewes was pointing at the dark green hump that had just appeared on the horizon that looks to be her if im not amiss winston turned to study the sea ahead of them just above the surface of the sea was the tip of a large hump deep green like a leatherback turtle aye maybe youd best order all hands to station for the afternoon watch john he reached back and kissed katherine lightly katy the rest of this little tale will have to wait weve got to get ready now in truth i dont exactly know how pleased my old friend jacques is going to be seeing me again after all these years as she watched him head down the companionway she felt a curious mixture of excitement and unease now all at once she was wondering if she really did want to know what hugh had been like back then perhaps she told herself there are some things better just forgotten bon soir capitaine a young man carrying a candlelantern was standing at the waters edge to greet their longboat as winston john mewes and atiba backed by five seamen with flintlocks rowed in to the shallows tibaut de fontenay a votre service messieurs we spotted your mast lights from up at the forte since you seemed to know the reefs we assumed you had been here before so you are welcome he appeared to be in his early twenties and was attired lavishlya plumed hat topped his long curls his long velvet waistcoat was parted rakishly to display an immaculate white cravat and high glistening boots shaped his calves the dull glow of the lantern illuminated an almost obsequious grin around them the dark outlines of a dozen frigates nodded in the light swell while lines of foam sparkling in the moonlight chased up the shore the defiance had been the last vessel to navigate basse terres narrow channel of reefs before the quick caribbean dusk descended the name is winston master of the defiance he slid over the gunwale of the longboat and waded through the light surf late of barbados and nevis bienvenue the man examined him briefly then smiled again as he extended his hand and quickly shifted to heavily accented english your affairs capitaine are of course no concern to us here any man who comes in peace is welcome at la tortue in the name of his majesty king louis quatorze of france what the devil winston drew back his hand and stared up at the lanternlit assemblage of taverns along the shore tortuga is french now mais oui for the better part of a year the gouverneur of st christophethe french sidefound it necessary to dispatch armed frigates and take this island under his authority the anglais engages planting here were sent on their way they are fortunate we did not do worse but ships of all nations are always invited to trade for our fine hides brasil wood for making dye and the most succulent viande fumee you will taste this side of paris he bowed lightly debonairly or londres we also have a wide assortment of items in spanish gold for sale hereand we have just received a shipload of lovely mademoiselles from marseilles to replace the diseased english whores who had come near to ruining this ports reputation we dont need any provisions and we dont have time for any entertainment this stop the defiance is just passing through bound for the windward passage id thought to put in for tonight and have a brandy with an old friend jacques le basque know if hes around my master the man quickly raised his lantern to scrutinize winstons face he does not normally receive visitors at the forte but you may send him your regards through me i will be happy to tell him a capitaine winston what in hell are you talking about what fort is that forte de la roche the fort on the rock up there he turned to point through the dark on a hill overlooking the harbor a row of torches blazed illuminating a battery of eighteen pound culverin set above a high stone breastwork when was that built it wasnt here before only last year capitaine part of our new fortifications it is the residence of our commandant de place your commandant winston stopped dead still youve got a governor here now oui he smiled in fact you are fortunate he is none other than your friend jacques he was appointed to the post last year by the chevalier de poncy of st christophe administrator of all our french settlements in the caribbean he examined the men in the longboat his glance anxiously lingering on atiba who had a shiny new cutlass secured at his waist may i take it you knew jacques well i knew him well enough in the old days back before he arranged to have himself appointed governor but then i see times have changed many things have changed here capitaine ill say they have winston signaled for atiba to climb out of the longboat but my friend and i are going up to this forte and pay a visit to commandant le basque and you can save your messages and diplomatic papers he knows who i am de fontenay stiffened not quite sure how to reply as he did a band of seamen emerged out of the dark and came jostling down the sandy shore toward them carrying candlelanterns and tankards and singing an english chantey with convivial relish we took aboard the captains daughter and gave her fire twixt wind and water several were in pairs their arms about each others shoulders all were garbed in a flamboyant hodgepodge of european fashionsgold rings and medallions stolen from the passengers of spanish merchant frigates glistened in the lantern light most wore fine leather sea boots a few were barefoot the man at their head was carrying a large keg when he spotted the bobbing longboat he motioned the procession to a halt tossed the keg onto the sand and sang out an invitation welcome to you masters theres a virgin pipe of spanish brandy here were expectin to violate wed not take it amiss if youd help us to our work he drew a pistol from his belt and swung its goldtrimmed butt against the wooden stopper in the bunghole knocking it inward no monsieur merci bien des remerciements de fonte nays voice betrayed a faint quaver i regret we have no time i and my good friend the anglais here i wasnt asking you to drink you arsesucking french pimp the man with the pistol scowled as he recognized de fontenay id not spare you the sweat off my bollocks if you were adyin of thirst he turned toward winston but you and your lads are welcome sir whoever you might be ill wager no honest englishman ever declined a cup in good company my name is guy bartholomew and if you know anything of this place youll not have to be told im master of the swiftsure the finest brig in this port winston examined him in the flickering light yes it was guy bartholomew all right hed been one of the original boucaniers and hed hated jacques from the first permit me to introduce capitaine winston of the defiance messieurs de fontenay tried to ignore bartholomews pistol he has asked me personally to winston the defiance gods wounds bartholomew doffed his black hat let me drink to your good health captain he paused to fill his tankard with the dark brown liquid spilling from the keg then hoisted it in an impromptu toast you dont remember me from before bartholomew back on hispaniola the boucanier stared at him drunkenly no sir i cant rightly say as i do but yours is a name known well enough in this part of the world thats for certain you wouldnt be planning to do a bit of sailing from this port would you now twould be a pleasure to have you amongst us monsieur de fontenay was edging on up the hill capitaine winston is a personal friend of our commandant and we must a friend of jacques bartholomew studied winstons face id not believe any such damnd lies and calumnies of an honest englishman like you sir i knew him many years past bartholomew i hope he remembers me better than you do though im not sure he still considers me a friend after our little falling out well sir i can tell you this much things have changed mightily since the old days back then he only stole from the poxeaten spaniards now he and that french bastard de poncy rob us all they take a piece of all the spaniards booty we bring in and then jacques demands another ten percent for himself as his landing fee he even levies a duty on all the hides the hunters bring over from hispaniola to sell de fontenay glared there must always be taxes anywhere jacques is commandant now and the chevalier de poncy has commandant bartholomew snorted my lads have another name for him sir if he ever dared come down here and meet us the englishmen in this port would draw lots to see who got the pleasure of cutting his throat he knows we cant sail from any other settlement its only because hes got those guns up there at the fort covering the bay and all his damned guards that hes not been done away with long before now he turned back to winston the bastards made himself a dungeon up there beneath the rock that he calls purgatory go against him and thats where you end up few men have walked out of it alive ill tell you that de fontenay shifted uneasily and toyed with a curl purgatory will not be there forever i promise you so you say but you may just wind up there yourself one day soon sir and then well likely hear you piping a different tune even though you are his matelot which ill warrant might more properly be called his whore what i am to jacques is no affair of yours aye i suppose the goingson in the fort are not meant to be known to the honest ships masters in this port but we still have eyes sir for all that i know youre hoping that after jacques is gone that frenchman de poncy will make you commandant of this place this stinking pisshole just because the code of the boucaniers makes you jacques heir but itll not happen sir by my life never monsieur enough suffit de fontenay spat out the words then turned back to winston shall we proceed up to the forte he gestured toward the hill ahead or do you intend to stay and spend the night talking with these anglais cochons my friend do beware of that old bastard bartholomew caught winstons arm and his voice grew cautionary god almighty i could tell you such tales hes daft as a loon these days id be gone from this place in a minute if i could just figure how he tried to kill me once master bartholomew in a little episode you might recall if you set your mind to it but im still around winston nodded farewell then turned back toward the longboat john mewes sat nervously waiting a flintlock across his lap john take her on back and wait for us atibas coming with me and no shore leave for anybody till morning aye mewes eyed the drunken seamen as he shoved off see you mind yourself capn ill expect you back by sunrise or im sendin the lads to get you till then winston gestured atiba to move alongside him then turned back to de fontenay shall we go avec plaisir capitaine these anglais who sail for us can be most dangereux when they have had so much brandy the young frenchman paused as he glanced uncertainly at atiba the tall african towered by winstons side will your gentilhomme de service be accompanying you hes with me bon he cleared his throat as you wish he lifted his lantern and leaving bartholomews men singing on the shore headed up the muddy torchlit roadway leading between the cluster of taverns that comprised the heart of basse terres commercial center how long has it been since you last visited us capitaine de fontenay glanced back i have been matelot to jacques for almost three years but i dont recall the pleasure of welcoming you before this evening its been a few years back before jacques became governor was this your home once senhor atiba was examining the shopfronts along the street many displaying piles of silks and jewelry once belonging to the passengers on spanish merchantmen along either side patchedtogether taverns and brothels spilled their cacophony of songs curses and raucous fiddle music into the muddy paths that were streets winston laughed well it was scarcely like this there used to be thatched huts along here and piles of hides and smoked beef ready for barter all you could find to drink in those days was a tankard of cheap killdevil but the main difference is the fort up there which is a noticeable improvement over that rusty set of culverin we used to have down along the shore i gather it must have been a very long time ago monsieur that you were last here de fontenay was moving hurriedly past the rickety taverns heading straight for the palmlined road leading up the hill to the fort probably some ten years or so then i wonder if jacques will still remember you winston laughed i expect he does de fontenay started purposefully up the road about six hundred yards from the shoreline the steep slope of a hill began the climb was long and tortuous and the young frenchman was breathing heavily by the time they were halfway up this place is damnable strong senhor very hard to attack even with guns atiba shifted the cutlass in his belt and peered up the hill toward the line of torches he was moving easily his bare feet molding to the rough rock steps it could never be stormed from down below that much is sure winston glanced back but were not here to try and take this place he can keep tortuga and bleed it dry for all i care ill just settle for some of those men i saw tonight if they want to part company with him those whoresons are not lads who fight atiba commented they are drunkards they can fight as well as they drink winston smiled dont let the brandy fool you your brancos are a damnable curiosity senhor he grunted i am waiting to see how my peoples here live the slaves the boucaniers dont cut cane so they dont have slaves then mayhaps i will drink with them youd best hold that till after were finished with jacques my friend winston glanced up toward the fort just keep i your cutlass handy they had reached the curving row of steps that led through the arched gateway of the fortress above them a steep wall of cut stone rose up against the dark sky and across the top illuminated by torches was the row of culverin sentries armed with flintlocks in helmets and flamboyant spanish coats barred the gateway till de fontenay waved them aside then guards inside unbolted the iron gate and they moved up the final stairway winston realized the fort had been built on a natural plateau with terraces inside the walls which would permit several hundred musketmen to fire unseen down on the settlement below from somewhere in the back he could hear the gurgle of a springmeaning a supply of fresh water one of the first requirements of a good fortress jacques had found a natural redoubt and fortified it brilliantly all the settlement and the harbor now were under his guns only the mountain behind a steep precipice had any vantage over forte de la roche senhor what is that atiba was pointing toward the massive boulder some fifty feet wide and thirty feet high that rested in the center of the yard as though dropped there by the hand of god winston studied it puzzling then noticed a platform atop the rock with several cannon projecting out a row of brick steps led halfway up the side then ended abruptly when they reached the base de fontenay turned back the citadel above us is jacquess personal residence what he likes to call his dovecote it will be necessary for you to wait here while i ask him to lower the ladder the ladder mais oui a security measure no one is allowed up there without his consent he called up identified himself and after a pause the first rungs of a heavy iron ladder appeared through an opening in the platform slowly it began to be lowered toward the last step at the top of the stair again de fontenay hesitated perhaps it might be best if i go first messieurs jacques is not fond of surprises he never was winston motioned for atiba to stay close de fontenay hung his lantern on a brass spike at the side of the stairs then turned and lightly ascended the rungs from the platform above two musketmen covered his approach with flintlocks he saluted them then disappeared as winston waited atiba at his side he heard a faint human voice a low moaning sound coming from somewhere near their feet he looked down and noticed a doorway at the base of the rock leading into what appeared to be an excavated chamber the door was of thick hewn logs with only a small grate in its center was that he wondered the dungeon bartholomew called purgatory suddenly he felt an overwhelming sense of anger and betrayal at what jacques had become whatever else he might have been this was the man whose name once stood for freedom and now he was turning to head down and inspect purgatory firsthand when a welcome sounded from the platform above mon ami bienvenue anglais mon dieu il y a tres long temps a good ten years n estce pas a bearded face peered down while a deep voice roared with pleasure perhaps youve finally learned something about how to shoot after all this time come up and let me have a look at you and maybe youve improved your aim jacques your last pistol ball didnt get you a hide winston turned back and reached for the ladder oui truly it did not anglais how near did i come he extended a rough hand as winston emerged close enough winston stepped onto the platform of the citadel in the flickering torchlight he recognized the old leader of the boucaniers now grown noticeably heavier his thick beard once black as onyx was liberally threaded with white he sported a ruffled doublet of red silk and had stuffed his dark calico breeches into buckettop sea boots of fine spanish leather the gold rings on several fingers glistened with jewels and the squint in his eyes was deep and malevolent le basque embraced winston then drew back and studied his scar mon dieu so i came closer than i thought mes condoleances i must have been sleepy that morning id fully intended to take your head how about some of your french brandy you old batard for me and my friend by the look of things id say you can afford it vraiment brandy for the anglais and his friend the boucanier nodded warily as he saw atiba appear at the top of the ladder after a moments pause he laughed again throatily truly i can afford anything the old days are over im rich many a spaniard has paid for what they did to us back then he turned and barked an order to de fontenay the young man bowed then moved smoothly through the heavy oak doors leading into jacquess residence you know i still hear of you from time to time anglais but never before have we seen you here n estce pas how have you been well enough i see youve been busy yourself winston glanced up at the brickwork house jacques had erected above the center of the rock it was a true citadel along the edge of the platform looking out a row of ninepound demiculverin had been installed but whats this talk you chased off the english planters they annoyed me you know that never was wise so i decided to be rid of them besides its better this way a few were permitted to stay on and sail for me but la tortue must be french he reached for a tankard from the tray de fontenay was offering i persuaded our gouverneur up on st christophe to send down a few frigates to help me secure this place is that why you keep men in a dungeon up here we never had such things in the old days my little purgatory he handed the tankard to winston then offered one to atiba the yoruba eyed him coldly and waved it away jacques shrugged taking a sip himself before continuing surely you understand the need for discipline if these men disobey me they must be dealt with otherwise no one remembers who is in charge of this place i thought wed planned to just punish the spaniards not each other but we are anglais we are remember when i declared they would someday soil their breeches whenever they heard the word boucanier well its come true they swear using my name half the time the craven bastards are too terrified to cock a musket when my men board one of their merchant frigates he smiled everything we wanted back then has come to pass sweet revenge he reached and absently drew a finger down de fontenays arm but tell me anglais have you got a woman these days or a matelot he studied atiba an englishwoman is sailing with me shes down on the defiance the defiance my spanish brig oui but of course i heard how you acquired it he laughed and stroked his beard alors tomorrow you must bring this anglaise of yours up and let me meet her show her how your old friend has made his way in the world that depends i thought wed empty a tankard or two tonight and talk a bit bon nothing better he signaled to de fontenay for a refill and the young man quickly stepped forward with the flask tonight we remember old times winston laughed could be therere a few things about the old days wed best let be so maybe ill just work on this fine brandy of yours and hear how youre getting along these days with our good friends the spaniards ah anglais we get on very well i have garroted easily a hundred of those bastards for every one of ours they killed back then and taken enough cargo to buy a kingdom you know if their nuevo espana armada the one that ships home silver from their mines in mexico is a week overdue making the canary islands the king of spain and all his creditors from italy to france cannot shit for worrying i might have taken it someday my friend i will good ill drink to it winston lifted his tankard to the spaniards jacques laughed oui and may they always be around to keep me rich on that subject old friend i had a little project in mind i was thinking maybe id borrow a few of your lads and stage a raid on a certain spanish settlement anglais why would you want to bother believe me when i tell you theres not a town on the main i could not take tomorrow if i choose but theyre mostly worthless he drank again then rose and strolled over to the edge of the platform below mast lights were speckled across the harbor and music drifted up from the glowing tavern windows by the time you get into one the spaniards have carried everything they own into the forest and emptied the place ill grant you that but did you ever consider taking one of their islands say jamaica mon ami the rewards of an endeavor must justify the risk jacques strolled back and settled heavily into a deep leather chair whats over there besides their militia theyve got a fortress and a town villa de la vega and theres bound to be a bit of coin maybe even some plate but the harbors the real oui peutetre perhaps theres a sou or two to be had there somewhere but why trouble yourself with a damned militia when therere merchantmen plying the windward passage day in and day out up to their gunwales with plate pearls from their oyster beds down at margarita even silks shipped overland from those manila galleons that put in at acapulco you know an english captain named jackson took that fortress a few years back and ransomed it for twenty thousand piecesofeight thats a hundred and sixty thousand reals anglais i also know very well they have a battery of guns in that fort covering the harbor it wouldnt be all that simple to storm as it happens ive taken on a pilot who knows that harbor better than you know the one right down below and im thinking i might sail over and see it winston took another swallow youre welcome to send along some men if you like ill split any metal money and plate with them forget it anglais none of these men will wait a minute jacques you dont own them that was never the way so if some of these lads decide to sail with me thats their own affair my friend why do you think i am the commandant de place if i do not command have you seen those culverin just below us trained on the bay no frigate enters basse terreor leaves it against my will even yours mon ami dont lose sight of that i thought you were getting smarter than you used to be jacques dont try and challenge me again anglais jacquess hand had edged slowly toward the pistol in his belt but then he glanced at atiba and hesitated though its not my habit to kill a man while hes drinking my brandy he smiled suddenly breaking the tension and leaned back it might injure my reputation for hospitality when im in the fortress overlooking jamaica bay one day soon ill try and remember to drink your health you really think you can do it dont you he sobered and studied winston its too easy not to but i told you we could take it as partners together anglais im not a fool you dont have the men to manage it alone so youre hoping ill give you some of mine i dont want you to give me anything you old whoremaster i said we would take it together forget it i have better things to do he smiled but all the same its always good to see an old friend again stay a while anglais what if tomorrow night we feasted like the old days boucanier style why not show your femme how we used to live jacques weve got victuals on the defiance is that what you think of me he sighed that i would forgo this chance to relive old times bring this petite anglaise of yours up and let her meet your old ami i knew you before you were sure which end of a musket to prime i watched you bring down your first wild boar and now when i welcome you and yours with open arms you scorn my generosity were not finished with this matter of the spaniards my friend certainement perhaps i will give it some consideration we can think about it tomorrow night while we all share some brandy and dine on barbacoa same as the old days as long as i breathe nothing else will ever taste quite so good he motioned for de fontenay to lower the iron ladder we will remember the way we used to live in truth i even think i miss it at times life was simpler then things dont seem so simple around here any more jacques but we can remember my friend humility it nourishes the soul to old times then jacques he drained his tankard and signaled for atiba tomorrow oui anglais a demain and my regards to your friend here with the cutlass he smiled as he watched them start down the ladder but why dont you ask him to stay down there tomorrow i must be getting old because that sword of his is starting to make me nervous and we wouldnt want anything to upset our little fete now would we mon frere katherine stood at the bannister amidships serina by her side and studied the glimmer of lights along the shore swaying clusters of candlelanterns as seamen passed back and forth in longboats between the brothels of tortuga and their ships the buccaneers they lived in a world like none she had ever seen as the shouts curses songs and snatches of music drifted out over the gentle surf she had to remind herself that this raffish settlement was the home of brigands unwelcome in any other place yet from her vantage now they seemed like harmless jovial children still anchored alongside the defiance were some of the most heavily armed brigantines in the new worldno bottom here carried fewer than thirty guns the men too were murderers who killed spanish civilians as readily as infantry jacques le basque presided over the most dreaded naval force in the new world he had done more to endanger spains fragile economy than all the protestant countries together if they grew any stronger the few hundred men on this tiny island might well so disrupt spains vital lifeline of silver from the americas as to bankrupt what once had been europes mightiest empire the report of a pistol sounded from somewhere along the shore followed by yells of glee and more shots several men in spanish finery had begun firing into the night to signal the commencement of an impromptu celebration as they marched around a keg of liquor a cluster of women prostitutes from the taverns shrieked in drunken encouragement and joined in the melee this place is very frightening senhora serina shivered and edged next to katherine her hair was tied in a kerchief african style as it had been for all the voyage i have never seen branco like these they seem so crazy so violent just be thankful were not spaniards or wed find out just how violent they really are remember i once lived in brazil we heard stories about this place tis quite a sight yor ladyships john mewes had ambled over to the railing beside them to watch for winston the damnedest crew of rogues and knaves youre ever like to make acquaintance with thingsve come to a sad pass that weve got to try recruitin some of this lot to sail with us do you think theyre safe ashore john aye yor ladyship on that matter id not trouble yourself unduly mewes fingered the musket he was holding you shouldve seen him once down at curasao when a gang of dutch shippers didnt like the cheap price we was askin for a load of killdevil thatd fallen our way over at i forget where threatened to board and scuttle us so the captain and me decided wed hoist a couple of ninepound demis up on deck and stage a little gunnery exercise on a buoy floatin there on the windward side o the harbor after wed laid it with a couple of rounds blew it to hell next thing you know the butterboxes john whats that light over there isnt that him mewes paused and stared at the shoreline opposite their anchorage a lantern was flashing aye mlady thats the signal sure enough he smiled didnt i tell you thered be nothing to worry over with an exhale of relief he quickly turned and ordered the longboat lowered assigning four men to the oars and another four to bring flintlocks the longboat lingered briefly in the surf at the shore and moments later winston and atiba were headed back toward the ship it seems they are safe senhora serina was still watching with worried eyes perhaps these branco are better than those on barbados well i dont think they have slaves if thats what you mean but thats about all you can say for them a few moments later the longboat bumped against the side of the defiance and winston was pulling himself over the bulwarks followed by atiba katy break out the tankards i think we can deal with jacques he offered her a hug hes gone half madtaken over the island and run off the english settlers but therere plenty of english boucaniers here whod like nothing better than to sail from somewhere else did he agree to help us of course not youve got to know him its just what i expected when i brought up our little idea he naturally refused pointblank but he knows therere men here wholl join us if they like which means that tomorrow hell claim it was his idea all along then demand the biggest part of what we take for himself tomorrow im going back up to the fort around sunset to sort out details i wish you wouldnt she took his hand why dont we just get whatever men we can manage and leave thatd mean a fight he kissed her lightly dont worry ill handle jacques we just have to keep our wits well then i want to go with you as a matter of fact he did ask you to come but thats out of the question its just as dangerous for you as for me if youre going back then so am i katy no hugh weve done everything together this far so if you want to get men from this place then ill help you and if that means i have to flatter this insane criminal so be it he regarded her thoughtfully then smiled well in truth im not sure a woman can still turn his head but i suppose you can give it a try serina approached them and reached to touch winstons hand senhor was your council of war a success i think so all things in time the branco in this place are very strange is it true they do not have slaves slaves no though they do have a kind of servant here but even thats different from barbados how so senhor well thereve never been many women around this place so in the old days a boucanier might acquire a matelot to be his companion and over the years the matelots got to be more like younger brothers than indentures they have legal rights of inheritance for instance since most boucaniers have no family a boucanier and his matelot are legally entitled to the others property if one of them dies he looked back toward the shore also no man has more than one matelot in fact if a boucanier does marry a woman his matelot has conjugal rights to her too but senhor if the younger man the matelot inherits everything what is to keep him from just killing the older man to gain his freedom and also the other mans property honor he shrugged and leaned back against the railing inhaling the dense air of the island he lingered pensively for a moment then turned to katherine katy do remember this isnt just any port some of those men out there have been known to shoot somebody for no more cause than a tankard of brandy and underneath it all jacques is just like the rest its when hes most cordial that youd best beware i still want to go she moved next to him im going to meet facetoface with this madman who once tried to kill you chapter twentyone the ochre halflight of dusk was settling over the island lending a warm tint to the deep green of the hillside forests surrounding forte de la roche in the central yard of the fortress directly beneath le basques dovecote his uniformed guards loitered alongside the row of heavy culverin watching the mast lights of anchored frigates and brigantines nod beneath the cloudless sky tibaut de fontenay had taken no note of the beauty of the evening he was busy tending the oldfashioned boucan jacques had ordered constructed just behind the cannon though he stood on the windward side he still coughed occasionally from the smoke that threaded upward over the dovecote and toward the hill above the boucan itself consisted of a rectangular wooden frame supporting a greenwood grill set atop four forked posts over the frame and grill a thatchwork of banana leaves had been erected to hold in the piquant smoke of the smoldering naseberry branches beneath several haunches of beef lay flat on the grill and now the fire was coating them with a succulent red veneer it was the traditional taino indian method of cooking and preserving meat barbacoa that had been adopted intact by the boucaniers decades before jacques leaned against the railing at the edge of the platform above pewter tankard in hand contentedly stroking his saltandpepper beard as he gazed out over the harbor and the multihued sunset that washed his domain in misty ambers finally he turned with a murmur of satisfaction and beckoned for katherine to join him she glanced uneasily toward winston then moved to his side the aroma of the boucan mademoiselle was always the signal the day was ending he pointed across the wide bay toward the green mountains of hispaniola were we over there tonight with the hunters we would still be scraping the last of the hides now while our boucan finished curing the days kill for storing in our bananaleaf ajoupa he smiled warmly then glanced down to see if her tankard required attention though of course we never had such a charming anglaise to leaven our rude company i should have thought monsieur le basque you might have preferred a frenchwoman katherine studied him trying to imagine the time when he and hugh had roamed the forests together jacques le basque for all his rough exterior conveyed an unsettling sensuality she sensed his desire for her as he stood alongside and when he brushed her hand she caught herself trembling involuntarily you do me an injustice mademoiselle to suggest i would even attempt passing such a judgment he laughed for me womankind is like a garden whose flowers each have their own beauty where is the man who could be so dull as to waste a single moment comparing the deep hue of the rose to the delicate pale of the lily the petals of each are soft they both open invitingly at the touch do they always open so easily monsieur le basque please you must call me jacques he brushed back a wisp of her hair and paused to admire her face in the light of the sunset it is ever a mans duty to awaken the beauty that lies sleeping in a womans body too many exquisite creatures never realize how truly lovely they are do those lovely creatures include handsome boys as well she glanced down at de fontenay his long curls lying tangled across his delicate shoulders jacques drank thoughtfully from his tankard mademoiselle there is something of beauty in all gods work what can a man know of wine if he samples only one vineyard a woman might say jacques it depends on whether you prefer flowers or wine touche mademoiselle but some of us have a taste for all of life our years here are so brief as she stood beside him she became conscious again of the shortbarreled flintlockborrowed from winstons sea chest without his knowing itshe had secreted in the waist of her petticoat just below her lowcut bodice now it seemed so foolish why had hugh painted jacques as erratic and dangerous could it be because the old boucanier had managed to better him in that pistol duel they once had and hed never quite lived it down maybe that was why he never seemed to get around to explaining what really happened that time then perhaps youll tell me how many of those years you spent hunting she abruptly turned and gestured toward the hazy shoreline across the bay seen through the smoke of the boucan below hispaniolas forests seemed endless impenetrable over there on the big island ah mademoiselle thinking back now it seems like forever perhaps it was almost that long he laughed genially then glanced toward winston standing at the other end of the platform and called out anglais shall we tell your lovely mademoiselle something about the way we lived back in the old days you can tell her anything you please jacques just take care its true winston was studying the fleet of ships in the bay below remember this is our evening for straight talk then i will try not to make it sound too romantic jacques chuckled and turned back since the anglais insists i must be precise i should begin by admitting it was a somewhat difficult existence mademoiselle wed go afield for weeks at a time usually six or eight of us together in a party to protect ourselves should we blunder across some of the spaniards lancers cavalry who roamed the island trying to be rid of us in truth we scarcely knew where we would bed down from one day to the next winston was only half listening as he studied the musket men in the yard below there seemed to be a restlessness perhaps even a tension about them was it the boucan the bother of the smoke or was it something more some treachery in the making he told himself to stay alert that this was no time to be lulled by jacquess famed courtliness it could have been a big mistake not to bring atiba in spite of jacquess demand he be left on most days we would rise at dawn prime our muskets then move out to scout for game usually one of us went ahead with the dogs before the anglais came to live with us that perilous assignment normally fell to me since i had the best aim he lifted the onionflask of french brandy from the side of the veranda and replenished her tankard with a smooth flourish when you stalk the wild bull the taureau sauvage youd best be able to bring him down with the first shot or hope theres a stout tree nearby to climb he smiled and thumbed toward winston but after the anglais joined us we soon all agreed he should have the honor of going first with the dogs we had discovered he was a born marksman he toasted winston with his tankard when the dogs had a wild bull at bay the anglais would dispatch it with his musket afterwards one of our men would stay to butcher it and take the hide while the rest of us would move on following him then what she never knew before that winston had actually been the leader of the hunt their marksman well mademoiselle after the anglais had bagged a bull for every man wed bring all the meat and hides back to the base camp the rendezvous then we would put up a boucan like the one down there below us now and begin smoking the meat while we finished scraping the hides he smiled through his graying beard you would scarcely have recognized the anglais or me in those days mademoiselle half the time our breeches were so caked with blood they looked like wed been tarred he glanced back at the island by nightfall the barbacoa would be finished and we would eat some then salt the rest and put it away in an ajoupa together with the hides finally wed bed down beside the fire of the boucan to smoke away the mosquitoes sleeping in those canvas sacks we used to keep off ants then at first light of dawn we rose to go out again and then you would sell your barbacoa and hides here on tortuga exactly mademoiselle i see my old friend the anglais has already told you something of those days he smiled and caught her eye yes often as not wed come back over here and barter with the ships that put in to refit but then sometimes wed just sell them over there when we had a load we would start watching for a sail and if we saw a ship nearing the coast wed paddle out in our canoes canoes she felt the night grow chill suddenly a memory from long ago welled up again bearded men firing on their ship her mother falling oui mademoiselle dugout canoes in truth theyre all we had those days we made them by hollowing out the heart of a tree burning it away just like the indians on hispaniola used to do he sipped his brandy then motioned toward winston they were quite seaworthy n estce pas enough so we actually used them on our first raid he turned back though after that we naturally had spanish ships and where was your first raid monsieur le basque she felt her grip tighten involuntarily on the pewter handle of her tankard did the anglais never tell you about that little episode mademoiselle he laughed sarcastically no perhaps it is not something he chooses to remember though at the time we thought we could depend on him i have explained to you that no man among us could shoot as well as he we wanted him to fire the first shot as he did when we were hunting truly we had high hopes for him jacques drank again a broad silhouette against the panorama of the sunset he told me how you got together to fight the spaniards but did he bon he paused to check the boucan below them then the men finally he shrugged and turned back it was the start of the legend of the boucaniers mademoiselle and you can take pride that the anglais was part of it few men are still alive now to tell that tale what happened to the others jacques winstons voice hardened as he moved next to one of the ninepound cannon i seem to remember there were almost thirty of us guy bartholomew was on that raid for one i saw him down below last night i knew a lot of those men well oui you had many friends but after you left us a few unfortunate incidents transpired winston tensed did the ship i discovered what can occur when there is not proper organization anglais but now i am getting ahead of our story surely you remember the island we had encamped on well we waited on that cursed sand spit several weeks more hoping there would be another prize but alas we saw nothing rien then finally one day around noon when it was so hot you could scarcely breathe we spied a spanish sailfar at sea by then all our supplies were down we were desperate so we launched our canoes and put to sea with a vow we would seize the ship or perish trying and you took it winston had set down his tankard on the railing and was listening intently mais oui but of course desperate men rarely fail later we learned that when the captain saw our canoes approaching he scoffed saying what could a few dugouts do against his guns he paid for that misjudgment with his life we waited till dark then stormed her the ship was ours in minutes congratulations not so quickly anglais unfortunately all did not go smoothly after that perhaps its just as well you were no longer with us mon ami naturally we threw all the spaniards overboard crew and passengers and then we sailed her back here to basse terre a threehundredton brigantine there was some plate aboardperhaps the capitaine was hoarding itand considerable coin among the passengers but when we dropped anchor here a misunderstanding arose over how it all was to be divided he sighed there were problems i regret to say it led to bloodshed what do you mean winston glared at him i thought wed agreed to split all prizes equally he smiled patiently anglais think about it how could such a thing be i was the commander my position had certain requirements and to make sure the same question did not arise again i created articles for us to sail under giving more to the ships master they specify in advance what portion goes to every man from the maintop to the keel though the commander and officers naturally must receive a larger share and what about now winston interrupted now that you frenchmen have taken over tortuga i hear theres a new way to split any prizes the men bring in which includes you and chevalier de poncy oui conditions have changed slightly but the men all understand that they understand these french culverin up here mes compliments it must be very profitable for you and him but we have much responsibility here he gestured toward the settlement below them i have many men under my authority so now that youve taken over this place and become commandant its not really like it used to be when everybody worked for himself now theres a french administration and that means extortion though i suppose you call it taxes naturellement he paused to watch as de fontenay walked to the edge of the parapet and glanced up at the mountain behind the fort but tonight we were to recall those old happy days anglais before the burden of all this governing descended on my unworthy shoulders your jolie mademoiselle seems to take such interest in what happened back then id like to hear about what happened while hugh was on that raid with you you said he was to fire the first shot oui jacques laughed and he did indeed pull the first trigger i was truly sad to part with him at what was to be our moment of glory but we had differences i regret to say that made it necessary what do you mean she was watching hughs uneasiness as he glanced around the fort suspecting hed probably just as soon this story wasnt told we had carefully laid a trap to lure in a ship mademoiselle up in the grand caicos using a fire on the shore where some islands north of here where the spaniards stop every year jacques continued evenly and our plan seemed to be working brilliantly whats more the anglais here was given the honor of the first bullet he sipped from his tankard but when a prize blundered into it the affair turned bloody some of my men were killed and i seem to recall a woman on the ship i regret to say the anglais was responsible hugh what did you do she heard her tankard drop onto the boards to his credit i will admit he at least helped us bait the hook mademoiselle jacques smiled did you not anglais that i did except it caught an english fish instead of a spaniard good christ no katherine sucked in her breath the coldhearted bastard i am glad i brought a pistol except itll not be for jacques le basque i think you two had best spare me the rest of your heroic little tale before i but mademoiselle the anglais was our finest marksman he could bring down a wild boar at three hundred paces he toasted winston with a long draught from his tankard dont forget i had trained him well we wanted him to fire the first shot you should at least take pride in that even if the rest does not redound entirely to his credit hugh youd better tell me the truth right now she moved toward him almost quivering with rage she felt her hand close about the grip of her pistol as she stood facing winston his scarred face impassive did you fire on the ship mademoiselle what does it matter now all that is past correct jacques smiled as he strolled over tonight the anglais and i are once more freres de la cote brothers in the honorable order of boucaniers he patted winstons shoulder that is still true nestce pas and together we will mount the greatest raid everon the spanish island of jamaica winston was still puzzling over katherines sudden anger when he finally realized what jacques had said so he thought the old batard wants to give me the men after all just as id figured now its time to talk details together jacques but remember im the one who has the pilot the man who can get us into the harbor so that means i set the terms he sipped from his tankard feeling the brandy burn its way down and since you seem to like it here so much ill keep the port for myself and well just draw up some of those articles of yours about how we manage the rest but of course anglais ive already been thinking perhaps we can handle it this way you keep whatever you find in the fortress and my men will take the spoils from the town wait a minute the towns apt to have the most booty you know that jacques anglais how can we possibly foretell such a thing in advance already i am assuming a risk jacques smiled and turned to look down at the bay as he moved the railing he had been standing beside exploded spewing slivers of mastic wood into the evening air when he glanced back startled a faint pop sounded from the direction of the hill behind the fort time froze as a look of angry realization spread through the old boucaniers eyes he checked the iron ladder still lowered then yelled for the guards below to light the linstocks for the cannon and ready their muskets katy take cover winston seized her arm and she felt him pull her against the side of the house out of sight of the hill above maybe commandant le basque is not quite so popular with some of his lads as he seems to think i can very well take care of myself captain right now ive a mind to kill you both she wrenched her arm away and moved down the side of the citadel katy what as winston stared at her uncomprehending another musket ball from the dark above splattered into the post beside jacques he bellowed a curse then drew the pistol from his belt and stepped into the protection of the roof when he did one of the guards from below wearing a black hat and jerkin appeared at the top of the iron ladder leading up from the courtyard jacques yelled for him to hurry damn you vite theres some fool up the hill with a musket before he could finish the man raised a long flintlock pistol and fired the ball ripped away part of the ornate lace along one side of jacquess collar almost before the spurt of flame had died away jacquess own pistol was cocked he casually took aim and shot the guard squarely in the face the man slumped across the edge of the opening then slid backward and out of sight anglais he turned back coolly tonight you have just had the privilege of seeing me remind these cochons who controls this island even as he spoke the curly head of de fontenay appeared through the opening when jacques saw him he beckoned him forward come on and pull it up after you too many killings will upset my guests dinner the young frenchman stepped slowly onto the platform then slipped his right hand into his ornate doublet and lifted out a pistol he examined it for a moment before reaching down with his left and extracting another i said to pull up the ladder damn you thats an order de fontenay began to back along the railing all the while staring at jacques with eyes fearful and uncertain finally he summoned the courage to speak you are a bete jacques truly a beast his voice trembled and glistening droplets of sweat had begun to bead on his smooth forehead we are going to open purgatory and release the men you have down there give me the keys or i will kill you myself i swear it youd do well to put those guns away you little fou before i become annoyed jacques glared at him a moment then turned toward winston his voice even anglais kindly pass me one of your pistols or i will be forced to kill this little putain and all the rest with my own bare hands i would regret having to soil them youd best settle this yourself jacques i keep my pistols besides maybe you should open that new dungeon of yours we never needed anything like that in the old days damn you anglais his voice hardened i said give me a gun at that moment another guard from below appeared at the opening with a curse jacques stepped over and shoved a heavy boot into his face sending the startled man sprawling backward then he seized the iron ladder and drew it up beyond reach of those below he ignored de fontenay as he turned back to winston are you defying me too anglais bon because before this night is over i have full intention of settling our accounts jacques mon ami winston laughed here all this time i thought we were going to be freres again he sobered though i would prefer going in partners with a commander who can manage his own men you mean this little one he thumbed at de fontenay believe me when i tell you he does not have the courage of now de fontenay was raising the pistol in his right hand shakily i said to give us the keys jacques you have gone too far you will not live that long my little matelot to order me what to do jacques feigned a menacing step toward him startled de fontenay edged backward and jacques erupted with laughter then turned back to winston you see anglais cowards are all the same remember when you wanted to kill me you were pointblank and you failed now this little putain has the same idea he seized winstons jerkin give me one of your guns anglais or i will take it with my own hands no at the other end of the citadel katherine stood holding the pistol she had brought she was gripping it with both hands rock steady aimed at them slowly she moved down the porch id like to just be rid of you both which one of you should i kill the old boucanier stared at her as she approached then at winston your anglaise has gone mad i was on that english ship you two are so proud of attacking she directed the flintlock toward winston hugh the woman you remember killingshe was my mother the night flared with the report of a pistol and jacques flinched in surprise he glanced down curiously at the splotch of red blossoming against the side of his silk shirt then looked up at de fontenay that was a serious mistake my little ami one you will not live long enough to regret the smoking pistol de fontenay held dropped noisily onto the boards at his feet while he raised the other i said give to me the keys jacques or i will kill you i swear it you think i can be killed by you jamais he laughed then suddenly reached out and wrenched away the pistol katherine was holding shoving her aside with a smile he aimed it directly at de fontenays chest now mon ami there was a dead click then silence it had misfired i dont want this jacques truly de fontenay started to tremble and abruptly the other pistol he held exploded with a pink arrow of flame anglais jacques jerked lightly a second splotch of red spreading across his pale shirt then he dropped to one knee with a curse de fontenay stepped hesitantly forward perhaps now you will understand mon maitre what kind of man i can be he watched in disbelief as jacques slowly slumped forward across the boards at his feet then he edged closer to where the old boucanier lay reached down and ripped away a ring of heavy keys secured to his belt he held them a moment in triumph before he looked down again suddenly incredulous mon dieu he is dead with a cry of remorse he crouched over the lifeless figure and lovingly touched the bloodstained beard finally he remembered himself and glanced up at winston it seems i have finished what you began he told me today how you two quarreled once he cared nothing for us you or me friend or lover he hesitated and his eyes appeared to plead what do we do now winston was still staring at katherine his mind flooded with dismay at the anger in her eyes at last he seemed to hear de fontenay and turned back since youve got his keys you might as well go ahead and throw them down i assume you mean to open the dungeon oui he had begun to lock men there just on his whim yesterday he even imprisoned a special friend of mine it was too much he walked to the edge of the platform and flung the ring of keys down toward the pavement of the fort as the ring of metal against stone cut through the silence he yelled out purgatory is no more jacques le basque is in hell he abruptly turned and shoved down the ladder in the courtyard below pandemonium erupted at once a cannon blazed into the night then a second and a third moments later jubilant musket fire sounded up from the direction of the settlement as men poured into the streets torches and lanterns blazing good god katy i dont know what youve been thinking but wed best talk about it later right now weve got to get out of here winston walked hesitantly to where she stood somebodys apt to get a mind to fire this place no i dont katy come on he grabbed her arm de fontenay was still at the railing along the edge of the platform as though not yet fully comprehending the enormity of his act below him a string of prisoners still shackled was being led from the dungeon beneath the dovecote winston forcibly guided katherine down the ladder and onto the stone steps below now guards had already begun dismantling the boucan with the butts of their muskets sending sparks sailing upward into the night air then the iron gateway of the fortress burst open and a mob of seamen began pouring through waving pistols and cheering finally one of them spotted winston on the steps and pressed through the crowd gods blood is it true winston looked down and recognized guy bartholomew jacques is dead an theyre all claiming you did it that you came up here and killed the bastard the very thing we all wanted and you managed it he reached up and pumped winstons hand maybe now i can stand you a drink for my money i say you should be new commandant of this pisshole by virtue of ridding the place of him i didnt kill him bartholomew that honor goes to his matelot the excited seaman scarcely paused tis no matter sir that little whore is nothing i know one thing every englishman herell sail for you or im not a christian maybe we can call some of the ships masters together and see what they want to do you can name the time sir and ill tell you this therere going to be a few changes around here that i can warrant he turned to look at the other men several of whom were offering flasks of brandy to the prisoners around them the french guards had remembered jacquess store of liquor and were shoving past headed up the ladder in moments they were flinging down flasks of brandy bartholomew turned and gazed down toward the collection of mast lights below them theres scarcely an englishman here whod not have left that whoresons service long ago save theres no place else but tortuga the likes of us can drop anchor but now with him gone we can until further notice this island is going to be under my administration as representative of the chevalier de poncy gouverneur of st christophe de fontenay had appeared at the top of the steps and begun to shout over the tumult in the yard his curls fluttered in the wind as he called for quiet by the code of the boucaniers the telle etoit la coutume de la cote i am jacquess legal heir which means i can claim the office of acting commandant de place bartholomew yelled up at him you can claim whatever you like you pimp but no englishmanll sail for you an thats a fact well spike these cannon if youre thinking to try any of the old tricks its a new day by all thats holy what do you mean de fontenay glanced down i mean from this day forth well sail for whatever master weve a mind to de fontenay called to winston you saw who killed him monsieur tell them he looked back toward bartholomew this man knew jacques better than any of you his friend the anglais from the very first days of the boucaniers he will tell you the code makes me anglais bartholomew stared at winston a moment then a smile erupted across his hard face good god i do believe it is youve aged mightily lad on my honor please take no offense i didnt recognize you before its been a long time gods blood none of us ever knew your christian name we all thought you dead after you and jacques had that little shooting spree he grasped winstons hand do you have any idea how proud we were of you i tell you we all saw it when you pulled a pistol on that bastard you may not know it sir but it was because of you his band of french rogues didnt rape that english frigate all the englishmen amongst us wanted to stop it but we had no chance he laughed in truth sir that was the start of all our troubles here we never got along with the damnd frenchmen after that articles or no hugh whats he saying katherine was staring at him what do you mean is it true you stopped jacques and his men from taking our ship the one you were talking about tonight the idea was we were only to kill spaniards no englishman had done anything to us it wouldnt have been honorable when jacques didnt agree with me on that point things got a little unpleasant thats when somebody started firing on the ship aye the damnd frenchmen bartholomew interjected i was there sir im sorry the rest of us didnt manage to warn you in time winston slipped his arm around her suddenly she wanted to smother him in her arms but do you realize you must have saved my life they would have killed us all they doubtless would have eventually he reached over and kissed her then drew back and examined her katy i have a confession to make i think i can still remember watching you when i was in the longboat trying to reach the ship i think i fell in love with you that morning with that brave girl who stood there at the railing musket balls flying i never forgot it in all the years my god to think it was you he held her against him for a moment then lifted up her face which also means i have you and yours to thank for trying to kill me when i wanted to get out to where you were the captain just assumed you were one of them i heard him talk about it after nobody had any idea she hugged him you and your honor you changed my life you and that ship sure as hell changed mine after i fell in love with you i damned near died of thirst in that leaky longboat and then ruyters capitaine please tell them i was the one who shot jacques that i am now commandant de place de fontenay interrupted his voice pleading that i have the authority to order them youre not ordering anything by jesus im about to put an end to any more french orders here and now bartholomew seized a burning stick from the fire in the boucan and flung it upward onto the veranda of the dovecote a cheer went up from the english seamen clustered around and before jacquess french guards could stop them they were flinging torches and flaming logs up into the citadel messieurs no please je vous en prie non de fontenay stared up in horror tongues of flame began to lick at the edge of the platform some of the guards dropped their muskets and yelled to get buckets of water from the spring behind the rock then they thought better of it and started edging gingerly toward the iron gates leading out of the fortress and down the hill the other guards who had been rifling the liquor came scurrying down the ladder jostling de fontenay aside as winston urged katherine toward the gates the young matelot was still lingering forlornly on the steps gazing up at the burning dovecote finally the last to leave forte de la roche he sadly turned and made his way out senhor what is happening here atiba was racing up the steps leading to the gate carrying his cutlass i swam to shore and came fastly as i could theres been a little revolution up here my friend and ill tell you something else theres likely to be some gunpowder in that citadel for those demiculverin i dont have any idea how many kegs he had but knowing jacques there was enough he took katherines hand its the end for this place that much you can be sure hugh what about the plan to use his men she turned back to look well just have to see how things here are going to settle out now maybe its not over yet they moved onto the treelined pathway the night air was sharp fragrant above the glow of the fire the moon hung like a lantern in the tropical sky you know i never trusted him for a minute truly i didnt she slipped her arm around winstons jerkin i realize now he was planning to somehow try and kill us both tonight thank heaven its over why dont we just get out of here while we still can well sir its a new day guy bartholomew emerged out of the crowd his smile illuminated by the glow of the blaze an ive been talkin with some of my lads why dont we just have done with these damnd frenchmen and claim this island he gleefully rubbed at the stubble on his chin no englishman heres goin to line the pockets of a frenchman ever again that ill promise you you can try and make tortuga english if you like but you wont be sailing with me if you do what do you mean sir bartholomew stood puzzling this is our best chance ever to take hold and keep this place an theres precious few other islands where we can headquarter i know one that has a better harbor and a better fortress guarding it where might that be ever think of jamaica jamaica sir he glanced up confusedly but that belongs to the poxeaten spaniards not after we take it away from them it wont and when we do any english privateer who wants can use the harbor there now sir bartholomew stopped tryin to seize jamaicas another matter entirely we thought you were the man to help us take charge of this little enterprise here of pillagin the cursed spaniards shipping you didnt say youre plannin to try stealin a whole island from the whoresons im not just planning my friend winston moved on ahead atiba by his side god willing im damned sure going to do it its a bold notion that ill grant you he examined winston skeptically then grinned as he followed after gods life thatd be the biggest prize any englishman in the caribbean ever tried i think it can be done well ill be plain with you sir i dont know how many men herell be willing to risk their hide on such a venture i hear the spaniardsve got a militia over there maybe a thousand strong tis even said theyve got some cavalry then all you englishmen here can stay on and sail for the next commandant chevalier de poncy finds to send down and take over hell hold la tortue for france dont you think otherwise all those commissions didnt stay in jacquess pocket you can be sure hes bound to have passed a share up to the frenchmen on st christopher well not permit it sir well not let the frenchmen have it back how do you figure on stopping them this fortressll take weeks to put into any kind of shape again and de poncys sure to post a fleet down the minute he hears of this id say this placell have no choice but stay french aye im beginnin to get the thrust of your thinkin he gazed ruefully back up at the burning fort if that should happen and i grant you theres some likelihood it just might then theres apt to be damned little future here for a godfearin englishman so either we keep on sailin for some other french bastard or we find ourselves another harbor thats how i read the situation now winston continued on down the hill so why dont we hold a vote amongst the men and see master bartholomew maybe a few of them are game to try making a whole new place jamaica chapter twentytwo a cricket sang from somewhere within the dark crevices of the stone wall surrounding the two men a sharp shrill cadence in the night to the older it was a welcome sign all was well the younger gave it no heed as again he bent over and hit his steel against the flint sending sparks flying into the wind finally he cursed in spanish and paused to pull his goatskin jerkin closer hipolito de valera had not expected this roofless hilltop outpost would catch the full force of the breeze that rolled in off the bay he paused for another gust to die away then struck the flint once more a shower of sparks scattered across the small pile of dry grass and twigs by the wall and then slowly tentatively the tinder began to glow when at last it was blazing he tossed on a large handful of twigs and leaned back to watch in the uneven glow of the fire his face was soft with an aquiline nose and dark castilian eyes he was from the sparsely settled north where his father don alfonso de valera had planted fortyfive acres of grape arbor in the mountains winemaking was forbidden in the spanish americas but taxes on spanish wines were high and spain was far away tenga cuidado the flame must be kept low it has to be heated slowly juan jose pereira was as he had already observed several times previously this night more knowing of the world his lined cheeks were leatherdark from a lifetime of riding in the harsh jamaican sun for the cattlerancher who owned the largest hato on the liguanea plain perhaps the youngest son of a vineyard owner might understand the best day to pick grapes for the claret but such a raw youth would know nothing of the correct preparation of chocolate juan jose monitored the blaze for a time and thenhis hands moving with the deft assurance of the ancient conquistadorescarefully retrieved a worn leather bag from his pocket and dropped a brown lump into the brass kettle now hanging above the fire he next added two green tabasco peppers followed by a portion of goats milk from his canteen finally he stirred in a careful quantity of muscavado sugarprocured for him informally by his sisters son carlos who operated the boiling house of a sugar plantation in the guanaboa vale one of only seven on the island with a horsedrawn mill for crushing the cane as he watched the thick mixture begin to simmer he motioned for the younger man to climb back up the stone stairway to the top of their outpost the vigia overlooking the harbor of jamaica bay dawn was four hours away but their vigil for mast lights must be kept even when there was nothing but the half moon to watch in truth juan jose did not mind his occasional night of duty for the militia especially here on the mountain he liked the stars the cool air so unlike his sweltering thatched hut on the plain and the implicit confirmation his eyes were still as keen as they had been the morning he was baptized over fifty years ago the aroma of the chocolate swirled up into the watchtower above and in the moonlight its dusky perfume sent hipolitos thoughts soaring elvita wouldnt it be paradise if she were here tonight instead of a crusty old vaquero like juan jose he thought again of her almond eyes which he sometimes caught glancing at him during the mass though always averted with a pretense of modesty when his own look returned their desire he sat musing over what his father would say when he informed him he was hopelessly in love with elvita de loaisa undoubtedly don alfonso would immediately point out that her father garcia de loaisa had only twenty acres of lowland cotton in cultivation what dowry would such a lazy family bring what to do just to think about her while the moon your chocolate juan jose was standing beside him holding out a pewter bowl from which a tiny wisp of steam trailed upward to be captured in the breeze the old man watched him take it then holding his own portion settled back against the stone bench you were gazing at the moon my son he crossed himself then began to sip noisily the spot to watch is over there at the tip of the cayo de carena now he was pointing south any protestante fleet that would attack us must first sail around the point the old man consumed the rest of his chocolate quickly then licked the rim of the bowl and laid it aside its spicy sweetness was good true enough one of the joys of the spanish americas but now he wanted something stronger unobtrusively he rummaged through the pocket of his coat till he located his flask of pimento brandy he extracted the cork with his teeth then pensively drew twice on the bottle before rising to stare out over the stone balustrade below them on the right lay jamaica bay placid and empty with the sandy cay called cayo de carena defining its farthest perimeter the cay he had always thought was where the passage fort really should be but their governor don francisco de castilla claimed there was no money to build a second one all the same spreading below him was the finest harbor in the new worldwhen jamaica had no more than three thousand souls maybe four on the whole island did not even the giant galeones on their way north from cartegena find it easy to put in here to trade their arrival was in fact always the event of the year the time when jamaicas hides and pig lard were readied for havana in exchange for fresh supplies of wine olive oil wheat flour even cloth from home don fernando owner of the hato always made certain his hides were cured and bundled for the galeones by late spring but don fernandos leather business was of scant concern to juan jose what use had he for white lace from seville he pulled again at the flask its brandy sharp and pungent and let his eyes wander to the green plain on his left now washed in moonlight that was the jamaica he cared about where everything he required could be grown right in the earth cotton for the women to spin beef and cassava to eat wine and cacao and canebrandy for drinking tobacco to soothe his soul he suddenly remembered he had left his pipe in the leather knapsack down below but now he would wait a bit thinking of a pleasure made it even sweeter just as he knew young hipolito was dreaming still of some country senorita when a young man could not attend to what he was told for longer than a minute it could only be first love as he stood musing his glance fell on caguaya the passage fort half a mile to the left along the rio cobre river that flowed down from villa de la vega the fort boasted ten great guns and it was manned by militia day and night if any strange ship entered the bay caguaya would be signaled from here at the vigia using two large bells donated by the church and the forts cannon would be readied as a precaution he studied it for a time pleased it was there its guns would kill any heretic luterano who came to steal the pipe he glanced over at hipolito now making a show of watching the point at cayo de carena and briefly entertained sending him down for it then he decided the climb would be good for his legs would help him keep his breathwhich he needed for his saturday night trysts with margarita don fernandos head cook though mother of god she had lungs enough for them both he chuckled to himself and took a last pull on the fiery brandy before collecting the pewter bowls to start down the stairs my pipa dont fall asleep gazing at the moon while im below the young man blushed in the dark and busily studied the horizon juan jose stood watching him for a moment wondering if he had been that transparent thirtysome years past then turned and began descending the steps his boots ringing hard against the stone the knapsack was at the side wall near the door and as he bent over to begin searching for the clay stem of his pipe he caught the movement of a shadow along the stone lintel suddenly it stopped que pasa he froze and waited for an answer silence now the shadow was motionless his musket and hipolitos were both leaning against the far wall near the stairs then he remembered slowly with infinite care he slipped open the buckle on the knapsack and felt for his knife the one with the long blade he used for skinning his fingers closed about its bone handle and he carefully drew it from its sheath he raised up quietly and smoothly as though stalking a skittish calf and edged against the wall the shadow moved again tentatively and then a massive black form was outlined against the doorway un negro whose could it be there were no more than forty or fifty slaves on the whole of jamaica brought years ago to work on the plantations but the cane fields were far away west of rio minho and inland the only negro you ever saw this far east was an occasional domestic perhaps he was a runaway there was a band of maroons free negros now living in the mountains but they kept to themselves they did not come down onto the plain to steal the black man stood staring at him he did not move merely watched as though completely unafraid then juan jose saw the glint of a wide blade a cutlass in the moonlight this was no thief who was he what could he want senor stop he raised his knife you are not permitted the negro moved through the doorway as though not understanding his blade was rising slowly juan jose took a deep breath and lunged he was floating enfolded in margaritas soft bosom while the world turned gradually sideways then he felt a pain in his knee as it struck against the stoneoddly that was his first sensation and he wondered fleetingly if it would still be stiff when he mounted his mare in the morning next he noticed a dull ache in the side of his neck not sharp but warm from the blood he felt the knife slip away clattering onto the stone paving beyond his reach and then he saw the moon clear and crisp suspended above him in the open sky next to it hovered hipolito his frightened eyes gazing down from the head of the stair the eyes held dark brown for a second then turned red then black meu deus you have killed him a womans voice pierced the dark she was speaking in portuguese as she moved through the door behind the tall negro hipolito watched in terrified silence too afraid even to breathe behind the negro and the woman were four other men whispering in ingles muskets poised he realized both the guns were still down below and besides how could the whoreson tried to murder me with his damnable knife the man drew up the cutlass and wiped its blood against the leather coat of juan jose sprawled at his feet we were not to kill unless necessary those were your orders the negro motioned for quiet and casually stepped over the body headed for the stairs mother of god no hipolito drew back wanting to cry out to flee but then he realized he was cornered like an animal now the negro was mounting the stairs still holding the sword the woman directly behind him why he wondered had a woman come with them these could not be ordinary thieves they must be corsario luterano heretic protestant flibustero of the sea why hadnt he seen their ship they must have put in at esquebel the little bay down the western shore then come up by the trail it was five miles a quick climb if you knew the way but how could they have known the road leading up to the vigia and if these were here how many more were now readying to attack the fort at caguaya just to the north the bells he backed slowly toward the small tower and felt blindly for the rope but now the huge figure blotted out the moon as it moved toward him fearfully he watched the shadow glide across the paving inching nearer a stone at a time then he noticed the wind blowing through his hair tousling it across his face and he would have pushed it back save he was unable to move he could taste his own fear now like a small copper tlaco in his mouth the man was raising his sword where was the rope mother of god nao the woman had seized the negros arm was pulling him back hipolito could almost decipher her portuguese as she continued suficiente no more killing hipolito stepped away from the bell tower senor por favor the man had paused trying to shake aside the woman then he said something like a hard curse hipolito felt his knees turn to warm butter and he dropped forward across the stones he was crying now his body shivering from the hard cold paving against his face just tie him the womans voice came again he is only a boy the mans voice responded in the strange language and hipolito thought he could feel the sword against his neck he had always imagined he would someday die proudly would honor elvita by his courage and now here he was cringing on his belly they would find him like this the men in the vineyards would joke he had groveled before the protestant ladrones like a dog i will stay and watch him and this place leave me two muskets the woman spoke once more then called out in ingles there were more footsteps on the stairs as the other men clambered up why damn me tis naught but a lad a voice said in ingles sent to do a mans work hes all theyd need to spy us have no fear ill wager twould be no great matter to warn the fort which is what hell be doin if we senor how do you signal the fort the woman was speaking now in spanish as she seized hipolitos face and pulled him up speak quickly or i will let them kill you hipolito gestured vaguely toward the two bells hanging in the tower behind take out the clappers then tie him the womans voice came again now in ingles the rest of you ready the lanterns the dugout canoes had already been launched bobbing alongside the two frigates anchored on the sea side of the cayo de carena directly ahead of them lay the point overlooking the entry to jamaica bay katherine felt the gold inlay of the muskets barrel cold and hard against her fingertips and tried to still her pulse as she peered through the dim moonlight up the companionway on the quarterdeck winston was deep in a final parlay with guy bartholomew of the swiftsure like all the seamen they kept casting anxious glances toward a spot on the shore across the bay just below the vigia where the advance party would signal the allclear with lanterns the last month had not been an easy time after the death of jacques le basque tortuga was plunged into turmoil for a fortnight with the english and french boucaniers at basse terre quarreling violently over the islands future there had nearly been war finally bartholomew and almost a hundred and fifty seamen had elected to join winston in his attempt to seize a new english privateering base at jamaica but they also demanded the right to hold villa de la vega for ransom as jackson had done so many years before it was the dream of riches that appealed to them most every man suddenly fancying himself a second croesus finally winston and bartholomew had drawn up articles specifying the division of spoils in the tradition of the boucaniers after that two more weeks had passed in final preparations as muskets and kegs of powder were stockpiled to have sufficient landing craft they had bartered butts of killdevil with the cowkillers on hispaniola for ten wide dugout canoesall over six feet across and able to transport fifteen to twenty men with the dugouts aboard and lashed securely along the main deck of the two ships the assault was ready they set sail as a flurry of rumors from other islands began reaching the buccaneer stronghold the most disquieting was that a french fleet of armed warships had already been dispatched south by the chevalier de poncy of st christopher who intended to restore his dominion over tortuga and appoint a new french commandant de place yet another story spreading among the spanish planters on hispaniola was that an english armada had tried to invade the city of santo domingo on the southern coast but was repulsed ingloriously with hundreds lost the story of the french fleet further alarmed the english buccaneers and almost two dozen more offered to join the jamaica expedition the spanish tale of a failed assault on santo domingo was quickly dismissed it was merely another in a long history of excuses put forward by the audiencia of that city to explain its failure to attack tortuga there would never have been a better time to storm the island but once again the cowardly spaniards had managed to find a reason for allowing the boucaniers to go unmolested claiming all their forces were needed to defend the capital the morning of their departure arrived brisk and clear and by midafternoon they had already made cape nicholao at the northwest tip of hispaniola since the windward passage lay just ahead they shortened sail holding their course west by southwest till dark when they elected to heaveto and wait for morning lest they overshoot at dawn they were back underway and just before nightfall as planned they had sighted point morant on the eastern tip of jamaica winston ordered the first stage of the assault to commence the frigates made way along the southern coast till they neared the point of the cayo de carena the wide cay at the entry to jamaica bay then while the swiftsure kept station to watch for any turtling craft that might sound the alarm winston hoisted the defiances new sails and headed on past the point directly along the coast the attack plan called for an advance party to proceed overland from the rear and surprise the vigia on the hill overlooking the bay using a map prepared by their spanish pilot armando vargas winston appointed atiba to lead the men serina went with them as translator they had gone ashore two hours before midnight giving them four hours to secure the vigia before the attack was launched a signal of three lanterns on the shore below the vigia would signify allclear after they had disappeared up the trail and into the salt savannah the defiance rejoined the swiftsure at which time winston ordered the focsle unlocked and flintlocks distributed together with bandoliers of powder and shot while the men checked and primed their muskets winston ordered extra barrels of powder and shot loaded into the dugouts along with pikes and halfpikes now the men stirred impatiently on the decks new flintlocks glistening in the moonlight anxious for their first feel of spanish gold katherine pushed through the crowd and headed up the companionway toward the quarterdeck winston had just dismissed bartholomew sending him back to the swiftsure to oversee final assignments of his own men and arms the old boucanier was still chuckling over something winston had said as she met him on the companionway see you take care with that musket now mlady he doffed his dark hat with a wink as he stepped past shes apt to go off when youd least expect she smiled and nodded then smoothly drew back the hammer on the breech with an ominous click as she looked up then tell me guy is this what makes it fire gods blood mlady bartholomew scurried quickly past then glanced uncertainly over his shoulder as he slid across the bannister and started down the swaying rope ladder headed for the shallop moored below hugh how long do you expect before the signal itd best be soon if not we wont have time to cross the bay before daylight he peered through the dark toward the hill weve got to clear the harbor and reach the mouth of the rio cobre while its still dark or theyll see us from the passage fort how far up the river is the fort vargas claims its only about a quarter mile he glanced back toward the hill but once we make the river their cannon wont be able to touch us its only when were exposed crossing the bay that we need worry what about the militia there when we try to storm it vargas claims that if theyre not expecting trouble itll be lightly manned after we take it well have their cannon together with the ordnance weve already got theres nothing else on the island save a few matchlock muskets and their cavalry all theyll have is lances or pikes he slipped his arm around her waist no katy after we seize passage fort the spaniards can never get us out of here from land or sea jamaica will be ours because this harbor will belong to us you make it sound too easy by half she leaned against him wishing she could fully share his confidence but if we do manage to take the fort what about villa de la vega the townll have to surrender sooner or later theyll have no harbor and this island cant survive without one she sighed and glanced back toward the shore in the moonlight the blue mountains of jamaica towered silently above the bay would those mountains some day stand for freedom in the caribbean the way tortuga once did she sensed winstons body tense and glanced up he was gazing across the bay toward the shore where a dim light had suddenly appeared then another and another katy ive waited a long long time for this thinking about it planning it all along i always figured id be doing it alone but your being here he seemed to lose the words as he held her against him tonight were about to do something together thatll change the americas forever the oars bit into the swell and the dark waters of the bay slapped against the barkcovered prow an ancient cadence he remembered from that long voyage north ten years past where had all the years gone behind him was a line of dugouts a deadly procession of armed grimfaced seamen all men of tortuga not one among them still welcome in any english french or dutch settlement was it possible to start over with men like these a new nation mira vargas whispered over the rhythm of the oars his dark eyes were glistening as he pointed toward the entry to the harbor a wide strait that lay between the point of the cayo de carena and the mainland around them the light surf sparkled in the moonlight is not this puerto the finest in all the caribbean he smiled back at winston showing a row of tobaccostained teeth no storm reaches here the smallest craft can anchor safely even in a huracan its just like i figured so the spot to situate our cannon really is right there on the point do that and nobody could ever get into the bay vargas laughed si that is true if they had guns here we could never get past but jamaica is a poor island the passage fort over on the river has always been able to slow an assault long enough for them to empty the town then their women and children are safe what else do they have worth stealing hugh is this the location you were talking to john about katherine was studying the wide and sandy point the very place thats why i had him stay with the defiance and keep some of the lads i hope he can do it hell wait till sunup till after we take the fort but this cay is the place to be mark it you are right senor vargas continued as they steered on around the point i have often wondered myself why there was no port city out here perhaps it is because this island has nothing but stupid agricultores their tiny armada of dugouts glided quickly across the strait then hugged the shore headed toward the mouth of the rio cobre now they were directly under the vigia as they rowed past five figures suddenly emerged from the trees and began wading toward them winston immediately signaled the dugouts to put in atiba was grinning as he hoisted himself over the side it was simple he settled among the seamen there were only two whoreson spaniards wheres serina katherine scanned the empty shoreline did anything happen when a woman is allowed to sit in council with warriors there are always damnable complications atiba reached and helped one of the english seamen in she would not have us act as men and kill the whoresons both so she is still up there on the mountain holding a musket youre not a better man if you murder their militia katherine scowled at him after you take a place you only need hold it that is the weak way of a woman senhora he glanced toward the hill as again their oars flashed in the moonlight it is not the warrior way winston grimaced but said nothing knowing the killing could be far from over in only minutes they had skirted the bay and were approaching the river mouth as their dugouts veered into the rio cobre the whitecaps gave way to placid ripples the tide had just begun running out and the surface of the water was flawless reflecting back the halfmoon now they were surrounded by palms and beyond dense forests since the rainy season was past the river itself had grown shallow with wide sand bars to navigate but a quarter mile farther and they would be beneath the fort jamaica at last winston grinned and dipped a hand into the cool river katherine gazed up at the passage fort now a sharp silhouette in the moonlight it had turrets at each corner and a wide breastwork from which a row of eighteenpound culverin projected hard fingers against the sky i just pray our welcome celebration isnt too well attended as they rowed slowly up the river the first traces of dawn were beginning to show in the east she realized their attack would have to come quickly now even though the vigia had been silenced sentries would doubtless be posted around the fort there still could be a bloody fight with small arms if they were spotted in time for the spaniards to martial the militia inside let one sentry sound the alarm and all surprise would be lost i think wed best beach somewhere along here bartholomew was sounding with an oar the river was growing increasingly sandy and shallow shes down to no moren half a fathom besides that its starting to get light now winston nodded concurrence much farther and they might spy us signal the lads behind to put in aye he turned and motioned with his oar quickly and silently the dugouts veered into the banks and the men began climbing over the sides as they waded through the mud each carrying a flintlock musket and a pike they dragged the dugouts ashore and into the brush all right masters winston walked down the line as they began to form ranks we want to try taking this place without alerting the whole island if we can do that then the spaniardsll not have time to evacuate the town remember anything we take in either place will be divided according to the articles drawn any man who doesnt share what he finds will be judged by the rest and may god have mercy on him he turned and gazed up the hill there was a single trail leading through the forest so look lively masters lets make quick work of this as they headed up the incline the men carefully holding their bandoliers to prevent rattling they could clearly see the fort above the trees now lights began to flicker along the front of the breastwork torches next excited voices began to filter down faint in the morning air armando vargas had moved alongside winston his eyes narrow beneath his helmet and his weathered face grim he listened a moment longer then whispered i fear something may have gone wrong senor what are they saying winston was checking the prime on his pistols i think i hear orders to run out the cannon he paused to listen could they have spotted our masts over at the cayo it is getting light now or perhaps an alert was sounded by the vigia after all he glared pointedly back toward atiba perhaps it was not so secure as we were told behind them the seamen had begun readying their flintlocks though they appeared disorganized they handled their muskets with practiced ease they were not raw recruits like barbados militia these were fighting men with long experience they continued quickly and silently up the path now the moon had begun to grow pale with the approach of day and as they neared the rear of the fortress they could see the details of its stonework the outside walls were only slightly higher than a mans head easy enough to scale with grapples if need be as they emerged at the edge of the clearing winston suddenly realized that the heavy wooden door at the rear of the fort was already ajar good christ we can just walk in he turned and signaled for the men to group its time masters vargas thinks they may have spotted our masts over at the point and started to ready the guns his voice was just above a whisper in any case well need to move fast ill lead with my lads after were inside the rest of you hit it with a second wave well rush the sentries then take any guards after that well attend to the gunners who like as not wont be armed suddenly more shouts from inside the fort drifted across the clearing vargas motioned for quiet then glanced at winston i hear one of them saying that they must send for the cavalry why he paused i dont know what is happening but they are very frightened in there senor good god if they get word back to the town its the end of any booty hugh i dont like this katherine stared toward the fortress there were no guards to be seen no sentries everyone was inside shouting maybe its some kind of ruse something has gone terribly wrong to tell the truth i dont like it either he cocked his pistol and motioned the men forward lets take it masters some fifty yards separated them from the open door as they began their dash forward across the clearing now they could hear the sound of cannon trucks rolling over paving stone as the guns were being set only a few more feet remained would the door stay open why had there been no musket fire as winston bounded up the stone steps leading to the door hewn oak with iron brackets still no alarm rose up only shouts from the direction of the cannon at the front of the breastwork he seized the handle and heaved it wide then waved the others after him atiba was already at his side cutlass drawn now they were racing down the dark stone corridor a gothic arch above their heads its racks of muskets untouched my god he thought theyre not even going to be armed only a few feet more a deafening explosion sounded from the front then a second and a third black smoke boiled up as a yell arose from the direction of the cannon the guns of the fort had been fired when they emerged at the end of the corridor and into the smoky yard spanish militiamen were already rolling back the ordnance to reload the gunners froze and looked on dumbfounded ingles demonio one of them suddenly found his voice and yelled out then threw himself face down on the paving stones one after another all the others followed in moments only one man remained standing a tall officer in a silver helmet winston realized he must be the gunnery commander he drew his sword a long toledosteel blade and stood defiantly facing winston and the line of musketmen no winston waved his pistol its no use the commander paused then stepped back and cursed his prostrate militiamen finally with a look of infinite humiliation he slowly slipped the sword back into its scabbard a cheer went up from the seamen and several turned to head for the inner chambers of the fortress to start the search for booty now the second wave of the attack force was pouring through the corridor katy its over winston beckoned her to him and and boxed ceremoniously jamaica is the yard erupted as the copestone of the turret at the corner exploded raining chips of hard limestone around them great god were taking fire from down below he stood a moment in disbelief around him startled seamen began to scurry for cover even as he spoke another round of cannon shot slammed into the front of the breastwork shaking the flagstone under their feet who the hells in charge down there there were no orders to fire on the fort another round of cannon shot crashed into the stone facing above them masters take cover therell be hell to pay for this i promise you he suddenly recalled that mewes had been left in command down below if johns ordered the ships into the bay and opened fire ill skin him alive aye and with this commotion ill wager their damned cavalry lancers will be on their way soon enough to give us a welcome bartholomew was standing alongside him id say wed best secure that door back there and make ready to stand them off order it done winston moved past the gunners and headed toward the front of the breastwork katherine at his side as they approached the spanish commander he backed away then bowed nervously and addressed them in broken english you may receive my sword senor in return for the lives of my men i am capitan juan vicente de padilla and i offer you unconditional surrender please run up your flag and signal your gunships weve got no flag winston stared at him yet but we will soon enough what do you mean mi capitan you are ingles his dark eyes acquired a puzzled expression of course you have a flag it is the one on your ships down in the bay hugh whats he talking about has john run up english colors katherine strode quickly past the smoking cannon to the edge of the breastwork and leaned over the side below the bay was lightening in the early dawn she stood a moment then turned back and motioned winston to join her her face was in shock he shoved his pistol into his belt and walked to her side headed across the bay guns run out was a long line of warships nearest the shore and already launching longboats of roundhead infantry were the rainbowe and the marsten moor the red and white cross of st george fluttering from their mizzenmasts chapter twentythree heaven help us to think the lord protectors proud western design has been reduced to assaulting this worthless backwater edmond calverts voice trailed off gloomily as he examined the bluegreen mountains of jamaica then he turned to face colonel richard morris standing beside him on the quarterdeck no silver mines no plantations doubtless nothing save wild hogs and crocodiles well sir at least this time the navy has landed my men where wed planned morris was studying the passage fort that loomed above them amidships moored longboats were being loaded with helmeted infantry muskets at the ready their culverin seem to have quieted if the towns no better defended there should be scant difficulty making this place ours that sir was precisely what you were saying when we first sighted santo domingo scarcely more than a fortnight pastbefore those craven stalwarts youd call an army were chased back into the sea morris eyes narrowed when the accounting for hispaniola is finishd sir that debacle will be credited to the incompetence of the english navy all the same youd best take your stouthearted band of cowards and see what you can manage here calvert dismissed the commander with a perfunctory salute rancor no longer served any end what was lost was lost what had been forfeited he knew was englands best chance ever to seize a portion of spains vast new world wealth oliver cromwells ambitious western design had foundered hopelessly on the sunscorched shores of hispaniola he reflected again on the confident instructions in his secret commission authorized by the lord protector himself and approved by his new council of state only four months earlier the western design of his highness is intended to gain for england that part of the west indies now in the possession of the spaniard for the effecting thereof we shall communicate to you what hath been under our consideration your first objective is to seize certain of the spaniards islands and particularly hispaniola said island hath no considerable place in the south part thereof but the city of santo domingo and that not being heavily fortified may doubtless be possest without much difficulty which being done that whole island will be brought under obedience from thence after your landing there send force for the taking of havana which lies in the island of cuba which is the back door of the west indies and will obstruct the passing of the spaniards plate fleet into europe having secured these islands proceed immediately to cartegena which we would make the seat of the intended design and from which england will be master of the spaniards treasure which comes from peru by the way of panama in the south seas to porto bello or nombre de dios in the north sea how presumptuous it all seemed from this vantage worse still the council of state had not even bothered taking notice of jamaica an underdefended wilderness now their only chance to seize anything held by the spaniards most depressing of all cromwell would surely be loath to spend a shilling on the men and arms needed to hold such a dubious prize meaning the spaniards would simply come and reclaim it the minute the fleet set sail surely he told himself cromwell was aware they had shipped out without nearly enough trained men to attack spanish holdings even his council of state realized as much but they had nourished the delusion that once barbados was bludgeoned back into the commonwealth its planters would dutifully offer up whatever firstrate men arms and cavalry were needed for the campaign what the council of state had not conceived was how indifferent those islanders would be to the territorial ambitions of oliver cromwell barbados planters it turned out wanted nothing to do with a conquest of the spanish americas to them more englishheld lands in the new world only meant the likelihood of more acres planted in sugar one day to compete with the trade they hoped to monopolize consequently morris barbados recruits consisted almost wholly of runaway indentures eluding their owners and their creditors a collection of profane debauched rogues whose only boldness lay in doing mischief sugar and slaves they might well have undermined barbados brief try for independence but they also meant there would be no more english lands in the americas calverts heart grew heavy as he remembered how their careful strategy for taking hispaniola had been wrecked they had decided to avoid the uncharted harbor of santo domingo and land five miles down the coast but by a mischance of wind on their stern it was thirty then morris had disembarked his troops with scarcely any water or victuals all the first day however he had marched unopposed his puritan infantrymen even pausing to vandalize papist churches along the way using idols of the virgin for musket practice the spaniards however had a plan of their own they had been busy burning all the savannahs farther ahead to drive away the cattle leaving a path of scorched ground soon morris supplies were exhausted and hunger began to set in whereupon his infantry started stealing the horses of the cavalry roasting and devouring them so ravenously the spaniards reportedly thought horsemeat must be some kind of english delicacy then came another catastrophe for sport the army burned some thatched huts belonging to hispaniolas notorious cow killers soon a gang of vengeful hunters had massed in the woods along the armys path and begun sniping with their longbarrelled muskets after that whenever fireflies appeared in the evenings the english sentries never before having seen such creatures mistook them for the burning matchcord of the cowkillers muskets and began firing into the night causing general panic and men trampled to death in flight also the rattling claws of the nightforaging caribbean land crabs would sound to the nervous english infantry like the clank of the cowkillers bandoliers an alarm would raisethe cowkillersand soldiers would run blindly into the forests and deadly swamps trying to flee when they finally reached santo domingo morris and his demoralized men gamely tried to rush and scale the walls whereupon the spaniards simply fired down with cannon and slew hundreds driven back morris claimed his retreat was merely tactical but when he tried again the spanish cavalry rode out and lanced countless more in a general rout only turning back when they tired of killing it was the most humiliating defeat any english army had ever receivedsuffered at the hands of the supposedly craven spaniards and the wandering cowkillers of hispaniola back at sea they realized the foolhardiness of an attempt on havana or cartegena so the choice they were confronted with was to return to england emptyhanded and face cromwells outrage or perhaps try some easier spanish prize that was when they hit on the idea of jamaicaadmittedly a smaller island than hispaniola and of scant consequence to spain but a place known for its slight defenses they immediately weighed anchor and made sail for jamaica bay well sir i take it the shootings over for now mayhaps this time your rabble army will see fit to stand and fight like englishmen edging his way cautiously up the smoky companionway in black hat and cotton doublet was one of the few barbados planters who had offered to join the expedition he glanced at the sunlit fortress then stared at the green hills beyond though from the looks of the place id judge its scarcely worth the waste of a round of shot twould seem to be damnd near as wild as barbados the day i first set foot on her i think colonel morris knows his duty sir calverts tone grew official and i presume some of this land could readily be put into cultivation why calvert puzzled had the planter come hed not offered to assist the infantry no most probably he volunteered in hopes of commandeering the choicest spanish plantations on hispaniola all for himself or perhaps he merely couldnt countenance the thought hed been denied a seat on barbados new council yes that was more likely the case why else would a sugar grower as notoriously successful as benjamin briggs have decided to come with them cultivation briggs turned on him i see you know little enough about running a plantation sir wheres the labor youd need perhaps some of these infantry will choose to stay and settle with the spaniards all about this islands going to require this set of layabouts i doubt one in a hundred could tell a cassava root from a yam assuming he had the industry to hoe one up briggs moved to the railing and surveyed the wide plain spreading up from the harbor this batchd not be worth tuppence the dozen for clearing stumps and planting but he found himself thinking maybe things would be different if you went about it properly and brought in some africans enough strapping blacks and some of these savannahs might well be set to production and if not along here then maybe upland the hills look as green as barbados was thirty years ago could it be i was wise to come after all damn hispaniola this place could be the ideal spot to prove what ive always believed aye he told himself barbados showed theres a fortune to be made with sugar but whats really called for is land lots of it and half the good plots therere still held by damnd tenacre freeholders the new world is the place where a man has to think in larger terms so what if i sold off those barbados acres packed up the sugar mill and brought it here cut a deal with the dutchmen for a string of quality nigers on long credit all we need do is send these few spaniards packing and this island could well be a gold mine if youll pardon me mister briggs ill have to be going ashore now calvert nodded then turned for the companionway as you will sir briggs glanced back at the island and if its all the same i think ill be joining you to take the measure of this fish weve snagged and see what weve got you might do better to wait mister briggs till weve gained a clear surrender from the spaniards well sir i dont see any spaniards lurking about there on the plain he headed down the companionway after calvert im the civilian here which means ive got responsibilities of my own hugh are we going to just stand here and let these bastards rob us katherine was angrily gripping her musket we took this fort not morris and his roundheads winston stood staring at the warships his mind churning why the hell were they here cromwell had better things to do with his navy than harass a few spanish planters whatever they want he vowed to himself theyll damn well have to fight for it tis the most cursed sight i eer laid eyes on guy bartholomew had moved beside them mayhaps that rumor about some fleet trying santo domingo was all too true an when they faild at that they decided to pillage jamaica instead next to him was timothy farrell spouting irish oaths down on the ships aye by the holy virgin but whatever happend ill wager you thisits the last were like to see of any ransom for the town his eyes were desolate the damnd englishll be havin it all theyve never heard of dividing a thing fair and square that i promise you well they cant squeeze a town thats empty winston turned to bartholomew so why dont we start by giving this navy a little token of our thanks set these spaniards free to go back and help clear out villa de la vega by the time the damnd roundheads get there therell be nothing to find save empty huts well sir its a thought ill grant you else we could try and get over there first ourselves to see if theres any gold left to be had these spaniards romanish churches are usually good for a few trinkets the boucanier looked down again a line of longboats was now edging across the bay below headed for the shore beneath the fort he glanced back at his men what say you lads theres no point to it capn as im a christian one of the grizzled boucaniers behind him spoke up therere lads here aplenty whove sailed for the english navy in their time an im one of em you can be sure wed never get past those frigates with any spanish gold all wed get is a rope if we tried riflin the town now or holdin it for ransom when an honest tar borrows a brass watch fob hes hangd for theft when the generals steal a whole country its called the spoils of war no sir ive had all the acquaintance i expect to with socalled english law i warrant the best thing we can do now is try getting out of here whilst we can and let the whoresons have what they came to find we took this place once by god and we can well do it again there was a murmur of concurrence from the others some experienced seamen were already eyeing the stone corridor reflecting on the english navys frequent practice of impressing any ablebodied man within reach whenever it needed replacements well sir theres some merit in what you say bartholomew nodded thoughtfully maybe the wisest course right now is to try and get some canvas on our brigs before this navy starts to nose about our anchorage over at the other side of the cayo thats the best make nae mistake the scotsman macewen interjected nervously an if these spaniards care to trouble keeping the damnd roundheads entertained whilst were doin it then id gladly hand them back every gunner here with a skein of matchcord in the trade whatevers in the town can be damnd then its done winston motioned for the spanish commander captain juan vicente de padilla advanced hesitantly renewed alarm in his dark eyes do you wish to receive my sword now capitan no you can keep it and get the hell out of here go on back to villa de la vega and let your governor know the english navys invaded capitan i do not understand your meaning he stood puzzling your speech is ingles but you are not part of those galeones down below were not english and i can promise you this island hasnt heard the last of us winston thumbed toward the corridor now youd best be out of here i dont know how long those roundheads expect to tarry with a bow of supreme relief captain de padilla turned and summoned his men in moments the spanish gunners were jostling toward the corridor each wanting to be the first to evacuate his family and wealth from villa de la vega in gods name hugh dont tell me youre thinking to just hand over this fort katherine was still watching the shore below where infantrymen were now forming ranks to begin marching up the slope i for one intend to stand and fight as long as theres powder and shot dont worry weve got the heavy guns and their damned warships are under them he signaled to tom canninge master gunner of the defiance have the boys prime and run out these culverin we need to be ready good as done canninge shouted an order and his men hurriedly began hauling the tackles left lying on the stone pavement by the spanish gunners rolling back the iron cannon to reload by now the infantry had begun advancing up the hill winston watched them long enough through the sparse trees to recognize richard morris at their head so we meet again you roundhead bastard but this time start out holding the ordnance masters cover us with your muskets he motioned for katherine and together they started for the corridor the hallway had grown lighter now a pale gold in the early light of dawn at the far end the heavy oak door had been left ajar by the departing spanish gunners as they stepped into the sunshine atiba suddenly appeared beside them concern on his face senhor i think it is no longer safe at the damnable vigia on the hill i must go back up there now all right winston waved him on but see youre quick on it i am a man of the mountains when i wish i can travel faster than a spaniard with a horse he began to sprint across the clearing headed for the trees katy hang on to this winston drew one of the pistols from his belt and handed it to her well talk first but if we have to shoot the main thing is to bring down morris that ought to scatter them as they rounded the corner of the fort colonel richard morris emerged through the trees opposite leading a column of infantry the commander froze when he saw them he was raising his musket preparing to give order to fire when his face softened into a disbelieving grin gods blood nobody told me youd decided to join up with this assault he examined them a moment longer then glanced up at the breastwork where a line of seamen had appeared holding flintlocks he stared a moment in confusion before looking back at winston i suppose congratulations are in order we had no idea twas you and your men whod silenced their guns youve doubtless saved us a hot ordnance battle bloody fine job i must say he lowered his musket and strode warily forward what have you done with all the spaniards theyre gone now winstons hand was on the pistol in his belt then the place is ours morris turned and motioned the infantrymen forward damned odd i didnt notice your frigate in amongst our sail we couldve used you at hispaniola he tried to smile id say sir that an extra months pay for you and your lads is in order even though i take it you joined us late ill see to it myself you can save your eighteen shillings colonel we plan to hold this fort and maybe the island to go with it but youre free to rifle the town if you think you can still find anything you plan to hold what sir morris took a cautious step backward where youre standing its called jamaica we got here first and we intend to keep however much of it strikes our fancy well sir thats most irregular i see youve still got all the brass i recall he gripped the barrel of his musket ive already offered you a bonus for exceptional valor but if youre thinking now to try and rebel against my command here what youre more likely to earn is a rope around your neck winston turned and yelled up to canninge tom ready the guns and when i give the order lay a few rounds across the quarterdeck of the rainbowe anchored down there maybe itll encourage colonel morris to reexamine the situation good god morris paled is this some kind of jest you can take whatever you want from the spaniards but this harbors mine that is if youd prefer keeping cromwells flagship afloat this harbor thats right were keeping the harbor and this fortress till such time as we come to an understanding while morris stared up again at the row of cannon behind him the last contingent of infantry began to emerge through the trees leading it was admiral edmond calvert and beside him strode a heavyset man in a wide dark hat they moved through the row of silverhelmeted infantrymen who parted deferentially for the admiral headed toward morris they were halfway across the clearing before benjamin briggs noticed katherine and winston what in the name of hell he stopped abruptly have the both of you come back to be hanged like you merit id take care what you say master briggs winston looked down the slope my lads up there might mistake your good humor briggs glanced up uncertainly at the breastwork then back id like to know what lawless undertaking it is brings you two to this forsaken place you might try answering the same question im here to look to english interests i assume that means your personal interests so were probably here for much the same reason i take it you two gentlemen are previously acquainted calvert moved cautiously forward whatever your past cordiality therell be ample time to manage the disposition of this place after its ours were dividing the skin before weve caught the fox besides its the lord protector wholl there was a shout from the breastwork above and calvert paused to look up tom canninge was standing beside one of the grey iron culverin waving down at winston capn theres a mass of horsemen coming up the road from the town are they looking to counterattack the gunner paused and studied the road from here id say not theyre travelin slow more just walkin their mounts an therere a few blacks with them who look to be carry in some kind of hammock now morris was gazing warily down the road toward villa de la vega he consulted briefly with calvert then ordered his men to take cover in the scattering of trees across the clearing coming toward them was a row of spanish horsemen with long lances and silvertrimmed saddles their mounts prancing deferentially behind a slowmoving cluster of men all attired in the latest seville finery in the lead was an open litter shaded from the sun by a velvet awning with the poles at each of its four corners held shoulder high by an aged negro wearing a blue silk loincloth katherine heard a rustle at her elbow and turned to see the admiral bowing edmond calvert madam your servant he quickly glanced again at the spanish before continuing colonel morris just advised me you are dalby bedfords daughter please allow me to offer my condolences she nodded lightly and said nothing merely tightening her grip on the pistol she held calvert examined her a moment then addressed winston and im told that you sir were gunnery commander for barbados winston inspected him in silence calvert cleared his throat well sir if thats indeed who you are i most certainly have cause to know you for a firstrate seaman i take it you somehow managed to outsail the gloucester he continued guardedly you were a wanted man then but after whats happened today i think allowances can be made in truth id like to offer you a commission here and now if youd care to serve under me accept my thanks but im not looking for recruitment winston nodded then turned back to study the approaching cavalry the commission i plan to take is right here and thats the two of us miss bedford and i expect to make jamaica home base calvert smiled as he continued well sir if youre thinking now you want to stay therell surely be a place for you here ill take odds the spaniards are not going to let us commandeer this island without soon posting a fleet to try and recover it which means weve got to look to some defenses right away possibly move a few of the culverin from the rainbowe and marsten moor up here to the breastwork theres plenty to what are you saying katherine stared at him that youre going to try and hold jamaica for england he sobered i agree with you itll not be an easy task madam but we expect to do our best i give you my solemn word yes indeed and if you and the men with you care to assist us i will so recommend it to his highness i fear well be wanting experienced gunners here and soon while katherine stood speechless benjamin briggs edged next to them and whispered toward calvert admiral you dont suppose wed best look to our defenses till weve found out what these damnd spaniards are about this can only be one thing mister briggs some kind of attempt to try and negotiate calvert examined the procession again as it neared the edge of the clearing not even spaniards attack from a palanquin now the approaching file was slowing to a halt while the horsemen reined in to wait in the sunshine one of the men who had been walking alongside the litter began to converse solemnly with a shadowed figure beneath its awning finally he reached in and received a long silkwrapped bundle then stepped around the bearers and headed toward them he was wearing a velvet waistcoat and plumed hat and as he approached the four figures standing by the breastwork he appeared momentarily disoriented his olive skin looked sallow in the early light and his heavy moustache drooped finally he stopped a few feet away and addressed them collectively i am antonio de medina lieutenantgeneral to our governor don francisco de castilla who has come to meet you he regrets that his indisposition does not permit him to tender you his sword from his own hand he paused and glanced back at the litter an arm emerged feebly and waved him on his excellency has been fully advised of the situation and he is here personally to enquire your business if it is ransom you wish to claim he would have me remind you we are but a poor people possessing little wealth save our honesty and good name i am admiral edmond calvert and i receive his greeting in the name of englands lord protector calvert was studying the shrouded litter with puzzlement furthermore you may advise don francisco de castilla that weve not come for ransom were here to claim this island in the name of his highness oliver cromwell for england senor i do not understand medinas brow wrinkled ingles galeones such as yours have come in times past and we have always raised the ransom they required no matter how difficult for us we will this time sir its going to be a different arrangement briggs stepped forward hes telling you were here to stay pass that along to your governor but you cannot just claim this island senor medina examined briggs with disbelief it has belonged to spain for a hundred and forty years wheres your bill of sale by god we say it belongs to whoevers got the brass to seize hold of it spaniards took half the americas from the heathen now its englands turn but this island was granted to our king by his holiness the pope in rome aye your popes ever been free to dispense lands he never owned in the first place briggs smiled broadly i seem to recall back in king harrys time he offered england to anybody whod invade us but none of your papist kings troubled to take up his gift he sobered this islands english as of today and damned to your purple whore of rome senor protestante blasphemies will not take care master briggs winstons voice cut between them dont be so quick to assume england has it at the moment it looks like this fortress belongs to me and my men well sir if youre thinking to try and steal something from this place which now belongs to england id be pleased to hear how you expect to manage it i dont care to steal a thing ive already got what i want while weve been talking my lads down on the defiance were offloading culverin there at the cayo de carena on the point as of now any bottom that tries to enter or leave this harbor is going to have to sail under them so the harbors mine including whats in it at the moment not to mention this fort as well perhaps youd best tell me what you have in mind sir calvert glanced up at the breastwork its iron cannon now all directed on the anchored ships below we might consider an arrangement winston paused then looked down at the bay what do you mean these men sailing with me are boucaniers cowkillers to you and we need this harbor in future we intend sailing from jamaica from right over there at the point therell be a freeport there for anybody who wants to join with us are you saying you mean to settle down there on the point with these buccaneers calvert was trying to comprehend what he was hearing could it be that along with jamaica cromwell was going to get armed ships manned by the only men in the caribbean feared by the spaniards for nothing perhaps it might even mean jamaica could be kept the western design might end up with something after all well sir in truth this islands going to be needing all the fighting men it can muster if its to defend itself from the spaniards calvert turned to briggs if these buccaneers of his want to headquarter here it could well be a godsend youd countenance turning over the safety of this place to a band of rogues briggs face began to grow dark with a realization hold a minute sir are you meanin to suggest cromwell wont trouble providing this island with naval protection his highness will doubtless act in what he considers to be englands best interest mister briggs but i fear hell not be too anxious to expend revenues fortifying and patrolling an empty spanish island i wouldnt expect to see the english navy around here if thats what youre thinking but this islands got to have defenses its not the same as barbados over there we were hundreds of leagues to windward and the spaniards never cared about it in the first place but jamaicas different its right on the windward passage youve got to keep an armed fleet and some fortifications here or the spaniardsll just come and take the place back whenever they have a mind then youd best start thinking about how youd plan to arrange for it calvert turned back to medina kindly advise his excellency i wish to speak with him directly the lieutenantgeneral bowed and nervously returned to the litter after consulting inside for a moment he ordered the bearers to move it forward what they saw was a small shriveled man bald and all but consumed with venereal pox he carefully shaded his yellow eyes from the morning sun as he peered out as i have said excellency we are pleased to acknowledge your welcome calvert addressed him for the time we will abstain from sacking villa de la vega in return for which courtesy you will immediately supply our fleet with three hundred head of fat cattle for feeding our men together with cassava bread and other comestibles as we may require after a quick exchange medina looked back troubled his excellency replies he has no choice but to comply fine but im not quite finished be it also known without any mistaking that we have hereby taken charge of the island of jamaica i expect to send you the terms to sign tomorrow morning officially surrendering it to england winston stepped forward and faced medina you can also advise his excellency therell be another item in the terms those slaves standing there and all others on the island are going to be made free men senor all the negros on this island have already been set free by his excellencys proclamation this very morning to help us resist do you think we are fools our negros are catolico they and our maroons will stand with us if we have to drive you protestante heretics from this island maroons calvert studied him si that is the name of the free negros who live here in the mountains he approached calvert and know this ingles they are no longer alone the king of spain will not let you steal this island and we will not either even now our people in villa de la vega have taken all their belongings and left for the mountains also we will wage war on you from there forever if need be you may try to steal this island against the laws of god but if you do our people will empty their hatos and drive their cattle into the hills your army will starve this island will become your coffin we promise you that remains to be seen sir calvert inspected him coldly if you dont choose to honor our terms and provide meat for this army then well just take what we please then we bid you good day medina moved back to confer with the governor after a moment the bearers hoisted the litter turned and headed back down the road trailed by the prancing horses of the cavalry calvert watched unease in his eyes as they moved out in truth im beginning to fear this may turn out to be as bloody as hispaniola if these spaniards scorn our terms of surrender and take to the hills it could be years before jamaica is safe for english settlement behind them the infantrymen had begun to emerge from the woods across the clearing led by morris next guy bartholomew appeared around the side of the fortress his face strained and haggard in the morning light he watched puzzling as the spanish procession disappeared into the distance then turned to winston whats all the talk been about theres going to be a war here and soon and we dont want any part of it so right now wed best head back over to the point that spots going to be ours or hell will hear the reason why johns been offloading my culverin and he should have the guns in place by now we dont need these cannon any more get your lads and lets be gone id just as soon be out of here ill tell you that i dont fancy the looks of this sir not one bit with an exhale of relief bartholomew signaled up to the breastwork then headed back god be praised as winston waved him on he spotted atiba approaching across the clearing serina at his side the yoruba still had his cutlass at his waist and serina her white shift torn and stained from the underbrush was now carrying a spanish flintlock when she saw briggs she hesitated a second startled then advanced on him my damnd niger the planter abruptly recognized them and started to reach for his pistol the very one who tried to kill me then made off with my mulata serina lifted her musket and cocked it not missing a step leave your gun where it is master briggs unless you want me to kill you he is free now hes a damnd runaway briggs halted and i take it youre in with him now well ill not be having the two of you loose on this island that much i promise you serina strode directly to where he stood i am free now too her voice was unwavering you can never take me back if thats what you have come here to do well damnd well see about that i laid out good money for the both there are many free preto on this island to be black here does not mean i have to be slave it is not like an ingles settlement i have learned that already the spaniard at the vigia told me there is a free nation of my people here atiba had moved beside her gripping the handle of his cutlass i do not know why you have come whoreson branco but there will be war against you like there was on barbados if you ever try to enslave any of my peoples living in this place therell be slaves here and plenty sirrah no runaway black is going to tell an englishman how to manage his affairs aye therell be war you may depend on it till every runaway is hanged and quartered and that includes you in particular he was suddenly interrupted by a barrage of firing from the woods behind them and with a curse he whirled to stare from out of the trees a line of spanish militia was emerging together with a column of blacks all bearing muskets they wore tall helmets and knelt in ranks as they methodically began firing on the english infantry briggs paused a second then ducked and bolted hugh weve got to get out of here now katherine seized his arm and started to pull him into the shelter of the breastwork shouts rose up while helmets and breastplates jangled across the clearing as the english infantrymen began to scatter morris immediately cocked his musket and returned fire bringing down a spanish musketman then yelled for his men to find cover in moments the morning air had grown opaque with dark smoke as the infantry hurriedly retreated to the trees on the opposite side of the clearing and began piling up makeshift barricades of brush senhor i think the damnable war has already begun atiba yelled to winston as he followed serina around the corner of the breastwork that it has and i for one dont want any part of it he looked back katy what do you say we just take our people and get on down to the point let morris try and fight them over the rest she laughed coughing from the smoke they can all be damned im not even sure whose side i want to be on anymore while briggs and calvert huddled with morris behind the barricade being set up by the english infantrymen the four of them quickly made their way around the side of the fort out of the shooting bartholomew was waiting by the oak door the seamen crowded around now the fortress was smpty while a musket battle between the spanish and the english raged across the clearing on its opposite side ive told the lads he shouted above the din theyre iust as pleased to be out of here that ill warrant you now that weve lost all chance to surprise the town id say were ready to get back over to the point and see what it is weve managed to come up with good winston motioned them forward as he led them down the trail katherine at his side he felt a tug at his sleeve and turned to see atiba i think we will not be going with you my friend the yoruba was grim dara says if there is to be a war against the ingles branco here then we must join it this time i believe a womans counsel is wise youd get tangled up in this fray it could be a damnable long war i think perhaps much years but i would meet these free people of my blood these maroons but were going to take the harbor here you could i am not a man of the sea my friend my people are of the forest that is what i know and where i want to be and that is where i will fight the ingles as long as i have breath well see you take care this may get very bad winston studied him were headed down to the point youll always be welcome then i wish you fortune your path may not be easy either these damnable ingles may try to come and take it away from you if they do then they dont know what a battle is were going to make a free place here yet and mark it therell come a day when slaveholders like briggs will be a blot on the name of england and the americas all anybody will want to remember from these times will be the buccaneers that is a fine ambition he smiled then glanced down at serina i wonder what becomes of this island now with all of us on it i will tell you she shifted her musket we are going to bring these ingles to their knees someday they will come to us begging she reached up and kissed katherine then lightly touched winstons hand finally she prodded atiba forward and in moments they were gone through the trees hugh im not at all sure i like this katherine moved next to him as they continued on down the hill toward the dugouts bartholomew was ahead of them now leading the boucaniers i thought we were going to capture an island but all weve ended up with is just a piece of it a harbor and all these criminals katy what did you once say about thinking you could have it all i said id learned better that sometimes youve got to settle for whats possible she looked up at him but you know i wasnt the only one who had a dream maybe you wanted a different kind of independence but you had some pretty grand ideas all the same what i wanted was to take jamaica and make it a free place but after whats happened today nobodys going to get this island for a long long time she looked up to see the river coming into view through the trees a glittering ribbon in the early sun then why dont we just make something of what we have down there on the point for ourselves he slipped an arm around her and drew her against him shall we give it a try london report of the council of foreign plantations to the lords of trade of the privy council board concerning the condition of the americas with recommendations for furtherance of the interests of our merchants having described barbados virginia maryland and new england we will now address the condition of jamaica subsequent to the demise of the late and unlamented oliver cromwell and the restoration of his royal majesty charles stuart ii to the throne of england unlike barbados which now has black slaves and whose lands command three times the price of the most fertile acres in england the island of jamaica has yet to enjoy prosperous development for sugar although its production may someday be expected to surpass even that of barbados by virtue of its greater size it has ever been vexatious to govern and certain recommendations intended to ammend this condition are here set forth it is well remembered that after jamaica was seized from the spaniards the admiral and infantry commander who shall not be cruelly named here were both imprisoned in the tower by oliver cromwell as reward for their malfeasance in the western design furthermore the english infantry first garrisoned there soon proved themselves base slothful rogues who would neither dig nor plant and in short time many sought to defect to the spaniards for want of rations these same spaniards thereafter barbarously scattered their cattle reducing the english to eating dogs and snakes whereupon over twothirds eventually starved and died the spaniards did then repair to the mountains of that island with their negroes where together they waged war for many years against all english forces sent against them before at last retiring to live amongst their fellow papists on cuba after that time oliver cromwell made offer of free acres under the authority of his great seal to any protestant in england who would travel thither for purposes of settlement but to scant effect his appeal to new englanders to come and plant was in like manner scorned thus for many years jamaica has remained a great thorn in the side of england even so we believe that certain possibilities of this island may soon compensate the expense of maintaining it until now the reason may be taken as follows it has long been understood that the aspect of our american settlements most profitable to england is the trade they have engendered for our merchants foremost among the commodities required are laborers for their plantations a demand we are at last equippd to supply the royal african company in which his majesty king charles ii and all the court are fortunate subscribers has been formed and a string of english slaving fortresses has now been established on the guinea coast the company has thus far shipped africans to the americas of which a full survived to be marketed and its most recent yearly dividend to english subscribers was near to a prized coin of pure west african gold appropriately named the guinea has been authorized by his majesty to commemorate our success in this remunerative new business now that the assemblies of virginia and maryland happily have passed acts encouraging the usefulness of negro slaves in north america we may expect this trade to thrive abundantly in light of the fact that blacks on english plantations do commonly perish more readily than they breed furthermore the noblest plantation in the new world could well one day be the island of jamaica owing to its abundance of fertile acres if two conditions thwarting its full development can be addressed the first being a band of escaped blacks and mullatoes known to the spaniards as maroons who make bold to inhabit the mountains of said island as a godless separate nation having no moral sense and not respecting the laws and customs of civil nations they daily grow more insolent and threatening to the christian planters brazenly exhorting their own blacks to disobedience and revolt by their endeavors they have prevented many valuable tracts of land from being cultivated to the great prejudice of his majestys revenue all attempts to quell and reduce these blacks said to live as though still in africa with their own practices of worship have availed but little by virtue of their unassailable redoubts a condition happily not possible on the small island of barbados our records reveal that some pounds sterling have thus far been expended in fruitless efforts to bring them under submission yet they must be destroyed or brought in on some terms else they will remain a great discouragement to the settling of a people on the island it is now concluded that since all english regiments sent against them have failed to subdue these maroons who fall upon and kill any who go near their mountain strongholds efforts must be attempted in another direction accordingly we would instruct the governor of the island sir benjamin briggs to offer terms of treaty to their leader a heathenish black reported to be called by the name etiba whereby each nation may henceforth exist in harmony the other condition subverting full english control of the island is the town that thrives at the entrance to jamaica bay a place called cayo de carena by the spaniards and now known in honor of the restoration of his majesty as port royal said port scarcely upholds its name being beholden to none save whom it will it is home to those rovers of the sea calling themselves buccaneers a willful breed of men formerly of tortuga who are without religion or loyalty travelling whither they choose they daily wreak depredations upon the shipping of the spaniard taking piecesofeight in the tens of millions and have made the kingdom of the sea their only allegiance unlike our own failure to settle prosperous plantations on jamaica this port has enjoyed great success of a certain kind no city founded in the new world has grown more quickly than this place nor achieved a like degree of wealth it is now more populous than any english town in the americas save bostonand it has realized a position of importance equalled only by its infamous reputation in chase of the stolen spanish riches that daily pour in upon its streets merchants will pay more for footage along its front than in the heart of london having scarce supply of water its residents do drink mainly strong liquors and our census has shown there are not now resident in this port ten men to every tippling house with the greatest number of licenses we are advisd having been issued to a certain lewd woman once of barbados who has now repaired thither to the great advancement of her bawdy trade although this port has tarnished the name of england by its headquartering of these insolent buccaneers it is yet doubtful whether the island would still be in his majestys possession were it not for the fear they strike in the heart of the spaniards who would otherwise long since have reclaimed it the chiefest of these rovers an englishman known to all has wrought much ill upon the spaniards and on the hollanders during our recent war for which service to england and himself he is now conceived by his majesty as a gentleman of considerable parts though he has acted in diverse ways to obstruct our quelling of the islands meddlesome maroons accordingly his majesty has made known to the council his desire that we strive to enlist this buccaneers good offices in persuading his rovers including a notorious woman equally well known said to be his wife who doth also sail with these marauders to uphold english jurisdiction of the island and its port should this design fall out as desird his majesty has hopes that by setting as he would have it privately these knights of the blade in charge of his purse he can employ them to good effect in furtherance of this end it is his majestys pleasure that we in this coming year recall sir benjamin briggs whose honesty his majesty has oft thought problemmatical and make effort to induce this buccaneer to assume the post of governor of jamaica afterword in the foregoing i have attempted to distill the wine of history into something more like a brandy while still retaining as much authentic flavor as possible many of the episodes in the novel are fictionalized renderings of actual events albeit condensed and the majority of individuals depicted also were drawn from life the action spans several years from the first major slave auction on barbados thought to have occurred slightly before midcentury to the english seizure of jamaica in the structure of race and economics in englands caribbean colonies changed dramatically in those short years a social transformation on a scale quite unlike any other i can recall the execution of king charles and the barbados war of independence also took place during that crucial time all documents letters and broadsides cited here are essentially verbatim save the two directly involving hugh winston of the people there naturally were many more involved than a single novel could encompass hugh winston is a composite of various persons and viewpoints of that age such as thomas tryon ending of course with the famous buccaneer sir henry morgan later appointed governor of jamaica in recognition of his success pillaging spanish treasure governor dalby bedford is a combination of governor philip bell and his successor francis lord willoughby neither was actually killed in the barbados revolution the revolt collapsed when after defectors had welcomed parliaments forces ashore five days of rain immobilized the planters whereupon a stray english cannon ball knocked down the door of a plantation house where the islands militia commanders were gathered and laid out one of the sentries demoralizing them into surrender katherine bedford was inspired by governor bells wife in whome by reason of her quick and industrious spirit lay a great stroak of the government benjamin briggs is an embodiment of many early settlers his installation of the first sugar mill on the island and his construction of a walled compound for protection recall james drax and drax hall and his later career is not unlike that of thomas modyford a prosperous barbados planter who later became governor of jamaica anthony and jeremy walrond are vaguely reminiscent of the prominent royalists humphrey and george walrond edmond calvert was drawn for some portions of the story from sir george ayscue and for others from admiral william penn richard morris is a combination of captain william morris and general robert venables and james powlett recalls vice admiral michael pack most of the council and assembly members appearing here were actually in those bodies and my joan fuller is homage to a celebrated bridgetown brothel proprietor of the same name of them all i sincerely hope i have done most justice to her memory jacques le basque was modeled on various early boucaniersbeginning with pierre le grand the first to seize a spanish ship using dugouts and ending with the muchhated french buccaneerking le vasseur who built forte de la roche and its dovecote tibaut de fontenay was the latters nephew who murdered him much as described over the matter of a shared mistress although serina as mulatto bedwarmer to benjamin briggs had no specific prototype at that early time a condition soon to change much to the dismay of english wives at home atiba was inspired by a gold coast slave named coffe who led an unsuccessful revolt on barbados in the seventeenth century intending to establish a black nation along african lines as punishment he and several others were burned alive being chained at the stake when advised of his sentence he reportedly declared if you roast me today you cannot roast me tomorrow a contemporary broadside depicting the affair retailed briskly in london atibas subsequent career as a maroon leader with whom the english eventually were forced to negotiate also had various historical models including the fearsome cudjoe head of a warlike nation of free negroes still terrifying english planters on jamaica almost eighty years after it was seized very few physical artifacts survive from those years on barbados one can see drax hall on which briggs hall was closely modeled and little else on tortuga this writer chopped his way through the jungle and located the site of le vasseurs forte de la roche and dovecote a bit of digging uncovered some stonework of the forts outer wall but all that remained of the dovecote was a single plaster step almost three and a half centuries old once part of its lower staircase and now lodged in the gnarled root of a banyan tree growing against the huge rock atop which it was built on jamaica there seems to be nothing left save a few relics from the heyday of port royal only the people of those islands
