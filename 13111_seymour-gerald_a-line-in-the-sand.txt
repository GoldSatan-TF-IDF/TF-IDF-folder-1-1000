a line in the sand gerald seymour prologue he knew it was the last time he would be there he stepped through the double door of the administration building held open for him and the sinking afternoon sun blasted against his face he blinked hard momentarily blinded and stopped disorientated in his tracks he lowered the glasses from the crown of his head on to the bridge of his nose they were all around him crowded in the doorway and they were his wends more than just the people he did business with true friends the car was waiting the driver stood beside the rear door and smiled at him with respect the technicians engineers and managers pressed close to him to shake his hand hold his arms and brushkiss his cheeks the women who worked at the computers and the design benches were behind the men and their eyes beneath their closewrapped head scarves were lit with warmth but they did not touch him or speak the friendships had been nurtured over many years when he had left the office of the project manager three or four minutes before he had started a stuttering progress down a shadowed cool corridor stopping by each door to make his farewells he had been wished a good journey a safe return home and he had been told how welcome he would be when he came back the next time he knew there would not be a next time the sun full and gold turning to scarlet hit his face and pierced the protection of his darkened glasses he grinned and responded to the friendship and trust that was shown him he had betrayed their trust the project manager took his arm led him towards the car murmured appreciation that he had fallen in with the change of schedule and squeezed his arm in implicit thanks for the present of a toshiba laptop on each visit three times a year he brought many presents with him to the complex and they had a sliding scale of value dependent on the position in the complex of his friends he brought with him computer equipment and gold or sterlingsilver ink pens toilet soaps and packs of toothpaste he had come as always five days before his bags weighted with the gifts that cemented the friendship and bound the trust the vomit was in his throat and he swallowed hard as their friend each time he came he was invited to restaurants to eat battered prawns or shrimps or whitefish and he was invited to their homes it had taken years of visits to build the friendship and the trust that were a sham the driver opened the door of the car the project manager was flicking the buttons of a personal organizer a secondary present from the previous visit to confirm the date on which he would next return he looked past the project manager at the straggling line by the double doors all smiling and waving he said it again as he had said it many times in the last five days it had been no problem for him to change his schedule and come a week earlier than originally planned he wished them well he did not know what would happen to them it was the mark of their friendship their trust that they had left the cool airconditioned offices and design rooms to stand in the ferocity of the sunlight to see him on his way and he had betrayed them he could not look into their faces or into the eyes of the project manager before he ducked down into the car a last time he raked the buildings scarred by the sun and the salt carried from the sea by the winds as if it were important that he should remember each final detail what gavin hughes saw the complex was a series of wirefenced compounds above the wiremesh fences around each compound were the silver and rustcoloured coils of razor wire at the gates to each compound were sandbagged sentry points that were covered with decaying canvas to give shade from the sun the watchtowers at the corners of the compounds were built on weathered wood stilts and the dipping sunlight caught the barrels of the machineguns jutting above the parapets between the compounds were four antiaircraft defence positions two with multiplebarrel qerlikon guns and two housing a cluster of squat groundtoair missiles if it had not been for the friendship and the trust gavin hughes who was a salesman in engineering machinery would never have gained access to the complex he saw the entrance tunnel to the building with the buried concrete walls and bombproof ceiling and that was project he saw the dunpainted building into which he had never been admitted that housed project he saw the building where the hotdie forge was installed where heated metal for the warhead cone was compressed and then cooled for turning and grinding and milling the home of project the buildings were spread out across the bright sand scattered inside the complex perimeter that stretched three kilometres in length and two kilometres in width and contained the lathes mixers presses and machine tools he would be asked the day after or the day after that at the latest what he had seen what was different from before he dropped down into the back of the car and the driver closed the door behind him he wound down the window and reached out to shake the project managers hand but still could not look into his eyes he freed his hand and waved at the crowd by the double doors as the car pulled away they drove past the threestorey dormitory block that was used by the chinese he had never met them he had seen them from a distance they worked on project where the lathes shaped the solid fuel charges and past the tennis courts which were floodlit in the cooler evenings and had been built for the russians to whom he had never spoken he had passed them in corridors but his friends had never made the introductions they worked on project where the machines he had supplied mixed the coating capable of withstanding the temperature of degrees generated in the core of the missile tube and past the volleyball court scraped from the coarse sand and stone by the north koreans and played on in the halflight of dawn the driver slowed as they approached the main gate of the complex gavin hughes was sweating and he loosened his tie he twisted and looked through the rear window back at the small group still standing by the main doors of the administration building toy figures waving him on his way two guards came forward when he had first come to the complex they had scowled and taken their time over studying his papers now they grinned and saluted their automatic rifles slung casually on their shoulders three visits before he had brought one a zippo liquidfuel lighter with a harley davidson motif on the last visit he had brought the other a carton of marlboro cigarettes this would be his final visit he would never see these men again it had been made plain at the last briefing in a discreet secondfloor room of a georgian house behind the line of gentlemens clubs in pall mall the satellite photographs of the complex had been mounted on a displayboard the images of the roofs of the buildings were pinpoint sharp and the entrances to the underground workshops the tennis courts even the volleyball area and the positions of the antiaircraft de fences this was gavin hughess kingdom he had access he was a salesman for standard engineering machines and could tell them what they needed to know when the images failed them at the last briefing the night before he had flown over the tired sandwiches and the stewed coffee he had told them why his visit had been moved forward a week what was happening at the complex on the days that he should have visited if the original schedule had been maintained none of their satellites and highoptic lenses could provide them with that kernel of detail the meeting had been suspended for two hours he had been left in the room with only his controller an un giving and aloof woman younger than himself for company when the meeting had resumed the senior man requested he repeat the ground covered earlier why his visit had been put forward in the second session two new men had been present an american perspiring in a suit of brown herringbone tweed had sat behind him and to his right and never spoken a leatherfaced israeli a star of david in gold hanging in the chest hair under an opennecked shirt had been equally silent afterwards the controller had walked him back to his hotel and warned her agent to go carefully on this visit take no risks her last words before they parted reiterated what would be his fate and his death if he created suspicion as if gavin hughes did not know as the guards shouted their farewells the barrier at the gate was lifted and the car powered away on the straight road through the dunes it would be half an hour to the airport and then the feeder flight without formalities to the capital if if he made it through the security check another car another driver would be waiting the next morning for him when he came off the flight at heathrow to ferry him to another briefing if they knew the depth of his betrayal and were waiting for him at the final security check then they would hang gavin hughes as his controller had told him from the highest crane he didnt know what would happen at this place in the next few hours or days and hadnt an idea what his own future held chapter one the harrier contorted to clean the clammy mud from underneath its wing feathers it worked hard at the clinging dirt as if its primitive wild mind demanded cleanliness before the start of the days long flight north the dawn sunshine glossed the rusted gold of the feathers the bird worked at them with its vicious curved sharpened beak pecked at the mud spat and coughed it down into the marsh water below the perch on a dead stark tree at first light it had hunted it had dived on a brightly crested duck the bonestripped carcass of which was now wedged in a fork of the dead tree the mud had speckled the underneath of the wings when it had fallen stone fast on to the unsuspecting prey abruptly without warning it flapped with a slow wingbeat away from the perch and abandoned its kill it headed north away from the hot wet wintering grounds of west africa it would fly all day without rest on an unerring course that retraced its first migratory route as a killing bird a predator the harrier had no sense of threat or hazard they had been right over the tent camp bucking in the strength of the gale before they had seen it they had searched all morning for it forced lower by the lessening visibility from the whippedup sand the pilot of the lead helicopter had been sweating and he was supposed to be the best with many hours of desert flying experience good enough in desert storm to have flown behind the lines into iraq to supply the special forces they had been down to a hundred feet where the wind was most treacherous and the wipers in front of him were clogged by grains of sand only a minute after he had rapped his gloved fist on the fuel gauge and muttered into their earphones that they had little time left the marine corps major had spotted the camp tapped the pilots shoulder and pointed down the colonel of the national guard had softly mouthed his thanks to his god duane littelbaum had heard the excited voices on his headset and thought this might be a good game for kids reckoning himself too old for this sort of serious shit they had put down beside the tents the two following helicopters which were also flown by americans were talked in and disgorged the local national guardsmen the rotors lifted away two of the camps seven tents but the pilots had refused no argument accepted to cut their engines they wanted out and soonest as the thirty national guardsmen corralled the camp the rotors and the wind threw the fine grains in stinging clouds into their faces the two tents had come to rest in bushes of low scrub thorn a hundred yards from the camp but the bedding that had been with them and the clothes were still in loose flight scudding over the sand the pilots broke their huddle they shouted into the ear of the marine corps major the storm was not lifting the gusting sand would infiltrate every aperture in the helicopters engines they should get the fuck out not negotiable now it was already clear to them to the saudi colonel to the men of the saudi arabian national guard and to duane littelbaum that the raid had failed the man they sought had evaded them littelbaum felt it keenest he stood in the centre of the camp huddled against the wind and the blast of the rotors the sand crusting on his face and gazed around him the information had been good it had come from the interception of the signal of a digital mobile telephone the antennae on the eastern coast had identified the position across the gulf from which the call had been initiated and the position in the empty quarter where it had been received it should have led them to the man duane littelbauifl hunted there was one prisoner the man was heavyset jowled and he lay on his stomach with his arms bound behind him at the wrist and his ankles tied sharply he wore the clothes of a bedouin tribesman but his physique and stomach were too gross for him to have been from this group of camel herdsmen littelbaum knew the face of the prisoner from the files knew he came from riyadh was a courier for the man he tracked the tribesmen huddled on their haunches around a dead fire surrounded by scorched stones the colonel yelled at them kicked them and they keeled away from him twice he whipped them with the barrel of his pistol but none cried out even when they bled they were small men with twigthin bodies impassive in the face of his anger they could be shown the blade of a sword or the barrel of a gun but they never talked the camels were hobbled to pegs and kept their heads away from the force of the wind littelbaum thought the nameless faceless man would have ridden on a camel into the blast of the driven sand there would be no tracks and no chance of pursuit from the air he knew only the mans reputation which was why he sought him as if he were the grail the patience of the lead pilot was exhausted he was gesticulating to the colonel pointing at his watch at his helicopter and back into the eye of the storm the colonel gave his orders the prisoner was dragged helpless towards a fuselage hatch above the scream of the wind duane littelbaum heard behind him the crash of gunfire then the camels screaming without their animals the bedouin would either starve or die of thirst or exposure in the wilderness of the empty quarter it was a shit country to which he was posted with a shit little war and he had failed to find his enemy perhaps it was because one of the emaciated tribesmen ducked to avoid the blow of a rifle butt but for a brief second the dead embers of the fire were no longer protected against the wind littelbaum saw black shreds of paper lifting in the gusts between the charred wood he scrambled through the bedouin and the national guardsmen fell to his knees whipping out the little plastic bags that were always in his hip pocket carefully as he had been taught at the academy at quantico more than two decades ago he slipped the scraps into the bags as he squinted down he fancied that there were still faint traces of arabic characters on the fragments he was the last into the helicopter holding his bags as if they were the relics of a saint they lifted and the camp in which he had placed such hope disappeared in the storm of driven sand no i appreciate that this is a difficult moment for you but what i am telling you is based on information gathered within the last month no of course its a difficult situation for you to absorb no difficult but inescapable its not a problem that can be ignored no theyre serious people mr perry you know it we know it nothing has changed for gods sake you were in iran as often as im in the supermarket i cannot conceive that you are incredulous to what im saying but this is not accountancy or commerce where you would have the right to expect definitive statements i cant give you detail it is intelligence the putting together of mosaic scraps of information then analysing the little that presents itself i am not at liberty to divulge the detail that provided the analysis you have been there you know those people if they find you then they will seek to kill you geoff markham stood by the door watching fenton doing the talking and recognizing already that fenton had made a right maggot of it the man perry had his back to them and was gazing out of the front window as the late winter rain lashed the glass panes as the senior operative fenton ought to have made a better fist of it he should have sat perry down gone to the sideboard routed for a whisky bottle poured generously and put the glass into perrys hand he should have communicated warmth and commitment and concern instead he had trampled with the finesse of a buffalo into perrys home now it was fast going sour and as it went sour so fentons voice rose to a shrilling bark geoff markham stood by the door and remained silent it was not his place to intervene when his superior fouled up he could see perrys hunched shoulders tighten with each new assault perrys voice was low and muffled and markham had to strain to hear the words youre not listening to me no i cannot see what other option you have my option is to say what i have said no that isnt an option listen youre in shock you are also being wilfully obstinate refusing to face reality no not again i wont run he heard the hiss of his superiors exasperation he glanced down at his watch christ they had not even been in the house for fifteen minutes they had driven down from london come unannounced had parked the car on the far side of the green on to which the house faced fenton had smiled in satisfaction because there were lights on inside they had seen the face at the window upstairs as they had opened the low wicket gate and gone up the path to the door he had seen perrys face and he had thought there was already a recognition of their business before they reached the door they wore their london suits fenton had a martinets moustache painstakingly trimmed a brown trilby and a briefcase with the faded gold of the eiw symbol there was no porch over the front door and perry would have recognized them for what they were a senior and a junior from the security service before they had even wiped their feet on the door mat he made them wait and allowed the rain to spatter their backs before opening the door fenton was not often out of thames house he was a section head consumed by the reading of reports and attendance at meetings in geoff markhams opinion fenton had long ago lost touch with the great mass of people who surged back and forth each day along the thames embankment under the high walls of the building on millbank to fenton they would have been a damn bloody nuisance an impediment to the pure world of counterespionage markham wondered how he would have reacted if strangers had pitched up at his door flashed their ids muscled into his home started to talk of life and death fenton snapped we have conduits of information some more reliable than others i have to tell you the information we are acting upon is first class the threat is a fact i wont run again fentons right fist slammed into the palm of his left hand were not urging this course of action lightly look you did it before no you can do it a second time no i have the impression that you wish to delude yourself on the strength of the threat well let us understand each other i am not accustomed to leaving my desk for a day journeying into this sort of backwater for my own amusement i wont run again final fenton brayed at the back of perrys head there is evidence of a very considerable danger got me hard evidence real danger from where he stood at the door geoff markham thought that perrys silhouetted shoulders drooped slightly as if hed been cudgelled then they stiffened and straightened i wont run again fenton ground on relentlessly look its a pretty straightforward process getting there is something were expert at you move on you take a new identity a cash sum to tide you over the incidental expenses just leave it to us new national insurance new nhs number new inland revenue coding not again no bloody hell mr perry do me the courtesy of hearing me out they have your name not the old one they have frank perry get that into your skull if they have the name then i have to examine the probability that they have the location perry turned from the window there was a pallor now to his cheeks and his jaw muscles seemed to flex slacken and flex again there was weariness in his eyes he didnt cower he stood his full height he gazed back at fenton geoff markham didnt know the details on perrys file had not been shown it but if he deserved the threat then there was something in his past that required raw toughness its your problem wrong mr perry its your problem because its your life your problem and you deal with it thats ridiculous the voice was a whisper men like you they came they told me of the threat they told me to quit run i listened i quit i ran im not spending the rest of my life every day that remains of my life like a chicken in a coop wondering if the fox has found me it is your responsibility its owed me if the fox comes shoot it understand me shoot it what did you ever do for your country geoff markham heard fentons snort then the cut of the sarcasm oh were there are we playing the patriots card a man of letters once said that patriotism is the last refuge of scoundrels i worked for my country my head was on the block for it while lining a damn deep pocket i am staying this is my home it was a good room geoff markham thought there was decent furniture a solid sideboard and a chest of dark wood low tables it suited the room which was livedin he could see it was a home when he was not sleeping at vickys he lived in an anonymous sterile onebed roomed apartment in west london here a childs books were on the floor an opened technical magazine and a cotton bag from which peeped a womans embroidery invitations to drinks and social functions stood on the mantelpiece above the fireplace if it had been markhams he too would have tried to cling to it but he had seen bodies in ireland of men who had not covered their tracks had made themselves available to their killers he had seen their white dead faces the dried blood pools below their cheeks and hair matted with brain tissue and bone fragments they could whistle up the removals company there were people who did discreet business for them they could have him loaded within twentyfour hours gone lost fenton jabbed his finger at perry you wont get the sources from me but i can tell you they have given this matter your life your death a very considerable priority are you listening i am not leaving my home they are starting on a journey we dont know when they began it could be a couple of weeks ago for them mr perry it is a long road but you can be certain that at the end of it you are their target the dhow had brought dried fish and cotton bales across the gulf the cargo for the return journey was boxes of dates packaged videocassette recorders and television sets from the abu dhabi warehouses cooking spices bought from indian traders and the man the dhows large sail was furled and it was driven by a powerful engine the man was the important cargo and the engine was at full throttle he sat alone at the bow and stared down into the foaming water below the previous night each of the five crewmen had seen him come aboard in the darkness slipping silently down the quay side ladder only the boats owner had spoken with him then immediately given the order for the ropes to be cast off the engine to be started he had been left alone since the start of the journey the call to his mobile telephone had come just after the crewmen had seen him lean forward and peer down to watch the dark shape of a shark large enough to take a man swimming under the bow wave before it dived none of the crew approached him except to offer him a plastic bottle of water and a bag of dried dates then the man had lifted his face the scarred redness around his eyes the upper part of his cheeks and his forehead were raw the crewmen swabbing the deck stowing ropes taking turns at the wheel understood he had come through the stinging ferocity of a sandstorm he had talked quietly into his telephone and none of them could hear his words in the several minutes the call had taken it would be late afternoon before he would see the raised outline of the citys buildings the mosque minarets and the angled idle cranes of the port they did not know his name but they could recognize his importance because they had sailed with their hold half empty at night to bring him home he wore the torn dirtied clothes of a tribesman he smelt of camels filth but the crewmen and the owner simple devout men who had sailed through the worst gale storms of the gulf waters would have said that they held this quiet man in fear later when they had a good view of the buildings minarets and cranes of bandar abbas a fast speed boat of the pasdaran intercepted them took him off and ferried him towards the closed military section of the port used by the revolutionary guards they felt then as if a chill winter shadow was no longer on their dhow and they tried to forget his face his eyes the last time i did what i was told to do for your own good you were sensible mr perry i had only two suitcases of clothes i even cleared out the dirty washing from the bathroom basket and took that with me selfpity is always degrading the men in bloody raincoats they packed all my work papers said i wouldnt need them again said theyd lose them where did my work life go into a landfill dredging history rarely helps i had six hours to pack the men in raincoats were crawling all through my house my wife as i understand about to divorce you and with a friend to comfort her there was my son hes seventeen now i havent seen him since i dont know what exams hes passed and failed where hes going what hes doing always better mr perry not to sink into sentimentality i had damn good friends there never said goodbye not to any of them just walked away i dont recall from the file that you were under duress it was a good company i worked for but i wasnt allowed to clear my desk the raincoats did that fenton sneered the directors of that company were lucky from what ive read not to face a customs and excise prosecution as you were lucky you bastard obscenities mr perry in my experience are seldom substitutes for common sense i gave up everything life my friend is not merely a photograph album to be pulled out each christmas day for the relations to gawp at little to be gained from wallowing in the past life is for living your choice move on and live or stay and write your own funeral service thats the truth mr perry and the truth should be faced the rain was heavier outside beating a drum roll on the windowpanes the darkening cloud came out of the east off the sea geoff markham stayed by the door he could have reached beside him to switch on the lights to break the gloom but he did not markham knew his superiors performance was a disaster he doubted fenton had the sensitivity to appreciate the castration of a life perry had run away from a wife who no longer loved him a son friends and neighbours even his office the banter and excitement of the sales section everything that was past frank perry was a damned ordinary name if there had been six hours for him to quit his house then the time allotted to choosing a new name would have been about three short minutes maybe the raincoats had saddled him with it perry had turned back to the window and fenton paced as if he did not know what else to say markham wondered whether perry had gone a year or two later to watch a school gate from the far side of the street to see the boy come out from school a leggy youth with his shirt hanging out his tie loosened maybe the kid would have been alone still traumatized from his fathers disappearance the raincoats would have told him that kids couldnt handle secrets that they blabbed that he endangered himself and the kid if he made contact they would have tracked frank perrys former footsteps his onetime life until they were convinced that the trail was broken fenton wouldnt have understood you have to face facts and facts dictate that you move on and my new home new family new life new friends start again dump my new home put my new family through the hoop theyll cope theres no alternative and in a year or three years do it all again and again after that and again do it for ever peer over my shoulder wetting myself keeping the bags packed is that a life worth living its what youve got mr perry fenton rubbed his fingernail against the brush of his moustache despite the gloom markham could see the flush on his superiors cheeks he didnt think fenton was an evil man or a bully just insensitive hed do a memo they liked memos back at thames house to administration on the need for counselling courses in sensitivity they could set up a sensitivity subcommittee and they could call in outside consultants there could be a paper sensitivity dealing with obstinate bloodyminded pigheaded ordinary members of the public there could be twoday courses in sensitivity for all senior executive officers fenton beat a path between the toys and the embroidery i wont do it youre a fool mr perry its your privilege to say so but im not going to run not again fenton picked up his coat from the arm of a chair and shrugged himself into it covered his neatly combed hair with his hat geoff markham turned and quietly opened the livingroom door fentons voice was raised i hope its what you want but were going into an area of unpredictability it would be in the third week of its migration the bird would have left its subsaharan wintering grounds around twenty days earlier have stored weight strength and fat in the wetlands of senegal or mauretania it would have rested that last night in the southern extreme of the charente maritime and hunted at dawn he sold insurance for a parisbased company annuities fire and theft household and motor life and accident policies in a quadrangle of territory between la rochelle in the north rochefort in the south niort and cognac in the west the trade to be gained at a weekend when clients were at home and not tired was the most fruitful but in march and october he never worked weekends instead early in the morning he left his home at loulay with his liverwhite spaniel and drove a dozen kilometres into the winterflooded marshland of the charente maritime in the boot of his car was his most prized possession an armi bettinsoli over and under shotgun every saturday and sunday morning in the early spring and the late autumn he parked his car and carried the shotgun wrapped in sacking a kilo metre away his sport as practised by his father and grandfather was now opposed by the city bastards who claimed to protect the birds it was necessary to be covert to move after each shot because the bastards looked for men enjoying legal sport to interfere in the remaining months he shot pheasants partridges rabbits and foxes but the sport he craved was in march when the birds migrated north and october when they returned south to escape the winter that sunday morning in late march he saw the bird first as a speck and swung his binoculars up from his chest to make the distant identification he had already fired and moved twice that morning the dog had retrieved a swallow crushed by the weight of shot and a spotted redshank which had been alive he had twisted its neck the swallows flew in tight fast groups and were easy to down the spotted red shanks came in clusters and were not too difficult to shoot but the bird coming now from the south low over the reedbeds was a true target for a marksman he knew the markings of the harrier could recognize them with his binoculars at half a kilo metre distance it was a worthy target those birds always flew singly low at near to fifty kilometres per hour a ground speed of metres in ten seconds a marsh harrier would pay for his weekends cartridges his friend pierre the amateur taxidermist always paid well for a raptor and top price for a marsh harrier he crouched his breath coming in short spurts the bird had such good sight but he was low down and hidden by the marsh fronds he rose and aimed the bird was straight ahead and would pass directly over him he could see the gingercapped crown of the bird and the ruff at its neck it would be a juvenile but it had fed well in the african winter he fired for a moment the bird dipped bucked then fell the dog bounded forward splashing into the marsh water he fired the second barrel and shouted urging the dog forward into the wall of reeds he was still reloading when the bird came past him within five metres its flight was level to his head and then it was past it had a laboured fractured flight the wings beat unevenly his hands shook and a cartridge dropped from his fingers into the water he howled in frustration when the gun was loaded and the dog was back beside him he swung the bird was beyond range but he heard its scream he watched it for a long time with his eye then with the binoculars it went north for la rochelle if it had the strength it would pass by the estuary at nantes and the river at rennes then reach the channel coast he thought his pellets had hit the muscle ligament or tendons in the wing but not the bone bone fracture would have brought it down from the look of it the bird would not survive a crossing of the channel to an english landfall they were crowded in the hallway pressed close together against hanging coats the familys boots were scattered on the tiled floor there were tennis rackets in the corner a bright plastic beach bucket and spade a chaos of stones from the shore it was the same comforting clutter that geoff markham knew from his own parents home perry reached past them and pulled the door open there was an old bolt on it and a new lock geoff markham shuddered in belfast the psychopaths had sledge hammered through doors to do their killing fenton tried a last time is it that youre frightened of telling her who what frightened of telling your wife what you did is that the problem they never told me what id done said it was better i didnt know she doesnt know about before she didnt need to know lived with the secret did you festering is it get out my advice mr perry is to come clean with her then fall into line tell them back where you came from no so much better mr perry if youd had the guts to be honest with your wife isnt she just commonlaw fenton was on his way to the gate when his feet slipped on the wet brick of the path he stumbled and cursed geoff markham was going after him when his sleeve was grabbed the rain ran on perrys face he hissed this is mine its all i have im not running again tell them that this is my home where i live with the woman i love i am among friends true good friends i wont spend the rest of my life hiding a rat in a hole this is where i stand with my woman and my friends do you know what its like to be alone and running they dont stay with you the raincoats did you know that with you for a week ten days then gone a contact telephone number for a month then discontinued you are so bloody alone tell them whoever sent you that im sorry if its not convenient but i wont run again fenton was at the car crouched behind it to protect himself from the rain markham reached it and opened the door for his superior he looked back perrys door was already shut chapter two behind the cottage homes of brick and flint stone where climber roses trailed and the honeysuckle was not yet in leaf the ornamental trees in the gardens were shredded of colour and the sea was slate grey with white flecks between the houses and through the trees he saw it stretching away limitless a solitary cargo ship nudged along the horizon maybe out of felixstowe the sea was like a great wall against which the village sheltered a barrier that had no end to its width and to its depth god dont spare the horses it was the reason hed been fetched out for the day fenton wouldnt have wanted to drive or have to face the vagaries of train timetables and a waiting taxi geoff markhams function was to drive not to play a part in what should have been a reassuring and businesslike making of arrangements for the removal vans arrival he had the wipers going but the back window was a disaster as if a filled bucket had been tipped on it he reversed cautiously couldnt see a damn thing in his mirror then swung the wheel hard the car surged forward fenton was writhing out of his dripping coat and nudged markhams arm so that he swerved he veered towards a woman in a plastic cape pushing her bicycle before hed straightened up the tyres sluiced the puddle over her legs there was a shout of abuse fenton grinned first sign of life weve seen markham should have stopped to apologize but kept going he wanted away from the place he knew nothing of the sea and it held no particular attraction for him he thought it chill and threatening they went past a small shop with pottery and postcards in the window from which faces peered they would have heard the womans protest there was a tearoom beside the shop shuttered for the winter they swept past the village hall a lowset building with an old morris outside then there was a pub with an empty carpark thank the lord the open road beckons could you live here geoff in this dead end theyd both seen it the estate agents forsale sign was propped in an untrimmed hedge beside a crazily hanging gate with the faded name on it rose cottage beyond was a small overgrown garden then a darkened cottage with the curtains drawn no lights showing the rainwater cascaded from the blocked gutters and tiles were missing from the roof it would be three bedrooms bathroom two reception kitchen in need of modernization and it would also be down here on the suffolk coast ninety thousand pounds before the builders went in but all that was irrelevant to markham he was wondering how perry was facing up the devastation theyd left behind them sort of place geoff where the major entertainment offseason would be screwing your sister or your daughter or your niece eh not since he had come back from ireland and gone to work on the mid east islamic desk had he heard his superior utter anything as crude he was shocked wouldnt have believed fenton capable of such vulgarity the bitter little confrontation with perry had rattled him they went up a long straight road first flanked by terraced houses then as he accelerated by larger houses oozing prosperity set back in gardens with tarpaulincovered yachts in the driveways the church was on their right geoff markham was good on churches liked to walk around them and this one through his side window looked to be worth a quarter of an hour a fine tower solid as a fortress a wide nave safe as a refuge beyond it was a stark facade of flint ruins the clerestory windows open to the concrete grey of the cloud he turned his head to see the ruins better there was a chuckle beside him about as dead as the rest of the wretched place fenton he knew lived in beaconsfield not on his own salary but on family money couldnt have managed beaconsfield the restaurants the delicatessens and the bijou clothes shops where his wife went on a desk heads wage money was seldom far from geoff markhams thoughts nagging like a dripping tap vicky and his future were about money he was driving faster it was strange but he hadnt seemed to register the village when they came into it less than an hour before it had not seemed a part of the present and the future the village was history to be left behind once the removal van had arrived but no removal van was coming and the village its layout entry and exit route topography community was as important as any of those isolated whitewalled farmhouses in south armagh fermanagh and east tyrone fenton was again massaging his moustache and showed no interest in what was around him through the trees was the shimmer of silver grey from stretching inland water the road in front was straight and empty he had no need to concentrate markhams mind was on the landscape as it would have been if he had been driving in ireland they reached the crossroads and the main road for ipswich colchester and london he paused for traffic with the right of way and the smile brightened on fentons face he checked the distance they had come since leaving the house about bloody time you never said could you live there damn sure i couldnt it wasnt for markham to pick a pointless argument with his superior i couldnt but its right for him come again he chose well perry did dont give me riddles markham pulled out into the main road and slashed his way through the gears for speed he wants to make a stand he wont run its good ground for him one road in and the same road out the sea is behind and it can be monitored natural barriers of flooded marshland to the north and the south with no vehicle access if you were in a city street or a towns suburban road you couldnt get protection like that he chose well if hes really staying they would be back in london on millbank in three hours then the bells would start clamouring and the calls would go out for the meeting he went like a sleepwalker around the ground floor of his house and seemed not to recognize the possessions they had collected over four years frank perry felt a stranger in his house he had made himself three cups of instant coffee sat with them drunk them then paced again of course he knew the reality of the threat whatever had been done with the information hed given in the briefings at the house behind pall mall he would have made a lasting enemy of the authorities in iran hed assumed that the information had been used to block sales of equipment and chemicals from the factories of the old eastern bloc and from western europe from the works of his old company in newbury there would have been expulsions of iranian trade attach the loss of their precious foreignexchange resources and the programme would have been delayed of course the threat was real and hed known it however hard he had tried to put the past behind him it had stayed with him sometimes it was a light zephyr wind on his face sometimes it was a gale beating against his back for four years it had always been there he had never been able and god hed tried to escape the past through those years frank perry had been waiting for them he couldnt have put features to their faces but hed known theyd come in suits with polished shoes with a briefcase that wouldnt be opened with knowledge that would be only partially shared theyd be so recognizable and predictable from the moment hed seen them run from the car to his front door hed known who they were and what they would tell him he had rehearsed more times than he could count what he would say to them and had finally said it he stopped pacing he stared out of the window across the green his fists were clenched everything he could see the homes of his friends the shop the hall and the pub at the end of the road were as normal and unremarkable as they had been before the men from london had come it was hard for frank perry to believe that anything had changed but it had and he knew it his fingernails pressed hard into the palms of his hands he would fight to hold everything that was precious to him meryl perry held the umbrella over the childs head and sheltered him all the way from the car through the gate up the path to the front door the child shivered as they waited for the door to be opened the carstairs lived in a fine house on the main street the only road through the village they both worked and had good positions she would only just have reached home and he wouldnt be back for an hour the child bolted through the open door youre a saint meryl thanks ever so dont worry about it emma wouldnt let him get soaked you wouldnt others might look youre drenched youre a sweetheart im doing tomorrow and youre doing the rest of the week right actually meryl i was going to ask you can you do all this week its a real bash at work and barrys in too early to take them ill make it up the week after no problem what friends are for youre brilliant dont know what id do without you the door closed on her her ankles were sodden her stockings clammy she liked emma carstairs and frank was barrys best friend they had good times together the schoolrun to halesworth had been their first touch point she hadnt had friends not like emma and barry before she had moved to the village she hurried back to the car the rain lashing her while she furled the umbrella off again taking donna home she turned by the village hall then went back past the church and up the lane to the council houses she dropped donna at her front gate thanks so much mrs perry youd have drowned at the bus stop vince didnt stop nor that stuckup mary wroughton leave off donna probably they didnt see you id have ruined my hair youre really kind and ill see you next week when frank and i are out always enjoy babysitting at yours mrs perry thanks again the girl was out of the car and running for her front door her stephen was scowling beside her but he was eight and any child of that age objected to babysitters she poked him he put his tongue out at her and they both laughed hed had behavioural problems in the city but not since they had moved to the village the best thing she could have done for stephen was bring him here she drove back into the village there were no cars in front of mrs fairbrothers no guests checked in past the martindales pub too early to be open vinces van was outside his terraced house strange that he hadnt seen donna at the bus stop dominic evans he was always nice to her was running back into his shop with the icecream sign probably going to shut up early he was always helpful and euan she parked as close as possible to their front gate and stephen scampered for the door peggys bicycle was askew against the wroughtons garage door meryl was locking her car umbrella perched over her head as peggy came down the wroughtons path meryl hold on yes peggy ive that typing for you you said you would of course i did for the red cross and the wildlife no problem cant thank you enough dont know what i did before you came oh meryl you couldnt manage the institutes minutes fannys got an awful cold i think theres a lot of it about thanks meryl you should get on home peggy you look like a hose has been turned on you i tell you meryl those people seeing frank when you were out they drove right through a puddle could have avoided it i used the fword and all quite made my day using the fword stephen had left the door open and the rain was driving on to the hall tiles she took off her coat and shook it hard outside she called frank were home im in the kitchen there was no light on downstairs stephen would have gone straight to his room for his books and his toys she went into the kitchen he sat at the kitchen table but it was too dark for her to see his face you all right love fine had a busy day no visitors no no visitors it was the first time in the four years she had known him that she could have proved he had lied she said she would make a pot of tea and switched on the light kicking a cat would have been too easy and beating his balding head against a wall would have been poor satisfaction littelbaum wondered if they knew in audobon west iowa the good solidly ignorant folk as they scratched a living and paid taxes where their sweat money went did they know in california or south carolina where it ended in texas in montana if it were not for the tax money saddam hussein might have been in dhahran and the ayatollahs might have made it to riyadh and they treated him the representative of those taxpayers like a dogs turd but he kept smiling all day he had waited at the guarded headquarters of general intelligence and been shuffled between various airconditioned offices they offered him fruit juice and cake polite talk and he had achieved nothing the prisoner for littelbaum he was a number had most probably been below him all through that day in the basement holding cells it was the fifth time he had tried to win access to the prisoner without success the man would be in the cells and maybe his mother would not recognize him maybe he was without fingernails maybe a fine cord had been knotted tightly round his penis while water was poured down his throat littelbaum did not have the name of the man he hunted nor the face he had footprints the prisoner might have told him the name described the face his driver took him back to the embassy he could demand time of the ambassador and shout a bit and the ambassador would shrug and mouth sympathy he could send another protest signal to the hoover building and it would be filed along with the rest later he would be in his windowless office behind the bombproof door guarded by the young marine and he would stand in front of the big wall map of the region with his herringbone jacket loose on his shoulders and look at the footprints at the brightheaded pins it took two weeks from the event for littelbaum to be able to put another pin in the map to mark another footprint from the pins hung little paper flags carrying a date for two and a half years he had followed the footprints and they made a pattern for him there was a digital mobile telephone that made scrambled voiceprotected calls from and to an office in tehran of the ministry of information and security the computers could not break through the scrambled conversations but they could locate and identify the position from which the call had originated or been answered his pins with their carefully dated flags were scattered over the map surface of iran and saudi arabia it was two and a half years since the explosion at the national guard barracks in riyadh in which five of his countrymen had died the pin was there and dated the day before it happened two years since the lorry bomb at the khobar tower airforce base outside dhahran had killed nineteen americans and that date pin was there the day before the massacre each atrocity enabled him to track a man without a name and without a face it took two weeks for the computer to log the locations there was a pin in the empty quarter dated fortythree days back and he had bypassed every bureaucratic instruction ignored every standing order worked the contact game won the onetime favour tasked the marine corps helicopters and the saudi national guardsmen and still been too damned late and there was a pin in international waters along the trade route between abu dhabi and the iranian port of bandar abbas no name no face only footprints for duane littelbaum to follow as if he were a shambling slowgoing bloodhound maryellen brought him the days communications from the cypher section and coffee sometimes she put whiskey in it which in this arrogant ungrateful corrupt country was almost a beheading offence she was blue chip with a ph d old money off long island and she seemed to regard it as her lifes work to look after a middleaged man from poor farm stock out of audobon in west iowa it took sixteen days from the time the antennae or the dishes sucked in the streams of digital information for the computers to locate the positioning of the receiver and transmit it to duane littelbaum she passed him two pins and two dated flags maryellen was too short to reach that far up the wall map into northern iran he grunted and stretched he drove home the pins where there were two tight clusters he drank the coffee she said and he did not need her to tell him its where he always goes he calls from alamut then the next day from qasvin then silence then the call again then the killing its what he always does that paper we got the burned paper what did quantico scratch out of that she shrugged as if the hoover building hadnt bothered to report back what the forensics at quantico had learned hes going for a killing yes its what the footprints say he calls from qasvin and the day before from alamut like its his ritual then he moves and then he kills hasanisabah had called for a volunteer to strike down a vizier a young man without fear had stepped forward and nizam almulk was stabbed to death as he was carried in a litter to his wives tent hasanisabah had inscribed the killing of this devil is the beginning of bliss the words had been written years before in the place where the man now sat every wall of the mountain fortress constructed by hasanisabah was now broken it was the eighth time he had climbed the mountain taken the narrow path used only by the sheep wild goats and foraging wolves over the scree slope the drop beneath him did not frighten him but if he had slipped on any of those climbs he would have died he was two thousand metres above sea level perched on a small rock high over the valley it was where he found strength among the fallen stones of the fortress it was difficult for him to imagine it as it had been in the valley had been the garden of paradise in the fortress had been the discipline of selfsacrifice and obedience the young men who gazed down on the garden and learned their skills in the fortress were the fidais their trade was killing they understood their duty and the personal sacrifice it required they yearned for their reward a place in the garden of paradise where there were groves of sweet fruit trees clear tumbling streams and women of great beauty he had slept in a tent by a small fire and at dawn had packed up and started his climb on the path over the scree whether in sunshine or in the winters mists whether the snow had fallen and the path was treacherous he made that pilgrimage to the destroyed fortress he would reach it and sit for hours with the silence of the valley below him and consider the mission he had been given the requirement for obedience and selfsacrifice and the reward of a martyrs glory when the sun lowered or the clouds darkened he would make the call on the digital phone given him by the man who was like a father to him like hasanisabah had been to the fidais and he would start the descent he would reach the fourwheeldrive vehicle as darkness fell and drive back to the camp at qasvin from qasvin he would start on his journey as long ago the fidais had started theirs whats the matter with it he put down his fork noisily isnt it good enough for you he pushed away the plate now he looked down at the table mat its not much its what stephen likes a bit late to start complaining youve had it before hed cut through half a sausage and eaten it hed forked a few chips and hardly any of the beans whats the problem frank her boy had cleared his plate he had a muted fear in his eyes a childs loathing of adults argument all right its not much but i had a long day i did that typing come on frank whats it about he shook his head jerked it from side to side are you ill do you want an aspirin again he shook his head more slowly for gods sake frank what is going on there was the violent scrape of stephens chair as the boy fled the kitchen the clatter of his feet on the stairs then his bedroom door slammed you know what he did really well in his english assessment better than hes done before he was bubbling to tell you but he didnt have the chance did he come on frank youre always so good with him his head was sunk in his hands they hadnt spoken not properly since she had come home and had recognized the lie she had been in the kitchen doing the typing for peggy before cooking supper and he had been in the living room he still hadnt put a light on he had turned his chair away from the unit fire and the television so that he could sit and stare out of the window dusk had come early and he hadnt drawn the curtains he gazed out on to the green and the streetlight on the far side he had not listened to the news bulletin as he usually did or opened the paper she had brought him meryl had never known him lie and she felt a desperate anxiety when she had met frank perry four years before she had been a single mother without a name for her sons father working in a small company in east london pushing paper when he had come to advise on the engineering required for the heating system in the old factory floor hed made her laugh and god it had been a long time since anyone else had next week when donna came to babysit they were going out to celebrate the fourth anniversary april since she and stephen had come to the village with their cases all that they owned and moved into the house that she and frank had found living here with him she would have said had given her and stephen the best years of their lives she touched and tugged at her fair hair nervously is it about me no she took stephens plate stacked it under hers is it about him has he said something done something no its about you my problem he said his words were muffled through his hands arent you going to tell me when im ready she was up from the table carrying away the plates of course were not husband and wife were only man and woman with a bastard child makes a difference doesnt it dont talk such rubbish dont hurt yourself frank look at me is it what we dont talk about is it that forbidden area the past two men came and you lied did they come out of the past he pushed back his chair took the plates from her and put them in the sink he held her close against him and his hands were gentle on her hair he kissed her eyes as tears welled just give me time please i have to have time he gave her his handkerchief then went upstairs to stephens room to ask about his english assessment she tipped the food from his plate into the bin wiped the table then went back to typing the institutes minutes and the details of the wildlife field day and the red cross bringandbuy morning she heard him talking with her boy because two men had come from the past and he had lied she thought somewhere in the darkness outside the window there was danger the previous evening four men and a woman from the mujahiddinekhalq had been brought in a closed lorry to the camp at qasvin normally it was the corpses of executed criminals rapists drugdealers and murderers that were dumped at the abyek camp but because the four men and one woman were filth and apostates they were alive he had heard them singing in their cell in the night low chanting voices they had headed north from the training base in southern iraq and crossed the frontier in the mountains between saqqez and mahabad and been ambushed by the pasdars most of the raiding party had fled but five had been captured after interrogation trial and sentence they had been brought to the abyek camp at qasvin normally the corpses were propped against bare wood chairs or low walls of sandbags but once when an airforce officer had been found guilty of spying for the great satan he had been offered as live target practice it was not a camp like a military compound but was constructed as a small town on the outskirts of qasvin it was a miniature babel for the recruits spoke in many dialects with a sprawl of concrete houses and shops a market that sold vegetables meat and rice and a mosque for many years the abyek camp had deceived the spy satellites of the americans but no longer now there was stricter security around the perimeter and greater caution on all methods of communication only the best the most determined of the palestinians lebanese turks saudis algerians and egyptians were brought to the camp to finish their training many came to watch marshalled by their instructors into small groups of their own nationality in front of them in the sand scape that stretched to the perimeter wire and then the open country were the low heaps of sandbags and the chairs he wore a scarf across his face even the most dedicated and determined of the recruits might be captured interrogated might not have the resolve of those who had gone from the mountain at alamut he did not cock his kalashnikov automatic rifle until the terrorists were brought out from their cell and were within hearing range of the metal scrape they were not blindfolded they were led to the chairs and the sandbags their ankles were not tied the airforce officer who had spied for the great satan had tried to run which had made for a better shot it would be good if some of them ran they were between thirty metres and a hundred metres from him they were denounced by the commander of the camp who read from a page of text there was a silence and the sun caught their bared faces he shot two with a short burst and saw them spill over dead he fired a long burst into another a dozen rounds and watched as the body kicked in spasm he used many shots on the fourth man but his mind was clear enough to reckon when he had one bullet left she was furthest away the last she stared back at him none of the men had given him the satisfaction of running and neither did she he shot her in the forehead and she fell backwards there was applause he cleared his weapon and walked away as the recruits blasted at the corpses it hardened them to fire at real bodies he made a call on his digital telephone he was ready to begin his journey i cannot fashion it out of nothing i can only pass on what ive been given by the americans and ive done that ive gone to the edge of my remit if you cant shift him thats your problem penny flowers had cycled over from vauxhall bridge cross to thames house a rucksack and a mauve helmet sat beside her chair it was the end of her day and she was tired geoff markham thought she wanted out and the ride home she was older than him and more senior she didnt acknowledge his presence he sat at the far end of the table and took the minutes of the meeting may i just go over the ground once more stop me if im wrong we have fbi material on a raid into the saudi deserts following an intercepted but scrambled telephone link they miss their target but retrieve sheets of burned paper which are sent to their laboratories for examination barnaby cox was a highflier and geoff markham had heard it said often enough that promotion had come too fast for his slender ability he headed g branch with responsibility for the prevention of islamic terrorism and subversive activity in the united kingdom his route to survival as markham had heard it was a dogged pursuit of detail and a fierce avoidance of decisiontaking the weight of responsibility had prematurely aged his features and greyed his hair which is what i told you yesterday afternoon barney their forensics came up with the name of frank perry in capitals roman characters a date and time and a wharf number in the port at abu dhabi in arabic there was a secondary call the next day from a position located as midgulf between abu dhabi and bandar abbas the americans checked the name frank perry with their own computers drew blank tried us we registered its what i told you yesterday it was not harry fentons style to show deference to the younger man who had leapfrogged him on the advancement ladder fenton was back on tried and trusted home territory he had private means and didnt care about the pension but he had failed that day and there was an exaggerated edge to his voice geoff markham doodled on his pad waiting for something of value to note unless im given facts from which a threatlevel assessment can be made theres not really much point in me sitting here resources dont grow on trees franldy its pathetic that a man at risk cannot be persuaded to move to a safer berth the superintendent from special branch spoke he had come into the room and jerked off his jacket ready for a fight he was already bored geoff markham knew the spat for influence between the branch and the services was already explosive it amused him to watch fatal the use of businessmen never worth it cox mumbled hes simply a silly little man without the wit to know when hes being offered common sense harry fenton said but we dammit are obliged to react ill need some facts if its to come out of my budget the superintendent shot back so pass the load to geoff markham the junior would write a report and decisions could be suspended until it was circulated beside his doodles of victorian gravestones with a couple of church steeples he wrote down penny flowerss extension number at vauxhall bridge cross and the policemans number at scotland yard he left them as a whisky bottle was lifted out of the cabinet and went back to his cubbyhole between the partitions on the outer walls of the openplan area used by g there was a photograph blown up by the copier above his desk the ayatollah khomeini glowered down at him fixed him with a cold unwavering stare it was good to have the picture it helped him to understand the image on the wall was better than anything he read or was told it was a snapshot to suspicion and hostility he rang vicky to tell her he couldnt make dinner she was giving him the treatment and he put the phone down on her didnt bother to continue a scrap with her he opened the file on his desk and gazed at the three useless sheets of paper that dealt with an identity change five years previously nothing was in the file about a life and a name before that change theyd gone down to the country at half cock under prepared the familiar story he rang vicky back made his peace and said at what time he would meet her he wrote on a sheet of paper the questions he would have to answer if he were to write a decent report what was the history of frank perry what had he done and when did he do it what were the consequences of frank perrys actions what should be the threatlevel assessment what was the source of the american information what was the timetable for an attempt at a killing the one thing he wouldnt write was that hed rather liked frank perry the area was quiet the partitioned sections either side of him empty the face above him peered down the eyes long dead preserved in the photograph were without mercy he rang registry told them what he needed geoff markham lived a good safe life and he wondered how it would be if he were alone and threatened by the enmity of those eyes he walked along main street the rain had eased left only a trace in the gathering wind there were few streetlights and no cars moving he did not know what he would tell her or when he could recall each day and each hour five years back of the first month after he had left the culdesac house in newbury with his two suitcases two days with the minders in an empty officers quarters in the garrison camp at warminster four days with the minders in a furnished house at the clifton end of bristol five days with the minders in a hotel on hard times outside norwich after which they had left two more days alone in that hotel then three weeks in a guesthouse in bournemouth then the start of the search for something permanent and the absorption of the new identity the move to a flat in southeast london in those first days he had felt a desperate sense of shamed loneliness had yearned to call his wife and son the partners at the office the customers in his appointments diary in those endless briefings on his new identity for hour after hour penny flowers had demanded he put the old life behind him she had no smalltalk but emphasized coldly and reiterated that if he broke cover he would be found and if he were found he would be killed and then shed gone with the minders had cut him off left him and the night they had gone he a grown man had wept on his bed evening frank he spun coiled tense he gazed at the shadow only me seen a ghost sorry did i startle you its dominic afraid you did obvious was it like i was going to shoot you just taking the dog out i hear peggys lumbered meryl with the typing for the wildlife field day its very good of her i was doing the groups accounts this evening your donation was really generous thanks prefer to say it myself than just send a little letter dont think about it its worth saying it was a good day when you and meryl came here wish all the foreigners slotted in as easily we love it here cant beat friends can you no i dont think you can well weve had our little piddle time to be getting back and sorry i startled you oh did meryl tell you about the field day for the wildlife in may and the rspb lecture weve got coming up hope you can come to both were doing the marsh harriers on southmarsh for the field day any time now theyre back from africa its an incredible migration fierce little brutes killers but beautiful with it better be getting back goodnight frank the footsteps shuffled away into the night dominic seemed to love the dog as much as he did euan perry walked on and took the path beside the course of the old river now silted and narrow and across the north edge of southmarsh he climbed slipping and sliding over the huge barrier of stones the sea had thrown up and went down on to the beach his feet gouged in the sand wet from the receding tide from between the fast cloud that carried the last of the slashing rain moonlight pierced the darkness around him the silence was broken only by the hissing of the sea on the shingle he scanned for a ships lights but there was nothing he did not know what he would tell her of the past nor what she should know of the future he walked in the darkness grinding his feet into the fine pebbles and the emptied shells he turned his back to the sea the great black holes of southmarsh and northmarsh were around the clustered lights of the village he felt a sense of safety of belonging it was his home he moved on retraced his steps and came back into the village brisk footsteps were hurrying towards him a bouncing torch beam lit the pavement then soared and found his face hello frank its basil choir practice drifted on why im late out and same as you i suppose i felt like a prisoner in the vicarage with that dreadful rain today got to get out get a bit of air before bed evening mr hackett please frank not the formality not among friends even those forgive me whom i do not see on sundays a deserved slap on the wrist not to worry its what people do that matters not where theyre seen to be if all my worshippers were as involved in the welfare of the village as you and meryl id be a happier man you look a bit drawn had bad news everythings fine before i forget i hear meryls visiting mrs hopkins shes very kind a great help to that lady awful when arthritis cripples an active woman and ive got you down for churchyard grasscutting this summer on my rota no problem well bed beckons night frank goodnight he walked across the wet grass of the green towards the light above the front door and his home he still did not know what he would tell her or when chapter three the atmosphere hung like gas poisoned in the house and had for three days and three evenings it clung to the rooms eddied into each corner was inescapable they went their own ways as if the atmosphere dictated that they should separate themselves from each other the stench of the silence they carried with them was in the furniture in their clothes and had seeped to their minds he stood on the green beyond his front gate and gazed out over the rooftops towards the expanse of the gunmetal grey sea stephen came down the stairs each morning gulped half of his usual breakfast and waited by the door for his mother to take him to school or by the gate for the other half of the schoolrun to collect him he came home in the afternoons and bolted for his room came down for supper then fled upstairs again the atmosphere between his mother and his stepfather had filtered into his room twice from the bottom of the stairs perry had heard him weeping it was a bright morning there would be rain later and the wind brought a chill from the east since he had pleaded for time meryl had not spoken of his problem she was brisk with him and busy she called shrilly to him for his meals dumped his food in front of him made sharp meaningless conversation while they ate it was as if they competed to be the first to finish what she had cooked so that the charade of normality might be over more quickly if he spread work papers on the table in the kitchen then she was in the living room with her embroidery if she had an excuse to be out she took it spent all of one of the three days helping with the nursery class and staying late at school to scrub the floor he knew that she loved the house and the village and that she feared that both were being pulled by the poison from her they slept at night in the same bed back to back apart the space between them was cold she had looked into his face once the only time that her eyes had flared in anger when shed pushed him aside and run up the stairs to her sons room in answer to his weeping he watched the gulls flying lazily over the sea and felt jealous that such matters did not trouble them his life many times in those three days played in frank perrys mind he remembered his many friends at shiraz where the gases were mixed before the projects move to bandar abbas where the warheads were constructed and more friends there they had entertained him and kissed his cheeks when he gave them gifts and were deceived at the thought of his betrayal he screamed silently across the winteryellowed grass of the green and the rooftops where the first smoke of the day crawled from the chimneys and the open depth of the sea it was not his fault he hadnt been given a chance to do otherwise emma carstairs drove up smiling and chirpy she pushed the door open and belted her horn stephen ran past without looking at him and dived for the car as if to escape frank heard meryls brisk shout behind him the car drove away there was a call for him the home office in london he went back into the house and heard her washing up the breakfast things she hadnt asked him why the home office had rung he picked up the telephone he felt like a philby or a george blake bettany who had rotted in gaol on an official secrets act sentence would have felt like this when hed made his first communication with the soviets he took the phone card from his wallet geoff markham had come out of thames house doubled back behind the building scurried up horseferry road for the first bank of telephones the brewery answered through to marketing a shout for vicky he felt he was breaking faith and the furtiveness exhilarated him he told her that the bank was giving him an interview for a place in investment brokerage his application had been short listed down to the last three she squealed she said he was brilliant he gave her the details she growled that she would bloody murder him if he blew it and started on about her teaching him interview technique she had wanted him out of what she called that creepy job and into proper work since theyd first shared a bed he rang off he wouldnt have dared make that call inside thames house he felt elation that he had been short listed and the same sense of shame as when hed sent off the application to the bank with the necessarily limited personal background it was what vicky had told him to do she had torn the job advertisement from the situations vacant he took the backstreets to the bridge crossed over the great building the home of the secret intelligence service the green and cream and tintedglass monstrosity was enemy territory to most of his seniors at thames house when cox or fenton went across the river to vauxhall bridge cross they always said after theyd legged it back that they felt they ought to wash their hands he asked for ms flowers and the security staff at reception looked at him and his security service id as if they were both worthless she took him into a bare interview room on the ground floor she laid a file in front of her on the table and leaned her elbows over it covered it with her bosom he talked we went down under prepared to see him went with big holes in what we knew we knew that his new name and identity were blown open how and where is what we did not know we told him his life was under threat but we didnt know the extent of the threat it was difficult to assess who was the blind and who the oneeyed were sending him the blue book we need help and have to have answers to questions she snorted derisively ask away whether ill answer thats a different matter and you should know the importance we give to the iranian weapons programme attention among the ill informed was directed towards iraq which is just comic cuts cartoonstrip stuff iran is the big player iraq has no global following iran is a focus point for billions of muslims iran matters she guarded the file with her elbows who was frank perry his name was gavin hughes he was a pushy young salesman in an engineering manufacturing company at newbury he sold commercial mixing machines mostly for export what was the iran link the iranians wanted mixing machines for their programme wivid development you know what that is dont you weapons of mass destruction microbiological chemical and nuclear but the export to iran of those machines is blocked by legislahon enforced by customs and excise isnt that right the machines are dualpurpose you were informed of that and the customs interest the same machine can be legally exported to mix chewinggum or toothpaste to industrial quantities and illegally exported to mix explosives and the chemical precursors for nerve gases and biotoxins which are the anthrax or suchlike end of the business his companys machines with falsified export declarations were for the equipment of military factories what was his importance hes a sharp salesman as i said everybodys good guy people warm to him people want to be his friend the man who is liked and makes friends he gets access the access was disproportionate to the importance of the product he supplied no need to go to tehran to meet him have him down to shiraz or bandar abbas sort the problem out there and save time hes a popular man and not stupid he doesnt push his luck just keeps his ears and eyes open and he oils the friendships with gifts it gets so that hes hardly noticed when hes there im not exaggerating he was remarkable one of the most valuable assets weve ever had who was the controller running him ran him a bit myself at the end when it was leading up to the sensitive time we were into him about eighteen months before it finished wed picked up the illegality bit he faced a customs and excise investigation and hed have gone to prison we had him well stitched and he knew it he was always very cooperative you dont need to know who recruited him did the heavy stuff and pulled him onside they wouldnt give you the time of day what happened at the end what finished it we and other agencies became aware of the pace of the development of chemical warheads we needed to obstruct or at least impede that progress necessary action was taken what was the action taken you should never try to run mr markham before youve learned to walk thats not your concern sorry but it is my concern if im to be in a position where i can assess the contemporary threat level if youve ever rammed a stick into a wasps nest then you make the wasps angry they want to sting you at which point youre advised to get the hell out thatll have to be good enough for you how would the iranians have known that he was the source of information theyre not idiots certainly not in our eyes at the same time they were clearing up the debris hed disappeared left home and work yes they could put that together they would have been very angry has he been looked after what you already know new life no customs and excise feeling his collar new identity we treated him well and expensively thats a minimum of five years ago would their anger have lasted with the action that was taken yes the anger might have matured but it wouldnt have diminished what are we supposed to do now god whyd you ask me water under the bridge as far as were concerned hes no earthly use to us or anyone now just another engineer doing whatever engineers do but if he was brilliant and remarkable we owe him understood youve done that offered help i know his reaction too hes made his bed we dont acknowledge debt to civilians businessmen they work for us we explain the risks they stand on their own feet actually we were surprisingly generous in this case nothing is owed one last thing what was the quality of the information on the renewed threat theres an american in riyadh a funny little fellow from the fbi hes their iran guru he dug up perrys name a little consolation on a failed raid if you call him dont have a pending appointment and dont expect him to draw breath and let you get a word in get the message perry or hughes is a spent cartridge hes of no importance at the reception theyll show you the lavatory the american in riyadh is littelbaum the electric fan always distorted the television picture and the cranking airconditioner set in the wall did the damage to the sound maryellen was responsible for catching the locallanguage news programme because littelbaum found it hard to remember schedules he was at his desk the fan blast riffling the papers in front of him this small section of the embassy building that he used with maryellen and the larger area in an adjacent corridor the agencys place were not served by the buildings main aircoolant system the pipes had been cut off and sealed a security review two years back had decided that the bureau and the agency should be protected from the possible hazard of lethal gases being fed into the system so they had their own airconditioners a nightmare of noise and unreliability that needed the backup of electric fans the locallanguage news bulletin was usually a catalogue of the kings palace meetings and the public appearances of the prime princes the picture was awful the sound worse and the content negligible so he let her monitor it even above the clatter of the airconditioner and the whine of the fan he heard her gasp littelbaum swung in his chair the mans head was down his voice a monosyllabic whisper goddammit the man was dressed in a white robe like a long shirt dress was roundshouldered as if the hope had gone from him under the loosely draped gutra the scarf covering his head his eyes had lost their light damn shit damn the man mouthed a rehearsed confession littelbaum listened as he confessed to terrorism and subversion of the kingdom he was shrunken as if dehydrated from when littelbaum had last seen him dragged in the sand towards the waiting helicopters the bastards the lying deceiving doubletalking bastards he grabbed his herringbone jacket and ran a fast waddling gait for the door the corridor the grille gate where the marine stood guard the elevator and the ambassadors floor he stood to his full squat height and his body shook with anger as he hammered his complaint it is just obstruction i have been blocked at general security six times and i have made two dozen more calls to general security the ministry god knows who else i have not only been denied the chance to talk to this man myself i have not been permitted to read the interrogation dossier they are supposed to be fucking allies i know sir about their delicate sensibilities and i know they are a proud and independent people and please dont tell me to humour them but i dont give a shit what happens in this country the place is a cesspit it is corrupt devious lying complacent americans died in dhahran and riyadh if this man is on tv and making a confession then he has been tried convicted condemned three americans died in riyadh nineteen in dhahran finding the killers of americans is my job this man sir was in contact with an organizer who i am paid to track and find this man could give me the name and the face of that organizer but i am blocked when he has been oneway ticket to chopchop square i have lost the chance to get from this man that information i was so goddamn close so what the fuck are you going to say to our good sweet allies i have been working more than two years for this one chance so i can hunt the bastard down what are you going to say the ambassador wrung his hands and said he would make telephone calls which was what he always said littelbaum went back to his section the fan blew the papers on his desk and maryellen put a decent slug of brown in his coffee the coffee laced with whiskey might just make him forget that he had no face and no name to work towards and that he did not know where the footprints led the wind whipped about her and could not move her the sea swell bucked beneath her and did not shake her she was out of the kharg island terminal the property of the national iranian tanker corporation her call sign was equz her length bow to stern was metres her beam port to starboard was metres her draught the waterline to the lowest point of the hull was metres she was loaded with tonnes of iranian crude her speed through the water regardless of weather conditions was a constant knots she had been at sea for thirteen days routed from kharg island past the port of bandar abbas through the straits of hormuz north up the red sea to the canal away from port said and into the mediterranean after navigating the straits of gibraltar her last reported position had her giving a wide berth to the sea lanes leading to lisbon she was two days sailing from the western approaches of the english channel her crew complement was always thirtytwo iranian and pakistani nationals and the master would give that number in truth to the immigration authorities at the swedish refinery she was a monster carving her way forward moving remorselessly towards her destination just read it mr perry its all in here i cant say its anything that pushes back the frontiers of science it just states whats sensible when she walked out of the front door meryl had been crying shed tried not to cry in the house but shed cried when she was on the step and going down the path perry had seen her dab her eyes when she reached the car and then hed closed the door he was not ready to tell her it would have been easier if shed confronted him he had been leaning against the hall wall head in the coats when the bell had rung a card had been proffered home office central unit and a smiling middleaged man had been following him into the house its all in the pamphlet what we call the blue book because its blue vary your route to and from your home keep a constant watch for

best to be careful and do the checks doesnt take a minute they wandered through the house as if the man were an estate agent and the place was going on the market but it wasnt he was staying no quitting no running the furniture was eyed and the ornaments and the pictures and the fittings in the kitchen hed made them both a mug of tea and his visitor had taken three biscuits from the jar

curtains there should be your wife can knock some up she hates net curtains your job mr perry not mine to make her like them im sure that when youve explained it do you have net curtains at home he

about the net curtains ill call again in about six months if its still appropriate good day its not that bad or youd have the guns here or youd have been moved out after he had read the pamphlet he hid it among his work papers where she never looked frank perry still did not know what and when he would tell meryl a jam my old number the branch men in london called it a proper trolley ride for the geriatrics and let them try it he cursed he was fiftyone years old working out the time to retirement and too damned old for this caper his problem he was trying to do singlehandedly the work that should have been given to a fourman detail it had been fine at the terraced house where hed picked up his target easily enough the target had walked and the detective sergeant had trailed him on foot into the centre of nottingham into a campingequipment shop the detective sergeant had fingered wetweather coats while the target had selected then paid cash for a sleepingbag heavysoled walkingboots wool boot socks camouflage trousers and tunic that were exmilitary stock he might have been old near to retirement but the detective sergeant still registered his targets height and the size of the boots which were at least two sizes too small for the targets feet all the university cities in the country had a pair of branch men attached to the local police station used to be irish work not any longer it was the islamic thing that preoccupied the detective sergeant and his partner iranian students studying engineering physics chemistry metallurgy and the zealots who recruited among the campus kids it was work for a dozen men in this city alone not for two poor bastards the security service provided the names and addresses and bugger all else leaving the detective sergeant to tramp the streets and type the bloody reports the target was careful and had twice ducked into shop doorways and let him come past his shoes new hurt his feet and he was bursting for a leak the detective sergeant was trained in surveillance but it was damn difficult to make the tail when it was down to one man they had ended in a bookshop hed eyed the paperback thrillers while the target had been searching very specific on shelves across the shop he had not had this man before there were usually so many targets that they came round on a rota every four weeks or so it was only three months since the young fellow wet behind the ears and up from london had given the sparse detail of the security service interest in yusuf khan muslim convert formerly winston summers one of many the tall wideshouldered afrocaribbean was under surveillance around one day in thirty nine in the morning to seven in the evening he did not know why this thirtyyearold cleaner at the university was on the list for sporadic surveillance his was not to reason why his but to do and bloody die and bugger all glory for his pinched feet and aching bladder the target had taken a book gone quickly to a vacant cash desk and paid in notes and loose change before heading out into the street the detective sergeant was good at his work and conscientious he checked the shelves where the target had searched uk travel and guides the man was out on the street now a woman was at the cash desk with a child in tow choosing a gifttoken card hed lost half a minute before hed used his shoulder shown his warrant card and demanded of the assistant what book her previous customer had purchased the dumb girl had forgotten had to check back in the pointofsale computer he stood on the pavement outside the shop and cursed he could not see his target and narrow arcades led off both sides of the main street he swore he quartered the arcades and the precinct checked the bus stops and the precinct but could not find the bobbing head he sought or the brightcoloured shoppingbags as his son would say when his birthday came round when the detective sergeant had to dig in his wallet to pay for the amplifier or the tuner pay peanuts dad and you get monkeys they paid for one man to do a surveillance once every thirty days and by eleven oclock in the morning the monkey had lost its target he would find a place to leak then walk back to the dismal street of little terraced houses to sit in his car fashion the excuses compose his report and have not an idea why yusuf khan formerly winston summers had purchased boots camouflage trousers and tunic too small for him heavy wool socks a sleepingbag and a guidebook to the coastal area of north suffolk what the policeman knew of that area from a wet cold and miserable caravan holiday twentytwo years back was endless grey seas and marshes but it would go in his report for want of something better were you followed yusuf khan did not think so have you done anything to create suspicion yusuf khan knew of nothing the intelligence officer was a man of sophistication and poise he came from a childhood spent after the revolution in a villa of quality set in the foothills of the albourz the previous owner had fled in and his cleric father had been awarded the property which looked down on to tehrans smoggy sprawl he ws fluent in german italian arabic and english and could pass in casual london society for palestinian lebanese saudi or egyptian to the unaware he might be from the deep south of italy perhaps calabrian or sicilian he had been three years in london and believed he understood the heartbeat of the british psyche and that understanding had led him to recruit yusuf khan formerly winston summers muslim convert he was a religious man himself prayed at the given hours when it was possible and the obsession of the converts to the faith was something he found ridiculous but useful he preyed on the converts trawled for them in the mosques of the splinter communities who set themselves aside from the traditions of the sunni and shia teaching he searched for them in the universities the best he found those who displayed a fervent adoration of the imam khomeini he recruited yusuf khan had been subject to police investigation in bristol following a knife attack on an arab businessman who had kissed a white woman on the street outside a nightclub unemployed embittered and alienated living in the east midlands city of nottingham attending the mosque of sheik amir muhammad yusuf khan had been identified three years earlier for the intelligence officer twentythree months before with the trust already built in their relationship the intelligence officer had told yusuf khan how he might best serve the memory of the imam it had been a long evening of persuasion the following day yusuf khan had walked away from the faith taken a job as a cleaner at the university he monitored the attitudes friendships conversations of iranian students in the engineering faculty he found and befriended a girl who was now converted to the faith and was useful the trust grew the intelligence officer met his man in the carpark of a restaurant by the river there were too many high cameras in the streets of the city and at the entrances to the multistorey carparks the engine ran the interior heated the windows misted they were unseen and alone you will not be missed from work his friend the girl had telephoned the university and reported his head cold you are certain that you have not created suspicion yusuf khan was certain he was told that he should not go home again until after his part in the matter was finished to where he should take a train where he should hire a car the grade of car and where he should sleep before the given time his list was checked the clothing the boots the sleepingbag the rucksack of khaki canvas he had bought the day before and collected from leftluggage at the bus station everything was checked the book the maps the photographs and he was passed another tightrolled bundle of banknotes he was told of the affection for him of men in high places far away whose names he would never know of their gratitude for what he did and of how they spoke of him with love the intelligence officer watched the swell of yusuf khans pride and smelt the chilli on the mans breath he reached into the back of the car unzipped a big sausage bag and revealed the contents he saw the bright excitement in yusuf khans face he showed him the launcher wrapped in a tablecloth the shells the automatic rifle with the folded stock and the loaded magazines he opened the canvas rucksack beside the bag revealed the grenades he held the mans hand squeezed it to give him reassurance and drove him to the railway station he said that in the farsi language the imam was known as batl almustadafin and that was the champion of the disinherited and therefore he was the champion of yusuf khan he said that yusuf khan would deserve the love of all those who followed the word of the imam khomeini the intelligence officer did not tell him that the cornerstone of his work in london was deniability when they reached the forecourt of the railway station he told yusuf khan what the ayatollah fazlallah mahalati had said he spoke with fervour a believer who sees islam trampled underfoot and does nothing to stop it will end up in the seventh layer of hell but he who takes up a gun a dagger a kitchen knife or even a pebble with which to harm and kill the enemies of the faith has his place assured in heaven he watched khan into the station carrying the rucksack and the sausage bag which sagged under the weight of the weapons on the way back to london he would call in at a small mosque in the town of bedford to a cultural association for which his embassys support was well known for a meeting that would help create the necessary factor of deniability dont mind me saying it frank you look bloody awful had the tax man round you look like i feel when he pushes his bloody nose in martindale bellylaughed without enthusiasm he kept the pub in the village the red lion and had enough cashflow problems not to need the burden of his customers difficulties say nothing admit nothing if you have to say anything tell them the dog ate the receipts come on frank dont bring your troubles in here troublefree zone this bar come on frank looked into the thin face with its dour smile he had been nursing a pint for half an hour the regular gang was in and there had been whispering before the landlord had come over with the cloth to wipe the spotless table it had been good of martindale to fetch him up to the bar vince cuffed his shoulder not right not that youve got the tax man on your back not you what about a game of arrows frank tell you each time you go for treble twenty you reckon thats the tax mans face last time they came sniffing round me i told them to piss off oh i can get down and do that chimney of yours next week dont think id forgotten vince was the local jobbing builder a oneman band the previous novembers big storm had shifted some of the roof tiles and hed gone up a ladder in the wind and rain with the surefoot grip of a mountain goat if hed waited for the storm to blow out the rain would have been in the attic and dripped into their bedroom and it would have been a hell of a big job vince talked too much played at being a hard man but wasnt it embarrassed frank that hed brought his problems into the pub if a guy was asked here how he was he was supposed to say he was fine if he was asked if he was well he was supposed to say he was in good shape everyone there had problems came in for a drink to forget them there was a short awkward silence then gussie said shall we throw together why not gussie youve an education do you know about australia frank im thinking of going there next year what a team you and me you take first throw if it dries up a bit a couple of weeks ill be down to dig your garden you should be thinking of getting your vegetables in gussie passed him the darts he was a big strapping amiable youth thick as a railway sleeper not the full shilling but he kept his mother and the younger children on the pittance he earned as a labourer in the piggery he propped up the bar most nights and talked to the older men as a breadwinning equal he dug the vegetable garden in less than half the time it would have taken frank and charged too little nice boy but hed never get to australia paul took the empty glass from his hand no argument my shout be a pint right youve had one quiet one time now for three noisy ones right frank thats very kind of you paul thanks im thinking of coopting you on to the villagehall committee you being an engineer wont be any problem theyll do what i tell them placell fall down if we dont do something and im the only one with the wit to realize it i reckon wed work well together being friends of course id take the main decisions you up for it be pleased to help paul was not the chairman of the villagehall committee or of the parish council but his way always won through because he was better briefed than any of the others his life was the village as had been his fathers and grandfathers inquisitive but harmless if his ego was massaged he gave his friendship without condition and frank perry former salesman could manipulate vanity with the best of them he even quite liked the man he played darts with vince gussie and paul through the evening he didnt talk much but let the conversation ripple round him and warm him you heard paul whats happened at rose cottage heard it was under offer do you know what they were asking gussie chipped in i was told it was over a hundred grand and theres more to be spent the last thing this place needs is more bloody foreigners no offence frank we only want people here who know our ways and respect them as the games were restarted as the pints kept coming frank threw more accurately it was his home his friends were the publican the jobbing builder the piggery labourer the big man of the villagehall committee and the parish council god he needed friends because there was a bluejacketed pamphlet hidden among his papers where meryl wouldnt find it he and gussie lost both their games and it didnt matter to him he stepped out into the night they were going their own way and behind him martindale was switching off the bar lights his friends shouted encouragement to him good luck frank keep smiling frank ill be in touch about the hall look after yourself for a year he had been without friends from the time the last of the minders had driven away left him to his own devices until the day he had come with meryl and bought the house on the green with a view to the sea twelve endless months he had been without friends he had lived in a onebed roomed flat in a new block a couple of streets away from the centre of suburban croydon in all those months trying to wear his new identity he had never allowed himself more than half a dozen words on the stairs with any of the other tenants they might have been good kindly warm people but he hadnt felt the confidence to test them fear of a slip of a single mistake had isolated him the first christmas had hurt no contact with his son he hadnt sent a present no cards hanging from ribbons no visit to his father and mother in the lake district for the new year through that twentyfour hours he had sat alone in the flat and listened to the televisions the laughter the cheerfulness echoing up the stairwell and hed seen people arriving arms loaded with wrapped presents his company had been a bottle when he ventured out to pubs as the evenings lengthened he always took a chair and table furthest from the bar and the camaraderie he had learned that he mattered to no one he had sunk the signs were clear enough to him and it had taken a supreme effort to shake off the loneliness he had started to read the trade magazines and look for small freelance work the second company hed visited had employed meryl he could remember so clearly that he had bounced away from the companys offices with a contract in his pocket and her smile in his mind he waved over his shoulder and their laughter fun among friends roared after him he walked on and wondered where he would find an old wingmirror to lash to a bamboo pole what makes you think mr markham that you have any of the qualifications required for modern banking im used to highpressure work it matters when i make decisions that ive chosen the correct option i can work on my own and i can work with a team she sat wrong way round on the chair leaned on the back of it splayed her legs either side of the seat so that her skirt rode up balls about highpressure work but the right sort of balls hit team its an emphasis word they like that why mr markham do you wish to walk away from the security ha ha of safe civilservice employment you could join us you could be found unsuitable and out on your ear with your bridges burned why my present work and youll respect that im bound by confidentiality has been challenging and responsible but the nature of the beast its limited im capable of spending more time in the fast lane i dont expect to be found unsuitable great thats what they want arrogance and they want the rounded man mr markham what are your hobbies recreations shit it was the telephone so they dont want to hear about herefordshire churches no the telephone stayed ringing hillwalking give them longdistance hillwalking exploring the inner man you cant move for bloody bankers on snowdonia or ben nevis for christs sake and skiing he couldnt ignore any longer the ring of the telephone bell ill field it it was fenton opening with a caustic savage quip about clockwatching had he gone on the stroke of five he was to get back in soonest there was no apology for the time of night at which he was summoned back he left vicky if hed stayed longer shed have killed him or lifted the skirt higher he drove into central london against the homeward traffic from the theatres and the restaurants he parked on a double yellow as the big ben clock hammered out the midnight chimes fenton showed him the single sheet of paper a special branch detective sergeants report of a routine surveillance markham knew yusuf khan convert zealot in the hizbuttahrir pupil of sheik amir muhammad cleaner at nottingham university knew him as well as he knew a hundred others from the files the report was the familiar story of a fuckup the target had been followed lost not found again while he was followed before he was lost hed been on a shopping jaunt a cleaner no skills at the university took home not more than a week after stoppages three weeks wages gone in an outdoors shop cash and out of generosity because the boots wouldnt have fitted and the book there was a giant wall map in fentons room floor to ceiling which montgomery would have appreciated or perhaps wellington fenton used a snooker cue to do the business its end rapped the area covered by the guidebook north suffolk then stabbed a line where land became sea and rested there the guidebook covered a deadend place a onestreet hole he held in his hand the routine report from special branch and he felt the night cold id ring her if i were you geoff and postpone the nookie and dont get to be a timekeeper fenton smirked go to work because i want it on my desk at lunchtime the threat what it is where its coming from he had said it himself he chose well if he wont run the cue end was beside the name of the village which a man wouldnt leave where a home was protected only by a door with a new lock and an old bolt the wind whipped about him and snatched at his coat he was alone in the darkness the sea cried beneath him and he sat on the deck far forward of the lights of the tankers bridge the night hours were precious to him when he could escape from the claustrophobic confines of the cabin which was like a prison cell during daylight because he had been told he must not attract the crews attention he stayed there until darkness came and then he slipped out glided silently along the hushed corridors of the accommodahon block and eased open the watertight door that led to the wide length of the deck space above the crudes tanks in the night in the darkness with the great throbbing power beneath him he felt the strength of his people and of his god frank perry had walked for nearly an hour past the green down to the darkened boatyard with the stilted walkways over the river mud then out on the raised path towards the northmarsh he was at the place where the tidal river merged with the inland water mass and the slowswaying reedbeds there was a crescent moon up and a shallow light on the beds the silence was broken only when he disturbed a swan that clattered screaming away he rehearsed what he would say what he would tell her and he peed the beer out of his bladder and into the still water at his feet if they had had their way fenton and the younger man who had not spoken then he meryl and her boy would by now have been rootless flotsam maybe they would have been in an hotel or an army camp or in an empty chalet complex that was available because the holidaymakers had not yet come there would be nothing to hold on to but the handles of packed suitcases for ever if he had moved her on if they were now in an unknown bed listening for danger in the night alone perhaps she would have stayed with him for three months a year but finally she would have gone it was his home and her home and her sons home and he prayed mumbling that she would understand he would stay where he was safe where she was where his friends were and her friends he was drunk he had accepted two more pints than was good for him it was so long since he had been drunk the christmas before last lights on the tree stephen in bed with his new toys around him theyd shared a bottle of whisky sprawled on the sofa her head on his waist and stayed there until the bottle was finished then helped each other up the stairs tittering he had thought himself blessed but he could remember as clearly when he had thought himself cursed it was the second night after the minders had checked him into an army barracks and at his insistence they had permitted him a single phone call theyd huffed complained left him in no doubt that they were doing him a great favour and would only drop the rule book that once perry had rung his father every moment of the call was seared sharply in his memory hello dad its gavin dad please dont interrupt me and dont ask me questions and dont try to trace this number because its exdirectory and youll only waste your time ive had a difficulty overseas and im changing my identity i dont exist any more i have a new name and am starting out on a new life ive left home they dont know where i am i wont be able to make contact again its for the best if i came to see you and mum id be endangering you as much as myself dont please think badly of me there were good times and we should all cling to them i dont know what the future holds but i wont ever forget your and mums love for me forgive me dad im not gavin any more hes gone look after yourself dad and kiss mum for me hed rung off the minders had been round him and theyd nodded coolly as he put down the phone implying that hed done well without bothering to say so his father had never spoken there had been only the silence in his ear that silence on the line had been the moment when hed known he was cursed he would not quit again he listened to the retreating cry of the swan watched its ghostliness over the reedbeds and the quiet water and turned for home his car was parked in front of the house he paused beside it then crouched and felt with his fingers into the hidden space above the front near side wheel for a bag of sugar got a flat one got a puncture jerry wroughton stood in his door holding his cat a spiteful little beast that killed songbirds his neighbour always put it out last thing at night he lied thought i had false alarm the cat was dropped and ran to the cover of darkness wroughton asked are you all right youve not looked yourself the last few days frank havent i he straightened and rubbed the dirt off his hands what i wanted to say and mary if theres anything wrong and we can help youve only to shout do i look that bad you said it chief pretty grotty just yell its what neighbours are for thanks jerry ill remember that youre very kind both of you i appreciate it he went inside locked the door and pushed the bolt over he went to bed alone his back to hers cold he would tell her in the morning it could wait until then chapter four they walked on the beach their feet crunching on the smoothed stones of red agate opaque quartz and pink granite and on the pebbles of cysterine slate and torridonian rock and on the broken scallop whelk and mussel shells he did not speak until they were quite alone away from a pair of winter shore anglers with their long rods resting on triangles of gawky legs away from a woman and her toddler who threw flat stones that bounced then sank into the first wave line and away from the sight of their village behind the sea barrier of raised shifting rocks away from the world he had told her at the house on the green that he was ready to talk she had made two curt telephone calls to cancel her commitments for the morning and she had seen her boy stephen charge for a sort of freedom into the carstairs car they walked together but they were apart her hands were deep in the pockets of her coat as if she intended to prevent him taking her fingers in his perry didnt work his way round to it there was no delicacy no subtlety it would have been kinder to her if he had come upon it slowly but kindness wasnt in his script he wanted the weight of deceit off his back you tell a lie and each day it is harder to retract the lie breeds a life of its own you get so that the lie becomes the truth you become comfortable with it even though you dread the moment the lie will be found out the lie is easy at the beginning but it becomes gradually more and more the hell that you carry he paused stared at the stones and shells under his feet then pressed on frank perry is a fraud and doesnt exist a woman gave me that name she asked if it was all right for me and i said that i didnt care i had a new name new numbers a new life it was to block out the past he wanted to reach her to close the gap between them she was pale with shock never looked at him the waves beside them broke on the shingle pebbles and were spent on the sand everything i am telling you now is the truth my name is gavin hughes gavin hughes until this week was dead and buried he died so that frank perry could survive was buried for my protection gavin hughes was a chancer everybodys friend the good guy with good fun and good chat gavin hughes had a wife and perhaps she had seen through him and was growing out of love with him and he had a son gavin hughes had a job selling and responsibilities and was envied he was the good guy who won trust gavin hughes falsified the sale dockets betrayed all those who trusted him went and sold mixing machines in iran and reported back to the intelligence people everything about gavin hughes was a lie above the bluster of the wind and the rumble of the spent wave surges on the pebble shore were the cries of the birds on the southmarsh behind the seas barrier gulls and curlews whimbrels sandpipers and avocets wheeled and dived she never lifted her head or helped him the machines were for military use in iran it was illegal to export them for the manufacture of weapons and missiles all the documentation was lies i betrayed my company and my colleagues and they didnt ask questions because the order book stayed full and the endofyear bonuses kept coming i had good friends in iran kind ordinary decent friends and i broke their trust and gave them presents and sat their kids on my knee in their homes and reported on everything i learned to the intelligence people something was planned i dont know what because i wasnt on the needtoknow list i was told that it was better for me that i did not know there was a last visit to iran and a last debrief back in london and the links were cut like a slice with an axe gavin hughes died overnight i walked out of my home with two suitcases and was buried by the following morning whatever was planned from the information i gave made the death of gavin hughes a necessity it was for my own protection at the top of the wall behind the beach where the sea never reached the straggling plants grew from the stones glasswort sea lavender wormwood and beet as he had known the names of each of the integral parts of the mixers the screws nozzles endplate jackets the cored blades the airpurge seals now he knew the names of the plants and the pebbles what i told the intelligence people was used in an action against the iranians my life was considered in jeopardy i ran i quit for a few days not many i was like a package that was moved around a parcel in a sorting office thrown between military bases safehouses empty hotels i left behind my family my job my friends everything i had known and i started again and i found you with you i made a new home new family new friends i was so damned lonely before you came i have never been back i didnt tell you but two months ago i went to see my father theyd done that appeal what they put on the radio when a parent is dying and has lost track of a child imagine what they thought in the hospital an old man is sick and his middleaged child has disappeared out of his life i told you i had a business meeting he didnt die he wept when he saw me he called me by my real name i didnt tell him who i was and where i came home to you and the lie was alive again i thought the lie would last for ever he walked on towards the far distant bright little shapes of beached boats hauled up high for the winter it was a moment before he realized she was no longer abreast of him he turned she sat on the stones where they made a line against the wet sand that marked the extent of the tides encroachment he went back and sat close to her take a transcript spit pick your nose urinate in the corner anything is permissible provided youve taken a transcript fenton had said geoff markham was slumped at his desk he had spent the night at his desk and his head ached enough for him to have taken two paracetamols washed down with the corridor dispensers coffee his mouth was foul his socks smelt and he had broken his house rule there wasnt a clean pair in his desk drawer a runover with the electric shaver didnt help he was raddled fenton had been in at six scrubbed fresh following behind the cleaners with their sprays hoovers mops and buckets fenton would not have had more than four hours sleep and it didnt show the hookup was complicated they needed voice security and there were two choices he could go to vauxhall bridge cross and have the fbi agent attend the british embassy in riyadhs diplomatic quarter walking distance from his own workplace or he could take a cab over to grosvenor square into their london embassys fbi section and have the hookup direct to the americans office in the saudi arabian capital he chose to travel himself he was exhausted he would get more help from grosvenor square than vauxhall bridge cross a transcript is accountability neither party can then wriggle off the hook fenton had said what hurt most geoff markham had been asleep when his supe nor had opened his door by his watch he had been asleep for nine minutes woken abruptly by a little hacked cough from the doorway he had been up all night playing linkage with the small network of nightduty officers in london talking pushing trading favours with the special branch ndo and the woman at foreign and commonwealth and the man at vauxhall bridge cross the minute he had drifted off to sleep he had been discovered it hurt and wheres the zealot wheres his guidebook his known associates where are they fenton had asked a rasped voice through the night he had been searching for those answers alone in his small partitioned section his eyes flicking only occasionally towards the pinnedup snapshot of vicky he had been with the subfile on yusuf khan and with the motherfile of operation rainbow gold the motherfile was the net result of the most expensive operation in resources and manpower with which markham had been involved since his return from ireland rainbow gold was the setting up of a united nations inquiry front grandly named the united nations committee for the eradication of the harassment of ethnic minorities islamic rainbow gold had started up new york and london offices for unchem i resources had been found for the rent of offices and for the printing of the unchemi literature and the wages of correspondence writers and the telephone answerers manpower for the writers and researchers those who knew of it in thames house called rainbow gold a bottomless well in the budget of g branch islamic but out of the hearing of barnaby cox who was the suckling parent of the operation it was the only way to dig deep islamic society was damn near impossible to infiltrate the religion the culture the hatred of the muslim radicals in the united kingdom could not be penetrated by the usual triedandtested procedures researchers vetted and hired carried the literature to the selected mosques of the uk talked listened explained it had taken three years of resources and manpower for rainbow gold to begin to win trust and a desperate amount of g branch islamics budget so slowly water dripping on stone and eroding lichen rainbow gold had opened a small door into the world of the radicals they had tried with the irish with the committee of human rights for the irish in uk chriuk but theyd been too smart to buy it the name of yusuf khan formerly winston summers was a product of rainbow gold and the name of sheik amir muhammad the spiritual teacher of yusuf khan was from unchemi farida yasmin formerly gladys eva jones associate of yusuf khan had also been trawled in by unchemi it had taken markham all night between the nagging phone calls to special branch and the other nightduty officers to turn up the name of farida yasmin jones and when he had found it the waves of tiredness had caught him and hed slept markham said sb have a base camp outside yusuf khans place since they lost him theres not been sight or sound typical try and keep your eyes open or do you want a bed moved in with the sarcasm was the twinkle in fentons eyes associates just one a woman im about to get sb to put surveillance on her their los the big boy was out of london most of yesterday we picked him up at that study college at bedford that gets its funding from qom the little guy was in the embassy all day if i need you wherell you be mr fenton markhams father had gone to work each day in a worn suit with the fear of redundancy haunting him he had preached the need for financial security to the young geoff in his last year at lancaster university studying modern history he had gone to the milkround careers day the crowds of students had been thickest round the stalls offering graduate opportunities with british airways the big accountancy firms and imperial chemical industries but hed avoided the crush and gone to the civilservice display hed said to the earnest woman on duty there blurted out a whisper that he wanted to join the security service it had seemed to offer a winning combination of a job for life coupled with clandestine excitement the woman hadnt put him down had merely filled in his details and hed dictated a hundred words to her for the application about his wish to contribute to the safety of his country hed sat the civil service examination done adequately and been called to a shapeless interview in an anonymous london building his parents had been told by the neighbours murmured over the garden fence and in their street that theyd been asked questions about young geoff no skeletons had been found in the positive vetting because there werent any hed been accepted he had done three years as a probationer and dogs body of excruciating boredom in front of computer screens with occasional days for surveillance training and tracking eastbloc trade attaches across london everyone said it would get better when the probation time was completed three years of similar frustration on the russia desk but the cold war was over and the team had the lethargy of yesterdays crisis everyone said it would improve when he was transferred to ireland three years in belfast had turned up interesting and occasionally frightening work everyone said he should wait for promotion hed come back from ireland and been put on the islamic desk and in london his salary chit seemed to go less far every month islamic desk was hardly the stuff of defence of the realm and ran a poor third to the obsession with ireland and the east european culture hed met vicky vicky and he were engaged and shed found the advertisement in the newspaper and urged him to go for it he hadnt yet faced up to the big problem of when to tell his parents that he wanted to jack in the security service and go for a life in the uncertain world of finance they were so pathetically proud of what he did because he never told them about mediocrity and paperpushing it would have been cruel to disillusion them tell them that nothing he did mattered or affected an individuals life he could recognize the change in himself since hed applied for the job he was spar kier and more daring and quite prepared to ask the blunt questions that raised fentons eyebrow if its any business of yours ill be in my room arranging lunch dates ill scalp you if there isnt a full transcript remember what i said young man about us going into an area of unpredictability its looking like it might be a good deal worse than that the great leviathan shape of the tanker monstrous in the thinning mist crossed at right angles ahead of the course of the ferry it was huge against the size of the closing car ferry she glanced at it saw it merge again into the mist wall then turned away from the crosschannel ferry charmaine disappointed by another romantic culdesac pointed at the speck in the sky the bird flew low over the churning mass of the sea only just beyond the white whip of the ferrys bow wave the unsuitable object of her imagined affection shrugged just a bloody bird whats special about that fucking thing come on come on back down piss off she said and turned to watch the bird its wingbeat should have been perfect in its symmetry charmaine watched it through a film of tears its right wing rose and fell in a tired and flailing way and the left wing flapped harder as if to compensate she was on a high deck where shed hoped the amour would not find her and the line of the birds flight was beneath her she did not understand how the crippled bird had the strength to make the great sea crossing it was down near the breaking crests and the spume of the bow wave the bird dropped and the talons startled and outstretched would have splashed and skimmed the water she heard its agony cry and saw the frantic effort to climb again to survive she did not believe it could make the landfall if it fell again if the water covered its wings she wept uncontrollably the ferry sailed on fast and the bird even when she screwed her eyes to see it was lost in the bank wall of the mist stop the driver braked then crawled forward again do it stop stop the car the eyes of the driver flickered uncertainly as if an illegality was demanded of him but he had worked nine years for duane littelbaum and knew better than to question he stamped again on the brake pedal then coasted the jeep to the kerb they were on alimam torki jbn abdulla street dont look where i look maryellen take a point in the other direction fix on it dont look out of her window she took a point as instructed the telephone office at the far end of aldhahirah street he kept his eyes on the square between the central mosque the palace of justice the big souvenir shop and the mudbrick masmak fortress all the old embassy hands called it chopchop square there was a goodsized crowd word would have spread fast it was never announced first but the sight of men bringing out plastic bags of sawdust was enough to gather a crowd he had seen the man pitched out of the back of the closed van he recognized the prisoner and the colonel beside him he doubted that his ambassador had made the promised telephone calls or had bothered to pull rank in the long distance he saw the drawn frightened eyes of the prisoner and the easy stride of the colonel as if he were going to a picnic lunch on the beach it was the square where the crowds had gathered to see the beheading of the princess mishaal and of some of those fanatics captured after they had invaded the grand mosque at mecca it was where they beheaded yemeni thieves pakistani rapists and afghan drugdealers he lost sight of the prisoner behind the wall of heads and with him went the last chance to put a name and a face to the footprints they would never understand in the hoover building the assistant directors who flew to saudi arabia not more than twice a year and the desk analysts who never left dc why cooperation was denied him he dictated reports endlessly that were typed up by mary ellen cataloguing the saudi deceit and vanity that denied him cooperation on maryellens insistence they had gone to buy new shirts which now lay wrapped in paper on the floor of the jeep between his shoes he saw a television camera held up to get a better view over the heads of the sword the swordpoint would prick the base of the mans spine and the instant reflex of the man would be to extend his neck he saw the flash of light the rakban held high before it fell he heard the soft groan of many voices before the crowd began to thin and then the corpse was dragged away another man carried the head by the hair they would have had a confession and it would lie in a file the bastards would play their dignity and not share sawdust from a plastic bag was scattered he told maryellen that she no longer needed to look at the telephone office and instructed the driver to head on back to the embassy there was a message on his fax requesting his availability for a secure hookup he glanced at it felt nothing littelbaum had only old footprints to follow she broke the quiet she threw back her head and the auburn of her hair flashed she threw a stone savagely ahead of her towards the tideline who are you i am will be frank perry you never met gavin hughes this time i am not running what did they say she stared in front of her her eyes were redrimmed she allowed him to take her limp hand for what i did the consequence of my actions the iranians would kill gavin hughes he disappeared ceased to exist a new name a new identity a new home he would have been hunted but the trails had dried out were

done more i know these people you dont they look for an easy ride and me i dont know what it means saying that i will stay for you or stephen i do know its better than running ive done that it hurts that you kept the truth from me for fear of losing you the sea was grey dark in front of them the gulls hovered over them screaming her grip on his hand tightened and their fingers locked together and i told them what was owed me once before he had asked for what he said was owed him nine months after they had cut him off three months before he had met meryl exhausted by the loneliness of his life he had taken the train from croydon to central london and walked along the river to the monolith building at vauxhall bridge cross he had reached the gate been stopped at the glass window of the outer reception building and hed asked to see ms penny flowers did he have an appointment he did not did he know that it was not possible to come off the street and ask to see an officer he did not hed been told there was no procedure for such a visit hed said do you want me to sit down here till you call ms flowers do you want to call the police and have them cart me off and me tell them what i did and what i want the call had been made from the reception desk and inside ten minutes shed been there she was slighter than hed remembered her and had seemed older than in the heady days when shed bought him drinks and meals and made him feel that he mattered shed taken him to an interview room and sat him down and brought him a beaker of coffee and looked at him with distaste what did he want he wanted to belong did he want more money he didnt want money but to feel that he was a part of something did he want a job found for him he didnt want to be found a job but to feel some pride in what hed done shed looked at him across the surface of the plastictopped table and said you dont belong with us mr perry you are not a part of us and never will be on any given day there are on our books fifty men like you and when theyve outlived their usefulness we forget them youre past history mr perry shed shown him the door and told him that she didnt expect to see him or hear of him again and hed walked out into the winter sunshine the better for the crisp sixminute exchange hed shrugged his shoulders straightened his back and strode away he had broken the link and believed his dependence on them was cut hed taken the train back to croydon and reached the library in time to start his first trawl through the engineering magazines on the shelves turning the pages of advertisements his mind had raced with opportunities and plans for a new life for what hed done they owed him that new life which her rejection had sparked her eyes were closed his fingers played with the ring he had given her he did not know what more he could say and he waited for her to tell him whether she would go or whether she would stay classification secret date march subject gavin hughes uk national

ill come back to you fenton read the transcript and his nails worried at his moustache his brow was furrowed as if a ploughs blade had cut it geoff markham stood in fentons room and looked at the vinyl floor then at the ceiling where the cleaners had missed a spiders web then at the walls which were bare except for the leave chart for the section then at the desk and the photograph of fentons family he thought the transcript made poor reading when he had typed it up from the tape supplied him by the grosvenor square people he had thought he came across as an illinformed pillock a kid in an adult world fenton paced with the transcript geoff markham blurted do you know about alamut fenton nodded as if it was basic for anyone working the islamic road to know about alamut and do you know to what use was put the information supplied by perry hughes fenton shook his head didnt know and had no wish to what do we do now abandoning the rape of his moustache fenton laid down the transcript pages and picked up his telephone he dialled his pa in the outer office gave the name and extension number for the superintendent from special branch held the telephone loosely against his ear and waited markham felt so tired he wanted to be back in his own space and clear of fentons room where there was he thought all the fun of a mortuary chapel he had known bad times in ireland when the weight of responsibility had seemed to crush him but hadnt known it before at thames house in his mind was the pichire of frank perry defiant bloodyminded awkward obstinate like a vixen with cubs deep in the darkness when the hounds and the terriers came to her earth it would be different at the bank pray to god that he pulled it off at the interview different and better when hed stood by the door in that gloomy living room looking out of the window towards the rooftops and the sea he hadnt quite believed that the threat was real he could not conjure the image of a man of alpha quality coming he headed for the door ill be at my desk mr fenton ive got a mountain of work fenton ignored him and told the superintendent on the telephone that they should meet that they should consider a protection officer markhams mountain was a missing man who had bought allweather clothing that did not fit him and a guidebook and a woman who had left the address recorded on the file with no forwarding details he rang vicky said he was thinking about his interview said he did not know when he would be clear said it wasnt his fault not anybodys fault the call came through as she worked at her keyboard distracted her she finished the entry picked up the phone and heard his voice she had been gladys eva jones only daughter of a train driver out of the derby depot she had been a plain girl with poor eyesight a love of mathematics and a desperate loneliness her schoolteachers perhaps out of pity had concentrated sufficiently on her that she won a place at nottingham university she had clung limpetlike to gangs of fellow students and shed seen the efforts theyd made to avoid her one night second year drunk in the union bar they had told her to get flicking lost because she was so fucking boring and so fucking ugly she had gone to an abandoned lecture room to sob out her misery she had been the girl found by an afrocaribbean cleaner and she had wept on his shoulder it was he six years before who had taken her to the classes of sheik amir muhammad she had learned the five pillars of the faith the shahada the salat the zakat the sawm and the ha she had recited the words there is no deity but god muhammad is the apostle of god in her last year at the university she had gone to her lectures wearing the chad or the rou push she had felt the protection of her faith and the respect it gained from fellow believers and had taken the names fanda and yasmin her degree was mediocre but she knew that reflected the prejudice of her examiners she had been turned away by many potential employers but that reflected the prejudice of the management who interviewed her because she wore with pride her chad or her mentor had been sheik amir muhammad her friend yusuf khan and she felt herself to be safe in a world of enemies she had not known she was under the watching eye of an intelligence officer from the iranian embassy three years after her conversion when yusuf khan had appeared to abandon the faith forswear the prayer meetings of sheik amir muhammad and had left their small group she had been rocked at that time her own obedience to the faith had been total without yusuf khans friendship her own commitment to the faith had gradually weakened she had the intelligence to be aware of the change but she had tried her best to ignore the weakening at night alone she could analyse the shifting ground on which her faith was based she had wanted a place for herself had wanted respect at first the white girl she had been a prized convert and a focus of the sheiks attention but new converts had come to the small redbrick mosque and she had sensed she was no longer the centrepoint of interest even so farida yasmin had still been shaken to the core when the sheik with yusuf khan sitting silently behind him had quietly told her that she could best serve the true religion if she too were to seem to walk away from everything that was precious and reassuring she had not doubted them she had been obedient to their wishes she had felt undressed dirtied when she had gone for a job interview at a nottingham insurance company two years back dressed in a skirt and blouse and not in the black chad or she said her prayers each day at the appointed time in the privacy of her new bed sit home and in the insurance companys lavatory but the comfort of the mosque was now denied her for much of those two years she had been ignored no contact had been made at first she had been merely miserable then resentful the friendship of the mosque was in the past and the present offered no warmth because she despised the other girls who worked around her she had been given no explanation of why she had been recruited as a sleeper nor what would be expected of her one day until six weeks ago arriving back at her onebedroom flat from another days humdrum work for the insurance company yusuf khan had been waiting on the pavement for her after she had telephoned the company and pleaded a family bereavement they had driven north and the following week they had gone to the suffolk coast she did not know who had instructed yusuf khan to contact her but at last she felt a small sense of usefulness farida yasmin an unknown soldier of islam had just come back from the lavatory when her telephone had rung she hid her face from the other women tapping at their keyboards the virgin farida yasmin always felt pleasure flush her cheeks when he spoke to her because they shared the secret of their faith and the secret of their work against gods enemies tell me youre right and its not real they try to frighten you if youre frightened then youre compliant if youre compliant then its easier for them whats easiest for them is when you run if it was real bad real what they want is convenience i stood my corner and they backed off because they backed off i cant believe its bad real whats going to happen i dont know when i sent you out god im sorry i was foul a man came a creepy little bastard he came into our house and he looked around like he was wondering what sort of price he could get for everything thats special to us he left a brochure of locks and bolts and alarm systems weve to choose what we want and theyll be fitted theres a pamphlet he gave me with all the things we have to do its like being sick and listing all the pills you should take and how far you should walk that kind of thing look under the car with a mirror each morning dont establish patterns over regular journeys after dark go into a room and dont switch the light on till youve first drawn the curtains look for strangers watching the house and therell be a panic button youve got to make net curtains i hate net curtains i said you hated them please meryl weve got to have them why because because net curtains absorb flying glass its not much frank what we have to do its what he said you want to know what i think i want to know if youre going to stay youre brought up always to believe a policeman or an official i think as you said its a scare and theyre doing what comes convenient youve convinced me frank theyve got all the powers they want and if it was really serious i think they wouldnt have listened to what you said they would have shifted you its my home too and stephens are you going to stay i wont find another home i wont make another home not another home where thetes love where theres friends i think you were right frank it was just to scare you sos youd make it easier for them are you going to stay whatever you want ill do i can make a phone call i can have the removal van here tomorrow and we can pack the bags no goodbyes nothing scuttle out in the dark leave everybody whos important to us no explanation fear all the waking hours and no sleep because of the fear dont get to know anyone again not ever because youll be moving on running rootless i can make a phone call and it will happen and it will be convenient for them what do you want to do its our home if it were real they would have moved you youd have been kicking and screaming but theyd have shifted you the wind was freshening and the sea lashed the beach stones he wanted so desperately to believe her to believe her was to be given courage she held his hand he was in his cabin when the master brought him his one meal of the day a plate of rice and boiled mutton a bowl of spiced cooked vegetables an apple and a glass of fruit juice only the master had access to the locked cabin it was a womans space with bright decorative curtains a cheerful woven carpet and the photographs on the walls were of pretty views from home the masters wife would have used the cabin as her day room where she could sew and read and pray beyond the sight of the iranian officers and the pakistani crew as the master talked he ate calmly the next night out in the channel he would leave the ship he did not hurry over his food was at peace as the master again reiterated the procedures that would be used he knew they were planned with meticulous care he had been told in the airless room high in the ministry of information and security of the many people involved in tracking down his target and the thoroughness of their work nothing had been left to chance he had been shown the photographs and had been talked through the schedules it was the way of his people and he had complete confidence in the plan drawn for him it was the work of many effortful months and his own role was simply to conclude it later when the darkness had come around the tanker he would again slip down the corridor and out on to the deck space and he would walk far from the bridge lights sit alone and think of his wife of the mission that had been given to him and his homecoming when he had finished the food he passed the tray back to the master thanked him curtly then he sat in his chair and studied the enlarged photograph of the face of the man he would kill he had no cause for fear he had been told that the man was unprotected sergeant bill davies should have been watching his boy play football but it had been a pig of a day starting at half past midnight when lily had thrown two pillows and a blanket down the stairs and screamed at him that the sofa was where hed sleep or she was leaving four bad hours of sleep then out from home in southwest london and across all the bloody traffic streams to beyond east london half awake jazzed to hell he had been in the worst possible frame of mind for shooting if hed failed with the glock and the h ampk failed to make the necessary score then he was out on his arse for a month until the next slot came round with his personal weapon withdrawn hed forgotten until late the last evening to tell lily that he was in a shooting slot that he wouldnt be there to see his elder boy donald play central sweeper and shed screamed that it was the last straw that he was more married to the branch than to her hed never been a crack shot good enough on the heckler amp koch had the necessary score there but hed gone down the first time round on the glock he was the only one in the group who had failed with the handgun theyd put him through it a second time the instructors wanted to pass him willed him to get the score and the guys and girls from armedresponse vehicles and static protection and special escort group theyd all rooted for him but he had failed again midmorning the instructors had told him to get a coffee in the canteen that theyd try one last time before the lunchbreak if he failed the last time then hed have to hand in the gun and it would be a month behind a desk until the next chance if they knew back in the office about lily throwing the pillows downstairs and yelling about leaving it could be handing in the gun for all time because theyd have said his emotional stability was unproven he took the isosceles stance readied for doubletap shooting walking squares swinging to aim when the damn target swivelled drawnweapons position and shooting the last shot a mm bullet was on the line of the target circle in the figure shape ten metres range some instructors said that on the line was failure and some said it was good enough he had needed the last shot and theyd given it him he was thirtyseven hits out of fifty shots the bare minimum the bullethole on the line had saved him hed sweated there had been one little bastard off an armedresponse vehicle arrogant sod who had gained maximum score first time round and who had watched his final scrape through with a smirk damn all use as a protection officer if he couldnt shoot straight hed been toying with a bacon sandwich in the canteen his hands still shaking when hed been called to the telephone and the day hadnt finished with bill davies the superintendent wanted him back in london on to the branch floor at scotland yard a file was thrown at him hed been given two hours to digest it should have been two days he had speedread it techniques of iranian terrorism europe when he ought to have been on the touchline watching his son then theyd thrown him the principals file and given him thirty minutes when it should have been a full day and when he should have been at the flower stall at victoria station shelling out for the biggest peacemaker bouquet they could put together hed been with his signed authority down in the basement armoury drawing the kit the glock the glocks ammunition and the heavier firepower and there wouldnt be a call to a restaurant to reserve a corner table with lit candles the bloody awful day was coming to an end as hed driven down the narrow straight road into the village on the north suffolk coast he sat on the concrete and metal bench on the green later he would find a bedandbreakfast but not before he had absorbed the smell pace and habit of the village he sat on the bench with his raincoat folded on his lap and his glock in his shoulder holster under his suit jacket as the light fell on his day bloody awful days went with the job of protection officer and were commonplace in the life of detective sergeant bill davies frank and meryl walked back into the village as the dusk shadows thickened his arm was on her hip and her hand was against his waist they had clung to each other on the beach before turning for home vince coming back to the village in his van saw them and played a raucous fanfare on his horn it was as if they were youngsters in love and didnt care who saw them gussie cycling back stinking from the piggery wolfwhistled they strolled past rose cottage and the dark lifeless windows beyond the forsale sign perry thought it wouldnt be long before lights blazed there like a new dawn for a new family maybe there would be a new guy to drink with in the pub a new friend for meryl new kids for stephen to mess with not that he and meryl were short of friends and that was why they were staying the cottage was chilly and unwelcoming and he hurried her on they kept up the contact dominic sad and gay rolled his eyebrows gently and made a small grimace as he closed down his shop for the day the lie was dead the vicar mr hackett strode past them lifted his cap and smiled he held her she held him because they needed each other and had nowhere else to run they reached home and squeezed through the gate because neither would release the other a man was sitting on the bench on the green he looked like a salesman killing time before yet another cold call in the kitchen surrounded by his schoolbooks stephen saw them come in and the light spread in his eyes the poison was gone it was their home their castle perry had convinced her that they had only tried to scare him so that it would be easier for them and that the danger was not real in the kitchen in front of stephen he kissed her back in newbury his wife used to complain to anyone whod listen that her husband didnt notice women on trips away and in the office he had never played around because the job consumed him that first time hed met meryl as he was trying to put some purpose back into his existence hed noticed her as a damaged kindred spirit getting his coat off the hook in the outer office where she sat hed seen her loneliness it had been in her eyes and her careworn mouth and hed blurted out that since he might be coming back a few times they might as well get to know each other and hed asked her for a drink shed hesitated and hed apologized for his forwardness and then shed said there was time for a quick one when the works closed for the day their first drink and the attempts to find common ground had made them like a pair on an initial singlesclub meeting it had been a strange chemistry stilted conversation but each recognized the wounded solitariness of the other dinners had followed and pecks on the cheek and both of them had realized that they needed the other to put some foundation into their lives theyd bought the house on the green together furnished it and moved in the first night there with the wind on the windows and stephen in the next room theyd slept together and loved each other it had been accepted by both from the start that their previous lives harboured secrets the ground rules were set no inquisitions no interrogations she didnt ask where hed come from why he had no anniversaries no relations sending him cards and letters he didnt quiz her on stephens father they buried their past under their new happiness and mutual dependence he could justify to himself the cordonedoff areas of his life he was a changed man if anyone from the old newbury office a onetime colleague of gavin hughes had met frank perry they wouldnt have known him but the past seemed now to rush around him and he wondered whether an old lie was replaced by a new one at the last light of the day going to get a storybook for stephen from the living room he paused and looked out of the window the man in the suit the stranger with a raincoat loose on his lap remained motionless on the bench on the green chapter five the door opened and he held up his warrant card in better times lily had said it was a rotten photo that didnt do him justice that morning like as not she would have said it flattered him he was tall had no surplus weight with a pale face and cheeks drawn in under the bones his nose and chin were overprominent his hair was dark cut short and his light blue eyes were dominant he said briskly morning mr perry im detective sergeant bill davies he could hear a childs and a womans voice in the depths of the house he saw perrys jaw fall and then tighten there was never a right time to start the process of protection he thought of himself as a shadow cast over the principals life he could have come in the late afternoon as the family was preparing for supper and television or in the evening when they were readying for bed or early in the morning when they were starting a day at the breakfast table but there was never a best time to arrive on a strangers doorstep they called you last night yes sorry it had to be the duty officer but my guvnor tried to reach you in the afternoon and you werent at home sorry it worked out like that god help anyone called by the night duty officer the guvnor the superintendent would have been familiar with tact might have thought through what was appropriate to say and certainly would have had the file to dictate his tone but not the ndo it would have been blunt and to the point what the protection officers name was at what time he was arriving and goodnight perry swivelled looked behind him back towards the kitchen door and the voices davies said with confidence just getting the lad off to school its stephen mrs perrys lad right if you dont want me around for the moment thats no problem mr perry i can wait till hes on his way and then well do the business ive got my car here i can sit there it was all about getting off to the right start it didnt work if the principal refused to cooperate with the protection officer he needed from the beginning to set the tone of the relationship no call for diving in breaking the routine of the family jarring them then having to mend fences because there was a lingering bitterness most principals in his experience were frightened half to death when he first came to their homes the women were worse and the kids were the big problem always the headache best to go gentle if his guvnor had called there would have been a few crumbs of detail on why the threat had ratcheted up but thered have been none from the night duty officer the principals were never given the full picture not even senior persons in government certainly not judges and civil servant administrators and this principal perry was only a civilian with a past and he would get no detail the threat was not a matter for debate and discussion he had worked late into the night in his room at the bedandbreakfast and early in the morning before his breakfast on the file and the village hed had the electoral list the largescale map that showed every house digests of police and localauthority files on residents and had written names against houses only one property currently for sale was unoccupied with that mass of information digested he had made the plan of how they would work together him and the principal ill be in my car mr perry perry said in a low voice my wife knows the boy does not thats not a problem well let him get off to school then well talk hes being picked up the schoolrun in about five minutes you know where to find me mr perry there was a shout from the kitchen from the woman about the door being open who was there perry turned and yelled back into the depth of the house that he wouldnt be a moment there was defiance in his face there usually was at the start from the principals ill see you in a few minutes bill detective sergeant or mr davies please and you are mr perry and your wife is mrs perry its the way we do it he said it brusquely coldly there wasnt call in the job for familiarity what they said at the yard in the sb protection unit get too close and the principal starts to run the show that would not happen with bill daviess principal he had a job to do he was a paid hand and it mattered not a damn whether he liked or disliked the man he would tell him later about the workmen and the technicians who would be crawling round the house by late morning up the walls through the rooms in the garden there was no soft way of making a start the neighbours dont know no reason why they should were used to discretion the less they know the better perry frowned he was a moment summoning up the question then rushed it are you armed of course has the situation got worse the doorstep isnt the place to discuss it when youre ready come and get me out of the car the door closed on him of course he was bloody armed perry would have said all the brave things when the thames house people had come on their visit and been rejected now he would be realizing where the brave things had led him davies sat in his car he had a good view of the house and the green in front of it the road and the homes on the far side of the house the sea the car was from the pool it looked like any other vauxhall sold for company fleet driving but it had the big radio with a preset console linking davies to the sbs operations centre a fire extinguisher and the box with the comprehensive firstaid equipment in a metal container reached by lifting the rear seat central arm rest was a compact case holding a heckler amp koch machinegun with ammunition and magazines and a dozen cs gas grenades in the boot was an imageintensifier sight for the h ampk a monocular nightsight a bulletproof square of reinforced material which they called the ballistic blanket the gas masks and the television monitor with the cables and the headset bill davies waited by his feet was the lunchbox given him by mrs fairbrother at the bedandbreakfast and his thermos which she had filled with coffee black no sugar he had discarded the shoulder holster left it locked in his bag in the room gone for the waistbelt holster and put his loose change into his suitjacket pocket weight in the pocket so that the jacket moved decisively back if he had to draw his firearm fast he saw the neighbour leave for work with his wife bustling out of his weathered brickbuilt house before stopping and peering at him as he sat in the car finally the child ran from the house and into a car from the doorway perry waved for him to come inside davies of course had a trained eye for descriptions perry was of average height average build with fair hair and a face with no particular distinguishing marks he was ordinary and unremarkable the sort of man who was easy to miss in a crowd he took his time straightened his tie and checked in the mirror that his hair was in order then eased out of his seat he didnt hurry he was not there to be at the beck and call of the principal the glock in the waist holster lapped against his hip as he walked towards the door he would set the rules start as he meant to go on he went inside perry said softly i told my wife that the threat wasnt real then youll have to do a bit of explaining sir when the engine pitch changed he was sleeping he stirred in the hard bunk bed closed his eyes again aware of the swinging turn of the tanker then he wiped his eyes dragged at the floral curtain and peered through the porthole window beyond whiteflecked sea was a horizon of dark land browned cliffs yellowed fields and the greys of a towns buildings in the sea bucked and heaved by the swell was a small boat its blue hull lost then found as the spray broke over a garish orange superstructure the small boat closed on the tanker he was awake he remembered the tanker slowed to allow the pilots launch to come alongside turning to shelter it from the bluster of the wind he pressed his face against the weathered glass of the porthole and watched until the launch was under the sheer wall of the tankers side he imagmed the pilot jumping across a void of water from the deck of his boat to the rope ladder cavorting from the bottom of the fixed steps and if the pilot slipped in the night when he went over the side his god would protect him from his porthole window he could not see the pilot come aboard but he watched the small boat heave away and head back at speed towards the land he felt the turn of the tanker and heard the throbbing power as the engines regained cruising speed by the time that the ship guided by the pilot on the bridge with the master rejoined the northern lane of the english channels trafficseparation scheme he was asleep again he needed the sleep because he did not know when next he would have the opportunity he would sleep until the alarm on his watch woke him at noon then pray then sleep again until midafternoon then pray then sleep again until dusk then pray then ready himself they bought it i dont believe it but its authorized the faithful maryellen tore the paper off the fax roll thats just incredible they swallowed it youve got the clearance youre on the freedom bird tonight she laid the sheet of paper down in front of him have you enough socks the special agent riyadh of the fbi and his personal assistant sat beside each other and made a list of what he should pack and what he might need to buy in the embassy shop she wrote down and underlined the names of the pills for his bloodpressure problem when the list was complete she made the airline reservation the authorization is for a week is that ok book you back in a week he nodded agreement she chattered on dont you worry about me ill be just fine be glad to see the back of you for a week were behind with accounts filing all that stuff might just get the place cleaned out ill have a dandy time here but he was hardly listening duane littelbaum would not have paused to consider whether his personal assistant could cope with a week of his absence his wife esther was out in west iowa between audobon which had been his home and harlan valley where she had been reared she was in the world of cattle and corn had brought up two daughters and he hadnt lived with her not properly for a few months short of twentyone years it did not seem to matter to him or to her he went home to the roadside house between audobon and harlan valley every leave that was given him and every christmas he wrote to his wife each weekend that he was away and never forgot a birthday it was a detached marriage but it stayed alive he had lived his life for the study of iran those who did not know him the embassy staffers who passed him in the corridors or saw him in the parking lot or at the ambassadors functions would have reckoned him an academic eccentric and gentle they would have been wrong he played the dangerous game of counterterrorism it was a solitary workdriven life where victims held little relevance where the requirement for victory was paramount duane littelbaum had a light bouncing step as he left his office and went on down the corridor cheerfully slapping the arm of the marine at the grille his stride was almost a skip of pleasure his purpose in life through all of twenty years had been to put a smoking gun into an iranian hand if the chance came he would act with a ruthlessness unrecognized by those who did not know him well his finger hovered over the names he had written on his paper pad fenton stood over him geoff markham recited yusuf khan disappeared off the face of the earth sb have beefed up nottingham from manchester and leeds but they dont have him hes not been home since he was lost and has not showed at work the one associate we have listed is farida yasmin jones the convert but thats a problem because shes dropped out doesnt go to the mosque now and has moved out of her bed sit i cant trace her electricity telephone and gas bills for a new address like its covering a trail and intentional which is to me both interesting and worrying the protection officer given to perry hasnt called back to his coordinator its a slow haul keep pushing keep kicking bums ill be at lunch he nibbled at the fringes of impertinence thats nice enjoy it fenton grinned i will need to get up to speed i have a good feeling about this one in my water ive the feeling this might even be exciting im preparing for a jump on to the learning curve his superior had been transferred from the czech slovak i romanian bulgarian desk only fourteen months before which was why cox had been able effortlessly to win promotion over him markham thought fenton should have been on his learning curve a year ago he stepped over the fringes i am sure that mr perry would be pleased to hear that hes providing a bit of excitement you want to make anything of this job my advice take the heat ill be here where i would expect you to be markham did not look up fenton was going to the door whistling happily and he steeled himself mr fenton the whistling stopped mr fenton i know were in unpredictable times but i need to be out tomorrow afternoon for one oclock be about an hour fenton would have been looking at the photo on his wall of vicky the one where she wore the short skirt he asked going to get a little cuddle in to see you through the day i am entitled to an hour at lunch mr fenton vicky would maul him if he didnt put his foot down he said doggedly im not obliged to work right through a night but i did no call for claws geoff if you can be free then you will be sorry mr fenton its not if i have to be out of here for one oclock tomorrow clockwatching geoff does not fit the service ethos may be all right in a bank but secret work security work makes a bad bedfellow with a clock face fenton was gone geoff markham sat at the console and hammered out the text giant format then printed it he took a roll of sellotape from his drawer and stuck the paper to the outside of his door this project is so secret even i dont know what im doing the principal and his wife were subdued out of sight when the van arrived with the men from london davies jumped out of his car to meet them he took the foreman down the narrow track at the side of the house and showed him the rear garden the facade of old stone and gave him the sketch map hed drafted of the layout for the property and its interior two more men were at the front now unloading the cables and boxes from the van and unhitching the ladders stay ropes from its roof he had his own key to the front door now and took the foreman inside hed leave the kitchen where the principal was with his wife until last the foreman hadnt wiped his boots and left a trail of wet earth round the rooms they went through the house and the foreman never lowered his voice as he discussed arcs of surveillance for the cameras and the sighting of the infrared beams and through which upper windowframes they would drill the cable holes and which groundfloor windows and doors should be alarmed they came to the kitchen last she sat with her back to them didnt acknowledge them perry tried to make smalltalk but the foreman ignored him it was usually like that when the gear was put in and there was no easy way of riding out the shock outside the ladder scraped as it was extended the kitchen window darkened as a mans body settled on the lowest rung to test its reliability the wife had her head down and her lunch half eaten in front of her perry said i thought i had the choice on the new locks its a bit more than locks mr perry its cameras and infrared and tumbler wires and whats going on they were always worse more aggressive in front of the lady as if they felt the need to make a stand and pretend they were in charge the principal was not in charge not any more of his house and certainly not of his life i cant tell you mr perry because i dont know and if i did i couldnt tell you he went outside there was a light rain falling and the sky threatened more another ladder was up against the front wall the cables dancing as they were unrolled an electric drill was whining through the wood of an upper windowframe it wasnt the job of the detective sergeant to feel sympathy but already inside their home their lives were being violated and this was merely the beginning there would be some who would say afterwards that this had been the war of fentons belly they were the bureaucrats of the first floor administration subbranch accounts tasked with the study of expense receipts and entertainment bills five bills in a week for expenses and entertainment handed in by the head of section g branch and the handwritten demand for reimbursement they would call after the business was completed for explanations and would receive only the vaguest information of what had happened what had been at stake and its outcome harry fenton would have preferred to walk on nails rather than go to vauxhall bridge cross with an invitation to penny flowers to join him for lunch he said it to whomever would listen often enough that the secret intelligence service treated the security service as lesser creatures he would not go cap in hand to ms flowers for help and information so the first step on his learning curve was to offer a good meal to the senior mideast terrorism analyst of the foreign and commonwealths research division they ordered and then she launched iran is on the move dont believe all that garbage the americans peddle about a dark bloodstained hand islamic and iranian behind every vicious little guerrilla war in the world its just not true iran is going modern thereve been fair elections a new moderate president a breaking down of the taboos of muslim life look you want a drink in tehran you can get it youll have to be discreet but you can have it only three four years ago youd have had a public whipping to sober you up the womans role in government and the civil service is advancing fast women now have power and there are fashion boutiques for clothes to be worn at private parties they are modernizing at speed and if it was not for the bloody stupid american sanctions they would be going even faster towards a viable economic infrastructure im a fan she chewed on the breadsticks with the same enthusiasm with which she talked fenton watching her and listening didnt think research analysts were overwhelmed with invitations there is much greater internal stability now theyve wiped out the mujahiddinekhalq very few bombs explode in tehran the monarchist faction is gone i accept that they are paranoid about opposition and thatll last a bit longer but if we break their isolation theyll get respectable quickly the americans forever bleat about statesponsored terrorism when a bit of hush and encouragement will do a quicker job than a stick we believe the importance of their guerrilla training camps is overemphasized we think they offer more training in theological correctness than in bombmaking every time a bomb goes off in america they shout about iran remember the kneejerk accusation that iran was responsible for oklahoma city ouch remember every american commentator insisting that iran had knocked twa into the sea you remember iran had organized the attacks in saudi but its nowhere near proven we think they give encouragement financial support offer a safe haven to dissident groups but that is way short of controlling them the americans need an enemy right now iran is available but the facts dont support the need she was greyhaired severely dressed with only a small sterlingsilver brooch for ornament but there was a twinkle of light in her face of course iran has ambitions iran demands recognition as a regional power and believes she has the economic cultural and military clout to deserve that status the current leaders detest the image abroad of a pariah state and they say they received no credit for a statesmanlike neutral posture during desert storm they deny they export revolution they say that all they export is oil carpets and pistachio nuts they say they practise good neighbourliness at the bottom line they cannot afford to offend the west because the west is the purchaser of their crude and without that revenue the country simply folds actually they rather respect the british admire us give us credit where it may not be due they have a saying if you stub your foot on a stone you can be sure an englishman placed it there londons awash with iranian dissidents but theyre alive arent they theyre not being shot dead and blown up we dont think they want to offend us quite the opposite believe me the shah was more neurotic about british intelligence and meddling than the present lot the shah said if you lift khomeinis beard you will find printed under it made in britain go to the trade fairs go to the queens birthday party at our summer residence youll find great friendship for the british they ate pasta the end of the cold war had been a career disaster for harry fenton he was of the old school at five a former tank squadron commander in germany eyeballing soviet armour he had found it a straightforward move into counterespionage when soldiering lost its glitter attraction hed been on major spy investigations and found that work totally fulfilling but the bloody wall had come down the enemy was now to be treated as an ally and after years of dogged resistance hed been shuffled to the islamic desk for the first time since that move he felt a fris son of excitement another hoary old favourite is weapons of mass destruction which gets everyone in a proper lather our assessment goes against the grain theyre way behind in the production of a microbiological capability research facilities yes but theyre not there on the chemical front and they have cause to develop such hideous weapons after the gassing the iraqis gave them they were making fast progress until five years ago then we dont know why everything seemed to stop it was peculiar and i dont have the answer theyre back on track now but they lost several years top of the list for horror stories is the ayatollahs nuke makes the americans wet their yfronts but we think its ten years away that it was ten years away five years ago that itll be ten years away in five years time yes they have missiles for delivery they can reach the saudi oilfields but theyve nothing that matters to put in the warheads anyway theyre not idiots they cannot compete on military terms with the americans and they know it theyre not going to hit saudi and get a bashing they cant defend themselves from is this a disappointment to you god look at the time my little white neck will be on the block when i wobble in smelling of your booze as if it matters she nodded enthusiastic agreement when he pointed to the empty first bottle then raised his hand to the waiter for another to be brought she had lamb and he had veal bear with me im getting there as i said the dissidents here are still alive how long since we last expelled one of their los for sniffing round a target six years ok ok there are plenty of disparate groups factions of their intelligence agencies that are not under specific control they moonlight but not on a big one would they come into britain and attempt to assassinate a guarded target no absolutely not am i a killjoy but i would urge considerable caution on you in the event that my assessment is wrong please if i am wrong dont go into the pulpit and denounce that country because you would set back years of quiet diplomacy and cut the legs off those we believe are moderates were not dealing with schoolbrat vandals who should be made an example of but with a nation state we have to live with damn good lunch thanks he walked back to thames house and put his head round coxs door he had of course a network of highlevel contacts he had been with a senior and respected official of foreign and commonwealth office and very illuminating it had been the eyes of cox the bureaucrat beaded on him do they believe iran is on the march coming to suffolk they dont no and if they are on the march then the fco pleads for a soft line difficult to take a soft line with an assassin fenton boasted ive several more sources that ill be milking if theres more to know ill find it the motivation that makes people fight in a holy war is that death does not represent the end of life for a human being the words were in his mind he had prayed for the last time that day the fifth time an hour and a half after dusk he had slept well and was rested he had eaten a small portion of the rice and boiled chicken brought him by the master he had sat for many minutes on the lavatory in the corner of the cabin until he was satisfied that his bowels and bladder were cleaned emptied because that was important he had stripped washed himself with soap in the tiny shower cubicle that had been installed for the privacy and personal use of the masters wife he had dried himself then shaved on the contrary immortal life begins after death and the kind of salvation that a man has in the next world is dependent on the kind of life he lives in this world in his mind were the words of the ayatollah who taught at a college in the city of qom he stood naked in the cabin the clothes he had worn when he had boarded the tanker off the port of bandar abbas and on the voyage with the wedding ring and the gold chain from his neck were now folded in the cupboard with the chadors and rou push trousers left by the masters wife he was a tall man metres he was well muscled yet weighed only kilos his hair was dark close shortcut but with a neat parting that he combed to an exact line he was paleskinned for an iranian as if he did not come from the gulf but from the sunbathed countries and islands of the mediterranean it was a reason he had been chosen the texture of his skin was the gift of his mother along with the jutting chin and the determination from his father he took his eyes deepset shrouded in secrecy he was thirtysix years old taking part in a holy war is a way of assuring oneself that ones immortal salvation in the next world is guaranteed his englishborn mother had been the daughter of an oil worker at abadan who had married the young iranian medical student against the bitter opposition of her family she had not wavered and had been cut off from all contact when her father and mother had returned to their yorkshire home there had never been reconciliation she had embraced the faith become a good muslim wife the determination of his mother to follow the road of her love lived on in the jaw shape of her son her husband his father had qualified as a doctor and they had settled in tehran with their child he could remember the unannounced visitors coming late at night to the house and the murmur of voices as the blinds went down in the surgery room he the child kept watch for the savak thugs the scum men of the shahs secret police at night behind the lowered blinds his father treated the patriots who had been tortured by the savak in the cells and who had been beaten by the savak in street demonstrations he could remember when the savak had broken into their home and taken his father away he could remember when his father had come home bleeding and bruised and hed learned to despise and hate the countries that had supported the corrupt shah and trained the savak policemen now they were dead suffocated in the rubble of their tehran home after the explosion of an iraqi scud missile it is natural that a man would wish to be killed seventy times and still come back to life to be killed all over again he stood naked what he would wear that night was laid out on the tidied bunk bed when the revolution had come when the tanks were on the streets and the rule of the shah was in its death throes he had dropped out of school going forward with the molotovs running across open streets to retrieve those shot by the soldiers he had been noticed he had felt no fear and it was seen when the imam khomeini at last came home he was at seventeen years old given a kalashnikov rifle and drafted into a south tehran komiteh he had been on the roof of the alawi girls school when the last chief of the savak was half hanged cut down beaten so that his leg bones splintered mutilated with knives lit by television lights killed and he had felt no pity he had been inducted into the pasdars joined with pride the unit of the revolutionary guard corps that safeguarded the imam at his simple home in jamaran he had gone into the embassy of the great satan into the den of spies into the rooms where the shredders had failed and the files on collaborators and traitors were to be found and he had hunted them the war had come the military could not be trusted the war with iraq was his transient route from teenager to man he had become an elusive skilled master of the flooded death ground that was the faw peninsula and the hauralhawizeh marshland he had come home his first leave in two years to find the dried heap of rubble with the small tunnel through which the bodies of his parents had been extracted after praying at their grave in the beheshtezahra cemetery he had taken the next bus back to the front line the scuds were fired with american help american satellite photography was passed to the saudis who forwarded the images to baghdad the hatred grew when the war was over and the imam had sued for peace and had spoken of taking a decision more deadly to him than drinking hemlock when he had come home he had been taken under the wing of a brigadier in the ministry of information and security as if by a fosterparent and his talents were let loose and killings followed in his footprints from what he had seen suffered experienced survived there was no place in his mind for fear this is the perception which creates the desire for martyrdom among muslims he began to cover his nakedness he wriggled into anklelength thermal undertrousers then a thermal vest he struggled into the rubber suit he had worn such suits in the probing fast craft they had used in the swamps of the faw peninsula and he had been in such a suit when he had first gone ashore on the coast of the eastern province of saudi arabia he put his watch back on his wrist later he would synchronize the time on it with the time on the masters watch later the master would send a radio message of seeming innocence to his employer the national iranian tanker corporation in tehran and his watch would be synchronized with a clock at the nitc and the clock there with the master clock in the room at the ministry of information and security where the brigadier waited later the master clock would be synchronized on a secure voicelink with the embassy in london finally the intelligence officer at the embassy would synchronize his watch with that of the courier on the shore everything was planned to the smallest detail as always he waited for the master to come to take him to the stern deck on his bare feet below where the wet suit sealed his ankles he slipped a pair of casual trainer shoes he waited for the master and thought of his wife barzin and their small home and he wondered whether she missed him they had no children perhaps it was his fault and perhaps it was hers but the doctors they visited would not tell them she asked nothing of him except that he should serve the revolution of the imam the tanker churned its way north up the channel he took comfort again from the words of the ayatollah from the college at qom he was vahid hossein he was the anvil it was a pretext but the first and there would be more the rain as promised had come on harder davies sat in the car he didnt need to wind down the window and let in the damp air he had the monitor screen on the floor in front of the empty passenger seat and the headset over his ears two cables led from the car to a small junction box screwed to a side wall of the house he was parked right up against the wall filling the alley he could see in black and white on his screen the neighbour on the front doorstep and hear distorted speech from the button microphone secreted in the porch the pretext seemed innocent enough sorry frank for disturbing you you got a philips screwdriver cant seem to find one anywhere sure jerry wont take me a minute everything all right everythings fine just wait there ill get it he saw the neighbours grimace hed have expected to be invited inside but the principal had learned fast and left him at the door the neighbours eye line roved over the front of the house and checked the cables the broken plants where the ladder had been and looked into the camera he wouldnt have seen the button microphone because the men from london were skilled in positioning them had to be because not even the principal knew about the audio surveillance people didnt mind outside cameras but they were generally difficult about microphones he could hear adequately anything said in the front of the house ground floor and on the stairs it was good technology and necessary there we go one philips screwdriver brilliant no hurry for it back great frank mary said you had a new alarm system fitted today yes something i dont know i doubt it jerry dont think me inquisitive frank not me but there hasnt been a burglary this end of the village in four years not since the doves place mary said youd put in the full works chaps like chimps running up ladders friend to friend what do you know that i dont eh just taking sensible precautions jerry youre getting soaked frank no pissing whos that joker in the car im right in the middle of a bit of work bring it back when youve finished with it no hurry the door closed and the neighbour retreated hed have been sent by his wife neighbours always were hed report that he hadnt really learned anything that wouldnt satisfy the wife and shed be round in the morning to beg a halfpint of milk or borrow a halfpound of flour and theyd fret through the evening the neighbour and his wife about the cables and the camera and whether a wave of thieving was about to strike their small corner of heaven the boy came home and the woman who drove him gave davies a grinding glance before she pulled away he doubted this little place could survive without knowing every souls business his lunchbox was finished except for the apple he always kept till last it would be another hour before leo blake turned up to do the night shift he polished the apple on his sleeve and listened hed made his suggestion how they should tell the boy they might have been at the bottom of the stairs or just inside the kitchen his mother did it there were faint voices frank used to work for the government abroad hed made some enemies he did secret work and it was still secret and mummys secret and stephens franks going to be protected by the police just for a few days are we going to have to go will we have to leave here no her clear voice theres nothing to worry about we arent leaving our home davies put the apple core in his lunchbox the evening had come the car was parked in a deep layby used in the summer by tourists for picnics it was hidden from the road by trees and evergreen bushes yusuf khan had reclined his seat and dozed the small bedside alarm clock in his pocket synchronized to the watch of the intelligence officer would rouse him thirty minutes before it was time to move it was the most comfortable car seat he had ever sat in a bmw series with a litre injection engine high power high technology high luxury his own left behind in nottingham was an elevenyearold ford sierra litre underpowered and undermaintained the carburettor had choked on the mile journey to the northwest they had needed to call out a mechanic to fix it and had sweated to get to the hospital in time to see the target perry the car he used and the logo of the salesroom that had sold it to perry farida yasmins car was a nineyearold rover metro cramped and with a small engine good enough to get them to the car salesroom in norwich where a story had been told and information received and good enough to get them into and out of the village by the sea where the photographs had been taken that had lit up the eyes of the intelligence officer yusuf khans car was unreliable farida yasmin joness car was too small the cash float given him by the intelligence officer included enough for him to hire a fast reliable comfortable vehicle when he had come off the train it was fantastic the bmw but difficult to handle once he had been off the road and a tyre width from a ditch because he had underestimated the speed into a corner there was caked mud on the driversside doors he didnt use the radio because all the stations on the pretune buttons played degenerate corrupting music he imagined the man he had been sent to meet who would come out of the darkness the sausage bag was behind his reclined seat on the carpeted floor he felt a sense of pride that he had been shown such trust and yusuf khan dozed waiting he tried to concentrate but the words mocked his efforts they registered then they blurred their message was lost markham sat on the rug in front of the electric fire in vickys apartment she didnt like the word flat it was an apartment but the problem with it was the size smart but small as his was dingy and small neithers home was big enough for two so he read the books shed bought in her lunchhour and left for him in a neat pile everything about the room was neat organized like his vicky vicky was with a girlfriend at aerobics and then they would be going on for a pizza the books theyd have cost her a small fortune were on business management selfexpression leadership and finance hed have gone down to a library and borrowed if hed had time he tried to remember what she had told him for the interview he was geoffrey not geoff his father was in banking not a highstreet deputy manager out on his neck last year with downsizing his mother organized one of the princesss causes wasnt a twodaysaweek helper in a charity clothes shop he was ambitious he carried ambition round in wheelbarrow loads but the thoughts strayed back to frank perry there had been enough of them in ireland bloodyminded presbyterian hill farmers running beef stock over poor land doing evenings in the parttime military who were threatened by the provos policy of ethnic cleansing the obstinate old beggars had stayed put and taken a submachinegun out in the tractor cab when they went to muckspread wouldnt have considered quitting and running hed admired their courage what vicky had drilled into him he wanted responsibility what geoffrey markham wanted more than anything was the responsibility of handling the investment of clients savings nothing rash but the careful placing of their money and the safeguarding of their pension schemes he was not frightened of responsibility nor if the markets slumped of crisis and geoff markham couldnt cling to the interviews strands always bloody damn frightening when a player went missing and yusuf khan was missing like he had been bloody frightened in ireland when a provo player disappeared and they had no word had to wait for the semtex to detonate or the blood to drip on the pavement and they had lost the trail of the girl who was the only associate thrown up by rainbow gold wavering back with his concentration and he expected to work hard play hard had always believed physical fitness went hand in hand with psychological stability weekend hiking afterwork weights and tennis he was to decline the offer of a drink old trick with a friendly refusal and he was to be polite but not smarm deference and they shouldnt know it was the only shortlist interview in his locker he was to wear the new tie shed bought him and his best suit but he could take the jacket off if they suggested it though not loosen the tie and be sure to thank them for fitting him in during a lunchhour the interview was the next afternoon and he couldnt read the pages in front of him or remember what shed told him rainbow gold was gone cold on them without this job there was no home for him and vicky no bright ambitious future an armed protection officer was at frank perrys home of course geoffrey markham wanted a career in banking it might have helped relieve the frustration of his work if markham had had a really good friend at thames house it had been better in the early days when the probationers had hung around together and made a social life inside their own restricted secretive clan he had no friends now the probationers who had lasted were dispersed in the building and intersection friendships were discouraged the society was a mass of hermetically sealed cells it was not appropriate for east bloc personnel to fraternize with irish or narcotics personnel loose talk followed the old hands said the former friends were married off anyway had babies and didnt go to the pub after work but hurried home hed taken vicky to one insider dinner party which had been a disaster shed thought the men were underachieving and the women were little mice actually thinking about it the fentons of thames house were the lucky ones they had no expectation of changing the world and used the system as a personal fiefdom for fun and entertainment set around with rules regulations and procedures geoff markham believed himself a small irrelevant cog he would never matter and never be noticed he wanted out he jolted awake at the sound of vickys key in the apartment door at the end of his twelvehour shift bill davies handed over to dc leo blake checked him through the inventory took him over the camera controls the radio channels and the chart with the red lines marking the infrared beams how is he fine so far and her shes not spoken not a bloody word come again his call sign hes juliet seven bit lighthanded arent we maybe maybe not davies crawled out of the drivers seat and wished his colleague a good night with a wry smile he saw blake already pulling up the arm rest in the centre of the back seat in the small hours and davies couldnt blame him blake would be cuddled up with the cold grip stock of the h ampk what the trade called the master blaster davies had been promised that the next day he would be given a realistic threatlevel assessment but blake who was going to be alone through the night wasnt waiting for it he drove back towards the bedandbreakfast and the room where he would use one twin bed for the night and blake would use the other for the day and hed have to square that with mrs fairbrother lie his way out of it hed have a shower then find a pub in another village for his supper it made it a proper bastard when there wasnt a decent threatlevel assessment the master hugged him gripped the thick rubber arms of the wet suit kissed his cheeks and pressed against his life jacket the second officer and the engineer officer flanked him he had not seen them since he had come aboard fifteen nights before while he was kissed the master went again through the timetable of the dropoff and the schedule of the pickup he broke free stepped into the zodiac inflatable and settled on its floor of smoothed planks the whole craft was only four metres in length and he crawled forward so that the engineer officer had the space at the back beside the outboard engine the engineer officer reached out to him squeezed his arm and said that the wind was growing which was good it was good too he had been told that they were able to make the dropoff from the tanker when it was fully loaded and lower in the water the master and the second officer turned the wheel of the crane and the cable was drawn up further on the drum the four ropes from the inflatable to the cable hook took the strain then lifted them the pilot on the bridge with the navigation officer would have no view of the stern deck and the crane and what the crane lifted they swayed up above the rail and then the cranes arm lurched them out into the darkness they clung to the holding ropes of the inflatable he had no fear he was in the hands of his god ten metres above the water if the crude holds had been empty it would have been a metre drop they went down the blackpainted cliff of the hull slowly the tanker was now past the bassurelle light ship close to the sand ridge that divided the channel into the northern and southern trafficseparation schemes and under the monitoring watch of the radar at dover coastguard to the west and griz nez traffic to the east the tanker on the pilots direction would hold steady course and steady speed at knots and would arouse no suspicion from the men who watched the sweep of the radar screens they bounced on the water sank as the sea splashed over their feet and surged up as the cable tension slackened the moment before they were dragged along and then under the engineer officer unfastened the cable hook from the ropes they were clear the cable swung loose over their heads and clattered against the plate steel of the hull they were tossed in the white foam water of the engines screws and he did not understand how they were not dragged down into that maelstrom the tanker ploughed on a great bellowing shadow in the night he had been told that it was good when the wind increased and the swell was greater and that british seamen used the word poppling to describe such waves he knew the english language had learned it from his mother but he had not known that word when the sea pop pled it was impossible for the men watching the radar screens to see the signature of a craft as small as a fourmetre inflatable the outboard engine coughed to life at the second pull three kilometres back they could see the lights of a following ship the bow rose from the water as their speed grew they crossed the sand ridge higher waves there more spray slashing them they approached the westerly funnel of the trafficseparation scheme there was a line of navigation lights ahead the engineer officer throttled back paused and meandered the inflatable was lifted fell and corkscrewed in the waves before he was satisfied he was like a kid crossing the wide freeway road going south out of tehran for shiraz or hamadan but waiting for the gap in the traffic then running the engine screamed they bounced forward they went for the darkened space of the beach between the lights of new romney and dymchurch near dungeness he could have gone by plane or ferry or on the train through the tunnel but that would have exposed him to the gaze of immigration officers and security policemen no papers no passport photographs no questions no stamps he saw ahead the white ribbon of the surf on a shingle shore the engineer officer perhaps because tension now caught him or because there were only sparse minutes before they parted told of how he had been on the tankers when the iraqi planes had come after them with exocet missiles and of the terror on other tankers when the missiles detonated and the fireballs erupted he said that he hated those who had helped the iraqi fliers and he had reached forward with emotion grasped the hand offered him wished his passenger well and gods protection in the last minute before they reached the beach he told the engineer officer of a birthday party at a seashore restaurant and the bus that carried the guests there a long time ago they hit the shore the bottom of the inflatable squirmed on the pebbled beach he tore off the life jacket the cold whipping his face he slid over the ballooned side of the craft into the water of a gentle shelving beach he ran forward kicking his stride against the sea struggling until he was clear he heard the roar of the inflatables engine when he was at the top of the beach and looked back he saw the disappearing bow wave of the inflatable he was alone he walked forward blindly then stopped and stood stock still against a small windbent treetrunk seven minutes later on the hour as if by synchronization the brief twicerepeated flash of a cars headlights pierced the darkness he couldnt sleep watched by the red eye of the alarm he lay on his back frank perry knew that he had to live with the past because the consequences of his former life were inescapable there was no dusty cloth with which to wipe clear the words written on the blackboard the past could not be erased he had attempted it quite coldly he had changed his attitudes the salesman gavin hughes focused on work had never noticed the people around him he was now more temperate and more caring he had thrown himself into the life of the small village community had time for people and seemed to value their opinions as if that hardwon popularity was a substitute for his past he was he knew it a more decent man and it was natural to him that he should help others with the experience of his engineering background and cut the churchyard grass and attend meetings of the communitys groups but in his mind the words stayed on the blackboard and a newfound decency was insufficient to expiate the past a man had been sent on a long journey had travelled with a knife or a gun or a bomb to kill him those who had sent the man would not know or care that frank perry was a changed man he heard the boy toss in the adjacent room and he heard a car door opening the sound of a man urinating the door closing again meryl was silent beside him staring at the ceiling like sinners neither of them could sleep chapter six e went too fast on to the bridge and too late saw the twist in the road beyond it yusuf khan had met the man stood in awe of him he had come out of the darkness in response to the flash of the headlights just as the intelligence officer had told him he had babbled greetings to the man and tried to please him with the warmth of his welcome nothing had been given him in return he had been told sharply in good but slightly accented english that he talked too much he was in a myriad web of narrow sideroads and he was lost and did not wish to show it the first light was already a smear in the east he went too fast over the bridge unaware of the righthand bend immediately beyond it first the man had peeled off his wet suit then stood in his longtrousered underclothes and had clicked his fingers irritably at yusuf khan who watched he had been caught idle and felt keenly the criticism of the snapped fingers he had dragged the newly bought clothes from the bag and the man had cursed softly because the shop labels were still on them yusuf khan had torn them off before handing them back he had held the torch and passed the man the camouflage trousers the tunic and the thick socks the fact that the new boots were not laced provoked another savage glance when he had set out the schedule in his mind he had not expected that the clothes would be worn now hed assumed the man wouldnt be using them from the start and he had not expected that the man would demand the opening of the tubular bag with only the torch beam to guide him the man had been meticulous in his examination of the weapons he had broken open the mechanism of the launcher and examined each of the working parts studied them cleaned some with the window rag from the car and reassembled it because it was only a small torch beam yusuf khan had recognized that the man had worked virtually blind he had leaned forward anxious to please held the torch closer but had abruptly been waved back the schedule had gone the man in the fragile light had then turned his attention to the squat form of the rifle yusuf khan had never seen a man take apart a firearm and was amazed at the seemingly casual way that the weapon disintegrated into pieces each round had been examined before two magazines had been filled and the pressure of the coil tested by the time he had started up the car his fingers had been stiff and his legs taut and he had lurched through the manual gears the sausage bag with the weapons had been on the floor behind him within the mans reach as if already he was prepared for war to kill the man had leaned back in his seat and closed his eyes he was lost stressed when he came too fast over the bridge and into the hidden righthand bend beyond it as he swerved to hold the centre of the road the wheels failed to grip and yusuf khan stamped on the brake pedal at that moment the series bmw was out of control the car slewed on shrieking tyres across the width of the road he saw the pole that carried telegraph wires short of it was the ditch looming towards him in the headlights glare yusuf khan saw everything so clearly so slowly plunging into the ditch the bonnet going down the ditch throwing the back of the car upwards the mans arms went up to cover his forehead but he made no sound the car standing on its nose no fear on the mans face the roof of the car impacting against the telegraph pole there was a wild pain in his leg a fleeting sensation as the car came down crazily angled in the ditch his skull hit the point where the roof met the windscreen blackness around him and peace his partner euan would be in the shop cleaning the floor and the windows stocking the shelves putting out the icecream sign taking a list of the postcards that needed replacing the early morning was a precious time to dominic evans he loved his partner deeply but he also loved the earlymorning walk on his own out of the village and towards the southmarsh left behind in euans care was his dog because the sweet little soul would disturb the glory of the earlymornings tranquillity he was fortynine had come to the village and bought the shop fifteen years back with the money from his mothers estate for twelve of those fifteen years euan had been his partner he thought the villagers with their neanderthal minds accepted him and did not jeer at him because he had integrated carefully and made it his ambition to write down the old history of the community through learning the history explaining it sharing it he had won acceptance and he was discreet it was a good place to gain the sense of historys inevitability to recognize the futility of mans efforts to combat the power of nature in time the sea would claim all of it everything that man had built would crumble off these soft cliffs and be lost to the waves in the halflight he walked past the narrow silted stream that had once been a great waterway where skilled artisans built big ships that summer he would write a special pamphlet on the shipbuilding from viking to cromwellian times publish it at his own expense and lecture on it to the historical society but that morning each morning for a month history did not intrude on his thoughts it was the miracle month of survival and navigation the month when the birds completed the migration from the south seaboard of the mediterranean and the west coast of africa each morning in the dawn before the shop opened and each evening in the dusk after it closed he went to watch for the arrival of the birds on the southmarsh that they came from so far that they could find their way to this particular area of water channels and reedbanks was truly incredible to dominic he settled on the damp ground at his watching place usually he went to the southmarsh more rarely to the northmarsh there were godwits war biers and avocets but they had not come from africa nor the shelducks nor the geese it was a few minutes from the time that he should return to the village and open the shop when he saw the bird he was waiting for the tears pricked in his eyes and the sight made this gentle man cry out in anger the harrier flew low in tortured flight a pair had come back to the southmarsh three evenings before and their wingbeat after the journey of thousands of miles was firm true they had left the next morning for a destination further north it was as if this bird flew on one wing for all his anger for all his gentleness there was nothing dominic could do to help the bird it had come home it was injured the infection would be in the wound it would die a starved agonized death he lost sight of it as it came down into the reeds he wiped his eyes the harrier circus aeruginosus rust and copper feathering was the most beautiful bird he knew it would be in pain in hunger in exhaustion and he was helpless he went back to open his shop vicky slept as geoff markham dressed while he did so he played in his mind with the words she had written down for him made sentences for them i believe in the totally ethical use of finance a bank in my opinion should never deny the participation of the investor in the handling of his or her affairs money is for the benefit of the whole of the community not just for the wealthy finance stands at the interface of society and should be used to create general wealth and not narrow affluence vicky had said that he must use the modern idiom not the cobwebbed language of thames house he put on the new tie she had bought thin woven with brightly coloured stripes the intelligence officer in his kensington flat took the call the number of the mobile telephone was jealously guarded and changed every month and he assumed that the landline telephone was routinely listened to a voice of great calm spoke of a traffic accident gave a location of signposts a mile from the accident site and quietly told of the need for help in moving onwards deniability was the creed of the intelligence officer he took the number of his caller and rang off he threw on basic clothes he had not the time to consult tehran nor to call his colleagues apartment in marble arch it was his decision against every regulation of his service that he should take a personal involvement in a situation of emergency often his kensington apartment was watched there might be a car with the engine idling on the far side of the road to the front lobby of the block or in the sidestreet he went out through the fire door at the back past the janitors little locked room and the wastebins to further the creed of deniability he ran for a phonebox he called a number waited for it to be answered heard the sleepridden voice explained what had happened ordered what was to be done rang off walked back to his apartment he believed he had not compromised the creed of deniability blake told him that the woman in the house across the green had a big backside and didnt draw the curtains when she undressed and that was about the limit of his overnight excitement there were cats footprints all over the bonnet and blake told him that hed had the brute inside with him until it had tried to get into his foodbox blake stacked the h ampk back into the case and slotted it behind the rearseat arm rest davies rang the frontdoor bell as blake headed back to the bedandbreakfast the door was opened by the wife and from her eyes it didnt seem that shed slept she led him into the kitchen the boy broke from his cornflakes and stared at him davies thought he was looking for his gun but he wouldnt have seen it in the waist holster underneath the fall of his suit jacket she told the boy to go upstairs get his books ready go to the toilet get his hair combed morning mr davies and it didnt look to him that frank perry the principal had slept any better than his wife there was a dazed tiredness in his face i dont need to trouble you for too much of your time mr perry but you had rather an amount to take on board yesterday and id like to confirm a few points wasnt the easiest of days ive known but what ive said to meryl it could have been worse always best to be positive mr perry we could have run away could have turned our backs on all this from what he had seen in her face the hopelessness in the fall of her mouth he thought the woman was deeply wounded and he wondered if perry realized it not his job he should have phoned lily should have spoken to the boys should have he was hardly qualified for marriage counselling and it wasnt his job to try what i want to reiterate mr perry are the procedures and for the correct application of the procedures i need your cooperation and you should not forget that i worked for my country mr davies i am owed protection they faced each other across the breakfast table there was a tight curled snarl at perrys mouth he smiled defused of course mr perry if i could just repeat please you dont spring any surprises on me you tell me who you are expecting as visitors where you will be entertaining them that will be very helpful to me its a village mr davies its not an anonymous damn city our friends call by they dont make appointments were not an optician or a dentist he was generous he knew that the snarl was from tiredness and understood the stress behind perry the woman watched him her eyes never leaving him and i need to know mr perry your intended movements for the day are you going out where are you going how long will you be there who will you meet i need specific detail of your planned movements why he reckoned they were sparring and wasting each others time he said it straight brutally we have laid down procedures they are based on experience you are at least danger when in your own home you are in the greatest danger when in transit there are two points of maximum danger when you leave your home and are exposed as you go to the car and when you leave your car and wallz into a building particularly if that is a regular journey you are in danger en route if your journey is predictable i told you this yesterday and i am sorry that you werent able to comprehend it the danger on the pavement to the car and from the car is from a sniper at long range or a handgun used at close quarters the danger during a journey is from a culvert bomb with a command cable or remote detonation or from a parked car bomb get me if it couldnt happen mr perry i wouldnt be here the woman rocked on her feet as if caught by a shock wind but her eyes were never off him it was like hed hit perry in the solar plexus and his voice was quieter you cant search half the countryside what difference does it make if you know my routes he said easily i can plan in the event of an ambush where to drive to the nearest safehouse might be a telephone exchange a government building and i can have worked out wheres the nearest hospital jesus so if you could just tell me mr perry your plans for the day then there are no surprises meryls visiting this morning and shes got a class im not concerned with mrs perrys movements perry flared doesnt she matter youre the target mr perry youre the principal im here to protect thats my instruction are you going out today she had an antiquefurniture restoration class in the afternoon perry was committed to the school pickup can you cancel no i bloody well cant and i intend to live a life of course mr perry lets go over the route he was shown in by fenton and cox was hovering behind markham thought the man looked as if hed just stepped off the ark its mr littelbaum geoff from riyadh you told him you did the donkeys load so hes come to offer you some oats youre his liaison with us fenton said markham stood it was that sort of depressing morning where the pieces were obstinate and refused to slot nothing to report from sbs operations centre on the target juliet seven there was no trace on yusuf khan from nottingham the associate the woman thrown up by rainbow gold had moved from the address listed for her electricity and telephone bills but he had small mercies registration details for her car about as common a small saloon as any on the road the american had wild grey hair which needed cutting his tie was stained with food and from the tight knot seemed only to be loosened each night so that the noose could be pulled over his head the shirt was new but already there was grease on it he wore a brown threepiece herringbone suit what a solicitor might have worn thirty years back in north lancashire and the creases said hed travelled in it but he had alive penetrating eyes markham glanced down at his watch i apologize but i did tell you mr fenton i have to be at an appointment over the lunchhour and he added limply a family business appointment i cant cut it and i cant be late either fenton said dry i hope the family business is important mr littelbaum has flown three thousand miles so that he can offer us the benefit of his experience bring him back to me fenton and cox were gone he shuffled tried to tidy his desk space merely confused the papers and his notes would you like a coffee mr littelbaum only if you can put whiskey in it cant he said sheepishly at the donkey level its not permitted to keep alcohol in the work area id get a reprimand and it would go on my record not to worry where i come from its a capital crime mr markham in here im geoff please feel free then youll have to forgive me im not familiar with people who arent friends i take it as a lack of respect and common courtesy right now mr markham and im sure you know it youre sitting on the big one right now its all ends frayed and not tying i dont know what im sitting on ok ok the target hughes perry weve callsigned him as juliet seven ok juliet seven is he still refusing relocation yes what have you done for him we have given him specialist police protection they got howitzers they would have machine pistols and handguns how many markham said dispirited there are two each doing a twelvehour shift fuck its a matter of resources are you listening mr markham this is the big one i know him as the anvil i dont have another name for him i dont have his face he was in alamut did you read like i told you to about alamut of course you didnt donkeys dont have time to read donkeys just get the shit piled on them the anvil was in alamut i hate that name its crass and comicbook but its the name thats whispered in the souk in the mosque and in the theological colleges throughout saudi arabia so its real enough for me the anvil goes to alamut each time before he travels for the hit i know so little of him but hes the best and hes dedicated that he goes to alamut is important because it is the small window i have into his mentality please mr markham when im talking to you dont look at your wristwatch and now he is travelling and his target is your juliet seven before you rush away to whatever is important take time out for a little history alamut is a few kilometres northwest of quasvin where there is a terrorist training camp run by the iranian revolutionary guards corps at alamut nine hundred years ago hasanisabah founded the sect of assassins the modern word is from the same root core as hashish western scholars believed the killers were drugged or they would not have gone forward against guarded and near impossible targets i doubt they were drugged they just werent scared for two hundred years the assassins the living cult of political murder created terror from syria down through lebanon and palestine and into old persia because they had no fear of death and worshipped the notion of martyrdom he goes there to what is now a few stones on a mountainside unrecognizable as a fortress to gain the courage that will push him forward pretty damn easy to guard against a killer whos looking to keep the skin intact on his back but pretty hard mr markham to block the killer who has no concern for his own survival and hes coming after your juliet seven maybe you dont believe me maybe you need the alamut case histories to crank up my credibility markham hated himself for saying it but said it anyway dont think im being rude mr littelbaum but i really do have to go he was skilled at finding cover it was the skill that had dictated his survival in the flood plains around the faw peninsula and the water channels between the reeds of the hauralhawizeh marshlands and in the mountains of afghanistan and in the desert wilderness of the empty quarter and in the forest near to the village in southern austria he could find cover and use it at the edge of a small group of trees was dense thorned scrub he had gone so quietly into the trees that he had not disturbed the roosting pheasants and then crawled on his stomach into the depth of the scrub a rat had passed within three metres of him and not seen him if a farmer came into the field he would find no trace of him the rain dripped rhythmically down on him from the thorn branches of the scrub beside him was the sausage bag in it was what he had thought he could carry across country and still retain the speed of movement the cover was well chosen he had a clear view across a hundred metres of grassland field to an open gateway and through the gateway to the signpost at the crossroads he waited his stomach rumbled with hunger but a few hours without food did not concern him food was for sustenance not for enjoyment he waited he had seen a police car come down the road with a blue light flashing in the dawn then an ambulance his drivers pulse had been faint the breathing erratic and gasping the head wound bleeding it had not been necessary to finish the mans life he would not regain consciousness would be dead by the end of the day he had thought the man foolish and had then corrected himself because the man had achieved the state of martyrdom in the service of the faith he should not think badly of him the ambulance had come back through the crossroads with the bell going and the light brilliant against the dark rain clouds later he had seen a towing truck pull away the wrecked car there were only bruises and small scratches on his own body and he took that as a sign his life was in gods hands his work was gods work god watched for him there had been setbacks before however thorough the planning and he had overcome them he would do so again he had waited three hours and fiftyone minutes when the car finally came it was a small car old he could not see the driver at that distance it drove past the signpost and disappeared behind the hedgerow then reversed back into his vision the car stopped in the field gate the brakelights flashed twice he breathed hard there were times in the life of vahid hossein when his safety his life and his freedom rested in his own hands only and gods there were times also when he must give his trust to the intelligence officers who controlled him it had been written once you engage in battle it is inexcusable to display sloth or hesitation he crawled from the thorn scrub take no precautions for your own life he hurried through the trees and the pheasants clattered in flight above him he that is destined to sleep in the grave will never again sleep at home he ran along the hedgerow towards the gate he reached the small car he flung open the door and heaved the weight of the bag into the back the engine was turning he dived for the seat slammed the door shut and the car jerked forward he swivelled in his seat he sat beside a woman he sat beside a woman with the skin of her face exposed and her forearms and the skin of her thighs above her knees and below her tight skirt he sat beside a woman whose body was scented with soap and lotion she said its what they told me to do they told me i should give up the clothing of decency im sorry to offend you he stood on the pavement and looked around him there were no concrete posts outside the building to prevent a car bomb being left under the facade the building was glassfronted not heavy stone with small laminated windows he went inside and a pleasant young woman directed him to the lift she had no guards beside her and there would not have been hidden guns within reach under her desk he came out of the lift and pushed through an unlocked door there was no requirement for a personal security card it was what geoff markham wanted long after the ambulance had gone and after the recovery vehicle had towed away the wreck the two traffic policemen worked with their cameras and tape measures from what theyd seen it would go to the coroners court and an inquest and there were a hell of a number of questions to be answered a young black paying cash for the hire of a mw series and not being able to handle it writing it off and himself and the technical investigation looked to be the best last chance of finding the answers the two traffic policemen stopped work for a sandwich lunch one after hed eaten the elder one complained of his bladder and slipped through a hedge hole he didnt notice the canvas sack rammed down into the base of the hedge until hed finished and was shaking himself he would not have seen it if he hadnt been standing almost on top of it he bent and pulled it open the traffic policeman shouted to his colleague to come and bloody fast and showed him a black rubber wet suit a pair of trainer shoes and some squashed sales dockets before pointing down into the bag at the hand grenades she drove well confidently she was not intimidated by the heavy lorries his own wife barzin did not drive he admired the way she drove but he was ashamed that each time she punched her foot on the brake or the accelerator he could not keep his eyes from the smooth whitened skin of her thighs she would have seen him flinch and flush they called me when i was asleep told me it was urgent i just took the first clothes that came to hand i didnt find any stockings i suppose its what youd call bad he jab yes there was a mullah he had heard who had stayed inside his house for thirty years never gone outside his house never dared to for fear that he would see a woman improperly dressed bad he jab and be corrupted she kept in the slow lane of the wide motorway skirting london never in his life had he been driven by a woman the diesel fumes of the lorries came and went but constant in the car was the soft scent of soap and lotion she saw the twitch of his nostrils i went out last night with some girls from work one of thems getting married next weekend we went out for some drinks no i dont drink alcohol but i cant tell them its for my belief i have to tell a little lie i say i dont drink for a medical condition theyve told me to be like everyone else and that way i can better serve my faith and the revolution of iran i have to use womens soap and eaudetoilette if im to be like everyone else they tell me that god forgives little lies because of the persecution of his faith throughout history her faith it was acceptable for the shia peoples to tell the khodeh the halftruth in defence of the true religion he believed as did his wife so barzin told him that the place for a woman was in the home and rearing children she would be in their home cleaning it always cleaning it because they had no children to divert her his mother had been different dressed in good he jab she had come out of her home to help his father on his sick visits his wife barzin only undressed in his presence if the room were darkened when she changed the gears her body shook and her breasts swung loosely and he had flushed the most when he had seen the cherrystone shape of her nipple he would have picked the fruit from a tree in the albourz hills and sucked it turned the stone on his tongue and cleaned it then spat it out and then he stared straight ahead at the spinning wheels of the vehicle in front and the grinning idiot face of a child in the vehicles back window she knew i had the call i was out of my room in four minutes i told you i didnt have the chance to dress properly decently my names farida yasmin it was said that the imam khomeini on the drive from his french home in the village of neauphlelechateau to the airport at orly for his flight home and the triumphal return had never looked from his cars windows on to the decadence of the parisian streets had kept his head lowered to avoid the sight of impurity youve seen the mans photograph perrys of course you have i took it youve seen the picture of his house yes i took that as well i think im to be trusted he jolted under the law that was the basis of the state the sharia the testimony of a woman was worth half that of a man they were not of half value the crucial photographs of the man and his house she was beside him and her thighs were bare and her breasts bounced under a thin sweater it was written that exposure of the flesh without islamic cover can invite foul looks from men and invite the devils lusting he was dependent on her she told him when she had seen the man and about his house in the planning of an attack he had never before talked to a woman as his equal she looked into his face caught his eyes what happened to my friend to yusuf he said what he knew and offered her no sympathy she was strong he had known so many who had died young gone early to the garden of paradise she looked ahead you talk well geoffrey the man said you say the right things but i am not yet convinced of your commitment to them we get a lot of sincerity these days the woman said what we have to look for is when the sincerity is larded on like greasepaint markham swallowed hard anyway thats as maybe thats our problem to evaluate not yours the man hesitated as if for effect the interview had lasted twentyfive stilted minutes he had used all the words that vicky had written out for him woven them into answers and twice he had seen the little mocking glint in the woman eyes lets press on lets explore a bit more were not with the civil service were not able to rely on governments safety net were in a hard commercial environment a man works for a company does all that it asks of him takes his work home and frets over it is a good colleague and a pimplefaced creep who knows nothing of anything hands him a letter of dismissal without warning and a second letter of redundancy terms and hes cleared his desk and gone in ten minutes on the scrapheap for the rest of his life could you be the pimplefaced creep and do that the woman leaned forward are you up to that geoffrey screwing good employees lives he took a deep breath ive done it i know about it it got to be pretty much every day i was in northern ireland i ran informers thats playing god you make a mistake with an informer and you get him killed its not just killed like in a road accident its torture first with electricity and beatings and cigarette burns and then its the terror of a kangaroo court and then its a binbag over the head and a kick so that he goes on to his knees and the last thing he hears is a weapon being cocked theyre not good guys theyre scumbags and theyre so damned scared that they get to lean on you like youre a crutch you know how it will end and they do but you dont let them quit its expensive when they quit and theyre damn all use once theyre out of it so you keep your player in place and you sleep at night and put him out of your mind its your work and you dont worry about it ive played god with people who wont be getting a good pension and wont have only their ego bruised ive played god with men wholl have the back of their heads blown off and whose women will be spat on as the wife of a traitor and whose parents will disown them and whose kids will be ostracized for their lifetime does that answer your question the bleeper went at his waist the woman stared at him her mouth slack the man looked blankly down at his notepad he read the message markhamg re juliet get back soonest fenton he said im sorry im called back the woman asked to play god the man looked up from his notepad youll hear from us markham was out of the chair thank you for your time he left the office and waved down a taxi he was dropped on the corner and went into the building that had housed the last ten years of his life past the desk where they had the hidden guns through the security locks and ran up the stairs with the laminated windows he came to the door of fentons office and heard the americans quiet voice youll have a week and you should take this as the first day of the week in a week either hell have reached his target and goner or you will have him dead or in your cells a week not more believe me your countdown gentlemen has started and can i say youve had the luck of a break the like of which ive never had the question is can you use your luck the police uniformed and wearing bulletproof vests their handguns on their hips but their machineguns secreted in cases filed into the cubicle area at the far end of the ward for the hospitals emergency cases away from the sight of the patients close to the bed they unpacked the cases produced and loaded their machineguns the nurses came and went checking the purring equipment and dials on the rack beside the bed and glanced at them with raw distaste they found chairs and settled in their role the guns across their laps was simple the problem was away down the corridor where the detectives met the duty physician and the arguments began he turned his head and saw the cottage with the forsale sign and thought what it would cost to buy and repair it was the sort of home that lily would have loved and the village was the sort of place where the boys would have flourished but it was an empty thought because his job was in london and it was beyond the bounds of possibility that he could have afforded it it was the sort of place that some highflying bastard out of london bought as a second home for occasional weekends and they were the people he detested they were out of the village and soon into the narrow roads davies had the map on his knee perry drove if there was just the one protection officer the principal always drove he had jerked his coat back so that the butt of the glock was clear for his hand to reach he had the roadmap open and on it were marked the regional hospital fiftytwo miles away and the two local hospitals with casualty and emergency twentyfour and thirtyone miles away by now all of them would have been discreetly requested to hold plasma stocks of the principals blood group also on the map were airforce bases to the north and the southwest and a telephone exchange in the destination area all designated as safe areas of refuge its nice countryside its fabulous isnt it yes it is bill davies knew the countryside round the prime ministers bolthole chequers and round the oxfordshire home of a onetime northern ireland minister round the estate of a saudi fatcat and the countryside round windsor great park where the jordanian king had a mansion he knew about the countryside and loathed it he called it a hostile environment theyd come out of the village on the one long straight road and were now in the close highhedged lanes his eyes were on the hedges on the ditches on the concreted culvert entries on the trees back from the lanes it was the nature of the job and he regarded himself as professional and dedicated to it that the warning time might be two seconds or three and the principal wasnt trained to drive wouldnt have known how to perform the bootlegger turn wouldnt have known how to get to maximum speed hed half frozen just before the last junction his hand hovering over the glock when theyd come to a transit van half filling the road with the bonnet up and a man working on the engine theyd had to slow almost to a stop before passing it his eyes raked ahead you get out into the countryside much with your family not often youve got a family yes boys girls both boys what age are they if you dont mind mr perry he stared through the windscreen he should have cleaned it they all wanted to talk to unburden themselves with their protection officer and it was the route to disaster he was not tasked to offer a sympathetic ear ahead there were men and warning bollards and a heap of excavated road tarmac the road was clear beyond but one of the workmen held the stop sign facing them perry was slowing but davies shouted for him to keep going and they went through to a volley of rich local obscenities friends fell out and the rule was to keep it as a job the tools of the job were the h ampk in its case with the magazine attached at his feet and the glock on his hip he loved the job the pity was he might just love the job more than he loved lily how long have you been at it doing this quite a time good shot are you adequate dont you have to be better than adequate its about planning mr perry boring planning planning is the best defence against attack if there is an attack then the planning has failed what do you know about the iranians enough to respect them it was final and dismissive with it what he knew and wouldnt say was that the iranians were a different league from the provos the provos would back off from a guarded target find something softer he had studied the case histories of iranian hits not many killers made it away for too many the reward was martyrdom the message from the case histories would make any conscientious bodyguard nervous he read all the detail he could find on political killing it was his job they were outside a school and in a line of cars waiting at the gate it was a school like any other an old brick turnofthecentury building and a mass of raised prefabricated huts like the school his children went to parents were milling at the gate and inside the playground where kids ran and screamed skipped and swarmed after a football if he could he went to donald and brians school to pick them up but it still wasnt often enough am i allowed to go and get them dont see why not sarcasm like that was his defence you dont think ill be shot shouldnt think so he could have told him but didnt that the irish were gold medal standard at killing offduty policemen prison warders and magistrates on the church steps or in hospital wards or at the school gate they had no qualms about blasting a man when he wasnt taking the necessary precautions he said he would come with perry into the asphalt playground that they must lock the car because of the h ampk that he must have perry and the car in his sight at all times they walked through the gate the loose change clinked in his suitjacket pocket beneath it the holster was tight against his upper thigh he hung back and watched his principal before turning twice in complete circles to observe the faces of the mothers and fathers the grandparents the kids chasing the football he saw the way that men and women came to his principal slapped his back shook his hand and laughed with him the other boy the one they were getting home stood by the principal they came round perry like they were flies to jam and he heard the roar of the laughter a kid would have been the same age as his brian kicked the football high in the air the swarm followed the spiralling ball hed ring that night find out how donalds game had gone when hed done the shift with juliet seven the ball landed and bounced the bounce would take the ball over the playground fence out into the road and the traffic he jumped it was his instinct to keep a bobbing chased ball out of the traffic he was grinning at his own athleticism his back arched with the leap his fingertips pushing the ball back towards the pack of kids there was the lightness emptiness at his waist the gun the mm glock pistol fell from the waist holster as he landed he snatched for it it was beyond his grasp it fell away from him the gun clattered on the asphalt playground cartwheeled and came to rest away from the grope of his hands the kids shouts and yells died and the black shape of the glock lay on the asphalt beside the whitepainted lines of a net ball court the parents laughter and talk withered he walked forward half a dozen paces he saw the rolling abandoned football and the young old numbed faces he picked up the gun and the screaming started he saw the parents grabbing kids going down on to the asphalt and sheltering them with their bodies hugging them guarding them he held the gun in his hand the tool of his job and did not know what he should say perry stared at him blank and uncomprehending a great space was widening around him through a glass window he saw the grey lined face of the headeacher as she lifted the telephone he put the gun into his waist holster the first cars were already charging away from the school gate he took a deep breath then strode towards the school building and the sign for the headteachers room it took fifteen minutes to sort it he showed his warrant card made a telephone call to turn back armedresponse vehicles and another to verify his identity for the headteacher his explanation to her of his principals need for police protection was economical and bland he walked back across the empty playground they were all gone his principals friends and their children he slipped down into the front passenger seat davies said stiffly i owe you an apology mr perry that was unforgivable unprofessional you are perfectly entitled to ring my guvnor to request a personnel change but im a beggar bill so i cant be a chooser what id get might be worse than you the principal laughed with a hollowed echo thank you if you dont mind its mr davies i dont know what the consequences will be none forgotten just a little dose of excitement i have to tell you i saw the gun the gun was real but its the only part of anything that seems believable its all real mr perry and you shouldnt forget that the mobile telephone went in his inside pocket could bill davies talk no when could he talk in fifteen minutes would he call back soonest when he could talk in the guttering light they drove back to the village it was the second time he had asked the distance to the village she said it was six and a half kilometres by road he told her to stop then told her when he would see her again at this precise place he took her map largescale at four centimetres to a kilo metre and the sausage bag there were trees close to the road and he went for them he did not look back and he did not wave farida yasmin jones wondered what she would have to do to earn his trust and watched him until the trees hid him chapter seven well are you god its not that simple its black and white are you going im trying to be sensible are you staying i said i wasnt going i said i was staying what then is the problem the boy was upstairs davies had gone and blake was in the car outside they had come home perry had told meryl that the policeman had dropped his gun in the playground they had been responsible for a moment of blue panic that was one problem davies had come to the front door fifteen minutes later with another problem i want to stay so stay i dont want to go so dont go but im not told anything neither am i davies had stood on the step she would have seen the technique he used he stood on the step his body blocking the open doorway and he had motioned perry to stand back in the hallway he had reached forward to the switch and turned off the hall light perry had been in the shadow she behind him their bodies protected by the policemans davies had told them calm and businesslike that again he was offering his apologies for what had happened in the playground and repeated that mr perry was perfectly entitled to request a change in personnel and perry had shaken his head then the second problem was explained like a doctor at a bedside with a bad diagnosis to deliver clearly and concisely davies had said that there was an upgrade in the threatassessment level the property was to be protected by armed uniformed officers that premises for them would be delivered in the morning that there would be additional personnel mobile assigned to the village davies hadnt said it it was in his face but they were going up the tough road the easy road was to pack the suitcases they had paced around the kitchen and worried at the problem they had broken off the talk to eat with the boy before sending him upstairs and starting at it again what do they know they havent told me why havent they told you they dont explain they never explain what does it mean his voice rose if you want to go go i dont want to go can we then leave it im just frightened im frightened because we cant even talk about it is this our best effort at conversation everything i know ive told you lets drop it what sort of life better than running out of suitcases its home its our place its among our friends so leave it or go he turned on the television it was a quiz game and the audience bayed encouragement at the contestants going after giveaway money bitterly perry wondered how many of them could have answered real questions where was iran what was the government of iran what was wmd what was the requirement of mixing machines in the programme for the development of chemicalagent warheads and the requirement in the programme for the development of ballistic missiles what did they do with a fucking spy in iran the telephone rang the sound was suppressed by the shrieking of the studio audience she heard it and jolted but he didnt stir from his chair he watched the ecstatic faces of the audience the telephone rang a long time before she weakened and went to answer it she went into the kitchen and it was silent he could not hear her voice he hated the game show the moronic questions the cacophony of applause the curtains were drawn as the policeman had said they should be hed come into the darkened room and groped in the blackness towards the window and drawn the curtains then groped back towards the standard lamp and switched it on before they would not have drawn the curtains only their home tonight would have the curtains drawn the drawn curtains separated them from the village their neighbours and friends meryl had said that in the morning she would buy the lengths of net from which to make more curtains and the boy had been told he was not to stand behind windows when the curtains werent drawn where he could be seen she came back into the room she was biting her lower lip she was pale she shouted cant you turn that puerile bloody noise off he hit the mute button on the remote who was it one of your friends who emma carstairs what did she want she spoke deliberately but without emotion and without feeling emma has dropped out of the schoolrun with us we wont be taking sam she wont be taking stephen emma wont be coming to our house again and sam wont its dangerous to come to our house your friend said and shes not prepared to put sam at risk thats ridiculous he pushed himself up from the chair its what she said he blustered ill speak to her and barry she blocked his way she said she wouldnt speak to you she said her decision was final she said that if you rang her back she would put the phone down on you the bloody cow she said what did she say she said that it was selfish of us to expose others to danger then she rang off shes the only one were popular here you see he heard beyond the drawn curtain a cars engine crawl by and wondered if it were the armed police he felt the same chilly sweat as when he had come off the feeder flight and joined the emigration queue at tehran for the international leg as he had shuffled forward a small step at a time dying to urinate trying to appear unconcerned hed wondered then as he did now if the fear showed the last times the sweat had soaked his shirt under his jacket as he had presented his passport at the desk behind the emigration official were always the penetrating eyes of the pasdar men in their washedthin uniforms who leaned forward and stared in suspicion at the offered passport when it was handed back there was never a smile no farewell joke and he had walked away towards the departure lounge his legs weak fearing that they played with him and would let him go a few paces before the shout for him to come back each time as hed slumped into the aircraft seat before the engines gained power before the steps were taken away wondering whether they would allow him to settle before coming on board to heave him off hed felt the cold sweat because he knew the fate of a spy in iran meryl had gone to the kitchen and he heard her start to wash up the saucepans whos the p an sb sergeant davies hes useless whos on the other shift a dc blake next to useless whos in charge box totally fucking useless bloody lights get on through paget was driving the escort car with rankin beside him through heavy traffic into the road junction as the lights changed to red the prison van they followed had gone on shouldnt have the dozy beggar driving it should have checked his mirror seen whether the escort car was clear to follow but he hadnt no bloody option for paget but to break the red light and follow across the junction rankin hit the siren button and the cars coming at them across the junction from right and left were braking and swerving to avoid them all except one the car heading straight for them was a battered old cavalier with a toothy greyhaired black at the wheel they were two three seconds from a disabling sideon collision rankin had his window down the siren scream in his ears and the h ampk up the gun was racked bullet in the breach and rankins thumb was resting on the lever at safe as the escort team they should have been right up behind the prison van the guy in it was important a drugs supplier and a bad bastard on the daily run between the old bailey and the brixton gaol remand block he had the contacts and cash resources to buy a rescue bid which was why armed police escorted him each day from his cell to the court and back the bullet was in the breach paget and rankin were not there for the ride and they knew it the old cavalier was coming right for them on target for the drivers door if the bad bastard had bought a rescue the copperbottomed certainty was that the armed escort car would be isolated and rammed taken out rankin was close enough to see through the cavaliers grimy windscreen the gold teeth in the blacks wide open mouth and the big mahogany eyes rankins aim held steady in the swaying escort car was on the blacks forehead his thumb hardened on the safe lever if he shot to kill the law was bloody vague section of the criminal law act would back him if it were a genuine escape attempt and crucify him if it was only a traffic accident they were on collision course and closing and paget was wrenching the wheel to avoid the old cavalier might succeed might not itd take rankin about half a second to depress the lever from safe and put a double tap two bullets through the mans forehead hed get a commendation if it was a rescue bid and a murder charge if it was not and they were through the junction cleared paget was celeratmg like a mad idiot wrong side of the road to get back up behind the prison van and in their wake the old cavalier had careered into a traffic bollard the h ampk was back on rankins lap where were we joe no fast breathing no taut hands like it was a weekend runout with the wife we were on about who was in charge dave box what i said totally fucking useless whos the principal civilian ordinary an obstinate sod because they offered him the chance to bug out and he wouldnt whats the opposition fran hes up the mullahs noses thats bloody choice thats not clever when do we get there go down tonight recce take over in the morning from the halfarsed locals they had left a minor traffic accident behind them and were comfortably cosied up behind the prison van constables joseph paget and david rankin were a team and inseparable the driver paget was a toadlike man short and squat bald with a thick zapata moustache and he had been changing the oil checking the tyre pressures and vale ting the interior during the long wait at the court while his colleague had been given the new assignments briefing with the h ampk resting loose on his thighs rankin was a waferthin willow of a man with a brush of cropped dark hair the smoothskinned complexion of a child and a moustache identical to his colleagues anyone meeting them for the first time and noting their language and gait would have believed they made conscious efforts to ape each other they were both fortynine years old lived in adjacent streets in north london went on holiday together with their wives and grumbled with each other like a married couple they would retire on the same day both joe paget and dave rankin were considered expert marksmen but theyd never done it been on the courses been endlessly on the range been on every exercise but never actually done it for all of their training and with a combined total of thirtytwo years service with firearms neither had fired for real they saw the prison van go through the big gates of the gaol and swung away they stopped at a news agent and paget went in he bought three books of crossword puzzles some softdrink cans and two packets of sandwiches when he had come back up from the canteen and his supper but before he went to fentons room to collect the american geoff markham took a single sheet of white paper and the roll of sellotape from his desk he fastened the paper to the outer face of his door then scrawled on it with a black marker pen day one the fbi man had said it would be over within a week it was near to the end of the first day the american had gone off with markham and the fax purred on to fentons machine he thought of markham like a worrying dog at the heels of a sheep as hed rounded up the american made sure he had his coat gently chided him for fastening the buttons of his waistcoat out of kilter and done them correctly himself sheep were stupid and wilful a bloody nuisance and necessary he read the fax from special branch operations incredible an eighth wonder remarkable sb had done a deal with the local force must have been the angle of the moon or some such crap for sb and a local force to have done a deal he would have predicted an ongoing entertaining dispute sb would provide the closeprotection detail and had liaised with of scotland yard for a static uniformed presence the local force would offer armed vehicles to watch the single road into the godforsaken dead end and to cruise the area there was had to be a little scorpions sting at the tail of the message sb on own behalf and that of local force will negotiate with security service for budget funding during operation concerning juliet seven with view to reimbursement of expendihire it was the bare basic level for protection and it would cost a goddamn fortune and the resources bucket was not bottomless he pondered how to limit the extent of the commitment he put on his coat picked up his briefcase and switched off the light in his room the budget ruled his life and would until the day he filed his application to join the portcullis society until he joined the rest of yesterdays spooks at the christmas reunion reminiscing and carping about days gone by the commitment could not be endless and he cursed the bloody obstinate fool who had refused a most reasonable offer of help in moving on as if with a sudden afterthought fenton went back into his darkened room and dialled the home number of their duty solicitor harry here g section sorry to call you this late francis can i just run this past you we have a man who we consider to be an assassination target weve suggested he disappears and weve offered the means to do that he wont take our advice says hes staying where he is does the law provide us with powers to remove him forcibly from his domicile against his will and place him in protective custody i see assault civil liberties yes not on eh its just that these things are so bloody expensive thanks for your time francis and regards to alison when he crossed the silent deserted work area fenton saw the sheet of paper fastened to young markhams door day one there had to be a containment on the commitment or the operation would bleed his section dry he went out into the night he had walked quickly along the hedgerows and into what the map called sixteenacre wood and from the safety of the trees watched her drive away with his back against a big trunk vahid hossein used the last light of the day to study and memorize the map when darkness came and he could no longer see the trellised patterns of the upper branches he had again moved forward the map was in his mind he took a length of dead branch from the ground and used it as a blind man would he had friends who were blinded in the marshes by mustardgas shells and he used the stick in the darkness as they used their white wands in daylight the stick told him where were the desiccated lengths of wood that he could have stepped on broken left a trail he walked carefully from sixteenacre wood into big wood then on to common wood from common wood he skirted open fields and then he sheltered by a road and watched and waited and listened the caution was instinctive he had crossed the road and passed what the map called a tumulus but did not know what the word meant and then he slipped into fen covert it was in fen covert that he first smelt the salt of the sea and that he first heard the screaming the smell was soft the same as the tang off the shattalarab waterway and at the faw peninsula then the screaming had come again at the shattalarab and the faw when the salt scent had been in his nose he had heard the screaming of a man wounded or gassed and left behind in the retreat it had been his duty then inescapable to go back into the marshes to find a man with a shrapnelsevered leg or with the gas droplets on his skin and in his eyes he moved towards fen hill catlike and quiet where the scent was stronger and the screaming louder ahead of him dappled by thin moonlight was the open expanse called southmarsh on the map at the slight slope of fen hill he angered himself his mind had been on the scent and the screaming and on the ribbon of lights that he estimated to be three kilometres away when he set up a pheasant if he had been among the marsh reeds of the shattal arab or the faw he would have given his enemy his position it would have been a fatal error he stopped and stood motionless against a treetrunk so that his body made no silhouette smelling the sea and listening to the screaming the distant sound of a cars horn among the ribbon of lights carried over the southmarsh he found the rabbit its throat caught by a snare he did not use his torch but felt it first with his stick and then with his hand his fingers brushed the fur of the animals back and then came to the restraining wire the movement of his fingers caressing it had quietened the terror of the rabbit he held it by the fur at its neck and loosened the fine wire he could not see it could only sense it hanging supine from his grip because of his mistake in disturbing the pheasant his anger and selfcriticism he felt a need to reassure himself he killed the rabbit with a chop from the heel of his hand against its neck one blow he reset the snare and covered the ground where his feet had been with loose brushwood because at first light someone would come to check the snare he pocketed the rabbit dead and warm and moved on he came to rest in the heart of a thick tangle of bramble on the edge of foxhole covert not for hunger but to purge himself of his mistake he tore a leg from the rabbit carcass pulled the skin from it and ate it he chewed on the raw sweet meat it was important to him to feel no revulsion to be strong he chewed at the leg until his teeth scraped on the bone then put the carcass beside him and the cleaned bone and wiped the blood from his mouth the act of killing and the eating gave him strength the sausage bag was beside him through the bramble branches he saw the closeset lights across the southmarsh he had the photograph of the house and the man his hand stained with the rabbits blood rested on the bag and sometimes found the shape of the launcher and sometimes the outline of the automatic rifle he thought that it would be as easy for him to kill the man as it had been to chop the rabbits neck and eat its leg he tried lying on his back in the silence to think of his wife barzin and of the home that they shared and of the rooms they had decorated and of the possessions they had gathered together and of the shy darkened love between them but the bare thighs of the girl in the car intruded and disturbed him he could not shake from his mind the white skin of the girl and the outline of her breasts vahid hossein tried but he could not the bell rang three times meryl said she would answer it she said coldly that she didnt want to see him cowering in the shadow of the unit hallway again when the door was opened the detectives had said theyd use three short blasts on the bell when they wanted entry to the house blake was at the door and seemed surprised that she opened it his face fell a little when he saw her she thought he would be one of those creatures who expected only to deal with the man of the house blake said fumbling for the words that there were more personnel down from london uniformed armed and static and that they needed to look over the house she thought him supercilious he did not ask whether it was convenient but stood aside for them as they came out of the darkness they shouldered past her as if she did not exist and pushed the door shut behind them frank stood in the livingroom doorway she heard the names they gave him paget and rankin she grimaced a bitter little smile because neither asked frank if it suited him just said that they needed to walk round the house look it over they went together as if there was an umbilical cord between them they wore blueblack overalls and webbing belts on which were holsters and weapons and what she thought were gas canisters ammunition pouches and handcuffs when they had been waiting for her to answer the bell they must have been in the mud at the side of the road and the green and their boots smeared it over her carpet they seemed not to notice they looked around the living room at her furniture and her ornaments as if they were all dross and the glass cabinet where she put the china pieces shed collected and the pictures of the seashore prints by the local artist that frank had bought she strained to hear the murmur of their voices have to get it taped up joe too right dave nothing worse than glass cabinets have to get the pictures down what you think of where the television is not happy should be back against the wall right back shouldnt davies have done this should have didnt pillock i dont like all the stuff on the fireplace quite right lets do the windows the tall one rankin went to the standard lamp and switched it off she stood in the darkness and could sense the rising impatience of frank beside her could hear the sharp spurts of his breath the curtains were pulled back a faint glow eased into the room from the streetlights on the opposite side of the green she heard the scrape of their fingers on the glass and the window casing then the noise as the curtains were yanked without ceremony into place only then was the standard lamp switched on again thought they were supposed to have been laminated joe they havent got round to it the work orders in be done by the end of the week bloody marvelous i dont like that window dave not without the lamination dont tell me ive got bloody eyes what is it a hundred metres to those houses a sniper piece of cake or an rpg what you say dave piece of cake for a rocket launcher or a rifle god this place needs sorting out come on they did the hall the dining room and the kitchen frank trailed behind them and she followed she didnt have to ask everything that was glass china or pottery everything that was heavy and unattached would shatter fracture and fly maim and wound they said they needed to see upstairs she stiffened frank muttered that they should go upstairs if that was necessary but they hadnt waited for his answer and were already on their way up there wasnt any more mud from rankins boots to dirty the carpet they looked around her bedroom dont like the mirror dave it was the big mirror on her dressingtable tape it over she imagined the mirror where she made up where she worked the delicate brushes before they went out for an evening with packers adhesive tape crossing it look at all that loose stuff on her dressingtable were the cream jars and the glass eaude toilette bottles the vase of dried flowers and the silverbacked hairbrushes have to get it boxed up joe she would have to rummage in a cardboard box on the floor for her eyeliner and lipstick she imagined everything that was precious to her put away on the instructions of these men the pictures would have to come down of course the photograph frames would have to be put into the drawers and she wondered if she would be allowed to take out the photographs and stick them to the walls if they would permit that in the bathroom at the back of the house she couldnt have said they lingered on anything that was hers they were merely indifferent to each item that belonged and mattered to her better if they had lingered on them because then the items might have seemed important they went into the spare room and discussed what should happen to the pictures the mirror and the ornaments there they paused on the landing outside the last door it was as if they had kicked the fight out of her and the resentment was flushed on franks cheeks but neither of them protested she could hear her boys voice making the noise of a lorry they didnt ask her to go first or frank the short one went in the tall one behind him hello sunshine my word arent they brilliant great lorries sunshine proper little haulage business just call me uncle joe and im your uncle dave thats a real good one the seddon atkinson the seddys good dave but the volvos fantastic its a great fleet sunshine no sorry dont touch whats your name stephen well stephen you mustnt touch whats on uncle daves belt its gas its handcuffs and its the glock like what he did what that must have been fun sunshine you hear that joe ds davies chucking his glock round the playground thats nice to store away for when he gets all pompous i expect its time you were in bed sunshine the door was closed softly they had come she thought effortlessly into her familys life and brought with them their gas their handcuffs and their guns and in the morning her home would be prepared for defence against a snipers attack and against the devastation of a rocket launchers explosion when they had gone outside into the back garden she went for the vacuum cleaner to remove the mud theyd left on her carpets and before she started it up she heard franks voice dont ever do that again dont dare ever treat me and my wife like were rubbish were human beings and deserve to be treated with decency and respect this is our home so show a bit of sensitivity when you come into it dont look at me in that dumb insolent way just dont we live here if thats not convenient soft shit she didnt hear their reply when theyd finished in the garden and gone out through the front door and it had been bolted and locked again while she was in the living room with the vacuum cleaner she heard blakes voice you shouldnt have done that sir bawled them out theyre at the end of a pretty long day but dont worry they wont take it personally theyre used to principals being stressed up but you shouldnt have bawled them out sir one day you might depend on them to save your life one day soon this is not a zoo you dont come here to rubberneck its a working area youre causing disruption hed been told but it had slipped in his mind it could have been the fourth time the detectives had confronted the duty doctor but it was more likely to have been the fifth i will say when you can talk to my patient and it is the same answer as the last time and the time before that no my patient is severely concussed quite apart from the effect of the drugs alleviating the pain of a triple femur fracture no they were at the end of the ward beside the door to the partitioned cubicle geoff markham hovered a pace behind the two branch detectives the doctor was young harassed probably sleepwalking and on the edge of his temper it is not my concern what my patient is alleged to have done my concern is his health and welfare i understand he has been neither cautioned nor charged so he is in my care and i decide if he is to be questioned my answer no a policeman was sitting beside the bed on a hard chair facing the door his hands on the snub weapon resting on his legs his face impassive the second uniformed policeman sat outside the door cradling his own gun a wry smile flickering at his mouth i tell you its bad enough for my patients to have guns paraded around but right now they are trying unsuccessfully to get the rest they need they are not resting as they should be because this ward is being treated by you like a highstreet pavement just get out go away geoff markhams fingers were locked together clasped tight flexing hard enough to hurt he thought littelbaum was somewhere behind him the american had said this was the big and lucky break but it didnt seem as if they knew how to use it just listen to me you are interfering with the running of this ward i will protest most strongly in the morning to the administrators about that interference if the condition of this patient or any other patient in the ward were to deteriorate because of your refusal to accept my guidance then i will make it my personal business to see you broken get off my territory there was a dull blue sheen of light in the cubicle geoff markham thought could have sworn to it that he saw an eye glinting from the mound of white pillows the head of the patient the face that rainbow gold had identified as yusuf khan was half hidden by the left leg raised in traction the glint was momentary but hed seen it the patient now seemed unmoving unconscious the detectives turned away markham said hes fooling you youre a doctor familiar with this case history are you markham persisted hes alert listening hes feigning youre an expert on concussion you know about the effects of paindepressant drugs what i am telling you no i do the telling on my ward and i am telling you to get out markham spat there could be blood on your hands i doubt it a man could be murdered because of your refusal get out he had failed to exploit the break the faces of the uniformed policemen were expressionless as though they didnt need to tell him that hed made a right idiot of himself geoff markham turned angrily and walked up the central aisle of the ward towards the low light at the far end where the night sister sat at her table the detectives were alongside and he could hear the soft pad of the doctor behind him he saw the american sitting on a visitors chair in deep shadow against a patients locker the patient was passing him a grape and before he took it the american had his finger on his lips markham kept walking beyond the wards swing doors there was a last snapped question how long the doctor said that it might be two days and it might be three or it might be a week before his patient could be interrogated he walked on down the empty corridors the branch men were with him said they were looking for a coffee machine his footfall stamped to the stairs there was a fight in casualty reception a drunk with blood streaming from a forehead wound swung a fist at the security people he didnt care and threaded his way past them he went to the parking area and his car he wished he smoked he wished he had a hip flask he wished he was warm and wetsweaty with vicky he wished he worked for a fucking bank he sat in the car the wail of a siren approached and he watched the staff gather at the door to meet it the flurry as the stretcher was hurried inside he waited he was cold tired he had seen how the bastard had watched them listened to them fooled them and the first day of the week was ten minutes off its end and he couldnt imagine why littelbaum had found it important to stay behind he was slumped in selfpity and wondered whether the bank would turn him down by letter or by telephone damn sure they wouldnt accept him he wouldnt tell vicky what hed said about playing god or tell her how her buzz phrases had been sneered at the american eased the car door open and lowered himself into the seat first thanks for being so on the ball and giving me space you did well god what depressing places hospitals are you see mr markham its all about alamut the sort of places well all end in not able to do a lot about it alamut is the key markham began to drive away and had to swerve out of the path of another ambulance id need convincing i did anything well right mr littelbaurn tell me why alamut is relevant if he had known alamut been there then he wouldnt have talked to me markham gasped then laughed out loud why mr littelbaum did he talk to you the policemen were very cooperative heard what you said about blood and murder one needed to piss so the other took his place in the corridor why i fancy he talked to me because i poked the tip of my pen into the middle of the three femur fractures didnt he scream he probably did but i had my handkerchief and my fist over his mouth he wanted to talk more than he wanted the poke of my pen if hed been to alamut then he wouldnt have cared about the pain what did he say markham drove recklessly fast on the open road heh mr markham would you slow down please i dont want to be going back to that place on my back ease it off please he said the guy came off a boat and i told him we knew that i hadnt a name and neither had he i hadnt a face but he had the face is interesting its palecoloured its what i imagine to be the edge of caucasian and theres no facial hair english english accent not american tall but not exceptional hair not black matt didnt get the eyes age would be late thirties he crashed the car because the guy sort of frightened him weapons he started to tell me i think he was trying to talk about a launcher yes he wanted to tell me the lot i had the pen right in front of his face but he didnt i think he wanted to tell me but he fainted associates the faint wasnt acted he got another poke but he was gone cold like smoky joe had hit him and the law came back from its piss so what do we have mr littelbaum enough to think on may i first educate you on alamut with education you get to understand the anvil what hell do the sense of sacrifice the danger he poses the dedication to his orders in the year mr markham two of the fidais were sent from alamut to kill raymond the second of tripoli thats the port city in presentday northern lebanon raymond the second was the christian crusader king they chose the most public place in his city to kill him where he would be surrounded by the maximum security the place they chose was the main gate of the city imagine it crowds traders travellers guards the greatest audience in front of which to demonstrate their power and their commitment they stabbed raymond the second to death at the gate of his own city and they would have known that within moments they would be chopped into small pieces by his guards thats alamut for you mr markham thats what youre up against he pretended to sleep and made a pattern of his breathing her breasts and stomach were against his back and his buttocks they were naked in the bed but for comforts sake not for loving sometimes he heard the engine of the car parked beside the house as if blake boosted the heater sometimes he heard a car coming slowly by and stopping then there were quiet voices and chuckled laughter sometimes there was the empty whistling of the wind and the distant ripple surge of the sea on the beach if he pretended to sleep and his breathing was regular then he hoped it would be easier for her to sleep he lay on his side with her warmth against him and he played the televisions quiz game in his mind the grinning show host asked the questions and brighteyed frankie answered them where was iran iran with a territory of million square kilometres and a population estimated in excess of sixty million is at a pivotal geopolitical position between the middle east and the asian subcontinent where it cannot be ignored and is unlikely to be humoured what was the government of iran iran is ruled by islamic clerics categorized as fundamentalist and conservative in the extreme but the government has loose relationships with the organizations of the revolutionary guard corps and the autonomous private armies of clerics boasting vengeful actions against western cultures what was wmd weapons of mass destruction chemical and microbiological and nuclear are all the subject of urgent research programmes in iran what was the requirement for mixing machines the manufacture of the chemical air droplets to be included in the warhead and for the lining material of the interior of the missile body that must withstand extreme temperature require dualpurpose mixing machines sold on fraudulently prepared export dockets what was the fate of a spy in iran what did they do with a spy in iran a spy in iran is either hanged in secret on the gallows at the evin gaol or hanged in public from a crane in a tehran square and hoisted so high that the crowd can better see his death dance a final question had to answer correctly to win the holiday for two in barbados and the new fitted kitchen the food liquidizer and the wide screen television he squirmed in the bed what were the consequences in iran of the spys report on a military factory at bandar abbas dont know cant answer was never told dont want to know better not knowing to black to the darkness of the room and no prizes to carry away he took a point on the shadowed wall stared at it she was asleep if he slept he would dream of the crane she didnt know of the crane and she slept there was a small gale of laughter from the side of the house and a car drove away he was drifting he had always rather fancied emma carstairs and always thought she rather fancied him drifting but not sleeping if he thought of emma carstairs her bold smile and her wriggling her hips to work off her knickers her hands taking his to the buttons of her blouse then he wouldnt sleep and if he didnt sleep then he wouldnt see the crane he stared at the bare wall chapter eight in the last minutes of the night he moved like a wraith he came off fen hill and kept inside the treeline skirting the end of the marshland the high winter tides blown by storms and the heavy winter rainfall had made the ground he covered into a swampy bog the water was always above his ankles and sometimes above his knees but he left no visible track of his advance and he was hidden by the treeline he left behind him the carefully concealed sausage bag and the weapons because at this time he had no need of them when he came to a small stream feeding the marsh it was necessary for him to wade up to his waist the sediment clawing at his boots and his legs the higher ground of hoist covert the name he had read from his map was ahead of him and the faint outline of the church tower loomed beyond it he moved fast once he was out of the bog land and the marsh he did not stop to unfasten the laces of his boots and empty out the stale dark water and the mud it was all familiar to him he crossed the ground as if he were again in the hauralhawizeh reeds it gave him comfort to be on familiar ground he did not move as a trained soldier would working from instructions and manuals but used instead the innate skills of a predator he did not have to consider the dangers of silhouette of breaking cover of leaving a scented track behind him it was natural to vahid hossein that he should go as a stalking animal searching for a prey he had kept a steady pace and broke it only once when he had seen a single man come with binoculars and sit on a bench between hoist covert and a path that led back to the church he stopped then and checked the ground ahead of behind and to the side of the man and watched the traverse of his binoculars he was only twenty metres from the man when he passed him in scrub cover he assumed that the man had come to the bench to watch for birds from the viewpoint that overlooked the marshes it was a point squirrel led in his mind for future attention he moved on past high fences and garden hedges and a sign marking a narrow worn path towards the village he climbed a fence and used garden shrubs to mask his movement he crawled on his stomach through a gap in a hedge lifted a length of chicken wire to go under it and replaced it twice he was within five metres of a house and could hear voices inside but he kept from the arc of light thrown from the windows once he stopped and retraced his steps because a back door opened and a dog bouncing and barking was put out to run on a patch of grass he needed to know where the dogs were they were a greater enemy than the people the houses he went by were of old brick some were the homes of artisans with wilderness gardens stacked with rubbish bags and discarded kids bicycles as they would have been in south tehran some were the homes of the affluent with little tended squares of lawn heaps of raked leaves and the smell of dead bonfires as there would have been around the villas on the slopes above jamaran where the tagtuttee lived the idolworshippers who only pretended to re sped the teachings of the imam it was for reconnaissance it was to find the way in and know the way out he heard the noise of cars ahead slowing and changing down through their gears he was beside a fence and hidden by ornamental bushes from a small path it was well timed he had arrived at his vantageplace when it was light enough for him to see ahead and dark enough to preserve his cover it was the few minutes of the point between night and day he could not yet see the vehicles because bushes were blocking his view he lay very still a woman in a nightrobe came out of her door and he heard the clink of the bottles she carried the light above her door flooded the path as she went to the gate the empty bottles rattled onto the concrete and she went back inside slamming the door behind her he saw the lights of cars rolling across the houses ahead of him and illuminating the open ground he crawled on the photographs of the house and the target man were seared into his memory he heard the mutter of low voices as the engines of the cars were killed the voices were indistinct on his knees and elbows he edged forward and gently parted the branches and leaves of a garden shrub he felt the shake in his hands there was a police car with two men in it a dozen metres from him beyond the police car was the open grassland of the photograph and beyond the open ground were two more cars four men stood beside them two wore civilian clothes the others wore blue over ails and across their chests they carried machineguns on straps he felt the cold twist in his stomach beyond the cars was the house shown in the photograph all the curtains were drawn and no light showed he had been told the target was without defence had no protection he thought the men in front of the house were changing shifts he watched the car nearest to him started up and the roving eyes of the marksman and the barrel of a machinegun peeped above the door and out through the opened window as it edged slowly away one of the men at the house was stretching arching his back as if he had stayed the night in his vehicle the two men with the machineguns went to the door of the house in the photograph he saw their wariness and that one covered the back of the other when the door was opened there was no light in the hallway it was professional protection they went inside and the door closed on them if he had come a few moments later he would not have seen the machineguns he had the photograph of the man and wanted to look into his face as he took the knife or the gun from under his coat it was important that the man could see his face and the eye of vengeance he slipped away he crawled through the hedgerow pulled back the length of chickenwire climbed the fence and scurried in the growing light towards the scrub and the shelter of hoist covert he waded the stream then staggered across the bog among the trees it was not the threat from the machineguns to his own life that made his hands shake and his breath pant he would be carried as a martyr to the garden of paradise he had no fear of death from the bullets it was the fear of failure the brigadier the man who loved him as a son who had replaced his longdead father would be waiting in the office high in the building of the mimstry of information and security for news of his success vahid hossein could not contemplate the cloud passing over the face of the brigadier if the message carried word of failure he came through the trees on to fen hill and stopped dead in his tracks he had seen the bird the beak tugging and the talons clinging were at the rabbits carcass he saw the raw wound on its wing the bird was at the limit of its strength its beak was tearing at the fur but had not the power to rip it aside it was less than five paces away he saw the wound and the movement of ants in it and the colour of the flesh at the wing was not pink and pure but putrefied like the old wounds of the men in the hauralhawizeh the bird flapped the damaged wing and the good wing as if to flee from him but the strength was not there and it only hopped crippled a few metres from the carcass he knew the harriers from the hauralhawizeh and from the shattalarab and faw they were often with them as they hid up in the marshes and watched for the iraqis waited for the darkness and the opportunity to probe into their enemys de fences he had grown to love them to worship the beauty of their feathering they were light the harriers in the darkness of the killing grounds he dropped to his knees and crawled forward slowly to the carcass the wound would kill the bird if it could not feed with his fingers he tore little strips of flesh from the rabbit vahid hossein believed the hunger would defeat the birds fear and that the bird was his escape from failure he took the black felt pen and the clean sheet of paper to his door ripped off the existing message and fastened on its replacement he scrawled the words day two it was seven fortynine the traffic had not yet built up on the embankment outside thames house but already they were at their desks geoff markham had come in on the underground before the crush but they had beaten him there cox was in to supervise the expansion fenton was huddled with the american chuckling as if they were conspirators gary brennard was there from administration resources organizing the new team their new consoles and new telephones a redhaired woman markham recognized her from one of the irish sections but didnt know her name was sitting scratching her head and wiping her eyes looking like shed been heaved half awake from her bed there were two probationers and one of the old men from b branch they were in early as if they feared they might miss the entertainment hed slept in his own bed at his own place and thered been four messages from vicky on his answer phone howd it go did you do all right was it ok did you do enough to get it he went back into his partitioned office room overnight in his own bed he hadnt thought about the interview but about the american with his pen and whether that constituted a criminal assault whether it was a sacking offence whether he was just too damn squeamish for the job hed make the call later in the morning when the new team was bedded down hed ring perry he wandered across the open work area towards the new cluster of desks and screens he went by the woman with the red hair she seemed tired and uninvolved was flicking the pages of a newspaper maybe nobody had told her maybe theyd told her and she didnt think it mattered fentons laugh was louder fenton said morning geoff just hearing about last night damn good he said it grimly what we did was illegal bollocks fenton strode away the american sidled over to him sleep ok mr markham not so well if i could say to you its a rough world and rougher when the stakes go high you get to play hard if you want to win remember alamut and then you can judge your enemy do it by the rules and your enemy will walk over you they came out from alamut two of them in their target was conrad of montferrat who was the kingelect of jerusalem they caught up with him finally in the city of tyre presentday south lebanon but theyd stalked him nearly a half of a year he was guarded close had the best security of the day and they beat it they were dressed as christian monks the clothes of their enemy they went right through the security and knifed their man to death the way they did it they condemned themselves but they reached their target go legal if you want to if you do you wont win against cunning patience ruthlessness dedication is there anywhere you can get a decent coffee round here shed been up early to take the pictures off the bedroom walls and had stacked them glass down behind the dressingtabl everything off the top surface of her dressingtable had gone into the drawers then shed crisscrossed the mirror with heavy adhesive tape frank had watched her from the bed shed snatched breakfast and dumped a plate of cereal down in front of stephen she was already late for the school bell theyd been changing the shift at home when she had left nothing to say to her nor to frank but the uncles had time to chat with stephen about his lorries shed had to drag him away from them on their shoulders theyd had machineguns on webbing straps shed thrust stephen into the car and frank had stayed inside emma carstairs had once told meryl that she had bestfriend status theyd been to dinner there three months before emma carstairs would have said to barry she thought that frank and meryl perry were the right sort of people for the village barry had put work franks way and joked about keeping things close in a little mafia the loss of the friendship hurt badly meryl hadnt faced up to telling stephen why they didnt have sam in the car now had made instead a poor excuse about a grownups squabble shed have to tell him properly but later probably there would be things said at school but she couldnt yet cope with telling him the complicated truth a van was parked beside the road and she saw a man reaching up to hammer a sold sign across the middle of the forsale board outside rose cottage she wondered whod bought it and what theyd be like she drove fast to the school and had to brake fiercely to avoid a car pulling away from the kerb most of the kids were already in she frowned barry carstairs drove a sporty audi provided by his buildingsuppliers company it was parked outside the school gate three vehicles ahead of her barry never did the schoolrun she kissed stephen and pushed open his door the child ran through the playground gate towards the door of the main building where he was stopped by mr archer the deputy head he had one hand on the childs shoulder and with the other he was waving her to come to him several of those who didnt have jobs with regular hours helped with the painting the reading and the lunches of the nursery class she knew mr archer a little ferret of a man and the talk was that he was slyly bitter at being ignored for the headship she saw stephen try to pull away from him as the bell went inside archers fist clenched in the material of stephens anorak restrained him she stamped across the playground he didnt look her in the face mrs kemp would like to see you mrs perry why are you holding stephen like that he looked at the ground then at the sky if you could go please to mrs kemps office why are you preventing stephen from joining his class it will all be explained mrs perry theyre waiting for you youre making stephen late for class hell be in the common room ill be with him kids knew they always knew first stephens face was blank at home last night hed worked really hard at his writing was proud of it before hed pulled out his lorries and the men had come to his room his exercise was in his satchel with his lunch she told him ignored the ferret that shed sort it out and fast she stormed down the corridor didnt knock pushed her way into mrs kemps office from the door her eyes roved over the faces there was mrs kemp trim and greyhaired the headteacher bellamy overweight and everybodys friend the selfappointed organizer of the pta barry carstairs the smartsuited businessman who was going places the chairman of the governors and a woman with fiercely bobbed hair and a severe black trousersuit the men were either side of the women and they were all huddled close against the legs of the desk the headteachers voice piped at her thank you for coming in mrs perry please sit down why am i here just sit down mrs perry please youll know everyone here except miss smythe from the countys education department she remained standing whats going on the headteacher fixed her with a glance i am afraid i have something difficult to tell you what bellamy grunted its pretty obvious mrs perry after yesterday afternoon whats obvious carstairs tried to look sombre there was a very disturbing ii vident affecting the school yesterday meryl which cannot be ignored her child with the ferrets hand on his anorak knew stephen was in the common room and would be scared half out of his wits she stood her ground and glowered so which of yous queuing to use the knife thats not calledfor we have a responsibility its a responsibility were not ignoring barry carstairs didnt look at her he was playing with a pencil and hed scribbled words on a pad as if he didnt trust himself without notes this isnt easy for us as chairman of the governors after consultations with our headteacher and bearing in mind the feelings of the parents representative i have taken a most serious decision yesterday your husband came to the school to collect stephen he was we now know accompanied by an armed bodyguard it was not his intention that the presence of the bodyguard should be known and that was an act of deceit the bodyguard after a grossly irresponsible incident with his pistol an incident that could have led to the gun firing in a crowded playground in the headteachers hearing spoke to the local police after she quite rightly had called them i his explanation to the local police he spoke of a threat to your husband that necessitates his constant protection from terrorist attack we feel after very careful consideration that a threat to your husband represents also a threat against your husbands family youre blathering barry why dont you say what you mean carstairs pushed aside his notes there was a curl of anger at his lips i was trying to do it the decent way what franks done whats in his sordid past i dont know and i dont care what matters is that his family is exposed to bombs and guns in our school the children and staff here are all threatened by terrorists their safety is paramount stephen as much as his stepfather or his mother could be a target if he is a target then everyone at this school is a target hes out hes no longer welcome here you cant do that not to a child the woman miss smythe leaned forward to intervene and spoke with a low intense voice we can do it mrs perry and we are doing it my department after full consideration of the facts has decided to back the governors recommendation were foursquare behind them as soon as is practical we will communicate with you on proposals for alternative education for stephen but i cant say when that will be a thought mrs perry is it possible for stephen to move away stay with an uninvolved relative and attend school elsewhere it is not we are together a family then hell have to sit at home carstairs said im sure mrs kempll loan you some books but hes not coming back here you are despicable you are barry carstairs always have been a secondrate rat always will be as of now stephen is no longer a pupil at this school take him home and frank thought of you and your stupid wife as a friend your problems arent ours they dont concern us get off back home and when you get home you should call for a removal van and take your problems away youre pariahs youre not wanted there was so much she could have said meryl thought in that moment that weeping and pleading would have shamed her she eyed them with contempt and none of them could meet her gaze once before she had been through the business of shame and she would not go there again no begging no cringing not then and not now nine years before she had resigned from the haulage business where she worked the logistics computer four months after the christmas party hadnt been drunk incapable before that party or since too drunk too incapable to know which of the men had done it it could have been any of the thirtyeight drivers twelve loaders three managers and two directors she would have needed dna testing to learn which was the father of the embryo baby she turned living with frank loving him bringing up her child together had erased the shame she left them behind her the silence clinging in the room and strode down the corridor to fetch her son from the common room they would be watching her from the headteachers office as she led the child back across the empty playground towards the car their faces would be pressed against the glass she had shown them defiance but by the time she reached the car the pain and the despair hit her with her boy beside her she drove into the town centre to buy the length of net from which she would make the curtains classification secret date april subject juliet

behind the tower of the bridge and accommodation block the inflatable covered by tarpaulin sheeting was stowed beside them they discussed a schedule it was important for them to plan the length of time the tanker spent there for the crew to take shore leave and the sailing time back into the english channel time was critica amp the great tanker should not reach the point in the channel too early or too late to make the pickup neither man entertained the slightest doubt that he would be on the beach and that an enemy of their country would a few hours before have been justifiably killed they made calculations because they had been delayed in taking their place at the offshore jetty it seemed unlikely that the crew would enjoy more than a few hours of shore leave in the swedish port the restaurant was on no list in goodeating guides that harry fenton had ever seen but it was where the israeli had said they should meet it was an unpredictable place for the mossad station officer to have chosen and one where it was unlikely his enemies would look for him so harry you are confused you are confused because you have spoken with your foreignaffairs people who are an apparatus of appeasement theyre telling you that iran is misunderstood more sinned against than sinning and wants only to be permitted to take a rightful place in the affairs of that region allow me because you are paying for this excellent food to disabuse you of what you have been told and to further your confusion before he was killed rabin tried to alert the international community to the need to strike at this viper and crush its skull and he was a man criticized in his own yard as a peace monger they were strong words from a man vilified for attempting a deal with the syrian lebanese and palestinian enemies why they were in the further reaches of east london under railway arches and facing a line of boardedup shops it was small dingy and frankly unclean but the israeli said the restaurant served the best afghan cooking in the city he ate with enthusiasm fenton was less sure why because we in israel understand the real threat we understand it while many in europe refuse to open their eyes everywhere a bomb explodes or a bullet impacts we find the fingerprint of iran they pay for equip and train the hizbollah in the lebanon and hamas for the palestinians the bombs on our buses in our vegetable markets are placed by proxy but they are theirs yet what theyre doing now is only a pinprick harry in comparison with what they intend the israeli pushed the cleaned plate away from him wiped his mouth vigorously with the paper napkin and laid the palm of his hand over his glass fenton masked the taste of the spiced baked vegetables and sauces with beer and was now on his third bottle what they intend is to gain a triple arm of weaponry with which they may dominate the oilfields of the region for the development of the nuclear site at bushehr and they already have small quantities of plutonium they will beggar their own people and bankrupt the state they are scouring the asian continent for the necessary chemical agents for an independent poisongas manufacturing industry what is the work the scientific community of iran is given the means to deliver a warhead containing the most revolting disease known to man anthrax footandmouth any biotoxin any of the peasants weapons of mass destruction where are they putting these weapons and the missiles to deliver them in tunnels they bury them where they are beyond the reach of conventional attack only once have we been able to strike at such targets do you know how we achieved that harry with whose help were you never told harry if not its not for me to tell you the meat on the plates laid in front of them was unrecognizable as part of any animal fenton knew he assumed it had been a young lamb ritually slaughtered the thought of what had happened to it was sufficient to stifle his appetite the iranian programme for the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction gives me and the rest of our intelligence community bad nights its the big picture its what the people of israel will face in the future the mossad and the general staff have to plan the defence of our state against nuclear devices against nerve gases against toxins but that is in front of us the present ignore the denials ignore the protestations of fluent gentle diplomats who make your foreignaffairs officials feel comfortable the present is that every attack abroad by the iranian killer squads has the authorization of the highest echelons of government its only the appeasers who say otherwise government provides the training for the killers the weapons via diplomatic pouches the digital securephone links the passports the finance every operation abroad is laid before the foreign minister the interior minister and the defence minister sitting in the national supreme security council it is authorized sanctioned on one condition only the condition there should be no smoking gun in irans hand look in your files harry it is there if you wish to see it is there something wrong with your food harry fenton had barely touched his meat hardly eaten enough to offer a pretence of politeness he grimaced and signalled for more beer if you dont eat harry youll just fade away the germans have done deals appeased them looked for the easy life and the french the italians they have submitted to the blackmail they want to trade they want to offer export credits and they believe if they are generous and restructure the debts that the killer squads will stay off their territory prisoners are returned investigations are stalled have the germans helped you over lockerbie have they fuck what about all the killers the french have caught within their jurisdiction no prosecutions they appease and you in britain harry on your little island you do not believe that the problem of iran is real how can i say that i say it because of what i see from my embassy window you allow unchecked on your streets flourishing such organizations as the hizb uttahrir or the young muslims who provide the cheap charter flights to iran or the almuntada alislami who fundraise for the algerian fundamentalist butchers who are in their turn trained in iran you allow it to happen harry you refuse to recognize the cancer in your belly the israeli declined coffee which was a relief what had been served at the next table coughed and spluttered over had looked like tarmacadam sludge a great meal harry and a great opportunity to talk with you i say hit the bastards wherever you find them it is the only language they understand they are clever and determined they are not to be underestimated good day to you harry he stood the gold star of david bouncing in the greyed hair of his chest behind his opencollared shirt fenton finished the beer then followed him out on to the street the israeli tugged at his sleeve remember what i said to stop them you must crush the skull crush it under your heel crush the life from it and then you have to have the courage to shout it to the world and fuck the consequences you got the balls harry to tell the world you crushed the skull the israeli had said deviously that he had a man to meet fenton was abandoned he walked at least a mile before thank god he was able to flag down a taxi he told cox that hed been networking again he dropped the name of the senior israeli intelligence officer in london and saw that cox was reluctantly impressed he was tired and his feet hurt and he complained that the israeli policy position was in total contradiction to their own im supposed to be learning but the pointers conflict thats where we are between a rock and a hard place but i will press on of course you will cox said thats what youre here for isnt it the crane came across the green past the keepoffthegrass sign the big wheels gouging a track on the rainsoftened ground peggy stood on the far side of the green leaning on her bicycle and staring the hut the size of a large garden toolshed had already been hoisted off the flattop lorry that had reached the village in slow convoy with the crane and now dangled from a cable under the cranes arm frank perry watched the cranes manoeuvres from the diningroom window with paget and rankin they had asked for and been given a spare blanket from the airing cupboard and had draped it over the polished table hed said earlier im sorry about last night what i said didnt hear you say anything sir nothing to apologize for sir a pleasant afternoon of watery sunshine threw sufficient glare to highlight the garish yellow of the crane and the rusty brown creosote seal on the planks of the swinging hut the cranes engine coughed diesel fumes as it powered towards the gap between his house and the wroughtons davies edged his car clear to make space behind him paget and rankin were discussing kit they seemed uninterested in the arrival of the hut on the blanket with their machineguns and the small blackcoated gas grenades with a book of crossword puzzles was a kit mgazine they turned the pages and pored over the advertisements his face against the window glass perry peered at the cranes advance and heard the scraping noise he tilted his head looked up and to the side he could see that the hut swayed against the wroughtons plastic guttering wroughton was the deputy bank manager in the town his wife was the surgery manager and their twins were in school a small blessing that they werent there to see the destruction of the plastic guttering the crane hoisted the hut higher clear of the wroughtons guttering and roofing tiles he imagined a crowd cheering as a man swung and twisted from such a crane the crowd here was just peggy vince who was out of his van and watching with her and dominic standing in the shop doorway paul held tightly to the leash of his dog which yapped incessantly and strained forward on its hind legs he could no longer see the slow swing of the hut but could hear the shouts of the men guiding it in iran from what he had seen on television when he was there they didnt blindfold a man before he was lifted high for the crowd to see and they didnt pinion his legs to deny the crowd the sight of him kicking behind him in low voices paget and rankin talked through the brand names of windproof sweaters thermal socks and rainproof trousers they sat huddled close beside each other it was more than twenty minutes since the crane and the lorry had come to the village and theyd not passed comment on anything other than the advertisements in the magazine for kit he left them and went into the kitchen meryl didnt look up she was at the kitchen table with her sewing machine and her boy was feeding her the lengths of cut net in the back garden more of the men from the lorry were laying heavy planks on the grass lawn cursing because they were awkward to move and heavy shed spent half of last summers evenings working at that grass digging out the weeds to make it perfect the kitchen in spite of the long fluorescent striplight was dark she was looking at the window and he could see her teeth gnawing at her lower lip the hut was being lowered past the window to the shouted instructions of the men who eased it towards the planks on her perfect lawn hed heard that a man was left hanging dead for a whole day before they lowered the arm of the crane the hut jolted and the cable slackened davies was calling their names paget and rankin came through the kitchen they had the machineguns their rucksacks their foodboxes their magazine and the crossword book the tall one tousled stephens hair it was the first time perry had seen the child half smile since meryl had brought him home they walked out through the kitchen door to inspect their hut there was the roar from the front of the house as the crane backed out of the gap between the houses are you all right yes her head was down but her tone was aggressive she fed the net on to the needle of the machine i was only asking why shouldnt i be all right ive got you ive got my home ive got my friends what have ito complain about look dont be sarcastic davies rapped at the kitchen door he was carrying his gear the case with his machinegun his heavy coat a duffel bag for his sandwiches and thermos a clean shirt on a hanger and a pair of heavy boots through the window perry saw paget and rankin taking possession of their hut theyd dumped their kit inside and were supervising the linkup of the cables from the house one of the lorry men brought them two plastic chairs and a kettle another a small television set and a microwave cooker outrage had been building with meryl throughout the day but she had held on to her control because of the men in her dining room if davies hadnt been at the door he thought she would have screamed everything around them was worse for her than for him yes he turned on davies davies said quietly its been decided that i should be inside with you its not a matter of comfort or anything like that its about my safety when im sitting in the car its because of a reassessment of the security threat the car is too vulnerable thats the assessment now the boys in the hut are behind armourplated walls theyre certainly proof against lowvelocity bullets and theres a good chance theyd stop highvelocity but the car doesnt have that protection they want me inside ive been asked again to run away im staying ive been told that mr perry thats your decision not for me to comment on but the car outside with the new assessment is too vulnerable the strangers were with them inside the house and in the hut which blocked the precious view of their garden later the strangers would be all around them as the laminated plastic was fixed to the windows it would be late in the afternoon when paget and rankin were safe in their hut when davies was safe in the dining room before the lorry rumbled away and the cranes wheels dug another track across the green and there was nothing he could do except run all his life he had made for himself the decisions that mattered he had always been selfreliant at school he not his parents and not his teachers had decided what subjects he would specialize in at university ignoring his tutors advice he had decided what brahch of engineering he would concentrate on at the company his only employer he had decided that the opening he wanted was in the sales division and he had explored the tentative difficult trade openings that were possible with iran first his wife and then meryl had left decisions to him he had never been frightened of backing his judgement and now he was helpless and snared in a web it was a new sensation to him he couldnt of course not go out of the house and man a personal roadblock at the end of the village and check the cars coming in and couldnt beat across the common ground beside the road for the people sent to kill him and couldnt thrash around in the marshland no action was open to him except to run he was neutered and the men were all around him inside and outside his house and they ignored him as if he were an imbecile and incapable of independent thought there was nothing he could do but sit and wait it isnt my fault she had come where and when he had told her to come farida yasmin jones hung her head pressed her face against her knees the damp of the evening was in the air she had driven her car down the narrow lane off the wider busier road and after the bend that prevented it being seen from the road she had parked near to the track that led to the tumulus i do not criticize you you look as though you do when i came with yusuf there wasnt protection perhaps he lived you said hed die perhaps he lived and talked yusuf khan would never talk all men say they would never talk and believe it youre insulting him he was stupid he was like a child he spoke too much and he could not drive why should i believe he would not talk youve no right to say hed talk whatre you going to do he had come from fen hill and across fen covert and he had sat for close to twenty minutes hidden in bushes watching her before he had shown himself after twenty minutes vahid hossein had gone in a wide loop around her to check that she was not followed was not under surveillance he had seen the men at the house with the guns he had no trust in anything he had been told there had been an iraqi ruse in the marshland in front of the shattalarab an ambush would be set by a patrol they would lie up and their guns would cover a raised pathway through the reedbanks a cassette recorder would play a conversation mens voices in the farsi tongue men of the revolutionary guards would be drawn towards the voices of their own people friends had been killed because they trusted what they heard he had watched her she had eaten mint sweets from a packet and scratched the white skin of her legs above her knees and looked frightened around her in the quiet she had rubbed hard against the softness of her breast as if there was irritation there she had snapped her fingers together in impatience all the time he had watched her he had no trust in her and yet he was yoked to her think plan think about what plan what think and plan dont you trust me i have faith only in myself her face was against the white skin of her legs and her hair cascaded over her knees he thought that she might be crying ill do whatever you want you cannot think for me and you cannot plan for me is that because im a woman because what is your name you have no need to know my name you have no need to know anything of me she gazed into his face and the halflight made shadows at her mouth and her eyes but the eyes held the brightness of anger then ill tell you my name and everything about myself because that shows you my trust i take the chance the trust that youll not talk you believe that you believe i would she mimicked all men say they would never talk and believe it his hand went instinctively to her shoulder caught it gripped it to the bone you play a trick with me a trick of words i too had felt her body gazed into her uncovered face he snatched away his hand and looked at the ground between his damp muddy boots he had been wrong there were no tears in her eyes i trust you she said before i converted i was gladys eva jones i come from a town in the middle of england not much of a place my father drives a train hes fat hes ugly he likes newspapers with pictures of girls without swimsuit tops he dislikes me because im not a boy my mothers empty stupid and she dislikes me because im not married and breeding actually the married bit might not even matter to her its not having kids to push round in a pram that upsets her they both equally dislike me because i was clever enough to go to university it was the most miserable time of my life and id had some i was nothing on campus no friends lonely as sin i met yusuf and through him i went to the mosque of sheik amir muhammad and i was taken into the true faith and became farida yasmin and happier than id been in my life id found respect i was asked to drop my faith to hide it to go to the hairdresser and beautify myself i was told that was the way i could best serve the memory of the imam i was trusted i was sent with yusuf to identify this man perry at a hospital in the north of england when he was visiting his father was ill and the doctors thought he might die his parents didnt know how to call for him because hed cut all the family links when he changed his name there was an appeal on the radio for him using the old name and it was heard by perry and by the people at the iranian embassy and it said where the hospital was we went there yusuf and i but it was i who actually went into the ward and asked the nurse which patient was his father i saw him by the bed we waited outside and noted the car he was driving and it was i who walked past it and took down the name of the garage that had sold it we went to the garage and i chatted up the salespeople gave them a story i flirted i did what was disgusting for my faith and i was given the address of the man whod bought it i did all of that because i was trusted then i was trusted enough to come down here to perrys home to photograph him and his house and i was trusted when yusuf crashed to drive south collect you and bring you here how much trust do you need he gazed at his boots at the crossed laces and the mud she bored on is it too difficult for you now what because he is protected is it too difficult you believe he had never before been interrogated by a woman then lectured not even as a child by his mother are you giving up going home no no no she had angered him she smiled as if his anger pleased her as if she had finally reached him what are you going to do think and plan its possible in gods hands everything is possible how can i help he said i need bread and cheese and bottled water and i need raw minced meat please bring them for me tomorrow same time tomorrow bread cheese water minced meat yes he pushed himself up the damp of the ground had seeped through the material of his camouflage trousers stiffened his hips he stretched she reached up with her hand he hesitated she challenged him he took her hand and she used the strength of his grip to pull herself to her feet the blood flushed in his cheeks she rubbed the skin at the back of her legs as if to give them warmth he looked away from her and began to brush the ground on which they had sat with sticks to lift the flattened grass i dont know your name and you dont trust me she said softly but you cant do without me can you chapter nine were stuck with him dont know how we can shift him whichever budget its coming out of will be facing a black hole it was where they found comfort at thames house a meeting around a table an agenda and a stenographer parked in a corner to record conclusions barnaby cox once had gestured discreetly to the stenographer with the palm of his hand an indication to her that a particular area of discussion was not to be recorded for posterity no hack trawling in future years through the archives in library would learn how information was extracted from a hospitalized patient fenton was beside him next to him was the senior warhorse from b branch former army with a history going back to cyprus and aden beyond him was littelbaum in his crumpled tweed suit and creased shirt then the redhaired woman opposite cox was the branch superintendent with the maps on which were drawn the lines covered by the sensor wires and the arcs watched by the cameras and the fields of defensive fire and geoff markham was isolated at the end of the table and watched and said nothing the agenda had covered the threat the guarded prisoner the evidence of the presence in the united kingdom of a killer with the coded name of anvil good laughter at the top end of the table at that the possibilities of putting a name to anvil the missing associate thrown up by rainbow gold no laughter there because rainbow gold was a sacred grail cost an annual fortune and was beyond criticism and the mobile surveillance and taps on the movements and communications of the los at the iranian embassy the agenda had reached the transcript provided by geoff markham the call geoffs call wasnt authorized cox fretted all geoffs done not that we needed it is provide further confirmation that perrys a stubborn fool fenton said reassuringly he should have cleared it first cox complained the bloody trouble is and perry knows it we cannot abandon him if the iranians drop him in the gutter with half his head missing theyve won and that is unacceptable the branch man gazed at the table cox huffed sounds as if hes deranged all this rubbish about home and friends fenton said i think we should call him up to london with his wife give him lunch and the treatment plant the doubts in him scare the daylights out of her soften him up the branch man relaxed and grinned spell it out in words of one syllable that even an engineer can understand a good lunch a good wine and a good dose of fear should crack him fenton pressed on the cost of protection with no end date is simply unacceptable cox pummelled his hands together but i like what im hearing now fenton rocked back in his chair smiled broadly get some photographs from the germans the french a few of their corpses courtesy of the iranians for her to look at while shes eating always best to go through the little woman works every time right agreed cox rapped his pencil on the table were not criticizing geoff for his initiative he was following the agreed line its just that he didnt have sufficient weight in his punch handle it will you harry the stenographer scribbled briskly at the far end of the table markham felt like a child brought in to the adults dinner not expected to contribute but to be washed neat and silent the redhaired woman yawned the american who hadnt spoken since his precis of the hospitalbed interview coughed cox gathered up his papers and stood content thank you all for your time the main priority get him out a good lunch and lashings of gore to help it down harry to make the arrangenents thank you the american coughed again in a more stagy fashion sorry mr littelbaum have we ignored you cox grimaced while they were on the move around him littelbaum remained still and sitting just something id like to say cox glanced at his watch then said patronizingly any further contribution you wish to make will be of course greatly valued littelbaum smoothed unsuccessfully the tangle of his hair markham reckoned his hesitation was a good act he thought the american was as hard as granite thats gracious much appreciated it follows on from mr markhams transcript quote you think ill run away because of the sayso of those expletive bastards think again get it into your head i make my own decisions i am not running away end quote thats good excellent that should be encouraged the best place for him is at home what i would urge on you dont give him lunch and wine and show him photographs keep him where he is at home there are rare occasions too few for my liking when we have the chance to win this is such an occasion and i think you should take the opportunity as it presents itself cox was back in his chair the rest of them listened in silence if you like i am a surrogate child of iran iran my parent feeds me clothes me provides my reason for living without that parentage i have no life a child watches every move of its parents so i watch iran iran is at war with the united states with my government and if youd care to recognize it at war with you too the weapons they have are stealth deceit the probing for weakness my government and i believe rightly calls it statesponsored terrorism and every year puts iran top of the world list the war most currently is being fought on saudi arabias territory irans war aim is via destabilization to bring down the government of the kingdom and replace the administration of an ally that irritates us with that of an enemy actively hostile to us the road to destabilization is through the bombing of the united states military infrastructure now settled in saudi arabia they are trying to force us out and if we go the kingdom falls i dont have to give you the statistics of oil reserves in saudi arabia that country is a vile place a police state characterized by medieval cruelty but it is important to us hear me important and it is a most challenging environment for an enemy to operate in to survive there to continue to kill the enemy must be of the highest calibre our man rates up there each time he strikes he creates further government repression which night following day creates further destabilization he organized the bombing of the national guard barracks at riyadh five americans dead and the attack on the kobar tower barracks nineteen americans dead three americans killed on the road between dhahran and riyadh a saudi general working with americans was targeted and killed last year we had a chance to take him last month and we missed him missing him hurt because we categorize him as the principal terror criminal confronting us he was called home from saudi arabia and sent here geoff markham thought him masterful littelbaums voice was never pushed he used his hands only rarely and then for the supreme moment of emphasis it bleats cannot hide cannot escape it cries out attracts the predator is stalked by the predator it is watched dragging at its rope by the marksmen in the hide it is the tethered goat fentons breath whistled in his teeth the redhaired woman gazed at the american in fascination if you go with your rifle into the bush or the jungle or the desert then you have very little chance the slimmest of possibilities of searching out your predator but the predator has to be killed so you find a goat you put a stake in the ground and a rope around its neck it will attract the predator you tie the rope to the stake and you sit in your hide with your rifle and you watch your tethered goat they sat in hushed quiet around the table as if markham thought none of them dared to interrupt the bravado of the proposal afterwards when you have shot the predator you will receive the thanks of the community and you will walk with pride you dont have to put the body on show others wont come predators learn quickly others will stay away forget your lunch wine and photographs leave frank perry in place where the predator knows he can find him make the hide put good men in it you are lucky so lucky that you have a bait available fenton and cox spoke at once that is fraught with danger its brilliant the branch superintendent said there would be minimal risk to his people because the beast would have eyes only for the goat the redhaired woman chuckled said nothing but she patted the americans hand lightly cox murmured nervously but the consequences of such action they could be dire not if the matter is handled with discretion with the necessary discretion there are no consequences but believe me the necessary message will reach the ministry of information and security discretion avoids consequences well buy that if theres discretion cox said ill take responsibility for running it fenton rasped at the moment were drifting this way we have purpose our discretion is guaranteed my word on it littelbaum spoke with sincerity its what wed do if wed had the luck thats given to you geoff markham wanted to ask and didnt how long would the marksmen wait before they fired he held his silence in the interests of a better shot would they sacrifice the goat the american had turned away from his audience and rubbed his poorly shaven chin only markham saw the satisfaction of his smile he hadnt asked his question because he already knew the answer had seen it in their eyes he slipped out of the room and left behind him the clinking glasses and the pop of a drawn cork jerry and mary wroughton had lived in the next house with their fiveyearold twins bethany and clive before frank and meryl had arrived in the village they were able to buy the house of pink stucco four bedrooms overlooking the green with upstairs views out across the sea because the bank offered favourable mortgage terms to employees without that they wouldnt have had a sniff at it and with it jerry had to be everybodys friend at work while mary had to have a fulltime job as a receptionist in a local surgery in truth they lived behind their front door as semipaupers appearances for jerry and mary wroughton were deceptive and their poverty was hidden to the outside world they presented an aspect of cheerful friendly affluence jerry wroughton liked to be thought of as a bank manager dropping deputy mary gave her job description as a practice manager not mentioning the word receptionist just as jerry at work acquired customers and mary at work acquired patients so both in the village acquired friends friends went with the territory and they were of course careful in the acquisition of their friends friendships as with everything else in their lives were planned friendships were useful important should not create stress friendships should not provide unpleasant or jarring surprises both hated surprises they were close to the carstairs on good terms with the vicar relaxed with the fairbrothers but their best friends were in the next house there were never any surprises from frank and meryl perry not until that evening what jerry and mary liked about frank and meryl was that they listened jerry could talk all night round the kitchen table and frank always seemed to find what he said interesting meryl was so kind always ready to help out in a crisis having the twins round if jerry and mary were kept out late always prepared to shop for them if work were too pressing they had never had any cause for complaint about their closest neighbours vince the vulgar little builder had telephoned had they seen their guttering had they heard about the crane what about the hut did they know about the guns would they be wanting him cash if they didnt mind to check their guttering coming home from work jerry wroughton had seen the police car parked close to the junction on the main road at which the lane branched off to the village hed thought it was good to see them there watching for thieves and speedsters and yobs without tax discs or insurance hed driven down main street had seen a second police car coming slowly towards him and thought that it was high time decent hardworking lawabiding folk had proper protection an empty car had been parked outside the neighbours hed been tired hed wanted his tea and hed been sitting in front of the television when vince had telephoned hed gone upstairs from the backbedroom window he could see down into the neighbours rear garden he saw the hut and the policeman walking slowly round their lawn the sight of the machinegun in the policemans hands had sent jerry wroughton into the bathroom where he had vomited into the lavatory the killing zone was separated from his own property by a low fence of light palings he rang barry carstairs and then the fear was worse for the next hour his wife doggedly insisted that it was his right to protest and told him what to do it was the worst surprise that had ever confronted jerry wroughton her car had provided the lead they required it was a tworoom flat one room for the bed and the washbasin one room for the easy chair the television and the cooker the lavatory and the bath were shared with others on the floor below the detectives had taken apart every drawer and cupboard exposed every possession of farida yasmin jones and found nothing the rainbow gold file had carried an old address with neither a number not a street for forwarding mail the university records had failed them the father had cursed and the mother had sulked but they could not produce a current domicile for their daughter the detectives hadnt a workplace and so had no national insurance number to feed into the computers the drivinglicence address had not been updated but they had the cars registration from the vehiclelicensing files at swansea four men with the registration had footslogged round the backstreet garages of nottingham none of the possessions in the flat scattered from the drawers and cupboard on to the floor had produced what they searched for the detectives had been told to look for evidence of commitment to an extreme fundamentalist islamic sect but the possessions were those of an ordinary young woman one of thousands working for an insurance company they had her pay slips on the table a list had been drawn up of every motorrepair yard qualified to issue an mot certificate of road worthiness all they had was the registration of her car to get into the garages records theyd had to promise that the evidence uncovered of vat fraud and revenue scams would be taken no further theyd rolled back the carpet in the living room torn away the stuckdown vinyl in the bedroom and prised up the floor boards with jemmies each of the four detectives was familiar with failure but it always hurt they were sullen quiet surrounded by the debris of the young womans life they had nothing to show that this ordinary young woman had clasped a new faith or had made a selfjustification for a hatred of her own society the last chance was the entryhatch into the rafters of the building they lifted the slightest among them into the space with a torch to guide him they could hear his body movements above them as they made a play at tidying the flat replacing the young womans clothing they heard his shout of triumph a suitcase was passed down through the hatch laid out on the table of the living room was a leatherbound volume of the koran wrapped in spotless white muslin cloth there were the careful notes of a student handwritten listing the five pillars of the faith and their meaning neatly folded clothes that they recognized and the head scarves at the bottom of the case was a packet of film negatives the detective sergeant held them up towards the ceiling light well done lads thatll do nicely the darkness was his friend but the quiet was a greater friend than the darkness vahid hossein sat crosslegged he had heard a fox call behind him in the trees and the shriek of an owl he listened for each shift of the waterfowl dippers and waders in front of him the bird was close he did not need his eyes to see it his ears had located it and he knew it edged closer he heard cars but they were a long way off the only clear sound was of a dog barking in the far distance when he had come back to the place where the sausage bag was hidden he had found that the bird had tried again to tear at the rabbit carcass and not had the strength this time feeling with his fingers through the darkness hours of the evening he pulled off small pieces of the bloodless flesh slipped them into his mouth and chewed to soften them then tossed them towards the sounds of the bird each time he threw the chewed meat to the bird he drew it closer to him by the morning he would be able to touch it smooth his fingers on its feathers it was important to vahid hossein that he should win the trust of the bird through his help he thought of the marshlands at night and the bird later when he was at peace he would plan and think he would put from his mind the whiteskinned legs of the girl and the fall of her breasts and make the plan it was the same quiet he had found in the desert in the empty quarter his wife barzin in their small house in the village of jamaran had a fear of darkness and of silence and he could not change it she would leave a light on outside the open bedroom door it was harder when he had left the desert and the bedouin whose loyalty he had won and driven on the streets past the barracks of the americans to make the plan and to think the best times were when the quiet and the darkness of the empty quarter cloaked him and he would be back there within two weeks to complete the plan and site the bomb if hossein had lunged he could have caught the bird by the wing the leg or the neck but he would have lost its trust then he could not help it if he helped it the peace would come in peace he could plan and think the plan at riyadh for his last bomb thought through by vahid hossein and accepted by his brigadier had been complex the adaptation of the petroltanker lorry to hold kilos of commercial explosive had been carried out in the bekaa valley of the lebanon the explosives and the detonation leads had been loaded the time switch had been fitted the lorry had been driven into syria through jordan and across the saudi arabian frontier five days after leaving the bekaa the lorry had been parked fifty metres in front of the eightstorey residential block used by the americans the bomb had been set to explode and the driver had run to the backup car it was a complex plan but no thought had been given to the alertness of the sentry on the roof who had raised the alarm as soon as he saw the driver run nineteen americans killed injured but many more would have died without that sentrys advance warning for that small mistake hossein was blamed only by himself at peace his mind clear and rested in the darkness of the marshes he thought of the time he should attack his target now protected at the change of the protection shift in daylight or at night in the middle of the shift at dawn or at dusk he chewed the meat and threw each piece nearer to his body always luring the bird closer the bell rang he glanced at his watch blake would come to take over from davies but there had been only one ring sharp and persistent unlike the three blake and davies used the bell went on endless perry was watching television the story of the renovation of a wildlife park in the himalayas the sort of programme that made him forget where he was what had happened to him stephen was sitting on the floor with his arm on his mothers knee meryl was sewing he didnt think and stood up the bell was still ringing as if a finger was jammed on it he was in the doorway between the living room and the hallway when davies came out of the dining room pushing back the bottom of his jacket to reveal the pistol in the waist holster the last thing the lorry men had done after the laminated plastic had gone over the windows was drill a spy hole in the front door davies didnt seem fussed by the bell took his time the bell ring pierced the hall too loud for him to hear what davies said into the button microphone on his jacket lapel perry understood the camera covered the front door the monitor was in the hut davies was clearing the visitor with the men in the hut its your neighbour thats jerry jerry wroughton always on the scrounge probably wants do you need to see him hes a good friend davies switched off the hall light and unlocked the door jerry wroughtons finger slackened off the bell button hi jerry you in the business of waking the dead then perry saw the clenched mouth the quivering jaw hadnt ever seen jerry look so famous and he smelt the whisky hed been about to ask his neighbour to come inside he thought jerry wroughton was remembering what he had rehearsed the mouth flapping without words as if the memory was slow coming meryl had said that barry carstairs had read off notes whats the problem jerry in the dark hall perry went sideways as if to see his neighbour better but davies drifted across to stay in front of him shielding him come on jerry spit it out whats going on thats the problem whats happening the poor bastard sent out into the night by mary had forgotten his lines say what you want to say thats our way yours and mine say it it came in a torrent i come home i find you under guard police in your garden police with machineguns i talk to barry carstairs youre on a death list the kids been put out of school because of the risk whos thinking about me about mary about the twins whats the risk to us come on calm down youre all right youre bloody laughing what about us what protection have we got jerry youre upsetting yourself believe me you dont have to just head on back home sit in your chair and youve got a problem its for you to fix it its not our problem you made your bed you lie on it he tried to be soothing and conciliatory he thought he owed that to a good neighbour right so mary had primed him with drink and nagged and jerry had gone all pompous but he was still a proper friend he rocked on his feet and breathed deeply which was what he always did to control a rising temper what are you saying jerry youve no right to bring your problems to our doorstep right now our children are sleeping a few yards from where youve got guns protecting you whos protecting them whos protecting mary when shes in the garden at the washingline when beth and clive are playing outside or dont they matter theres been a professional assessment of what needs to be done theyd have considered davies stood between them like a statue impassive he didnt contribute an iota of support what goods that to us weve done nothing wrong weve done nothing to need protection whatever your quarrel is its not ours if they come for me theyll have the right address is that your worry that theyll get the wrong house no chance he laughed couldnt help himself the image came into his mind so fast of the turbaned mullah with the beard carrying the assault rifle knocking on doors in the village and going into dominics shop calling up the ladder to vince into the pub asking for directions he shouldnt have laughed jerry shook quivering with fear and anger just as perry had a long time ago all i can say jerry and i dont get told much is that im in their hands and theyre the experts were all in their hands thats not bloody well good enough what is good enough jerry wroughton stood his full height spittle bubbled at his mouth it was the moment for which he had needed the cocktail of whisky and his wifes nagging davies was between them you should leave just go where anywhere just get the fuck out of here youre not wanted since when i thought you were my friend best thing you can do is go be gone in the morning i thought friends stuck together in good times and bad dont you want to know what i did why the threats there i dont give a damn what you did what matters to me is my family i just want you out he didnt care any more there was a sickness in his throat and he realized the shallowness of what hed assumed was a valued friendship there were plenty of other friends with depth to them he might just talk about it in the pub tomorrow and theyd all laugh as he described the gutless henpecked prig jerry wroughton for long enough on his own doorstep hed tried to humour the man his temper snapped go home and tell mary that they offered me relocation and a new life i chose to stay i told them that this was my home with my family and my friends friends he stabbed his finger past daviess elbow towards jerry wroughtons heaving chest are you listening friends i may not get support from you when im up against the wall but ill get it from my true friends and ive got enough of them meryl and i we dont need you either of you go tell her that the telephone rang behind him he realized at that moment that he could no longer hear the television meryl would have turned the sound down she and stephen would have heard every shouted word he walked away and davies closed the door behind him hes a pathetic bastard you called him a friend mr perry you have to face it people get cruel when theyre frightened ive friends here believe me real friends glad to hear it he picked up the telephone in the kitchen she was the only one left at the new cluster of desks down at the far end of the work area the consoles were covered the desks were tidied all the lights were off except hers geoff markham came out of his cubicle and locked his door after him the redhaired woman didnt look up from studying the illuminated green square and speaking soundlessly into a telephone there was a ribbon of light under coxs door but the senior journeyman often did that sloped off home and left his room lit so that the lesser people might believe he still beavered vicky was expecting him at her place for a verbatim of the interview but markham wasnt in the mood for an inquest he wandered towards the woman towards the halo of light on her hair he wanted to talk wanted his feelings massaged if she hadnt been there he would have gone out of the front doors on to the embanj nlent sat on a bench and stared into the river watched the barges and the ripples he waited until she put down her telephone hello she didnt look up yes i just wondered can i get you anything are you the tealady can i help in any way she said brusquely no if its not too secret he giggled what are you doing pretty obvious isnt it or werent you listening the americans stuff was superb add light complexion to an englishspeaking accent it could equal the child of a mixed marriage hes put at late thirties a mixed marriage maybe forty years ago an iranian marries an englishwoman thats what im looking for it might be on file if the marriage was over there the fco should have it because probably the consul would have been notified if it was over here then its harder but possible is that good enough he felt a rare shyness she was older than him with the white ceiling light bathing her face he could see the first lines cutting her skin and the slight crows feet at her eyes he couldnt face vicky and her questions he thought that not so long ago she must have been beautiful does that give you time for a drink before they close sorry i dont know your name im parker it scratched in his mind parker cathy parker from belfast she turned away from her screen she looked up at him and her glance was withering i am cathy parker from belfast yes we used to talk about you did you the instructors used to lecture us about that bar escape and evasion the bar full of provos and you taking them on did they its a legend there what you did in the bar you want to know something of course please what cathy parker had done in the bar up on the hill above dungannon east tyrone brigade country when shed been on covert surveillance had been identified taken by the provos was held up by the instructors as the single best example they knew of the will to survive she was a legend tell me she said it was all for nothing what mattered was my tout i lost him i pushed him too far and i lost him did the instructors tell you that if youll excuse me have you time for a drink i have you havent hang around here and youll end up pushing paper in triplicate badgering nightduty archive clerks errandrunning for those useless farts sucking your bloody conscience scrapping for a place on the promotion ladder youll be sad and passed over and always have time for a drink that what you want where should i be down there where its at with the principal if you dont mind please fuck off because i want to get this boring crap finished with and get home you shouldnt be whining around with hasbeen legends get down there nothing is ever decided here they think it is and strut around as if they actually pull the string they dont its down there itll be decided body to body as it always is or is close quarters too tough for you youre a lucky bastard to have the chance to be a part of it if youre up for it even while talking she was dialling on her telephone he spun on his heel and she didnt look up as if shed said everything that needed saying he paused by the door he didnt knock but he put his head round it and asked can i come in its your house mr perry the detective said droll you can go where you like in it it was all out on the blanket over the table the heckler amp koch the bulletproof vest a little cluster of gas grenades the mobile phone the radio the thermos the plastic lunchbox the newspaper my wifes gone to bed shes had a long day sir the detective said noncommittal perry shrugged were not very good company for each other at the moment im afraid early days sir takes a bit of time for us all to shake down never easy at the beginning having us in the house do you mind talking up to you sir its not interfering you talk away sir if thats what you want the detective eyed him perry didnt know what he thought he was a younger man with fair hair and a good suit and he had the faint accent of the west midlands his jacket was off and he wore a shoulder holster on a heavy harness he seemed not to notice when he straightened in his chair and it flapped against his body perry supposed that if you wore the thing the whole time a holster and a gun then you came to forget it its leo isnt it its detective constable blake sir or im mr blake you please yourself sorry no offence sir i dont seem to get to talk much with mr davies were all of us different sir perry stood in the doorway sounds daft im in my own home with my wife and im lonely lateatnight talk youll have to forgive me i just need to talk have someone talk to me im not saying i want a shoulder to cry on its just talking that i need i cant say it to meryl its easier and no offence to a stranger but already its getting to me but i made my bed didnt i thats what people say still not to worry there are good people here in spite of tonight and theyll see us through actually being honest the worst bit of all this is behind me believe me a couple of months ago im lying in bed the radios on for the news meryls asleep and i heard my old name would mr gavin hughes last heard of five years ago go to the general hospital at keswick in cumbria where his father mr percy hughes is dangerously ill i lied to meryl as to why i was going out i drove up there in a daze i broke all the rules because id been told that i shouldnt ever try to reclaim the former life and i went in to see him the crisis was over he was sitting up in bed me walking in made him cry but he cried worse when i refused to tell him who i was now where i lived what i did my mother told me to go away she said i was better gone if i couldnt trust my own parents i came home that day was worse than anything theres three times since mr davies arrived here that ive thought of telling that to him but it never seemed the right time i dont find talking easy with mr davies he couldnt tell whether blake was bored with the story or moved by it hes a very conscientious officer sir one of the best perry smiled ruefully then forced himself to lighten the mood how is one officer better than another planning thoroughness study hes good at all that theres an old principle in our job sir no such thing as complete protection but if you do your work then youre giving yourself a chance and making a chance for your principal bill thats mr davies sorry hes good at planning and hes done all the studying what is there to study everything thats gone before because you can learn from it we had a halfday clear last year and he marched me round central london round five sites where there was an assassination attempt on queen victorias life he knew the exact place each time the weapon why shed lived he read about it so he could learn from it we had a day clear in january a course was cancelled at the last minute so he took three of us into the video room that sb have gave us a screening we had the killing of sadat and mrs gandhi mounthatten and rabin each detail what had gone wrong where the security had fouled up and the video of the shooting at reagan which was just diabolical for the protection officers they did about everything wrong that was possible you wouldnt want to hear too much about sadat and mrs gandhi sir wouldnt i why not a slight grin fluttered at blakes mouth perry knew it was intended hed snatch the bait they were shot by their own bodyguards wont happen to you sir they were murdered by the people who were protecting them mr davies told me that mussolini was paranoid about his protection people gave them guns to wave about but kept the ammunition locked up he studies whats happened learns from it he could walk you down the street by the hilton hotel in london where the israeli ambassador was shot and talk you through it as if hed been there the p did well fired and hit the gunman but it was still too late his principal was critically injured brain damage were always trying to catch up were told that their action is faster than our reaction stands to reason to give yourself a chance what mr davies does you study and learn it matters to him the job matters too much to him its bad for his wife and kiddies but its good for you sir can i say something of course you can like in confidence please not to go further were all covering for him its a lousy bit of wife trouble if the bosses knew how lousy they could pull him off the job they dont let men with bad home problems carry firearms when he lost the weapon in the playground if youd shopped him then made a complaint the bosses would have put the evil eye on him and the trouble bit might have surfaced if youd complained he could have been out on his neck you did well there sir dont take me wrong but its a comfort to know that other people have a bloody awful day he told me not easy for you sir well time for bed im grateful thanks you pretty down sir on the floor has mr davies told you about al haig no get him to its his favourite when you feel low like the worlds kicking you get him to do his al haig story goodnight sir perry turned for the door then stopped theres something i dont understand i was asked by the london people to leave and i refused we had a shouting match they came back this morning tried again new life and a removal van and again i refused but they called this evening it was all soft soap and they accepted my decision to stay whyd they change course dont know sir couldnt say perry went to the bottom of the stairs and hesitated can i ask you mr blake in a live situation have you ever fired your gun only the once two shots stone dead pints of blood on the pavement just happened to be there and just happened to be armed because i was going off duty before you ask i didnt feel good about it and i didnt feel bad about it i shot a beef bullock that had broken out of an abattoir pen and was running up a high street in south london i didnt feel anything get him to tell you the al haig story goodnight sir frank perry climbed the stairs past the winking light of the security sensor and went to bed chapter ten hello here already cathy hows it going getting there steadily not there yet it was the saturday morning the early underground trains were empty and geoff markham had reckoned that hed be the first there would only be lowlife in early on a saturday morning cox was down in the country for the weekend to be disturbed only with news of earthquakeshattering proportions the warhorse from b branch would be in charge but not in before nine and thered be a probationer to answer his telephone fenton could be called at home markham should have been driving with vicky to see her parents in hampshire hed still been smarting from the fracas with her when he had grabbed his coat and briefcase and fled the flat hed met the postman on the pavement and snatched his mail bills and circulars a couple of other envelopes catalogues and then hurried for the station vicky had said that her mother was cooking a special lunch it had been in his diary for weeks her mother had invited friends in and vickys brother and his partner were also driving up from london after the few bitter words and then the harsh silence markham had put the phone down on her and run he could have stayed out of thames house that morning and that afternoon and all of sunday he could have made an issue of it to fenton whinged about the hours hed put in through the week he hadnt instead hed rung fenton early before hed rung vicky and told him what he intended gained the necessary clearance actually he didnt think vickys mother thought much of him didnt rate him as a good catch for her daughter but vicky was two years older than him and there wouldnt be that many more chances of marriage coming her way so he was tolerated cathy parker the legend was back at her screen studying it with concentration as if he wasnt there in his cubicle he checked the answer phone and there was the sb overnight digest to get through he took a sheet of clean paper to his door and used the black marker pen day three he went off on a wander down the corridor to the coffee machines the building was hushed quiet weekends in thames house were like a plague time the corridor was darkened every second light was off as a part of the newest economy campaign the doors were shut the notice boards for cheap holiday advertising through the civilservice union for rentable cottages in the country and secondhand cars were in shadow perhaps he should ring vickys mother with an apology but later and maybe send some flowers he swore softly he hadnt the right change for two cardboard cups of coffee only for one and he didnt know whether she took sugar whether she took milk the first big decision of geoff markhams morning milk and no sugar he stamped back down the corridor his footfall echoing past the locked doors the american in the same suit and a clean shirt was sitting opposite her now he had a newspaper in front of his face and his chair was tilted back his scuffed shoes on the table he felt a youngsters hesitation i thought you might like a coffee she looked up if i want coffee i am capable of getting it ive brought a milkandnosugar i dont take milk in coffee she was at her screen typing briskly the american grinned mr markham i could murder for coffee flushing markham slapped the cardboard cup on to the desk in front of him spilling it youre most kind mr markham miss parker tells me youre going down to your juliet sevens territory did she and id like to hitch a ride would you sos we get the hassle out of the system good and quick may we just establish some minor points if you had a problem getting out of bed that is not a concern of mine if you have a problem with working weekends i dont because i work every weekend ok you have been tasked as my liaison and i think us going down to juliet sevens territory is a good idea and a smile helps to start the day littelbaum spoke with the same quiet relaxed tone with which he had laid out the notion of the tethered goat the image had stayed with markham through the night littelbaum swung his shoes off the desk and reached for the coffee markham said shrilly if thats what you want then thats what youll get he headed back to his cubicle for his coat and the american trailed behind him she is mr markham a very fine young woman a very attractive young woman ah day three the american had paused in front of the door and the smile rippled at his face i believe that weve four days remaining he will move and very soon he will want to strike as soon as is practical i assume by now he or his collaborators will have gone close for reconnaissance and he will already know that the target is protected that will not deter him only delay him dont get a comfortable dangerous illusion into your head mr markham that he will see the protection and back off he has the spirit of alamut where it was all about blind obedience and discipline let me tell you a story about old times at alamut markham snatched up his briefcase shrugged into his coat slammed the door shut behind him he went fast and sourly towards the corridor the american was at his shoulder in the time of the old man of the mountain hasanisabah alamut was visited by king henry of champagne that was a big prestigious visit hasanisabah needed to put on a show that would impress the king with the dedication of the fidais the show he put on was the death leap centuries later marco polo on his travels heard about it and chronicled it hasanisabah had some of his people walk to a clifftop a high cliff then jump off to their deaths they werent pushed they were volunteers thats obedience and thats discipline im telling you mr markham so you understand better the commitment of your opposition they just walked off the cliff because thats what theyd been told to do he held out his hand and felt the beat of the rain vahid hosseins arm was at full stretch in his fingers was one of the last pieces of chewed rabbit meat the bird watched him the rain made a spray of jewelled colours on its collar feathers and on its back it was beside his hand and he saw the wild suspicion in its eyes he thought the suspicion fought with its exhaustion and hunger each time it hopped closer he could see the darkening flesh of the wound under the wing and he knew the bird would die unless he could clean it he made small sounds slight whistling noises the cries he had heard long before in a faraway marshland like a hen bird to chicks the beak of the bird with the power to rip at his hand was beside his fingers and the chewed meat he saw the talons that could gouge his flesh he had woken and crawled from his bramble den the bird had been watching him and hed taken comfort from it once again he had skirted the marsh cut through old covert into hoist covert and crossed the river for a final time hed gone over the ground he would use at the end of that day he had approached the house from the side and had found a tree in a garden under which the grass was covered with a carpet of blownaway blossom he had sat motionless in the tree for an hour from it he could see the back and the side of the house across three gardens he saw the soft light in the hut and the curtained black windows he watched the policemen backlit when they opened the door of the hut emerge and walk the perimeter of the garden and he saw the guns they carried the car cruised past every twenty minutes as regular as if a clock timed it that night he would return in the darkness at the end of the day and he would use the rifle the harrier in a darting movement took the chewed meat from his fingers he could have wept with happiness there was caked blood and yellow mucus on the wound carefully as if he moved forward on a target vahid hossein took another scrap of meat with his free hand chewed on it and laid it on his wrist the bird flapped jumped he felt its talons strike into his arm and then the prick of the beak as it took the chewed meat from his wrist the bird perched on his arm and with great gentleness he stroked the wet feathers on the crown of its head its saturday i really think mr perry we should talk this through its what i do every saturday you have to accept mr perry and i am picking my words with care that the situation has changed i havent been out not even into the garden of my house in two days which has been sensible i am bloody suffocating in here enough is enough i go out every saturday lunchtime mr perry i am not responsible for the situation oh thats brilliant i suppose im responsible blame me thats convenient it was another of those moments when bill davies thought it necessary to assert his authority you are in my opinion totally responsible you told my colleague mr blake last night about your read ion to a radio appeal that gave your former identity probably half of the adult population of the country heard that appeal and the name of the hospital you were directed to dont you think that the iranian embassy listens to the earlymorning news bulletins on the radio which follow directly after such appeals im not a highflying detective but im bright enough to put that together theyd have picked you up there then hung on to the trace it was your mistake just as the weapon in the playground was mine dont get me wrong mr perry im not one of those people wholl say youve brought all this on yourself through emotional carelessness but i know plenty who would that was just to set the record straight brought all this on yourself but the principal had a streak of obstinacy which davies found mildly attractive perry blinked absorbed what he was told gulped then said its saturday and im going your last word last final word i cant take it another whole day like a rat in a cage ill make the arrangements what arrangements its not straightforward mr perry getting you out for a saturday lunchtime drink then back from the pub his principal had swung out of the dining room and shut the door noisily petulantly behind him bill davies sat again at the diningroom table reading the paper hed rung home that morning hoped one of the boys would pick it up but lily had hed tried to be pleasant to make reasonable noises and shed asked him when he was coming home but he couldnt answer her hadnt been able to think of anything else to say shed put down the phone on him in seventeen weeks he had had nine complete days off work and for four of them he had been so tired he had slept through till midday his marriage was going down the drain and he didnt know what he could do about it hed seen it often enough with other guys who all put on the brave front and moved out of their homes to shack up with barmaids and slags some were taken off sb protection and some smoothtalked the counsellor and kept the job and the firearm had the meetings in parks and at mcdonalds with the kids every third weekend and they all talked about the new woman in their lives as if it were heaven he could never find the time to think about it he was too busy too stressed if it happened if bill davies would have two or three seconds to react top estimate should his mind be on his wife his kids in those seconds he would lose his principal if it happened all the case histories he knew were about mistakes and distractions he pushed up from the table and went to the window the diningroom window was next on her list for net curtains he stood back from the glass and peered out he could see the neat homes the tended gardens the shop more homes and then the village hall with waste ground at the back it had been raining earlier and the road glistened there was thin sunshine now but the rain was threatening from the sea at the end of the road on the corner was the pub from the window he could see only the end gable of the building he counted eighteen houses on the left side between the house and the pub and the parked cars and fifteen on the right side with the shop at the shooting range they used was hogans alley a row of plywood houses and in front of them were derelict gutted cars behind the plywood and in the cars were cardboard shapes that could jump into vision when to fire when not to fire was the reason for hogans alley they used simunition there painttipped mm plastic bullets the target might have a weapon or be holding a baby against her chest no escape when walking hogans alley hold the fire and the instructor would tell you drily youre dead mate he got you fire too soon and youd be told you killed a woman mate youre charged with murder the road the houses the parked cars was hogans alley all the way to the pub she came into the dining room and brought him a mug of coffee thats very kind of you mrs perry but you didnt have to i was doing one for myself youre going to the pub thats what mr perry wants so thats what were going to do its not about a drink its about finding his friends i appreciate that he has to have his friends yes she was close to him he could smell the scent and warmth of her and could see the worndown strain at her eyes it was always worse for the women she held a handkerchief in her hand pulling and worrying at it had he put his arm around her shoulder then her head would have gone to his chest and he thought she would have wept it was not his job to offer comfort he thanked her for the coffee and began to make the arrangements to visit the pub at lunchtime they were at the last stages of the discharge of the crude the weather at the offshore jetty was too fierce to permit his crew to work with paint rollers on the superstructure and hull plates of the tanker the masters crew were employed on small maintenance jobs in the accommodation block below the bridge and in the engine housing unnecessary work but something had to be found for them the masters greater concern more than finding work for his crew and occupation for his officers was the failure of the people in tehran to provide him with a time for sailing he still expected to leave the waters of the terminal port that night but the coded confirmation had not reached him the man who had gone over the side of his tanker was never far from his thoughts it was not possible for the master to believe this man was blocked he demanded of his radio technicians that they maintain a watch through every hour of the day he waited hello can you put me through to theft section thanks hello whos that tracy its gladys yes gladys jones ive still got flu yes thats what i heard a lot of it about im not coming in not passing it all round yes beds the best place can you tell them in personnel thanks what police what sort of police what did they want thanks tracy itll just be something silly thanks ill sort it when ive got rid of the flu no im not in trouble bye she pocketed the handkerchief through which she had spoken to give the sound of illness to her voice and put down the receiver of the payphone a woman beat her knuckles impatiently on the glass screen beside her she felt faint worse than if she had influenza detectives had been in that morning a saturday morning when only a halfstrength staff worked till lunchtime had searched through the drawers of her desk and asked where she was if they knew her name they would know also her car she staggered away from the payphone barging past the woman she had been told there were four detectives she was an intelligent young woman she could assess the scale of the crisis that faced her but it did not cross the mind of farida yasmin that she should run hide and abandon him he needed her martindale kept the red lion in the village he was a brewery tenant and every penny of cash ever saved by him and his wife was now sunk in the pub along with the banks overdraft it had been a mistake the mistake had been in coming to the village on a warm crowded august day two summers back seeing the visitors parading on the beach and queuing for icecreams at the shop and believing that he could do profitable trade where his predecessor had failed he had thought the market was in visitors wanting cheap meals and fruit machines but last summer it had rained in torrents and the visitors had stayed away it had been their dream through all the years theyd owned a corner news agent in hounslow to have a busy pretty pub on the coast now the dream was going sour and the bank manager wrote more often his winter trade was entirely local not gin and tonics not sherries not whiskies with ginger but the brewerys beers and lagers on which the markup was least profitable he had enough locals to make a darts team and they came in wearing their work clothes to prop themselves against his bar if he alienated his few regulars he would not be able to meet the brewerys dues and keep the bloody bank off his back he quite liked frank perry martindale owed frank perry frank perry had helped him sort out at minimal cost the centralheating boiler in the cellar if hed gone to the trade it would have been maximum expense the far side of the bar the previous night the talk had been of frank perry the school and the policemen with guns he scraped open the bolts on the front door against which the rain lashed and waited for his saturday lunchtime drinkers ill look ridiculous davies said firmly in matters of protection mr perry please do me the courtesy of accepting my advice it weighs half a ton mr perry i am asking you to wear it i cant mr perry put it on no meryl exploded for christs sake frank put the bloody thing on they were in the kitchen the boy stephen was in the shed with paget and rankin out in the garden it would be worse if the kid heard the parents rowing davies held the bulletproof vest what does it matter what you bloody well look like she added put it on his principal took off the anorak and scowled but hed been chastened by the fury of her outburst she turned went out crashed the door shut after her and they heard her stamping up the stairs his principal dropped his head and davies slipped on the vest it was navy blue kevlarplated and the manufacturers said it was proof against a handguns bullets flying glass and metal shrapnel it covered perrys chest stomach and back davies pulled the velcro straps tight and fastened them she came back in carrying a grotesquely large sweater perry was foulfaced but she just threw it at him davies kept a wry little smile hidden because the sweater fitted comfortably over the vest and what about you what i do mr perry is not your concern i hope you find them meryl said find what what youre looking for i shouldnt expect too much perry led followed by davies he held his radio up to his face and told paget and rankin that he was leaving the location in the company of juliet seven through the front door the wind and rain whipped at them they walked briskly the house was now a gloomy bunker and he thought it was precious for his principal to get out of it daviess eyes raked each of the front gardens to his right and left and the parked cars since he had given the instruction the unmarked mobile had gone up and down the road seven times between the house and the pub it was what it took to get a man his saturday lunchtime drink they had started at walking pace then they jogged davies held the hem of his jacket so that his glock in the waist holster would not be exposed the rain came on harder and they ran going to the pub was an idiotic unnecessary risk before he had left the bedandbreakfast a call to the duty officer had told him they were now categorized as threatlevel the principal is confirmed on a death list the enemy intend to kill the principal the security coordinator does not have the method or the time at which the attempt will be made davies knew it by heart he had done protection officer on threatlevel years back when he had guarded the secretary of state for northern ireland but he had never been with a principal categorized as threatlevel as they sprinted across the carpark in front of the pub he was thinking that it would be worse for her left behind in the bunker lights out curtains drawn they reached the porch davies used his sleeve to wipe his face then smoothed his hair he heard laughter from inside and canned music in front of him the principal stiffened momentarily as if gathering his nerve before shoving open the door a man was leaning against the bar talking perry said almost diffident hello vince another younger man at the bar stopped laughing all right then gussie another man older was perched on a stool good to see you paul round the corner was a larger bar with more drinkers davies wasnt concerned with them he stared around him at the fruit machines tables and chairs reproduction photographs in sepia tint on the walls and bits of ship brass the smoking fire burning wet logs the story had stopped and the laughter the older man held his glass against his privates and beer was frothed on his lip the landlord was a skinny wheyfaced weasel with a cigarette hanging from his mouth davies thought it a pitiful place everything around him was fake he noticed a chair at the side of the bar away from the drinkers where he could face the door and also see round the corner whats it going to be mr davies orange juice thanks he eased down into the chair the west middlesex whine of the landlords voice cut the silence before you go asking im not serving you far as im concerned the sooner you turn round and get back out of here the better oh yes very funny mines a pint and an orange juice thanks perry was fishing for coins in his pocket davies glanced down the blackboard on which was chalked the menu for the day sausage and chips and peas burger and chips and peas steak and chips and peas im not having you in here its within my rights im not serving you come on a pint and an orange juice you want it spelled out i am not serving you ive my custom to think of that man with you hes carrying a gun im not having that on my premises and im not having you got it bugger off davies stood up from the chair saw the stunned shock spreading on his principals face and the cold hostility of the men hed called vince gussie and paul and the landlords smirk his principal clenched his fists and the blood flushed his cheeks davies kicked back his chair and strode towards the bar he caught his principals sweater and propelled him out through the door left it open let the rain spatter in he heard the laughter behind him the rain ran on perrys face he seemed dazed and in shock i thought he was a good man ignorant a bore but a good man jesus i just dont believe it davies said lets get the hell out cant credit it the bloody man when i was low last night didnt think i could get lower blake said i should ask for the al haig story when youre further down thats when youll get the al haig story they were standing in the middle of the road away ahead wipers flailing headlights on was the unmarked car there was a sign public footpath to the left davies took the principals arm and headed for it they walked between the banks of nettles and brambles stepping over the dog shit towards the rumble of the sea they crossed a wooden bridge the rain was in his hair in his eyes wgighting his jacket wrapping the sodden trousers against his legs he radioed the wendy house and told them they were going to the beach the marshland began a thousand metres to his right they scrambled up the loose tumbling stones of the sea wall clawing their way to the top into the teeth of the wind and the rainstorm the tide was out the pebble and shellpocked beach ran down to the sea in front of them beyond the tideline were the white crested waves then the shroud of the mist his principal shrugged his arm clear they walked together the rain plastered his hair across his forehead and davies shivered in the cuffing cold of the wind his principal stopped faced the sea and the emptiness sucked the breath into his lungs and shouted you bastards you fucking bastards i thought you were my friends what did he do why do you need to know i have to know what he did and the consequences of it otherwise i cannot evaluate the reality of the threat didnt anybody tell you what the end game was nobodys told me and nobodys told him geoff markham drove it had taken an hour of the journey to clean the detritus from his mind only when they were out on the open road did he begin to push why ask me i believe because you are here that you were a part of it you need to know unless i know mr littelbaum i cannot do my job the american sighed its not a pleasant story mr markham its about greater and lesser evils one of the rooms walls was covered by the bigscale maps the largest showed western irans seaboard the gulf the eastern coastline of saudi arabia and the emirates a second map showed a city plan of bandar abbas and the road going westnorthwest past the docks past the hotel naghshe jahan towards bandare khoemir tilted against the opposite wall were two displayboards on which were pinned the photographs of selected personnel from the bogus petrochemical plant although it was early on a bright morning the blinds of the rooms windows were drawn hanging in front of them was the blownup satellite photograph of the manufacturing plant they waited they had received the call from the airport which told them he had arrived safely off the flight they smoked sipped coffee and nibbled at biscuits in the room were two men and a woman from the secret intelligence service three americans representing the agency and the bureau and the military and the two israelis they waited for him to be brought to the discreet back door normally used as an entry and exit point for kitchen staff and vetted cleaners if it had not been for the most recently received intelligence briefings none of the men and the one woman in the room would have countenanced the plan that was now set in place they made desultory conversation none would willingly have given such a pivotal position in the plan to a lowgrade engineering salesman but it was accepted that the choice was not theirs he was the access point only he could tell them whether the plan could be launched or should be aborted they waited in the room just as officers of the israeli mossad waited in secrecy in the american huts of an egyptian airbase with the pilots who would fly them south just as the officers and crew of a united states navy fast patrol boat waited off the emirates port of shaijah all of them waited for the arrival of the one individual who could give them the information required to launch or abort he was led in he was wan strained swaying on his feet with tiredness his hands trembled as he gulped orange juice they all knew the risk he had taken they let his nerves steady he was sat in a chair and he told them in a stumbling monologue all that he knew about the restaurant about the bus about the invitation list to the celebration meal when they had finished with him teased out of him the precious information on which the plan depended he was taken out by penny flowers to be told of the new life offered him after he was gone after the final assessment of his information the cypher messages were sent and the mission was launched what do you mean the greater evils try the missile programme five years ago yes how far along that line were the iranians we were getting a mess of reports on the warheads but all contradictory on when theyd be ready with nuclear chemical and microbiological we could handle that live with it explain that mr littelbaum we thought we had a little time but not with missiles they werent contradictory on the missiles very clear very precise without missiles warheads dont count they were up to speed with the missile programme maybe two years away you cannot launch a warhead until youve a missile go to the top of the class mr markham we needed to buy the time to slow the programme but the installations are underground bombproof have air defence with an army round them enter juliet seven he gave us the way in we couldnt reach the hardware so the option we had was with their personnel the director was in the front of the bus a double seat to himself behind him sat the project managers the scientists and the foreign engineers he was relaxed and felt a sense of happy satisfaction behind him he heard the gentle joking banter of the men who had made possible the advancement of projects and and the babble of farsi russian chinese and the north koreans dialect it was a worthy occasion the retirement party for his colleague who controlled project and he had personally taken time to oversee the arrangements in the restaurant down to the detail of the menu that would be served and the music that would be played he rocked contentedly in his seat he had believed ever since his education in mechanical engineering at imperial college london university that a happy team was a productive team the bus sped down the narrow road beyond the docks and left the city behind he was lighting a cigarette the flame close to his nostrils when the driver stamped on the brake he saw the man peering ahead through the cigarette smoke and the windscreen a red light waved in the nights darkness the bus slowed as the driver pumped the brake he leaned forward to make out a shadowed figure behind the light and then a roadworks emergency sign he disliked lateness and glanced at his watch he saw thought he saw a figure pass beside the bus carrying something but could not be certain the barrier was pulled aside and the bus powered on past the man holding the light he eased back into his seat above the cackle of accents and laughter the director heard the single thud from the side of the bus behind him and twisted instinctively towards the source of the noise the last thing that registered clearly in his mind was the sight of the wall of fire coming like a torrent in spate through the bus in the final moments of his life the fire surged against his clothes the skin of his hands and face and beating in his ears were the screams of the scientists and foreign engineers trapped in the bus with the flames and the screams there was no possibility of escape the personnel burned to death christ we delayed the programme but the missile factories were the same the morning after not the same yes bits of metal remained in underground workshops but the team was gone take the team away and you screw the projects men matter its simply not possible to fly in replacements and carry on as if nothing had happened the missile programme was the greater evil in three years they would have had the capability of striking against any country in the middle east including israel even the possibility of reaching southern europe we bought five years what was the lesser evil for three consecutive days the satellite photography showed the skeletal shape of the burnedout bus on the first day the movement of rescue workers retrieving bodies could be clearly seen from the enhanced pictures with fire engines and ambulances radio tehran carried reports of a tragic road accident in which twentyfour men involved in the petrochemical industry had died the next day the photography showed a small group of forensic experts identified by their white overalls crawling through the gutted bus and radio tehran made no mention of the accident on the third day the pictures beamed from the satellite showed the bus being loaded on to a flattop lorry and radio tehrans bulletins had brief reports of local funerals by that third day the united states navy fast patrol boat had returned to normal duties and the united states air force had flown five agents of the mossad to israel and the life of gavin hughes had been painted out twentyfour men killed did i hear right mr littelbaum is that what youre telling me i can barely believe what youre saying what you heard a programme was delayed that was the greater evil their weapons of mass destruction threatened our interests and what the hell was the lesser evil the involvement of juliet seven gavin hughes the mission was done skilfully and theyd a poor forensic infrastructure it was days going on two weeks before they could confirm the initial suspicion of sabotage and by then gavin hughes had ceased to exist im damn near speechless it was pure savagery we were looking after our backs and we did it well you were involved to a small degree liaison yes i was involved did you consider the human misery the widows the children we considered the effect of the missile programme i dont really find emotion helps me get through the day what about the little awkward matter of statesponsored terrorism not applicable if the iranians kill one of their kurds in berlin wherever or a man anywhere in europe whos planning murder mayhem in tehran we shout scream recall ambassadors impose trade sanctions we call it statesponsored terrorism correct if we roast twentyfour iranians we call it looking after our backs forgive me but that is mindbending hypocrisy you are driving too fast again mr markham and if the israelis go into jordan to murder an activist that is justifiable selfdefence you should slow down a bit mr markham i would suggest to you that the prime objective of an intelligence agent is to further by clandestine means the objectives of the taxpayers who put food in his gut and a roof over his head i believe in morality i dont get to mix with people who use that word often thats a better speed thank you i hope you sleep well at night i sleep excellently thank you if we all talked about morality mr markham wed none of us finish a days work you used that poor bloody sales engineer what the lady miss parker said your work took you to ireland unless you were completely useless at your job i would have to assume that you used people were competent at running agents manipulating them exploiting them then you let them go they did a job of work for you did you go and see your line manager and bleat about your unhappiness at the ethics of running informers when does the marksman shoot mr littelbaum i beg your pardon does the marksman shoot as the predator approaches the tethered goat or when its on the goat he shoots when he has the optimum chance of a clean kill its nice country out here its a little bit like west iowa country thank you for what for telling me do you feel the better for it im devastated but yes im the better for knowing it would your juliet seven be the better for knowing it will you tell him i dont know i feel like throwing up he was betrayed treated like shit i think were going to hit the rain which is a shame listen mr markham we went to a hell of a lot of trouble to do your juliet seven a favour the israelis could have machinegunned the bus and left their callingcard bullets and grenades we insisted on the fire and gave the mossad the hardware which guaranteed slow difficult progress for the iranian investigators we bought your man time for his disappearance he should have been safe beyond their reach i imagine if you ever have the chance to look for it it was his error that led them here we did enough for him do you think theres time to stop for a pork pie and a beer the beach seemed endless stretching to the horizon where the cloud was poised over the grey stones of the wall behind which was the marshland the wind and rain beat relentlessly on their backs not until they turned for home did his principal start to talk davies stayed a pace behind him look at this place its as good as dead its condemned everything here is for nothing the sea rules and eats at the place like its rotten and decayed seven hundred years ago this place was alive it had a great fleet for trade fishing and boatbuilding the saxons the vikings and the normans settled here where we are now it had wealth their boats sailed after fish as far north as iceland and they traded as far south as spain and east to the baltic the sea killed this place that same sea in january there was a storm and a million tons of sand and stone was washed across the river mouth the wealth went and the land began to follow it the sea has the ultimate power it eats at the cliffs and at the beach every minute of every day right here where we are its a yard a year up the coast not far its four hundred yards in the last five years the fucking place and everyone whos here theyre all doomed little people fucking pygmies living their lives thinking they can change things theyve bulldozed sea walls concreted the base of the cliffs put in groynes and breakwaters but it doesnt make a damn of difference the sea keeps on coming a couple of miles down the coast was the tenth biggest town in england five churches built by people who thought that theyd last for ever now theyre all gone into the sea they were pygmies then and pygmies now the sea cannot be resisted were all dead here doomed we have no future we build little houses little gardens make our little lives and for what for flicking nothing people paid masons to carve gravestones so that the lives of their fathers mothers brothers sisters would be remembered but the stones are under the sea like theyd never existed we worry about the present but were just too small the future is the sea coming in taking snatching in spite of our little efforts to protect ourselves there is nothing we can do because there is no defence will you tell me when do you think the bastard will come in the distance on the sea wall wrapped in a dark anorak and waterproof leggings watching them facing into the thrust of the wind and the drive of the rain was one of the policemen from the unmarked car he cradled his gun close to his body as if to protect himself against the onslaught of the gathering storm now and in the future what davies drenched wet and frozen had been told was that the killer would come soon but he didnt say it chapter eleven geoff markham didnt like to drink in the middle of the day and had sipped a fruit juice the american had washed down the pork pie with a dark pint from a wooden barrel and there had been salad with the pie in the car the onion was still on littelbaums breath markham hesitated before turning at the signpost to the village a cattlecarrier lorry swerved past him and gave him a long blast on the horn it was all as he remembered it ahead of him was the high water tower the dominating feature and the american gazed at it with a sort of awe but didnt speak beside him flanking the road was a small carpark and a sign tobys walks picnic area away to the right was northmarsh to the left were wide flat fields covered with halfmoon pig shelters he swung the car on to the minor road of course it was the same how could it be any different the american smiled apologetically and murmured that he needed and badly to relieve himself markham drove into the carpark of the picnic area and saw what was different there were two men in an unmarked car uniformed wearing kevlar vests and silly little baseball caps but there was nothing silly about the barrel of the heckler amp koch aimed at him through the open side window he braked littelbaum said that he couldnt have lasted much longer and dived for the bushes markham held up his id card for the policemen to see and sauntered towards them he introduced himself and said the american had bladder problems he asked them how it was the aim of the gun was no longer on his chest he was told that they had the registration and the make of a car to look for and it was all right in daylight whats that mean the policeman grimaced its a sod of a place after dark so quiet last night before the changeover but after it got dark we saw this shape in the bushes bloody near crapped myself seemed to be watching us i got the gun on it then two dogs came out it was a woman walking her dogs in the dark like a bloody ghost proper turn it gave me its tobys walks here she asked all straightfaced had we seen toby she was serious had we seen toby we asked the old biddy who was toby you know what he was black toby tobias gill no lie its what she said and he was a black drummer in the dragoons who got pissed up went looking for a bit of fanny and brought her up here he was found black toby was the next morning drunk and incapable and she was beside him raped and strangled they took him to the assizes and then carted him back here to hang him in chains it was two hundred and fifty years ago and the old biddy said he liked to walk round here rattling his bloody chains its that sort of place after what shed told us we heard every bloody bush move last night every bloody creak of every bloody tree she meant it she was really surprised we hadnt seen him the american came out of the bushes and was pulling up his zip markham didnt laugh at the story out there a shadowy figure was moving in darkness among cover silent without the rattling of chains towards a target and a place of death he felt the cold wind coming off the sea and shuddered they climbed back into the car and he drove on of course it was different and for some it would never again be the same markham asked the american what he wanted to see and littelbaums finger jutted towards the church tower the rain had come on heavily while theyd stopped for lunch but now had eased into a fine persistent drizzle he could see the first houses of the village and the church tower looming above them he was unsettled it wasnt only the policemans story of the ghost of the black drummer it was also what littelbaum had told him of alamut a place of death and a bus ride out of bandar abbas a place of carnage and he remembered what cathy parker had said and asked it would be decided down here at the village body to body as it always was at close quarters and was he tough enough he felt inadequate it was no longer about people like himself rated as intelligent educated and thoughtful it was about guns and nerve this was a power play littelbaum pinched his arm and pointed to the parking layby at the side of the church at the near end was a fine squat tower perhaps seventyfive feet in height with wide walls of flint facing behind it were the nave and the high chancel windows and between them were stout yellowed stone buttresses beyond the church was a ruin once finer and larger than its neighbour but now roofless and with the rain coming through the clerestory windows markham asked the american what he wanted to do and was told he wished to go inside he had a fascination for churches and a total respect for the quality of the architects and craftsmen who had built them but the ruin disturbed him death so close to life he pushed open the church door there were a few lights in the dull dim interior as there had been in the weekend corridors at thames house that morning a clergyman came towards him a gaunt fleshlessfaced older man markham thought littelbaum was following him he offered his hand in friendship and lied said that he often diverted on a journey to see a worthwhile church he heard the aged squeak of the hinges of a small door to the side a smile lit the clergymans face as if few came to see his church the flowers were already in place for sundays service the only brightness stretching towards the altar and the stained glass of the arched window behind it on the walls were the carved plaques remembering the dead the clergyman said there was an older church of course but thats gone flooded by the sea first time round then washed away the origin of the building here is fifteenth century and a magnificent building it would have been but the village died there were four altars here now theres just the one once we had a bell that weighed threequarters of a ton but the community sold it off in because they were dying from deprivation and hunger its so good to meet someone whos interested my names hackett markham looked around him past the old carvedstone font and could not see littelbaum if he had been alone in the church he would have said a short private prayer for those whod been in the bus the clergyman droned on disease poverty fires all decimated the population of the village i sometimes say that this is a place without a present only a past thats how it feels here sometimes he was in the bath meryl had made them undress at the back door had insisted on it davies thought by now that perry would have told her of the disaster in the pub would have come up with an explanation as to why they had come back sodden with sand caking their shoes she came into the bathroom davies had hitched his wristwatch to the cold tap and was allowing himself five minutes defrost time the holster and the glock were within reach on the floor with the radio she had brought two of perrys dressinggowns to the back door there was no knock and no hesitation or apology he sat upright and hunched forward to obscure his waist hips and groin from her meryl carried a heap of folded clothes her face was expressionless like those of the nurses had been while he couldnt wash himself sponging his privates after hed broken his ankle falling from a ladder when trying to get through a back window to plant a bug there was a towel on top of the clothes they could have been left outside the door and she could have shouted to him that they were there she laid the towel and the clothes on the chair beside his head davies stared straight ahead and wondered how close she was to the edge of her sanity it wasnt his job to prop up the morale of his principal let alone that of his principals wife he felt himself to be the crutch on which she leaned it was nothing to do with his personality his warmth or his wit it was because he had a glock mm pistol in a holster lying on the bright pink fluffy mat beside the bath she came into the bathroom where he was naked for comfort from him and from his gun the wristwatch showed that his time was up he had not the heart to tell her that he could not be her friend he reached for the towel hid himself clumsily stood up in the bath and began to dry himself he thanked her for bringing him the clothes she went out of the bathroom and closed the door after her she had not said a single word duane littelbaum paused took his handkerchief and mopped the sweat off his forehead he swayed clung to the rail and climbed again he had a horror of heights but beyond the horror was a cruel sense of obligation he had to climb the tower he went up the narrow worn spiralled steps if he had slipped he would have plunged the door at the top was bolted and the bolt rusted he couldnt move it he balanced on a smooth worn step then heaved his shoulder into the door it gave pitching him forward through the doorway on to the small square floor of the towers top the wind snatched at him his coat was lifted and his tie was torn from his waistcoat the drizzle made his eyes smart he looked around him and clung with both hands to the low crenellated wall from the vantagepoint he gazed down over the village his hair was ripped to a tangle he could see the road that was the one point of entry into the village and the lanes off it the clusters of homes and the patchwork shape of the green he saw the house and the roof of the small wood hut behind it he saw the endless disappearing seascape the house its position was of small interest to duane littelbaum he sank to his hands and knees and crabbed around the square floor space never dared to look vertically down there were the marshlands dull yellowed reeds and darkwater channels between them the marshlands were to the south of the village behind the sea wall and to the northwest reached by the one road the village was an island surrounded by the old reeds the dark water and the sea he estimated that each of the great marshes was a full three thousand metres long and a minimum of a thousand wide he saw the thick cover of trees around the fringes of the marshlands the tracks between the marshlands and the village in spite of his fear without thinking he straightened his back lifted his head and his nostrils flared he snorted the air into them he was satisfied he had posed the questions and had answered them he crawled back towards the flapping door he took a last look at the marshes and saw the gulls white specks meandering above them he wedged the door shut after him and came down the spiral steps with his eyes closed he heard the clergymans voice everything went the bells the lead the bestcut stones sad but inevitable they have a history the native people of this community of great suffering it makes for a cruelty and a selfsufficiency the original church was lost because survival took precedence over principle littelbaum walked out into the rain and the wind markham came after him what do you want to do now go back to london you dont want to see the house at least drive past it no you dont want to meet the protection officer thank you hed be a busy man well he should be he wouldnt want tourists no actually you hitched a lift with me i had a day planned down here i needed to see for myself the interruption brooked no argument are you a marksman i dont think so are you expert at drawing defensive perimeter lines i doubt it theres nothing for you here dont sulk mr markham youre a good driver always do what you do well markham unlocked the car held the door open for him littelbaum felt aged tired cold the tone of markhams voice was resentful the teeth of a saw on a buried nail so back to london i hope its been a worthwhile exercise for you mr littelbaum above and beyond lunch it was worthwhile can we have the heater on full please hes there mr markham i saw where he is it was like i could smell him the bird ate the minced meat stabbing down with its beak in quick urgent strokes vahid hossein had led her to the small clearing among the bramble and thorn at the edge of the marsh where the grass was short from the rabbits feeding farida yasmin did not know whether he had brought her there out of a sense of boastfulness or whether he wished to share with her his fingers were long gentle and sensitive she was behind him within reach of him he had sat her down told her not to move and whistled into the lateafternoon light the bird had come from close by had materialized over the dead reed fronds with a laboured flight now he stroked its head feathers with his fingers and he used her handkerchief to clean the wound the bird permitted it she hoped it was not a boast but the demonstration of his wish to share with her a moment so precious his fingers moved on the feathers soothing the bird and pried into the wound and she saw the peace on his face it was as if that day she had slipped from the mindset of farida yasmin jones the identity of her faith was discarded as a snakes skin was shed that day she had she knew it and it did not trouble her reverted to the world of gladys eva jones she had stolen a car any kid from her comprehensive school knew how to steal a car it was the talk in the canteen at lunch and in the grounds in midmorning break and on the bus going home she had listened in disgust years before as boys girls had talked through the theory of how to do it and she had remembered what she had heard she was a thief had broken the rule of the faith as it had been taught her and she did not care in the parking area beside the small railway station where the london commuters left their cars for the day she had felt a raw excitement and it had been so easy the hairpin into the lock of the blue fiat because all the kids always said that the small fiat was the simplest to take and the stripping of the covering the marrying up of the ignition wires she was a thief a few seconds work with a hairpin and she was no longer the virtuous farida yasmin who could recite the pillars of the faith pages of the koran and had once been the favoured pupil of sheik amir muhammad she had not felt shame only excitement she watched him watched his fingers on the bird watched the rifle lying half out of the sausage bag on the far side of him and the excitement was a toxin in her bloodstream it was now a part of her she recognized that it had nothing to do with the islamic faith to which she had dutifully converted for all her teenage and adult life gladys eva jones had craved to be noticed to be valued he had listened thoughtfully when shed told him that the police had been to her workplace and had nodded his quiet appreciation when she had described the theft of the car she sat and watched him the bird and the gun she knew what he planned to do that night had even seen the man he would kill and could remember each feature of that mans face the excitement the knowledge engendered in her was a liberation at last gladys eva jones was a person of importance the sensation was as fresh as morning frost to her compared to the dull tedium of her parents home and the shunned shutout existence at the university her hand hovered over the hair at the back of his head she thought of the empty boredom of theft section at the insurance company and she stroked the hair on his head with the same gentleness as he caressed the feathers of the bird her hand trembled as if she sensed the danger of what she did the bird flapped away in heavy flight and his eyes followed it watching its wingbeat soon he would be gone with the rifle and she would wait at the car for him to return he needed her and the knowledge of it gave her the confidence to slip her hand down on to the skin and bristly hair at the back of his neck she knew the man who would be killed that night and the house where he would be killed and the excitement coursed in her there had been an older boy in her street who had a air rifle it was fired on wasteland where a factory had been demolished many times shed gone after him to the waste ground and hung back had never quie had the courage to ask him if she could fire it shed dreamed at night about the chance to hold the rifle aim it and fire it one summer evening the boy had shot a pellet against a passing bus and the police had come and taken it away so shed never had the chance but for the lonely unpopular girl the rifle had stayed in her mind as the symbol of the boys power on the waste ground with his friends he swaggered when he carried it the dream from childhood was roused one hand still stroked the hair at the back of his neck but her other hand moved in slow stealth behind his back until her fingers touched the weapons barrel which protruded from his bag she felt its clean smoothness and the tackiness of the grease and her fingers slid on the oiled parts she imagined it against her shoulder and her finger against the trigger and she touched the sharpness of the foresight and she thought of the sight locking on to the chest of the man in the house on the green her hand moved faster but more firmly on the nape of his neck but her fingers glided in gentleness on the cool metal of the rifles barrel he could see what she did but he could not snatch the rifle away from her because that movement would frighten the bird she said very quietly i should be with you no i could help you his free hand had moved to hers she felt the roughness of his hand covering it she would be with him following him and sharing with him she had in truth no comprehension of the thudding blow of the rifle stock against a shoulder or the earsplitting noise of the discharge and the soaring kick of the barrel she only understood the power that the rifle offered the pain was in her hand relentlessly he squeezed her hand down on to the sharp point of the foresight crushed it until she struggled to remove it his eyes never left the bird he freed her hand and she quietly sucked the blood from the small punctured wound she kneaded the muscles at the back of his neck i go alone vahid hossein said always i am alone i am here to give you anything you need farida yasmin whispered meryl heard the impertinent lingering blast of the bell she was in the kitchen locking the legs of the ironing board with the heap of washed and dried clothes in a basket at her feet she started for the door to still its insistent shrillness it surprised her that frank had not gone to answer it she heard the voice of davies the detective speaking into his radio in the hall stephen was with her at the kitchen table methodically writing in his school exercise book in spite of it all he was doing the weekend work that his class teacher had set that was her next looming problem monday morning and no school frank shouted down from upstairs that he was on the toilet davies was at the door waiting for her to come and assuring her that the camera had picked up one of the village people she switched off the iron all frank had told her was that martindale the bastard would not serve him davies opened the door and she saw vince smelt his beer breath she was behind davies its all right mr davies its vince hello vince god dont say youve come to start on the chimney vince was the most fancied builderdecorator in the village there were others but he was the best known he was a great starter and a poor finisher but those with a leak or a slipped tile or the need for a sudden repainting of a spare bedroom for a visitor knew they could rely on him and he was a popular rogue the revenue had looked at him twice in the last seven years and hed seen them off he was in a constant state of dispute with the parish council because of the builders supplies dumped in the front garden of his former council house now his freehold property behind the church anyone who could lay a hand on a bible and say they would never have a rainwater leak or a slipped tile or the need for fast redecoration could call him a fraud a bully a botcher there were not many small powerful his arms heavily tattooed he was everybodys friend and knew it and exploited it what vince believed in above all else was the quality of his humour he had no doubt that his jokes made him a popular cornerstone in the village meryl tittered nervously the mortar was coming out of the brickwork on the chimney it was just something to say surely youre not going up there actually ive come for my money what money why what im owed frank paid you he paid me two fifty down but there was more materials ive got the bills he was routing in his trouser pocket dragging out small crumpled sheets of paper im owed nineteen pounds and fortyseven pence you said it was inclusive for stephens bedroom everything for two fifty i got it wrong you owe me then youll get the extra when you come to do the chimney if youre still here if pigs fly if what does that mean hed been in her kitchen she made him four pots of tea each working day and gave him cake shed left him with the key when shed gone out and hed been working in the house shed trusted him what on earth are you talking about if you havent moonlighted going arent you ill be left owed nineteen pounds and fortyseven pence and youll be gone ive come for my money she choked i cant believe this arent you franks friend were not going anywhere no well you should be youre not wanted she stuttered go away when ive got my money the detective moved without warning stepping forward two three paces he caught at vinces collar and had him up on to his toes when the fist came up davies caught it as if he was handling a child he twisted it hard against vinces back pivoted him round and marched him back down the path she heard everything davies said into vinces ear listen scumbag dont come here to play the fucking bully go back to that godawful pub and tell them that these people arent leaving and dont ever bloody come back here with a jerk of his arm the detective pushed vince down on to his knees in the roadway forced his face into the deepest and widest of the puddles and kept hold of him until he stopped struggling lay still in submission davies released him and stepped cleanly back to watch vince crawl away she leaned against the wall beside the door davies came back in and closed it quietly behind him she hadnt noticed it before but franks trousers were too short for him and his sweater was too tight she put her hand on his arm thank you i dont suppose you should have done that i dont suppose i should frank would have called him a friend he went up on the roof in a storm last winter very gently he took her hand from the sleeve of the sweater she didnt look into his face didnt dare to she looked down at his waist and the gun in the holster what you have to understand mrs perry its all totally predictable its not peculiar to here it would happen if you lived anywhere it would be the same if you were in a suburb or a city street its what people do when theyre frightened maybe youll find someone out there who has the guts to stand in your corner and maybe you wont what you have to remember theyre ordinary people people youd find anywhere you cant expect anything else from them the lavatory flushed upstairs ill get the ironing done how long will it be till they come for frank thank you the stuffs a bit tight on me he disappeared into the dining room in the kitchen her stephen was still doggedly writing in his exercise book even though he would have heard each word vince had said to her outside the night was coming and the curtains were tightly drawn against it vince had always been so good with stephen had made him laugh would they come that night for frank or the night after or the night after that she shook and tried to hold the iron steady in a vile temper fenton returned to thames house from his lunch it should have been lunch and shopping with his wife if the wretched man had not cancelled lunch for monday and insisted his only opportunity was saturday fenton had bartered with his wife lunch with the academic and then shopping with her having access to the full range of his plastic he came up to the third floor was told there was nothing new of note then went into his office to shed his coat and spill his micro taperecorder on to the desk the lunch had further confused him and the expensive shopping had wounded him he had not used this source before but the file said he was sound the academic was whitehaired and gingerbearded a professor of islamic studies at a minor college at the university had a face lined like a popular skirun from sudan the confusion from the softvoiced lecture had fuelled fentons temper he listened to the tape again what distresses me is the hostility of the western media and the western orientalists towards the islamic faith they are servants of imperialism they stigmatize stereotype and categorize us and any scholar of the faith of islam is labelled with the title of fundamentalist theres no denying it is a term used with hostility if we judged christianity by the excesses of the inquisition or if we took the fascist elements in zionism to reflect the faith of judaism you would be horrified if we talked always about apartheid and nazism as examples of christian belief you would rightly criticize us but when a zealot hijacks an aircraft he is labelled an islamic fundamentalist if a lunatic shoots children in a school do we call him a christian fundamentalist you live by a double standard you follow slavishly the american need to have an enemy and you plant that title without the slightest reason on the faithful of islam they had been in the students canteen a dreary cavern of a building theyd colleded salads and fruit juice from a selfservice counter not a bottle of wine in sight and the academic had persistently questioned the woman at the till to be certain there was no alcohol in the vinegar that accompanied the salad you distrust us in your midst even those muslims who are british citizens our colleges for converts in this country are monitored by the security forces why because we are different because we live by other criteria is it that you fear believers and the standards to which they dedicate their lives a muslim will not steal from you will not seduce your wife will not go to prostitutes and yet the strength of our decency is regarded as a threat so we are harassed by the political police everything you talk about involves this threat but it is a figment of your imagination we are not drunk in the street and looking for violence we are not hooligans would a virtuous young woman an islamic convert join in a criminal conspiracy of murder the very idea is preposterous and shows the depths of your prejudice fenton had listened and toyed unhappily with his lettuce leaves probably left over from the previous weeks catering they had a table to themselves he had attended the royal military academy at sandhurst not university and when his eyes wandered to the students sitting around them hed felt a sense of disgust you have made a growth industry in the study of the islamic faith but the work is shallow you seek to vilify iran to cast that great nation and its people in a mould of the medieval i tell you mr fenton where there is the sharia the law of islam you would find it safe to walk in the streets it is a code of fairness charity and decency yes there is a death sentence yes there is very occasional amputation and the flogging of offenders but only after the most rigorous examination of the felon by the courts i venture to say that there are many in the united kingdom socalled christians who yearn for the punishment of the guilty but to suggest as you do mr fenton that the legally elected government of iran would seek clandestine vengeance abroad is just another example of a warped and closed mind let me tell you if a small incident or a trivial event occurred if you made from it a fraudulent link with iran if you danced to the american tune if you made lying public statements then the consequences could be most grave do you dance to that tune mr fenton are you acting now as a lackey to those islamophobic elements of the american establishment who wish to block the return of more normal relationships between iran and the united states a false and deceitful move would lead mr fenton to the most desperate of consequences of course i do not threaten you but i warn that your irrelevant and decadent country would be at war with a billion muslims throughout the world i do not think you would wish that so earnestly at the end of a meal that left him hungry he had fled the canteen with a deep sigh fenton switched off the taperecorder he had worn under his jacket the two roads split ahead of him and the directions they took were opposite and irreconcilable was islamic iran a force for good which he was too bigoted to appreciate or a force for evil which made a sewer of the streets of his country he did not know which road led to truth what he did know was that abigail fenton had punished him for her missed lunch with the price of a new handbag a dress and a matching twinset he rang cox in the country and hoped he was disturbing him he told him what he had learned whichever way they twisted was fraught with problems cox said his confidence in fentons judgement was as always total hed always thought of cox as a timeserving networking fool now he began to doubt that opinion he wandered towards cathy parker im confused cathy goes with the rank harry i dont know whether its real cant quite bring myself to believe it the threat best harry as the actress said to the bishop just to lie back and enjoy the ride do you want to be told if itll blow some clarity into a fogged old mind bollocks youre loving every minute of it he grinned she laughed and started to map it out what they had a man had come in from the sea a car had crashed the man had moved on an associate was missing from home but photographs had been found of a target and a location between each point she rapped her pen on the desk as if to alert him then her face lightened ive found a marriage the daughter of a british oil engineer to an iranian doctor theres a cousin down in somerset whatll that give you who knows might give me a face i dont like to see you confused confusion is like haemorrhoids harry embarrassing for you and therefore bloody unpleasant for the rest of us im making it my business by hand to swab away your confusion do you believe in it the threat id be a right idiot if i didnt and the tethered goat do you believe in that she laughed into his face im just the bottle washer its your responsibility harry not mine you volunteered the blue fiat was behind a hedge hidden from the road brought up in the provinces by a family without military or criminal links she had compensated for her lack of experience in such areas by the simple application of common sense using basic logic she had thought through each of her moves the car was the right colour to avoid attention the station with commuters not coming back from london until the middle evening had been the right place to steal it from her own car was abandoned in woods she had unscrewed the numberplates and buried them under fallen leaves it would be days or weeks before it was found reported she had done each thing sensibly and even if he had wanted to be could not have criticized what she had done she sat in the car in the silence in the dark and her mind wafted between her two contrary worlds farida yasmin or gladys eva he would now be making the final checks on his rifle and would be smearing mud on his face she shuddered and tried to pray to his god her god to protect him when she tried to pray she was farida yasmin jones the man was guarded under her sweater she was running her fingers over the skin of her stomach as he had caressed the birds feathers as she had stroked his hair the man was guarded with guns it was the first moment that she had considered the realities of the guards the guns she thought of him shot bleeding as her fingers moved faster pressed harder she was gladys eva jones she thought of herself waiting and alone she thought of the boots on his neck where her fingers had been and the pools of blood soon he would be moving off tracking beside the marshes towards the lights of the village geoff markham had crossed the orbital motorway and was coming through the dirty sprawl of east londons streets littelbaum had slept on the open road but the jerking drive through the traffic had wakened him and he talked pathetic really a sign of age that i cannot climb a narrow staircase without a palpitation im fine now im warm and ive had my necessary sleep i owe you an explanation why a hundred miles driving out of london a quick climb of the church tower and a hundred miles drive back has not been a waste of your time markham stared into the weaving mass of cars vans and lorries in heavy concentration i am not a criminologist or an academic most certainly not a clinical psychologist i detest those shrinks who charge fat fees for profiling i am simply mr markham an ageing soldier of the bureau i have been in tehran and saudi arabia for the last twenty years of my working life i said because i know those places and those people i could smell him its not vanity its the truth markham drove past the brightly lit shop windows festooned with bargain stickers and kept his silence he had noted that not a word of sympathy had been expressed by the american for frank perry and his family as if there were no room in the job for compassion my tools of trade mr markham are intuition and experience and i value them equally actually there is little thats complicated we are told he is late thirties he would have been eighteen or nineteen years old when the ayatollah returned from exile then comes the war with iraq the military are not trusted the principal fighting is given to the fanatical but untrained youth of the revolutionary guard corps they fought with a quite extraordinary and humbling innovative ness and dedication they made up the rule books of combat as they went along any man given the responsibility for a mission of this importance or the importance of the bombings in riyadh or dhahran would have come through that route he saw the men who carried the clusters of shoppingbags and the women who pushed prams and the voice in his ear dripped the story of a world they would not have comprehended markham would be joining the great uncomprehending masses because he did not believe he had the ability to affect events most of life is a linked chain think about it the iranians could not match the quality of the iraqi weaponry that had been provided by the western powers they had to learn to improvise and fight where that hardware was least effective they chose the most unpromising ground you wont have heard of these battles mr markham but they were of primitive ferocity fish lake and the jasmin canal the hauralhawizeh marshes the shattalarab waterway and the faw peninsula the battleground for the best of the revolutionary guard corps was water and reedbanks by choosing to fight on such hostile and difficult territory they nullified the sophisticated equipment of their enemy and thats why i had to climb to the highest point the vantageposition i am not ashamed to say it i was on my hands and my knees petrified i surveyed the battleground and all i could see was water and marshes its where he would be it is why i said it was like i could smell him dont waste fuel by sending up helicopters with infrared the iraqis did that and dont waste peoples time by commissioning aerial imageintensified photography they did that as well he will be hiding there and an army wouldnt find him but he has to come out mr markham and then god willing you shoot him one day before the end of the week he would tell littelbaum insist on it that he was geoff that he was a colleague and not a stranger he didnt know whether the formality of the american was oldworld iowa courtesy or the patronizing talk of a veteran to a youngster but as the bright lights of the city reflected up into his eyes from the roadway he listened to every word and believed them he thought the american brought as much soul to the business as he did when he played a board game with vicky it was actually distasteful and near to being disgusting you are a polite man mr markham you havent interrupted my rambling and polite enough to humour me by driving slowly but if you had been less polite you would have interrupted to ask the question that is most pertinent what sort of man is he let me tell you he is a child of the revolution when you were chasing girls mr markham he would have been on the barricades facing the bullets of the shahs army when you were studying at college he would have been learning to survive against heavy artillery barrages and mustardgas bombing when you were playing at war in ireland he was killing with expertise in the harsh environment of saudi arabia he will be a man who has never known youth gaiety and mischief as you have he will be a man without love ahead of them was the thames house building and the light was going over the river its been a grand day ive said all i can my part in this is about played out would the tower of london be open tomorrow my esther would be properly upset if i didnt send her some photographs of london history theres not a lot of history in west iowa i wont be going down there again not till its finished i dont believe in secondguessing the experts its in their hands now the people with the guns remember what i said a man without love a man who wont walk away ill go down again if theres a body to view id like that if it can be done inside my schedule markham swung the car down into the basement carpark he turned off the ignition and stared to the front before turning to face littelbaum can i ask something no several things he said briskly havent i given you the chance im sorry fire away it may sound like an idiotic question mr littelbaum but do you think you change anything do you believe you do anything thats honourable and worthwhile do you care about people have you ever considered walking away and picking up work where theres something finite at the end is it a decent job markham looked into the americans old eyes and saw the light flash in them that tells me youre thinking of bugging out its not for me to offer persuasion either way but i dont think youre the sort to drop out ive been through the bad times when its just filing paper and getting a cold ass in a surveillance stakeout and theres no big picture to tell me its worthwhile ive done that i hung on in there i got a grip and i hauled myself up and i thought whining was poor sport i believe in what i do i think i serve my countrys interests theres plenty of places back where i come from that have banks and realestate offices and insurance companies where i could have gotten work and i think it would have been slow death but im a selfish man and i love what i do and i aim to keep doing it if they threw me out tomorrow i might just go find a veterinary surgeon and ask him to put me down i cant think mr markham of a better thing that a man can do than to serve his country and not have it bother him that no one knows his name and no one will ever learn what he did littelbaum had reached for the doorhandle markham said thank you ive met your principal i was at the meetings that evaluated the information he gave hes a tough proud able man dont make a judgement on me because im not modern and emotionally incontinent i hope sincerely he makes it through this but im honest with you my countrys interests are paramount to me you cant go soft on this i have to tell you i have very little respect for quitters only later were they able to put together the sequence of events they were all trained men but their memories were hazy and fuddled on one thing they were all agreed dave paget joe rankin leo blake and bill davies the speed with which it happened so fucking fast dave paget and joe rankin sat in the wendy house the door shut tight against the cold it was fifteen minutes to the end of the twelvehour shift they were both wouldnt have admitted it knackered when they cared to look at it the television screen alternated between the view of the back garden and the view of the front approach to the house on the console the lights indicating the state of the sensor beams were steady on green joe paget was finishing the last of the sandwiches and muttering about where they would go to eat where theyd find a new pub because last nights meal had been a bloody disaster dave rankin flipped the pages of two magazines simultaneously survival kit and holidays talking to himself about thermal socks and about which month had the best weather in bournemouth and eastbourne was engaged in a mindless interior dialogue a red light on the console bleeped indicating that a sensor beam was broken at the bottom end of the garden joe paget said it was that bloody fox again and dave rankin said that bournemouth was as good as eastbourne if it was out of season something moved on the screen at the far end of the garden leo blake tried to slip quietly past the sittingroom door of the b and b but was ambushed by mrs fairbrother how long were they intending to stay they were not the sort of trade she was used to did he realize how inconvenient it was to have him sleeping in their house through the day she had a shrill moneyed voice and the bark hadnt been lost with the change in fortunes he said that he didnt know ducked past her and hurried out to his car bill davies was reading his newspaper in the dining room the radio and the heckler amp koch resting on the blanket covering the table he was warm had an electric fire on two bars and clean meryl had ironed his shirt his underwear and his socks and had attempted to press the creases out of his suit only his shoes were still damp and they were filled with the sports section of his newspaper he had his feet up on the table the television was on next door in the living room and they were all there he glanced down at his watch blake would be relieving him in five or six minutes his radio crackled to life jolting him from the newspaper dave paget and joe rankin were both numbed into silence the first call out to the house was the warning now they stared at the screen and were checking for the confirmation paget was very pale rankin was sweating their machineguns were hooked over their necks and shoulders red lights began to replace green lights on the console twice the camera caught a movement and twice lost it somewhere down at the bottom of the garden where the shrubs were and the greenhouse it wasnt like hogans alley and it had fuckall sweet fucking nothing to do with the shooting range what the hell should they do quit the wendy house crab towards the end of the garden where the beams were broken and the movement showed shout activate the bloody floodlights run for the house there was no flicking instructor to tell them what to do they saw him on the screen he was coming up the side of the garden a blurred white figure they saw the rifle outlined against a grey furred background then it was gone paget swore and rankin gave the confirmation into the radio it might have been the rain and the maintenance on the pool cars was worse than last year when it had been worse than the year before but it took leo blake an age to start the damned engine he sat in his car and revved long enough for the curtain behind him to part and he saw mrs fairbrother scowling at him bloody car and hed have some bloody words for the maintenance people bill davies burst the door open into the living room the advertisements were playing between the soaps the machinegun dangled free on its strap and thudded against his body he was shouting they sat frozen perry was in his chair holding his coffee mug meryl had her needlework on her lap stephen was on the floor with his computer game he was shouting and they did not respond and he was shouting louder he grabbed his principal and hauled him up from the chair and the coffee flew in the air and down to the carpet he was dragging his principal helpless like a sack of sand out into the hall the radio was blasting in his earpiece and she hadnt come and neither had the kid he snatched open the door of the cupboard under the staircase and pitched his principal inside perry cannoned against the vacuum cleaner the brooms the boots the kids old push chair and the junk he went back shouldnt have done for her and the kid broke the drill they practised the principal should have been his only priority he caught her arm and the kids wrist she was screaming and the kid and he threw them in the cupboard against his principal he crouched by the door god if they would just stop screaming joe paget stayed at the console and watched the screen dave rankin ducked out of the wendy house launched himself on to the lawn rolled then crawled towards the kitchen door and the cover of the waterbutt each had the selector off safety had gone to singleshot each had one in the breach each had the finger on the trigger guard joe paget told dave rankin face microphone to earpiece that the tango was out of the beams off camera where was the bastard where the fuck was he leo blake was going down the drive when he switched on the radio he heard the chaos on the net and the gravel spewed out from under his bill davies had his principal buried deep in the cupboard and the kid was in there behind him but the woman was still screaming he held her he had to with one hand he aimed his machinegun at the front door with the other hand he clutched her to him he held her against his chest to stifle the screaming and she sobbed hopelessly joe paget said that the tango had gone up the side of the house would be on the neighbours patch and the front was not covered dave rankin swore said hed try to cover the front his breath was heaving and to joe paget he was damn bloody close to going incoherent coming across him and dave rankin was bill davies crying out for cover at the front and the womans sobs were across everything and the unmarked car at the main road was playing bolshie and saying they werent supposed to move off station and the unmarked car that was cruising was more than two minutes leo blake came round the corner by the village hall and with the green ahead of him had to swerve to miss an old man with a terrier bill davies heard the shoulder hammer into the front door where there was a new lock and an old bolt and held his hand over her mouth and tried to muffle the sobbing that would pinpoint for the tango where they were the door sagged dave rankin fell into the cold frame at the side of the house crashed through the glass sprawled and lost the momentum of his charge leo blake drove straight across the grass of the green wheels spinning skidding hit a young tree and flattened it with its post he swung his wheel and had the front of the house in his full lights and saw him bill davies heard the door splintering for a flickering moment joe paget saw him again white against grey then lost him as the cars lights blacked out his screen leo blake had the tango in his lights he could see the mans camouflage combat gear his mudsmeared face and the assault rifle the man as if it was his final desperate effort threw his weight against the door blake shared the heckler amp koch with davies and now only had the glock in a shoulder holster hed forgotten it its presence there was clean out of his mind he dazzled the tango with his lights the tango had the rifle up aiming towards the car but couldnt see through the lights blake knew the rifle had fired the same weapon on the range knew its killing power he thought his last best chance was to charge the man with the lights on full beam the tango thrust an arm over his blinded eyes then ran the man sprinted full stride along the track in front of the houses there was a moment when the back of the tango was in front of the car and then the man tried to sidestep towards the cover of a hedge clutching the wheel leo blake felt the jolt as he clipped the tango and he was past him the car surged on spun turned the full circle leo blake saw lying on the grass the kalashnikov he switched off the engine he tried to be calm to report what he had done what he had seen bill davies held the woman his hand still over her mouth the sound of bitter argument on the soap played from the living room through the hall and into the cupboard he said it was all right he said it was over and he realized that he had no shoes on joe paget sat motionless in front of his console and watched the green lights of the unbroken beams far away dave rankin heard the splinter crack of a fence breaking as if it were rotten and gave under the weight of a man he walked out of the front garden and across the grass to the kalashnikov cleared it and made it safe leo blake sat in his car and tried to slow the beating of his heart he put the window down for air and the stench came to him from the hedge of old stagnant mud bill davies took his hand from meryl perrys mouth dear geoffrey it was good to see you in person and hear you at first hand if we had any doubts about your suitability or your readiness to take responsibility then you most decisively struck them out my colleague and i are therefore very pleased to be able to offer you employment with the bank you would start in our pensions investment section where we would monitor your progress before deciding where in our operations you would sit most comfortably our human resources section is currently drafting a letter setting out a proposed salary structure along with bonus emoluments which you will receive on monday if they are acceptable please let me know when you can start with us the sooner the better as far as we are concerned we would wish you to resign from your present employment at the earliest opportunity sincerely the letter was under her buttocks it was vickys reward it was creased and crumpled and her thighs gripped his waist and her ankles locked against the small of his back the drink made her noisy she had cooked for the two of them something mexican his absence at lunch with her mother was forgiven and shed drunk most of the bottle hed brought round shyly he had shown her the letter that had lain unopened all day in his briefcase she had left the plates the empty glasses and the finished bottle on the table and taken him and his letter to her bed wasnt he clever wasnt he brilliant wasnt the future opening for them he was too tired to enjoy it but he pretended she grunted and squealed and kept him inside her long after he was finished when would he resign when would he be shot of the bloody place it was as if vicky had given him a present his pager bleeped on his belt his belt was in his trousers on the floor by the door where shed pulled them off him he prised open her thighs and fell off her all he wanted to do was to sleep and to forget the oneroad village the prey and the predator the high church tower that overlooked the marshlands he crawled to his trousers and read the pagers message mark ham c ire juliet fared hit get back soonest fen ton he started to dress she lay on the bed limp her legs apart he pulled on his underpants his trousers shirt and his socks the letter still peeped from under her buttocks he pulled on his shoes and knotted the laces he went to the bed and tried to kiss her mouth but she turned her head away and his lips brushed her cheek its the last time you do this to me the last bloody time youre not running back to them again like theyre your bloody mother chapter twelve bill davies had clung to the pillow in the bed in his dream mind meryl had been with him through the night the pillow was the principals wife he had held her close against him in the doorway of the cupboard under the stairs when her body had shaken with the sobbing and he had held the pillow against his chest the pillow had been soft vulnerable needing protection he had slipped out of the house before mrs fairbrother was downstairs an hour before his wakeup call he had driven away from the village out past the church to the woodland by the carpark and the picnic site he had pulled up an oak sapling from the ground wrenched it up from the sandy soil and had found a pile of posts for fencing that had been left by the foresters and taken one he had thrown the sapling and a post into the boot of the car he waved grimly to the men in the unmarked car theyd be the same shift as had been on last night and the beggars had played by the rule book and said they werent permitted to leave their station hed have them later in the morning hed burn them when he could get his guvnor on the telephone it would have been shades of hell for that family but the unmarked car had followed the rule book and the family could have died because of it he shook his head sharply as if to block the memory and started up his car he pulled on to the road and had to brake sharply hed damn near run into the back of the van at snails pace it was going towards the village he was about to hit the horn when he realized the implication of the painted words on the back of the van dannys removals nothing too large or too small go anywhere anytime and there was a london telephone number the removals van was lost and trying to find an address in the village why hadnt blake radioed him or his guvnor telephoned him he wondered whether theyd already gone with their suitcases and whether the van was just to pick up their furniture and possessions they could have bloody told him after everything hed done for them he beat his fist in frustration against the steeringwheel hed been in charge of the security and it had so damn near gone wrong was he responsible for the family running momentarily he shut his eyes lost sight of the big back doors of the van hed thought perry had the balls to stick it out even if the wife hadnt a van meant that perry was going or had gone he felt limp washed through he thought that he had failed he couldnt blame them for going not after last night he thought the bastards had won the bastards were not a man with an assault rifle but the men in the pub the neighbour the people at the school the bastards the friends had won the day a man ran out from a hedge ahead looked like a lunatic on the loose and waved frantically to the dawdling van he was wearing a raincoat under which the hem of a nightshirt showed and bedroom slippers the brake lights flashed davies saw the forsale sign on to which the sold board had been nailed the man was pointing to the narrow driveway of the cottage he stopped and breathed hard he thought it was his tiredness that had made him react so fast and so stupidly he waited while the van manoeuvred into the driveway of rose cottage then powered away down the empty road he realized then how much the family meant to him in the halflight of the sunday morning bill davies used the shorthandled spade from the boot to hack out the broken tree on the green and the snappedoff post that had held it the broken tree an ornamental cherry was in bud and would soon have been in flower last night the wheels of blakes car and its chassis had miraculously cleared the small plaque commemorating the planting of the tree by the parish council as a mark of respect for the dead princess he dug a deeper pit and planted the oak sapling in the cherry trees place then used the back of the spade to hammer down the stolen post he tossed the broken tree and the snapped stake behind the waterbutt at the side of perrys house where there had been a cherry tree there was now an oak sapling where there had been a stake there was now a post he used the point of the spade to scuff up the grass and cover the tracks of blakes tyres he folded away the spade a teenage boy was working down the far side of the green with a bicycleload of newspapers two cars went down the road at the side of the green and plumed exhaust fumes behind them he shivered in the chill of the morning and wondered if she had slept or had clung to her husband his principal and bill davies was satisfied the evidence of the night action was erased he had told them in london in his interim report of the highly professional defence of his principal and his principals family he had written in a stuttering hand then controlled his voice to hide its quaver as hed dictated a brisk litany of lies they might just believe it in london he looked across the green and the roofs of the houses towards the watery low light growing on the seas horizon line he looked at the house and the drawn curtains on the bedroom window and he wondered how they would be he was walking to the front door when the neighbour spilled out from the nextdoor house a word i want a word with you wroughton the neighbour was in a dressinggown and slippers his hair wasnt combed and he hadnt yet shaved davies saw the wife behind him half hiding in the halls shadows how can i be of help what happened here last night im not aware that anything happened there was a car was there really and shouting must have been a television turned up too loud are you telling me that nothing happened here last night if theres anything you need to be told mr wroughton youll be told it he stared into the neighbours eyes challenged him then watched him back off and go back inside bill davies could be a quality liar and a goodgrade bully he saw the womans face at the window beside the door smiled cheerfully at her and waved a man with a highvelocity assault rifle had been in the darkness a few feet from where that woman her husband and children had lain in their beds and listened to tyre screams and panicked shouts there were enough complications in bill daviess work day without added responsibility for the neighbours he felt the burden of it and stamped up the path to ring the bell the previous week he would have sworn it couldnt happen that he would be emotionally involved with his principals family blake told him that a dog team had arrived three hours earlier found a trail through the gardens down the green across rough ground and had lost the trail in the river apparently there was no blood on the trail the dogs had worked the riverbank blake said but had failed to regain the scent a van had come an hour before and collected the assault rifle how were they in the house blake shrugged they were predictable what was predictable they were on the floor would they get off the floor and again blake shrugged as if it wasnt his concern but the woman had cried in the night and twice the man had come down the stairs and poured whisky swigged it and gone back up theyd had the kid in the bed with them was blake ten hours later sure hed hit the man blake was sure and to emphasize his certainty led him to the car and showed him the sharp dent in the paintwork over the near side wheel a small car a city runabout type came towards them instinctively his hand slipped inside his outer coat and rested on the glock he saw a young man at the wheel his eyes raking the ground ahead as he approached bill davies thought he was looking for the evidence of what had happened in the night but there was nothing for him to see it was like the aftermath of a road accident when the fire brigade had hosed down the tarmac the traffic police had swept up the glass and the recovery truck had towed away the wrecked vehicles the car stopped the window was lowered the young man stubble on his face tie loosened held up an id card davies thought he had been up all night im markham geoff markham im the liaison from thames house are you bill davies he nodded didnt bother to reply pleased to meet you theyre singing your praises at our place up to the rafters i mean it was a quality defence of a target wed have expected unadulterated chaos but what you did was brilliant theres a big meeting this morning up at secretaryofstate level thats why im here for liaison there has to be an evaluation of how the target will take the pressure waste of time really because your report indicates exceptional calm wed have reckoned theyd be screaming and bawling and packing their bags what was it like davies tried a thin smile well its what youre trained for yes we understand the dogs lost him on the way to the marshes going south ill talk to your principal later when ive had a walk about the place and found somewhere to bed down hope i wont be in your way theres talk of putting the army in to flush him out but thats for the meeting to decide i wont have it i cant accept it the secretary of state flexed his fingers nervously ground the palms of his hands together we should be there weve the expertise the colonel had driven from hereford through the dawn hours out of the question there has to be a different way special forces are the answer not policemen fenton was there with cox at the side of the secretary of state but a step back from him it amused fenton to see the politician writhe in the confrontation with the stocky barrelbodied soldier he understood the regiments commitment to northern ireland was reduced the colonel was touting for work for his people and for justification of their budget with the military and their backup all their paraphernalia equipment we escalate way beyond any acceptable level to government policemen cannot do it counterrevolutionary warfare wing should be deployed the colonel demanded the military going through those marshes like its a pheasantbeat a foxhunt ending in gunfire and a corpse thats an admission of our failure then you take the risk on your shoulders for the life of this man and for the lives of his family we can do it the colonel wore freshly laundered camouflage fatigues and his boots glowed fenton and cox were of course in suits the politician was of the new breed dressed down for a sunday morning in corduroys and a baggy sweater at thames house they harboured no love for the special air service regiment the gunningdown by plainclothes soldiers of three unarmed provisional ira terrorists in daylight in a crowded street in gibraltar had been in the opinion of the security service hierarchy simply vulgar each time the moment before he launched himself in speech the secretary of state glanced at fenton and cox as if they might offer him salvation and each time both men gazed away it would smack of persecution we have close to two million muslims in the country the effect of a military gunclub drive could be catastrophic for race relations in the united kingdom do you want the job done or dont you those relations are fragile enough even now were walking a tightrope between the cultures deployment of the army against what is probably a single individual and his inevitable death would create dangerous tensions quite apart from the effect on international dialogue the colonel thwacked his fist into the palm of his hand the idea of sending policemen into those marshes that sort of terrain against a dangerous fanatic is preposterous another way there has to be no my men have to go in for him the politician rocked and reached out to his table to steady himself perhaps fenton thought he saw an image of camouflaged soldiers dragging a body from the water of those hideous marshes that bordered the road going away from the godawful place perhaps he saw an image of young muslims barricading streets in old mill towns of central and northern england perhaps he saw an image of a british diplomat being pulled from his car by the mob in tehran or karachi khartoum or amman every politician every minister of government he had ever known was traumatized when the men came from the dark crevices at the edge of his fiefdom did not confide demanded freerange action and dumped on the desk a sackload of responsibility the colonel had his finger up wagged it at the secretary of state as if he prepared to go in for the kill there is no other way it was fentons moment he enjoyed always a trifle of mischief he looked at cox and cox nodded encouragement fenton smiled warmly i think i can help i think i can suggest an alternative procedure he had been there through the night and all of the day before the necessary stillness and silence were as second nature to him in that time he had eaten two cold sausages given him by his mother and not needed more he sat motionless sheltered by a rock from the worst of the wind he was a thousand feet above the small quarry beside the road where the police waited two hundred feet above the escarpment of raw stones and weathered tree sprigs where the eyrie was he had his telescope and the binoculars but he did not use them he could see all that he needed to see without them there was only the winds light whistle to break the silence rippling around him it was an hour since he had last whispered into the radio the police had given him and the birds at the eyrie were quieter now when the egg thieves came to the mountains the police always called him because as they told him he was the best the anger burned slowly in the young mans mind when he had climbed to his vantagepoint using dead ground never breaking the skyline or making a silhouette the birds had been frantic at the eyrie wheeling and crying it was impossible for the young man to comprehend that a collector would hire people to come to the eagles eyrie to take eggs and harder than impossible for him to understand that those same eggs a pair of them would be valued by the collector at a figure in excess of a thousand pounds the notion that the collector would hide the dead smooth eggs away from sight and keep them only for a personal gratification was impossible for him to believe he loved the birds he knew every one of the nine pairs that flew soared hunted within twenty miles of where he now sat the previous afternoon he had seen the decoy come down the mountain it was intended that the movement should be seen there was a routine and he had learned it the eyrie would be hit in darkness a pair of men would climb to it with the aid of passive infrared goggles and would lift the eggs they would move them down a few hundred metres and hide them they would be clean when they reached the road and their car a decoy would go on to the mountain the next day and appear to make a pickup would search in the heather or among boulders would seem to lift something and would then come down were he stopped and arrested the decoy too would be clean the surveillance would be blown and the eggs abandoned if the decoy were not stopped then a man would come for the pickup the following day the pickup man had gone close in the misty dawn light to a group of hinds had been within thirty yards of them and not disturbed them had been good but he had disturbed a solitary ptarmigan and that had been enough for the young man at his vantagepoint he had followed the pickup his eyes needling on him he had seen him lift the eggs from a hidingplace and start with great care to come down from the mountain he had told the police over the radio where he would reach the road the mountains of this distant corner of northwest scotland their eyries and the vantagepoints were the young mans kingdom he was andy chalmers twentyfour years old employed to shoot hinds in the forestry plantations for ten months of the year and to stalk stags for the guests of the owner of his estate mr gabriel fenton to shoot during the remaining two months of the year he was the junior by twenty years of the other stalkers of the neighbouring estates and in that small closeknit world he was a minor legend if he had not been exceptional he would never have been allowed near mr gabriel fentons guests were it not for his remarkable skills at covering ground in covert stealth he would have been relegated to renewing boundary posts and hammering in staples to fasten the fencing wire he was surly with the guests had no conversation treated wealthy men with undisguised contempt made them crawl on their stomachs in waterfilled gullies till they shook with exhaustion snarled at them if they coughed or spat phlegm and took them closer to the target stags than any of the other stalkers would have dared the guests adored his rudeness and insisted on him accompanying them when they returned in subsequent years he watched the distressed wheel of the birds above their thieved eyrie many times the pickup from cover searched the ground above and below him for evidence that he was identified and failed to find it there was little satisfaction for chalmers in the knowledge that the police waited in the small quarry beside the road the life warmth of the eggs was gone and the embryos already dead the pickup disappeared into the treeline that hid the quarry and the road the radio called him the wind blustered against him and rain was shafting the far end of the glen he looked a last time at the birds and felt a sense of shame that he could not help them he took the direct route down using a small stream bed the cascading icy water was over his ankles in his boots and he felt nothing but the shame he came to the quarry they were big men the police out from fort william and they towered over him but they treated this slight spare filthy young man with a rare respect they thanked him and then led him into the trees and pointed to the yellowed yolk of two eggs and the smashed shells the pickups always tried to destroy evidence in the moments before they were arrested he looked at the debris and thought of the fledglings they would have made and of the sad aimless flight over the eyrie of the adult birds he started towards the police car where the shavenheaded pickup sat handcuffed on the back seat but the policemen held his arms to prevent him reaching the door he was told there was a message for him at the factors office peggy was a cog in the wheel of the villages life she thought of herself as a large cog but to others in the community she was of small importance she didnt care to acknowledge that reality her husband dead nine years from thrombosis had been a district engineer with the water authority and within a week of burying him she had joined every committee that gave her access her loneliness was stifled by a workhorse dedication to activity nothing was too much trouble for her she hustled through the hours of the day out with her bicycle and her weathered bag on her duties with the womens institute and the wildlife group and the committee for the red cross she had a checklist of visits to be made each week to the young mothers and the sick and the elderly dressed in clothes of violently bright colours she believed herself popular and integral what she was asked to do she did she was happily unaware that to most of her fellow villagers she was a figure of ridicule she had no malice she had a loyalty on that sunday morning she was tasked by the wildlife group to perform a duty which would also feed the curiosity inquisitiveness on which she lived frank perry could see side on the slight wry grin on daviess face and his hand sliding away from under his jacket it wasnt anything perry had seen before peggys coat was a technicolour patchwork of colour and her garish lipstick matched none of the coats hues hello peggy keeping well yes peggy stared past him a sort of disappointment clouding her features not too bad thank you she said severely peggys disappointment he thought was that she hadnt spied out an armoured personnel carrier in the hall nor a platoon of crouched paratroops she was on her toes to see better into the unlit hall perry wondered if shed noticed the new tree and the new post the tyre marks she probably had because she missed little how can i help its meryl i came to see wildlife group business sorry youll have to make do with me meryls still upstairs the unmarked car cruised behind her and davies gave it a small wave as if to indicate that the woman in the dream coat was not a threat there were two more cars in the village that morning perry was unshaven half dressed and he had left meryl upstairs in bed she had been crying through half the night and only now had slipped into a beaten exhausted sleep peggy blurted her message i was asked to come the wildlife group asked me meryl was doing typing for us ive come for it ive been asked sorry youre confusing me but he was not confused just wasnt going to make it easy for her your next meetings not till tuesday shell have it done by then shell bring it with her ive been asked to take it from her by whom by everybody chairman treasurer secretary we want it back he was determined to make her spell it out word by bloody word but its not finished well finish it ourselves he said evenly shell bring it herself to the meeting on tuesday shes not wanted there we dont want her at our meeting the day after he meryl and stephen had moved in peggy had brought a freshbaked apple pie to the house of course shed wanted to look over the new arrivals but she had brought the pie and talked about infant schools for stephen with meryl the better shops and the reliable tradesmen and introduced her to the institute she had made meryl feel wanted he didnt curse as he wanted to he saw that the grin had chilled off the detectives face perry said quietly ill get them would you like to take the stuff for the red cross have they decided that meryl is a security risk too itll save you two visits yes she said loudly that would be best he went inside meryl called down to him to find out who was at the door he said he would be up in a moment he went into the kitchen last nights supper plates were still in the sink with the whisky glass he took the folders from the cupboard where meryl kept her typing and flipped through them there was the scrawled handwriting of minutes and deliberations by the group and the committee members the chaotic mess that had been dumped on his meryl her typed pages were clean neat because trouble was taken over them because care was important to her as he turned the pristine ordered pages of her work his resolve began to founder because of him his past his betrayal and his damned godgiven obstinacy she suffered he turned the pages of her typing prize lists outings letters of thanks to guest speakers all so bloody mundane and ordinary but they were the necessities of her life like an outcast he felt the touch of plague there was a church st jamess outside the next village down the coast which had been built on the site of a lepers hospital dominic had told him that when the church was built a hundred and fifty years back the labourers digging the foundations had found many skeletons not laid out as in christian burial but in rejected disarray when the first sore appeared suppurating and the first bleeding and a man was sent to the lepers place had his friends still known him or had they turned their backs he gathered meryls pages back into the folders and took them to the front door reaching past the detective to hand them to peggy she dropped the folders into her bag so much he could have said but meryl wouldnt have wanted it said there you are peggy everything you asked for he knew that by not cursing not swearing he destroyed her her chin shook and her tongue wriggled and spread the lipstick on her teeth i was sent it wasnt my idea youre with us or youre against us thats what they said if im against them im shut out doesnt matter to you frank you can move on ive nowhere else to go its not my fault im not to blame if i dont bring those papers back im out im a victim too its not personal frank she ran to her bicycle he let davies shut the door on her and climbed the stairs to the bedroom there was never a good time for telling a bad story she was wiping the sleep out of her eyes i dont want to tell you this but i have to peggy came to take away your typing for the wildlife group and the red cross shes going to do it herself we are not wanted i could have thrown it all at her face and made her grovel down in the road to pick it up i didnt i know what im doing to you he paused and drew a breath they say hes still out there he may be hurt but if the injury isnt severe hell come again they say the dogs found a scent then lost it peggys going to do the typing herself she screamed the shrill staccato burst of her scream filled the room she convulsed in the bed the scream died and her eyes stared up at him wide and frightened still in his pyjamas stephen was in the doorway holding a toy lorry and gazing at him he told stephen that his mother was unwell he tried to hold him but the boy recoiled he left the bedroom where there were no lights no pictures where the glass of the mirror on the dressingtable was scarred with adhesive tape he walked slowly down the dark stairs as if descending into the lower reaches of the bunker he stopped at the diningroom door how much worse does it have to get does what have to get mr perry how much worse does it have to get before im told the al haig story a bit worse mr perry he hung his head and how much worse does it have to get before i say im at the end of the road before im ready to run quit the detective sitting at the table the machinegun beside his hand looked up keenly that door was open once but not any more i think it was on offer a bit ago but its not an option mr perry not now cathy parker had used one of the sleeping hutches at the top of the building to catch four hours rest she came down to the floor fenton was there with cox she riffled through her papers for the address in somerset it would be a good drive shed enjoy the blessing of being clear of thames house she might have time to call in for tea or a sherry with her parents afterwards fenton was talking convincing you worry too much barney youll go to your grave worrying you heard what the american told young geoff this man is essentially a civilian he is not military doesnt have the mindset of manuals he will think like a civilian and move like one you dont put the military in against him you put another civilian there if it had been the military then youve lost control and thats some thing to worry about god the day i side with a politician is a day to remember she walked past the grinning fenton and cox whose face was an enigmatic mask and paused at the closed locked door she took a pen from her handbag and made a decisive line through the writing on the sheet of paper fastened there she wrote boldly day four and moved off down the dulllit corridor the iranian crude was offloaded the tanker was buoyed up monstrously high above the waves rippling against its hull riding to its anchor the radio message had still not been received perplexed the master called the terminal authority reported a turbine problem and requested that a barge come alongside to take his crew ashore he did not understand why the order to make the rendezvous had not reached him all day peggy had anticipated the opportunity to call on the new people who had moved into the cottage on the opposite side of the road to the church it was a dingy little place only three bedrooms old mrs wilson now in a nursing home had always said the damp in the walls of rose cottage had wrecked her hips the ride home had settled her after the confrontation with frank perry and shed collected the pie wrapped it in tinfoil and balanced it under the clip on the rack over the back wheel of her bicycle she had hoped to be invited inside but she had had to hand over her welcoming gift on the step a man had answered her sharp rap at the door wispyhaired slight raggedly and dully dressed and seemed to be astonished that a complete stranger brought an apple and blackberry pie to him he said his name was blackmore there were halfemptied packing cases in the hall behind him he told her no more about himself other than his name a woman came down the stairs picked her way between the rolled carpets and the boxes but the man did not introduce her and awkwardly held the pie he had been given peggy chattered her name where she lived the societies and groups in the village the woman had a sallow skin a foreigner perhaps from the mediterranean the bus timetable the early closing day in the town the best builder in the village the walks the milk delivery neither the man nor the woman responded the layout of the village the pub the hall the shop the green and they should not go near the green because of the disgraceful attitude of the people who lived there endangered the whole community protected by guns showed no respect for the safety of the village the man shrugged limply as if to indicate that he had work to be getting on with and passed the pie to the woman behind him when she reached out her hands to take it peggy saw very clearly that the woman had no nails on the tips of her fingers and thumbs peggys nails were painted sharp red to match her lipstick but where the womans nails should have been there was only dried wrinkled skin she came away feeling that they were uninteresting and unlikely to contribute to the life pulse of the village and that her pie was wasted on them show me she had waited all through the night in the car huddled in the passenger seat as she had waited her mind had been churned with the torment of her split identity the quiet had been broken by the owls and once a fox shadow had passed close she had sat hunched cold and waited she remembered yusufs kindness and the calmness of the teaching of sheik amir muhammad and the strength given her by the conversion to the muslim faith and she thought of the confidence that the name farida yasmin had brought to her it was as if the old world the existence of gladys eva jones demeaned and diminished her again and again alone she murmured the name that had given her strength and confidence without it she was base and trivial the old world was lustful and cheap the new world proud and worthwhile show the wound to me through the night she had listened for the crack of distant gunfire and she had heard only the owls as the hours had slipped away so her anxiety for him had increased nagging and worrying at her until she could no longer bear the loneliness of the vigil she had felt an increasing sense of disaster breaking in the dawn light she had left the car and tried to trace the route he had taken her the day before in fen covert shed avoided fallen dead branches stepped lightly on the leaves and not scuffed them kept wide from the path as hed shown her and she had heard the baying of big dogs then she had walked more quickly and her anxiety for him had been at fever point across the marshes beyond old covert she had been able to see right to the tower of the village church the early sun gleamed on the river that ran from the marshes and by the river were the dogs behind the dogs controlling them were the handlers behind the handlers guarding them were the marksmen with the guns on which the bulging telescopic sights were mounted they hunted for him they had not killed him and the knowledge of his survival brought pricking tears of happiness to farida yasmins cheeks you dont have to be shy but you have to show me where you are hurt so i can help while the sun had risen and the clouds had gathered off the sea and chased it the dogs had tracked back on the riverbank then searched away from it and shed known theyd lost the scent when the cloud had crossed the sun and the greyness had dulled the marsh reeds she had seen the handlers call off the dogs but she had taken note of where the marksmen settled where they watched from after the dogs had gone she had kept in the trees she had gone into the woodland of fen hill because of what she had endured the anxiety her anger snapped fine so you wont show me where so you dont want help well get up keep walking turn your back on it go home dont think about me what ive done if it had not been for the bird farida yasmin would not have found him it had lifted off flapped away cried then circled the bramble clump into which hed crawled he had seemed to be sleeping which had amazed her because his face was furrowed in pain she had wriggled on her stomach into the back of the thicket and been within arms reach of him when he had woken jerked up slashed his face on the thorn barbs gasped grabbed at her recognized her and then his eyes had closed his body had arched as if the pain ran rivers in him he had told her of his failure of the car the lost rifle the words had been whispered and his head stayed down she whipped him with her hissed words because of you what ive done for you ive police waiting for me im on the line for you are you staying or are you going are you going to let me treat your wound or not the rent was at the side of his fatigue trousers the car must have caught his hip and upper thigh ripping the seam of his trousers at the pocket she had seen the long distance he had come from where the dogs had lost his scent to fen hill he could not have come that far with a broken femur or fractured pelvis farida yasmin thought the failure would have hurt him the worst her hands trembled as she reached for his belt unfastened it and dragged down the zip it was hard to pull down the trousers were sodden wet she crouched low above him under the roof of bramble and thorn then pushed her arm under the small of his back and lurched his buttocks clear of the ground he didnt fight her as she dragged the trousers down towards his knees she saw the mottled purple and yellow bruising she saw the hair at the pit of his stomach the limit of the bruising and the small contracted penis he stared up at her her fingers so gently touched the bruise and she felt him wince she tried to soothe his pain she told him of the dogs and where the marksmen were she told him what she would do and how she would help him her fingers played on the bruising and caught the hairs and she saw him stiffen it was where her fingers had never been before his breathing came more slowly as if the pain lightened it was what the girls had talked about in the schoolyard and in the coffee shop at the university and in the canteen at work and then she the virgin had thought their talk disgusting her fingers caressed the bruising as his fingers had stroked the neck of the bird the voices were soft atmospheric metallic coming over the monitor i dont know whether she can take it not much more i have to assure you mr perry that your security is constantly under review if id known realized what i said to you and that jerk who came with you what it meant geoff what it would do to me and more important what it would do to her there are now two more arvs sorry thats armedresponse vehicles in the village four in total and eight highly trained men thats in addition to mr davies and mr blake and the men in the shed you should see it mr perry as a ring of steel dedicated to you and your familys safety in the hut the speaker was turned down low paget was eating sandwiches rankin watched the screen and flicked between the image of the rear garden and the front door while they listened to the two men talk youve bloody changed your tune why there are questions i cannot answer thats convenient you have to believe mr perry that everything that should be done is being done look take last night a professional and expert defence are you serious it was fucking chaos after the han dover and the debrief joe paget and dave rankin had been up into the small hours going through in exact and minute detail every moment of the alert had the camera given them a target why was the next garden not covered by the beams why had they not moved the cold frame from the side of the house they had been close to bloody disaster rankin had said maybe a few seconds off it and paget hadnt disagreed thats not the way mr davies reported it what the hell do you expect him to say grow up get real she cant take the punishment not much longer weve made our commitment mr perry when i told you and that jerk we were staying it was because i believed we were among friends thats the worst dont you read newspapers its how people behave when theyre afraid each week its in your newspapers a family have a child recovered from meningitis and theyre about to fly back from a sunshine holiday but the other passengers wont travel with them for fear of infection theyre bumped off the flight no charity how many examples do you want it doesnt matter where you are an american navy ship shoots down an iranian passenger aircraft and its a mistake but the iranians dont accept apologies and bomb the car driven by the captains wife on some smart street in san diego the detonator was incorrectly wired she lives but shes chucked out of her job shes a pariah and might endanger others i can reel them off its a herd mentality the fear makes them vicious dictates they turn on the victim its human nature mr perry there was the squeak of the planks at the door of the hut rankin swung paget gulped on the last of his sandwich meryl perry was in the doorway on the speaker was markhams metallic voice i suppose its because so few people these days ever get really tested that theyre so scared of the unpredictable her tone was dead flat like her eyes and the pallor of her cheeks i hope im not disturbing you i came for stephens tractor paget remembered her screams over the detectives radio and rankin had heard them as he had tried to get round the house and fouled up in the cold frame paget scrambled to kill the speaker rankin groped under his chair and found the boys tractor do you always listen to us is everything we say frank and i listened to chapter thirteen at that moment meryl hated them do you hear everything what i say to frank what he says to me are you listening is that how you spend your days she could hear the rising pitch of her own voice paget wiped old crumbs from his mouth and looked away from her rankin passed her stephens tractor she snatched it to her they were huge dark shapes in the baggy boiler suits with the big vests over their chests they were older than her older than frank and they seemed not to care standing at the door before theyd known she was there shed seen one of them grin at the smooth reassurance being dished out to frank you get a big laugh out of what we say do you snigger when you hear us in bed not much noise when were in bed is there her control was gone meryl was over the edge they would think her hysterical stupid or just a woman they would wonder why she didnt just shut up start the ironing do the dusting make the beds she squeezed the tractor in her hand tighter hurting herself nobody told her anything the wheels fell off the tractor when any of them talked to frank and she came close they stopped and frank cut short what theyd said she was not included not needtoknow just a woman who was a nuisance how long are you here for ever is that my life for ever having you listening the short one paget said quietly were here mrs perry till wednesday night thats the end of our shift the tall one rankin said gently thursday mornings a lieu day mrs perry then we start our long weekend actually mrs perry well have clocked up twentyeight hours overtime in the week so they wont mess with our long weekend then were on the range for a day not an assessment just practice after that we might come back and we might not were always the last to be told where were going rankin took the tractor from her then crouched to pick up the wheels the tears were filling her eyes she thought they were indifferent as to whether they came back to this hut this house her life or were assigned to another location rankin had the tractor wheels back under the toys body and paget passed him a small pair of pliers she was just a makeweight woman who had lost control she turned and leaned against the wall of the hut her eyes closed to pinch out the tears when she opened her eyes the picture was in front of her three or four inches from her face it was hazy a greywhite image of the bottom fence of her garden the apple tree and the sand pit frank had built for stephen the shape of the man they sought stood out and the silhouette of the rifle her voice was brittle fractured whatll you do when you drive away from us for your long weekend we were thinking of going fishing mrs perry off the south coast you get a good rate on a boat this time of year mrs perry paget smiled rankin gave her back the repaired tractor she smeared the tears off her face will you stand in front of us before you go fishing in front of frank and stephen and me rankin said i wont lie to you mrs perry were not bulletcatchers i dont expect to get killed on the sayso of a fatcat bureaucrat sitting in a safe london office if the opposition him he gestured harshly towards the picture sellotaped to the wall if he wants to die for his country then ill willingly help him along but i dont aim to go with him if he wants to end up a martyr famous for five minutes thats his choice im here to do the best thats possible and joe is and thats as far as it goes if you dont like it then you should get your suitcase down off the top of the wardrobe thats the truth mrs perry and im sorry no one told it you before thank you she turned for the door the cloud had covered the sun and her home what was precious to her seemed both drearily mundane and terrifyingly dangerous she held the doorhandle for a moment to steady herself it was joe paget who called to her id like to say something mrs perry we didnt do well last night but we learn it wont be like that again well kill him if he comes back and thats not just talk he paused you should get back in the house and make yourself a fine pot of tea i dont know him or anything about him but ill shoot him or dave will you can depend on that well kill him the husband stared belligerently at the sofa as cathy parker wrote briskly in her notebook his wife spoke i wouldnt know anything about her except that when my aunt died i had the job of sorting through her papers my uncle had passed on three years earlier it was a sort of surprise to find any reference to my cousin but shed written two or three times a year to her mother my aunt i say it was a surprise because my uncle never spoke of edith it was like she didnt exist my uncle was an engineer with the angloiranian oil corporation based in abadan i think they lived pretty well servants a good villa all that he just couldnt accept that his nineteenyearold daughter should fall for and want to marry a local ali hossein was a medical student in his early twenties my uncle did all he could to break the relationship and couldnt and gave up on edith he didnt go to the wedding and forbade my aunt to go he just cut her off pretended there had never been a daughter an only child i dont think he ever knew that my aunt kept in touch with her she was a neat fussy woman on her lap were old letters and a small bundle of photographs held together by a frayed elastic band it was a traditional muslim wedding she must have felt very alone with just alis relations and friends her letters over the years were sent to a post office near where my uncle and aunt lived in their retirement up north and my aunt collected them it was a sad little bit of subterfuge but necessary because my uncles hostility never lessened not till the day he died the letters stopped coming in and my aunt in the following months badgered the foreign office to find out why she made up excuses to be away for a whole day and went to london and nagged the diplomats for information eventually they told her that edith had been killed in a rocket attack in tehran and she never told my uncle but its their son ediths and alis boy that you want to know about cathy parker was quiet it was the photographs she had come for but it was her way never to appear eager she let her informant talk he was called vahid i think edith had a sense of guilt about the way she and ali brought him up ali was involved in dangerous politics he was even arrested and beaten by the secret police and edith supported him to the hilt the child vahid was left to himself and it wasnt a surprise that he became a tear away a street hooligan he was involved in demonstrations in fighting with the police myself id have been horrified but edith wrote of her pride in the boys determination after the revolution when that awful man you know the ayatollah came back and there were all the executions public hangings and shootings the boy went into the military and was sent away to the war with iraq he was at the front line when edith and her husband were killed by the rocket behind their heads cathy parker could see an ordered welltended small garden their bungalow was on the outskirts of a small village west of chard in somerset she thought how difficult it would have been for this elderly woman reading the letters to understand the world of revolutionary iran but she made no show of sympathy i wrote to him after id gone through the letters to tell him there were blood relations alive in england but the only address i knew of was the house where his parents had been killed it was pretty silly the house would have been destroyed by the rocket and i never had a reply so why have you come from london and why is the security service interested in ediths boy youre not going to tell me are you hes a nicelooking lad well he was a nice looking lad in the last photograph but that was taken a long time ago hed be thirtyseven now would you like to see the photographs the bundle was passed to cathy parker she flipped through them feigning indifference they were what a daughter would have sent to her mother it was the usual progression a baby a toddler a child in school clothes at a picnic and kicking a football a teenager only the last two pictures interested her a young man holding a kalashnikov rifle and posing with others in illfitting fatigues at a roadblock and the mature man hed become sitting hunched and deadeyed in the front of a small boat with water and reedbanks behind she didnt ask just put the last two photographs into her handbag a goodlooking boy yes cathy made her excuses she had seen the dead aged and cold eyes of young men in ireland and seen the misery they could inflict she thanked vahid hosseins aunt for the photographs that might help to kill him andy chalmers was driven to fort william in mr gabriel fentons range rover he sat truculent and quiet in the front seat with the dogs behind him the light was going down to the west of the big mountains and the sea loch as they approached the station dont take any shit from them andy ive said it before and ill say it again do it your way and the way you know theyll be superior and

ears then ill have them mounted and hung in the hallway thats a joke you understand a joke he trailed from the range rover behind his estate owner into the station and he jerked his dogs to heel it would be the first time in andy chalmerss life that he had left the mountains that were his home mr gabriel fenton collected the firstclass ticket return and the sleeper reservation pointed through the doorway to the waiting train cuffed him cheerfully on the arm and left him chalmers walked towards the platform and heaved the dogs after him ignoring the scowl of the attendant and the amusement of other passengers before picking up his dogs and climbing on board please mr fenton you have to listen to me ive just come from that house believe me its horrendous in there weve created a monster and im not overstating the case here there was a secure line in the newly created crisis centre at the police station in the town of halesworth twelve miles inland from the village down the line fenton told geoff markham he was suffering an attack of melodrama should pull himself together youre not here if you were here then youd understand let me tell you its dark theres hardly a light on theyre bouncing round off their furniture shes the problem sometimes its hysterical weeping sometimes its just sitting withdrawn shes traumatized hell follow her he thinks hes going to lose her hes got the guilt bad keeps saying its all his fault itll be worse in the morning because the kid doesnt have a school to go to theyre near to quitting were crucifying this family and hes close to demanding a safehouse a new identity fenton told geoff markham that his job down there was to keep frank perry in place that may seem reasonable enough in london mr fenton but viewed from where ive been today it seems poorly informed rubbish i am trying to stay calm of course i am what do you suggest i do do i tell him what use was made in iran of the information he provided how much blood there is on his hands do i tell him about a tethered goat thatll really get to him mr fenton too right im not losing it mr fenton i merely try to explain the situation confronting me fenton told markham that policy dictated frank perry should stay there what do i do lock him in the bloody broom cupboard fenton told him to get perrys friends in and get the bottles out if you only listened to me mr fenton the friends have all quit the ship theyre jumping off the decks all right most of their friends im planning to meet the vicar in the morning seemed a decent man i thought if the village saw the vicar with him that might spark some conscience fenton told him to take the perrys out for the evening splash out on a smart meal no expense spared to sweettalk them and relax them ill do that mr fenton ill book a table for tonight for them and a busload of police should be a really jolly evening im sorry to have troubled you at home maybe we can find a restaurant that serves boiled goat donna should have stayed the extra year at school at eighteen she was already as much on the shelf as the tins of beans sweet corn and quickcook curries that she stacked at the supermarket in the town she was trapped and she knew it she wrote in a childs laborious hand for jobs in hair salons and with beauticians but most of her letters were ignored and a few were rejected in three lines she was unskilled and unqualified in the village only meryl perry had time for her and gave her the old magazines with which she could dream of smart salons and bright beauty shops where rich women would come to her for advice gossip about their private lives and offer her respect only the perrys cared enough to fuel the dream and she broke the boredom of home and her parents for ever sitting in front of the blaring television with little pockets of relief when she stayed with stephen while frank and meryl were out for an evening they picked her up they dropped her back they gave her a small sense of importance he came in through the door murmured his request to davies took a big breath and strode into the kitchen markham said brightly i think we need an evening out frank its time for a splash on my masters expenses to cheer ourselves up sausages were frying on the stove the packet of instant mashed potato was ready at the side perry looked at him astonished were going out enough of being shut up in here were going out to drink a restaurant dry to murder their menu no argument no hesitation and im picking up the tab perry asked hesitant where are we going at this time on a sunday night wholl have us we leave that to bill hes the expert spends half his time getting his principals into restaurants that say theyre full he tried to laugh meryl asked flatvoiced whos going to look after stephen he turned and saw her blank reddened eyes im sure youve a regular babysitter lets get a call to her well collect dont you worry about the detail mrs perry just get yourself ready and let us take the strain perry said im not sure yes you are mr perry its whats going to happen meryl said i dont know that i want to go out yes you do mrs perry its whats best he manipulated them they danced for him he had boasted to the man and woman at the bank that he was prepared to use people in the interests of policy and here he was doing it meryl perry was lifting the frying pan off the cooker and muttering that the sausages would do for tomorrow and that shed already fed stephen perry was at the telephone and scanning the list above it for donnas number bill davies leaned through the doorway and said the local police had given him the name of a place but it was twentytwo miles away and theyd have to shift themselves hed called the restaurant and hed organized people to check it out markham thought she looked so cudgelled so damned helpless he asked her gently if she wanted to change and wished that harry bloody fenton were here to see her meryl went out and he heard her deadened step up the stairs do you have a girl frank to come in thick as two planks but decent and loyal meryls been great to her and shes fond of stephen perry lifted the phone and dialled two cars were pulling up outside blake coming to take over inside the house and the change of shift for the hut markham drew a sigh of relief at least he had achieved something his mind flipped back to london the letter would be at his flat in the morning with the terms of employment he would ring vicky later if they survived the meal and ask her to go round and collect it to read it to him once hed resigned they would boot him out of thames house so fast his feet wouldnt touch the ground how would it be a year later ten years later when he walked down the embankment and went past the bulletproof windows and the concrete bollards would he feel fulfilled streaming with the commuter hordes into the city he had played god before with agents lives and was playing god now he wondered how it would be playing god with savers investment accounts and pension holdings if he hadnt met vicky he would know sweet nothing about investments and pensions he heard the anger in frank perrys voice what do you mean youre not coming is it you cant come or wont its nothing to do with your father nothing to do with anyone but yourself listen here weve been damn good to you were about the only bloody people in this place who have been i thought better of you perrys hand trembled as he tried to return the telephone to the wallfitting then he took a pen and scratched out donnas name and number from the list on the wall over his shoulder markham could see the list donna was inked out along with most of the others there were pitifully few names and numbers left unscathed at the kitchen door bill davies took the radio away from his face dave paget and joe rankin will stay on theyve had kids themselves god help the poor blighters they can do childminding meryl came down the stairs if her eyes hadnt been red and puffed markham thought she would have looked marvelous the poor damn woman had made the effort he noticed bill davies take her hand and murmur something in her ear but he didnt catch what was said when theyd gathered in the hall the detective told paget and rankin that there were sausages and mashed potato on the stove for their supper the two men in their boiler suits and vests with their pistols hanging from their waists thanked him balefully blake came through the front door carrying five fire extinguishers he dumped them down noisily then went to the car again retrieved a heavyweight blanket from the boot with a box of gas grenades and staggered back into the house markham thought it predictable that there should be more fire extinguishers inside one for each room the additional bullet and shrapnelproof blanket was for draping over a chair to make a wider protective barrier the gas grenades were standard but he wished that meryl perry hadnt seen them she asked where donna was and was told she wasnt given time to think about it she was made to run to the open car door her heels clattering down the path there was an escort vehicle in front and another behind their front windows were down and markham could see the machineguns well done harry fenton another great idea as he helped to hustle her through the gate and pitch her into the car he thought it was all already unravelling bill davies came after him and seemed to be shielding perry markham drove beside him the detective sat awkwardly because hed twisted his body so that his hand could rest free on the pistol in his waist holster off for a night out with friends well done harry bloody fenton the helicopter had been over at last light and vabid hossein had gone into the water at the first sound of its approach long after it had disappeared he had returned to the marsh shore he lay in the darkness in the depth of the cover the policemen who watched the marsh from the village side on the higher ground of hoist covert and east sheep walk had been replaced by fresh men and he had noted their positions the harrier was close to him but he could not see it could only hear its movements as it scratched in the ground for the last scraps of meat the girl had come to the rendezvous point in the late afternoon bringing food and ointments for the bruising she had been withdrawn subdued when he had told her what she should do the next day she hadnt argued he was curled up on his side in the bramble thicket to keep the weight of his body off the bruising the skin was bared at his waist and hip and he could feel the soothing cool of the ointments hed thought she wanted to smooth on the ointments herself and hed refused her he could not allow himself to be dependent on a woman he heard the sounds of the bird and tried to shut from his memory the softness of her fingers seeking instead to recall the sight and touch and feel of barzin who was alone in their bed in the house at jamaran each time he summoned the image of her and the touch of her hands the image dissolved and was replaced always it was her fingers the girls he called to the bird the bird was his truest friend and would not corrupt him it did not challenge him was his equal his love of it did not make him weak when it was finished and he was home he would never talk to barzin about the bird she would not understand he was alone he was in darkness he was sodden wet from immersing himself in the water sucking his air through the reed tube he had fashioned when the helicopter had circled overhead he spoke soft gentle words to the bird hushed so as not to frighten it told it what he was planning to do vahid hossein shifted slightly so that he could reach out with his hand beyond the tangle of thorns the bird pecked at it as if he might have held a last piece of rabbit flesh a lack of patience had caused him to make mistakes trying to break into the house without sufficient preparation taking the assault rifle he criticized the bird for its laziness it should hunt it was strong enough now he should have taken the rocket launcher it would be the rpg next time he told the bird his fingers found the neck and crown of the birds head and smoothed the silky feathers he hoped it would hunt in the dawn light and that he would see its power and beauty as it dived to kill he trusted the bird as his friend they sat at a corner table frank perry was drunk what did i do the restaurant had cleared and he had taken on a drunks aggression will some bugger tell me what i did the principal was in the angle of the corner his wife was to the right of him and the detective to the left with a clear view to the door markham had his back to the room the evening was a disaster he thought of titanic proportions perry snatched at the bottle and poured again ive the bloody right to know what i did one of the cars was out at the front with its driver but its passenger sat with his gun across his knees close to the glass door the other car was at the rear of the carpark covering the outer entrance to the kitchens a policeman was sitting by the swing doors through which the waiters had brought the french food the customers who had been there when the late party had stampeded in seven of them at three tables had stuffed themselves gulped their drinks paid up and were long gone perry swilled the wine the most expensive on the list drops dribbled from his mouth and ran on his jaw why cant i be told what i did why wont any bastard tell me meryl hadnt spoken a word through the meal twice after wiping her lips with the napkin she had dabbed her eyes the detectives contribution had been to ask for various condiments to be passed him the waiters had brought the coffee and retreated to the kitchen frank perry belted his hand on the table right no one tells me then were off we get the hell out and thats that end of story the principal was trying to push back his chair but he was wedged in the corner then he tried to shove the table forward driving it into markhams stomach bill davies was snapping his fingers at the policemen by the main door and the kitchen swing doors and they were adjusting the straps that held their machineguns and mouthing into their microphones geoff markham thought how it would be on the telephone that night to harry fenton hed failed the principal was running the failure would be the marque to end his career at thames house however many years he lived decades he would be dogged by that failure he took out his wallet and extracted a credit card the owner came hurrying god hed be glad to see the back of them and took it he straightened his tie then rammed the table away from him trapped the man you want to know ive the bloody right to know the bill was waved under his nose it must have been prepared and ready without checking it he scrawled his signature on the docket and took back the card he waved the owner away gestured for him to retreat and give them space what did i do there was at thames house and it would be the same at the bank a culture against honesty no advancement ever came from telling it as it was he was hemmed in at work and it would be the same in the future by men and women who weighed their words for fear of giving offence it had been the same at home and the same at university he had drunk nothing but carbonated water he was utterly sober for the first time in his life geoff markham thought the moment had come for sheer honesty the whole truth he spoke quietly you were a secondrate salesman you were a grubby little creature on the make you were into illegality fraudulently writing out false export declarations for customs and excise you were greedy so avaricious for the commissions you were getting that the chasing of the money became more important to you than that your wife was screwing on the side and your marriage was gone perry swung a wayward fist at him and missed the target markhams chin but hit the bottles neck and toppled it you were on a fast ride and going nowhere but the greed held you and you wouldnt back off to hell with the wife opening her legs the money kept rolling in and then one day comes the morning after the dawn hangover and theres a call from a lady and most persuasively shes asking for a meeting you thought you were in control until you sat down with penny flowers do you remember her frank i hope you do because where you are now is down to her you dangled from her little finger in the background romantic piano music played serenely the wine stained a path across the tablecloth from the toppled bottle she was asking you for a little bit of help and if you didnt care to do so she was offering you a big bit of a prison sentence like seven years and of course you chose to help when you walked away from that first meeting with penny flowers youd have thought you could handle it without breaking sweat and you were wrong shes a tough bitch but you know that now you dont get clear of penny flowerss claws it starts easily enough always does its the classic way mr perry of agent handling did she tell you that she liked you that you were really important she would have regarded you as cheap dross because thats the way all controllers regard all agents the wine stain reached the edge of the table and the first drip fell into meryls lap at first it would have been sketchmaps of the plant then character profiles of the prime personalities after that its documents later its photographs with a supplied camera cheap dross you may be but not an idiot you understand now that youre into espionage and you know the penalty in iran for espionage the sweats started the sweat becomes colder each time you fly there and youre looking over your shoulder because it only takes one mistake to alert the security there each night in your hotel room youd have wondered whether youd made that mistake but you couldnt shake clear of penny flowers and there was always one more trip back always one more question she wanted answered frank perry stared into geoff markhams face and in his eyes was the fear as if he lived it again you told penny flowers just happened to mention it that theyd changed the schedule for your next meeting brought it forward a week shed not have looked that interested its a handlers skill never to seem interested in what an agent says but shed have probed deeper done it in easy conversation if youd understood the way a handler works the few extra questions and always the studied indifference then the alarm bells would have rung just before you flew to iran that last time you would have known it was the danger time a debriefing the night before you travelled not just penny flowers but hardfaced bastards telling you what was wanted it was about a party yes a celebration dinner for heads of section frank perry grim sobering nodded you would have gone back the last time to all those people who welcomed you i doubt you slept on any of those nights because youd have been going over every question youd asked where was the party who was going when was the bus leaving and wondering if the mistake had been made they were the heads of section for the chemicalwarfare programme and the designers of the warhead they were the big people in the big picture and you were just a bloody ant by comparison your only importance was that you had access theyd have hanged you not so that your neck broke but so that you strangled and kicked the air i couldnt have done it myself mr perry i wouldnt have had the courage i would have crumpled with the fear i sincerely admire what you did i dont mean to embarrass you but i havent ever met anyone of such raw bravery do you still want to know frank perry mouthed his answer softly that markham couldnt hear it the jews do the dirty work for us they understand about survival better than we do they wont again go naked into the sheds and have cyanide crystals drop on them they are in modern jargon proactive the israelis wouldnt have needed much persuasion because those warheads could fall on them a squad was put on shore after being ferried across the gulf they landed up the coast from bandar abbas they intercepted the bus on its way to the restaurant a piece of charity fell off penny flowerss desk probably the only time it has what happened to the bus was an accident you understand me it created confusion and bought you time to build a new life before the iranians realized the enormity of the crime and at whose door it lay the music played on markham felt so sorry for the man the bus was stopped then burned it was made to look before a detailed examination produced the truth like an accident there were no survivors the director the engineers the scientists all died in the fire frank perry jerked the weight of his body up his lips gibbering but he could not speak you wanted to know it is why the iranians will hunt you track you try to kill you and all those with you therell be files on you that are stacked high enough to eat lunch off they will never forget you what you did was buy time id like to say that the time was well used that the programme was seriously delayed i cant i dont know i dont know whether the time you bought with your courage frank was well used or was frittered but i recognize your bravery because it humbles me meryl was crying quietly markham pulled back the table and let perry stagger to his feet the rain had started outside and the street glistened he took perrys arm gently and steadied him through the door and across the pavement davies held meryl close to him her dress from the spilled wine was stained red like a wound markham thought it was what perry was owed and he was glad hed done it he climbed the stairs slowly it had been a distressing evening for simon blackmore two months earlier a surveyor had checked rose cottage and described the damp as minimal late that evening without an appointment a man who described himself as a builder and decorator had prised his way into the cottage he called himself vince and explained that he always dropped by on new people moving into the village hed walked around and pointed out at least half a dozen places where the wallpaper peeled and the plaster work was stained tut ting and frowning at the cost and his schedule but the work needed doing must be done hed spoken of mrs wilsons rheumatism and laid the blame for it on the damp hed settled immovably at the kitchen table with a mug of coffee they were both so tired exhausted from the unpacking of boxes but they had listened with courtesy as hed talked of the village his lifetime home and his central place in it and hed told them as if it were a kindness to them that they should keep away from the green at the far end of the village because there were armed police there guarding a family that no one in their right mind wanted to know but theyve got the message theres no onell speak to them theyll be bloody frozen out of here it had been an age before hed finished his coffee insisted that he would send in an estimate for necessary work and left simon went up the stairs and into their bedroom where luisa was undressing they hadnt yet unpacked the shades for the ceiling bulbs the garish harsh light fell on his wife and highlighted the old burn marks on her breasts and stomach before the nightdress covered them the train hammered on the track jerking and rolling andy chalmers lay on his side on the bunk bed on the clean white sheets and the blankets he had not undressed his dogs alert were curled against his body and gave him warmth behind him distanced were the birds and their eyries on the crag cliffs and the bog heather uplands where the deer grazed and the mount am lochans that held the small brown trout and the glens that were home to the plovers and wheat ears and curlews ahead lay an unfamiliar terrain andy chalmers came south to track a man chapter fourteen he was into thames house early had limped from a photodevelopment kiosk to the building shown his temporary accreditation at reception and hobbled into the thirdfloor work area his feet were blistered from a long days walking the deep bath and the salts in it hadnt lessened the pain duane littelbaum had walked the previous day right round the tower of london the jewel tower the white tower traitors arch the grasscentred square where the states enemies had been beheaded and all the places of death and imprisonment once hed giggled attracted attention because hed wondered why his saudi friends hadnt bought the whole damned place lock stone and axe and transferred it to riyadh he had gone round on a tour led by a costumed guide then gone round again on his own and taken a whole roll of film from the tower of london he had walked to st pauls cathedral then hiked through the sunday empty streets towards the palace and parliament when he was half dead and on the third film for esther he had weakened and taken a taxi back to the embassys service flat and the bath a probationer told him that his office in saudi arabia had called that he should ring back the young man fixed the secure link for him because duane littelbaum was adept at demonstrating technological incompetence when the situation necessitated he listened to the distant tinny concerned voice maryellen bur bled at him asking about his domestic arrangements and he wondered whether she was missing him its been hellish hot here duane plus fahrenheit and the cooling system in heres zapped again its awful one of the visasection guys went out in the parking lot saturday and cracked an egg on the paving to see if he could fry it he couldnt the egg dehydrated seriously he saw cathy parker come in she had a bounce in her walk she stopped in front of markhams door and scribbled through the writing on the paper stuck to the door she wrote boldly day five what i thought you should know duane we had a briefing at short notice from the agency people there was a proper fracas about me being admitted in place of you was i cleared for a briefing from the central intelligence goddamn agency ambassador heads of section and me they are such seriously pompous people anyway she sat beside him and laid a closed envelope on the table you still there duane look the guy said that the saudi intelligence people admitted to him that the outsider hired guns you know what i mean came in during the last ha with all the pilgrims and are still in place inside the magic kingdom also the armys come clean and said that four believe me four mm mortars have been stolen from one of their bases up north how can you defend against that sort of scenario a dump truck pulls up on the median just outside of a major enclave of ours the tarp is pulled back the rounds fly and the agency say they could have chemicals in them and the agency have gotten the name of your pal duane a is for anvil away now but coming back the commercial attache you know that lanky idiot had to be told why one man was so important why theyd wait for one mans return before launching he seemed to think that quality men like anvil came off a production line as if they were general motors products he was put right when anvil comes back its time to go into the shelters thats what the agency people are saying theres real fear here those mortars and the name of anvil it sort of kind of makes you cold beside him cathy parker pulled two photographs out of the envelope he saw a young man holding a kalashnikov rifle at a roadblock of revolutionary guards and the picture was lifted away the second photograph showed an older man in combat fatigues with his back to the water and te reedbanks she reached again into the envelope i came away from that briefing and i tell you i was quite spooked well thats it ill meet you wednesday night off the flight oh sorry hows it going nowhere ill cook you supper wednesday night would you have done better to stay here theres someone at the door bye he replaced the receiver a slow smile was spreading across cathy parkers face she took a blownup picture from the envelope he recognized immediately the work of computer enhancement the ageing process a fattening at the face a thickening at the neck more lines at the eyes shorter hair with bleached greying thinner lips she took a pen from the table and wrote in big capital characters the place of birth tehran the date of birth the name only the goddamn name vahid hossein he gazed at it then at her and into the brightness of her eyes he kissed her on the mouth kissed her hard what they would have noticed everyone else in the work area cathy parker kissed him back lip to lip fenton was gathering up his coat saying he had a train to meet but he paused long enough to lead the applause and to call for a copy post haste to be sent to geoff markham duane littelbaum stared down at the face at a stranger who had become familiar and could still feel the taste of cathy parkers wicked groping tongue why isnt he coming sam carstairs howled his mother distracted and trying to put on her makeup for the day in the solicitors offices told him not to worry his head with such things hes my best friend why isnt he coming to school the child bellowed his father trying angrily to put the papers together that hed been working on the previous evening told him it was none of his business if he isnt ill why isnt he coming to school in a tantrum little sam started to rip pages from the book theyd bought him only the week before and stamped on them if emma hadnt caught his arm barry would have hit his son the row had gone on since the child had woken and sensed the tension it was convenient for neither of them to take sam into halesworth for school emma the legal executive was in court that day with the senior partner and barry had the annual sales conference it was the sort of day when they could have relied upon meryl perrys help she was always prepared with a smile to alter the schedule of the shared schoolrun sam and stephen had always been close friends good for each other barry grabbed the child by the collar of his school coat and frog marched him to the car emma had said her job was as important as his because of the row shed be late meeting her senior partner and hed be bloody late at the conference he put sam into the back of his audi then ran back to the house because hed forgotten damn it his briefcase emma was throwing on her coat in the hall weve done the right thing havent we what on earth do you mean with frank and meryl until that moment through all the weekend neither had spoken of it as if it were forbidden territory they must be so isolated without friends their fault not mine you dont think that we should make a gesture what did she call me a secondrate rat what sort of gesture do i make in response to that i suppose youre right she touched her hair in front of the mirror of course im right please tell sam in the car why theyre not our friends any longer he doesnt understand hasnt a clue why hes lost his best friend please do it barry you wait a week after theyve gone well have forgotten they were ever here he set the alarm she locked the house and they ran for their cars to live their busy lives ten minutes earlier geoff markham had gone out into the parking area behind the towns police station the arrival time had been given them in the crisis centre and others had drifted after him to stand in the light rain and wait aside from markham glancing at their wristwatches were a uniformed superintendent and the inspector from the branch detectives and the people who manned the radios and the computers away in the corner of the arpark were the military from special forces denied involvement but permitted standby status they were all out in the rain to see the arrival of the scottish tracker the local uniforms would have thought they were best equipped to search their own area had the feel for it thdetectives from london and the branch would have thought they bad the trained surveillance specialists had the necessary expertise the military would have thought they owned the territory of stalk and track had the right to crack the problem they were all interested to see the man dragged out from the north by five the man given the job that should have been theirs geoff markham felt an atmosphere around him of acid curiosity edging on malevolence the car big black and sleek driven by a chauffeur swept into the parking area and braked hard all eyes were on it harry fenton pushed himself out of the front passenger seat mischief in his eyes he called a cheerful greeting to the watchers it was his show and that mattered to him he caught markhams glance and there was the slightest faintest wink of his eye then he opened the rear door the dogs came first they were squat scurrying creatures held by leashes of fodderbale twine bright orange they yapped he came after them wriggled clear of the car what markham had expected was an old man ruddy and weatherskinned a man with the lore of the countryside in his face and a lifetime of experience in his eyes he was small he looked barely out of his teens his visage was pale and his cheeks and chin were speckled with light stubble his build was slight looked as if the wind could blow him away more than that he was filthy the gathered audience gazed at him with astonishment at ten paces markham could smell the dank dirtiness of his clothes he wore boots khaki trousers and a tweed coat all liberally smeared with mud markham thought the coat was a bigger mans castoff its buttons were gone and it was held tight at the narrow waist by the same twine the man stood beside fenton and glowered at them a titter of laughter rippled behind markham an old man markham thought would have merely ruffled feathers but this pallid grimy stinking youth disjointed noses the dogs heaving at their leashes coughing had seen a police alsatian god and the little verminous bastards would probably try to roger it if they were free but the young man grunted at them almost inaudibly and they sat at his boots their teeth bared he didnt back off from the laughter but stared back at them they were geoff markham thought the most frightening eyes he had ever seen from the back seat of the car the chauffeur was lifting out sheets of newspaper and shaking the mud off them fenton strode to markham he said in a loud voice as if to be certain he was generally heard what a stink had the window open all the way down i thought i was going to throw up like being shut in a cellar with a wellhung duck id like you to meet andy chalmers geoff its your job to see he goes where he wants to go has what he wants i see that his appearance creates amusement i want to see that amusement wiped off their faces and shoved far up their backsides got me youll brook no obstruction from any bastard in a clean shirt or ill break his bloody neck and yours ive lunch to be getting back to keep to the windward of him good luck and good hunting fenton was gone without a backward glance the car swept out of the parking area the theatre over the uniforms the detectives and the military trooped back into the police station geoff markham thought that if the young man failed it would be fentons neck for breaking as the car disappeared down the road he realized that no bag had been dumped with the tracker and his dogs damn your bags still in the car dont have a bag clean clothes and so on dont have a bag markham laughed out loud who needed clean socks who wanted fresh underwear who had to wash do you like something to eat no do you want anything no what would you like to do get there there had once been ambition in mr hacketts ministry but that was long gone he existed now in this coastal parish believing his congregation and his community were beneath his talents on a diet of godless weddings hurried funerals and a continuingnxiety about the maintenance of the fabric of his church his welcomin smile his proffered friendship were shams he was lonely he was better his wife lived away and the fiction that explained her absence involved her need to care for an elderly bedridden mother but she had left him he lived out his life in the village kept trouble from his door and the bishop off his back and waited for retirement blessed release the ambition of the reverend alastair hackett then an innercity curate on a fastpromotion track had ended twentyseven years earlier in the north welsh mountains when he had taken a party of deprived children with volunteer helpers from their manchester tower blocks for a camping holiday it was the sort of expedition blessed by bishops the sort of trip that was good for advancement and an elevenyearold boy had died in a fall such a long time ago but there was no forgiveness in the file that passed from bishop to bishop each time he had applied for subsequent promotion the file held the muted criticism unspecified but hinted at of the police evidence at the subsequent inquest why had the child been alone why had the child not been better supervised his career had never recovered and the bitterness lingered still its target was sometimes the bishops who did not seem to understand the problems of watching over eighteen hooligan youngsters but most particularly the police that bitterness verged on detestation when he should have been explaining the circumstances of the accident to his bishop and comforting the bereaved parents he had been incarcerated in a bare interview room in the police station at conway treated like a felon quizzed relentlessly by men seeming determined to find inconsistencies in his account the career gone ambition fallen he had moved from manchester to middevon then taken this suffolk parish it was a blighted life no fault of his own and empty they were in the village if geoff markham spoke he won a grudging response if he didnt speak there was silence did he want to go up the church tower use it as an observation point a grunt a shaken head did he want to take a look at the house again a similar response while he had driven chalmers had spread across his knees the map on which a redink line marked the trail the police dogs had found and the riverbank where they had lost it by chalmerss boots the dogs chewed noisily at the cars floor mat markham was pretty damn certain that one maybe both had peed during the journey the smell reeked through the car he stopped near to the hall down the road from the green chalmerss brow was furrowed in concentration as he studied the detail of the map a young woman with a guidebook was sitting on a bench her back to them an older woman was coming out of the shop with a wheeled shopping bag he ignored the slow life of the village around him and busied himself with putting new batteries into the second radio then checked the transmission between the two shit the stress snatched at markham hadnt rung vicky and he didnt know the terms of employment offered him hadnt spoken to bill davies didnt know whether they were still on their feet or down on the floor hadnt remembered the picture chalmers eased out of the car took a little of the smell with him but not enough the mat was chewed and puddled and he seemed not to notice markham took the picture out of his briefcase locked the door after him sorry about that sorry i didnt give it you earlier you should have had it before he didnt know why he should be frightened into abject apologies to this stinking kid he passed over the picture it was the first time he had seen anything other than hostility in chalmerss eyes he had once been to a boxing match when he was at college for a middleweight title he remembered the first sight of the men when they had come into the ring with the hype blaring over the loudspeakers and it was supposed to be a grudge match there had been no hate in their eyes only respect and the fight had started each had done his bloody damnedest to batter the other to the canvas the bout had been brutal and merciless and hed hated it he took back the picture and they walked away following the maps trail chalmers unpicked a piece of cotton thread from a strand of barbedwire topping a garden fence and said that the man wore a camouflage tunic where the path narrowed chalmers stopped hunched down and studied the ground beside the paths mud half hidden by squashed nettles a boot print was just visible chalmers said the man was size eleven and added casually that he was hurt handicapped they were beside the river chalmers unhooked the twine from the dogs throats but cooed softly to them they stayed at his heel ahead were the marshes the grey cloud was low on the reedbeds the rain spat on their faces chalmers gestured to his right a contemptuous short motion of his arm and markham saw the movement of the policemen in bushes away on higher ground the marshes stretched ahead to the mistline and the far dull shape of the trees there was the slow thunder of the waves on shingle beyond the sea wall get lost chalmers growled whenll i see you some time when im ready go away geoff markham walked back down the path alongside the river he turned once looked round and the path behind him was empty bill davies flushed the downstairs lavatory and came back into the hall nothing for him to do but drink coffee and ruminate on the catastrophe of the evening before which hed been doing all morning perry had been looking like chilled death when davies had come in first thing to relieve blake and was now pacing the living room meryl was in the kitchen quiet and shed only been out the once to hang her washed dress on the line paget had been with her scanning the bottom fence all the time shed pegged it up and the rest of the clothes from the machine he heard a sudden clatter of sound from the kitchen and knew that with a numbed mind and clumsy fingers shed dropped a plate broken it he glanced out through the window through the new net curtains there was a spit of rain misting the glass but he saw the tall wiry mans clerical collar he moved aside the curtain for a better glance mr hacketts name hadnt been scratched off the list by the kitchen telephone it was reflex not thought through he spoke on his radio to the hut said hed be outside to the front of the house he went out into the light rain he ran across the green past the new tree and the new post towards the clergyman excuse me the man stopped in midstep turned the wind catching his greying hair excuse me are you mr hackett he is me a piping voice and a thin smile of greeting please have you a moment a moment for what im with frank and meryl perry the caution clouded his face which means youre a policeman which means youre an armed policeman why would you want a moment of my time why because frank perry was told last night of his responsibility in the death of a coach load of iranian military scientists because he had drunk two bottles of wine and been sick twice because he and meryl were at home alone and needed a friend i just thought if youd the time its rough for them a visit from a friend would help the clergyman took a step forward i have appointments people are expecting me bill davies caught his arm what they need please is for someone to show them some charity be so kind as to take your hand off me another time perhaps daviess hand was shaken off and the clergyman quickened his stride you are a leader in this community mr hackett i doubt it but i do have a filled appointments diary your example is important please go and ring the bell go and smile and make some smalltalk better still walk up this road with meryl perry with frank well protect you show everybody here that they have your support another day perhaps but i cannot promise they need you there are many who need me i dont know your name and i do not need to but we did not ask for your guns to be brought into our community we did not ask for our children and our women to be endangered we are not a part of whatever quarrel frank pejry is enmeshed in we owe him nothing he should go what he owes us is his departure from here i have a wider responsibility to the majority i do not condone the ostracism of this family but i cannot condemn it but we are a godfearing and lawabiding community and i doubt that observance of gods teaching and the rules of society have brought perry to his present situation in your search for a friend to perry i suggest that you look elsewhere thank you mr hackett for your christian kindness good day bill davies walked slowly back to the house the italian owner of the restaurant from naples eyed the manylayered stomach of the german and murmured with quiet discretion to fenton the full menu mr fenton not the twocourse luncheon special they were eased into their seats and immediately the german ordered decisively as if to feed himself for the rest of the week fentons guest was from the bfv attached to the embassy an old hand at counterterrorism and a friend of sorts as was his habit fenton set an agenda he was confused he admitted and in search of enlightenment the foreign office preached appeasement of iran the israelis demanded they be beaten with lump hammers the islamic movement claimed there was americaninspired unwarranted hostility towards the muslim world where lay the truth the german talked and ate drank and smoked so you have one of their excrement loose on your territory otherwise it would be sandwiches and perrier in your office you wish to know how seriously to take that threat my government as you well know because you have leaked your criticisms has taken a conciliatory attitude towards iran has rescheduled debts has given out visas has pushed for stronger trade links and has still provided the venue for iranian assassins to meet their targets it won us nothing so we have considerable experience of their tactics that is what i should talk about our experience of their murder tactics a heaped plate of antipasti was followed by a wide filled bowl of pasta with fungi the german left his cigarette burning the smoke made fentons eyes smart they aim to be near to kill at close quarters but the beginning the beginning is from the top in tehran from the peak of government and the authorization for the allocation of hardcurrency funding and the provision of weapons through diplomatic pouches a trusted man is appointed and he will be backed by local sympathizers but he takes the responsibility for success or failure he will have no contact point with his embassy there is the creed of deniability he will not be helped by diplomats or intelligence officers our experience is that the trusted man is most hard to capture or kill it is the sympathizers who reconnoitre and drive the cars who sit in our prison cells it is a great triumph to take or eliminate the trusted man if you can do that you will have my sincerest congratulations when the steak was brought the german took the majority of the vegetables the greater part of the potatoes and lit another cigarette what is he like the trusted man i tell you very frankly he is the same as the people in our rote armee faktion the same as the people in your irish groups the less you know of him the more impressive you will believe him to be our ignorance lifts his reputation he is dedicated fanatical he is skilled he is prepared for martyrdom he is elusive that is what ignorance tells us the german chose icecream with pistachio flavouring and asked the waiter to bring a double portion but i have seen them i have interrogated them i have been with them in the cells and explained with politeness that the rantings of their government and the shouting mobs outside our legation compound in tehran will not affect the length of a prison sentence i have talked with those men of the bundesgrenzshutz who have dragged them from cars at gunpoint spreadeagled them on the road laughed about shooting off their testicles the trusted man then is the same as you or me you know at fustenfeldbruck at the airbase at the time of the olympic games we killed five of the palestinians of black september and three surrendered did they then wish to die go to the garden of paradise did they hell they knelt and wept for mercy when the italians our esteemed friends eventually capture a capo of the mafia he is the same he has been a killer on a grand scale perhaps murdered a hundred men and consigned their corpses to the gulf of palermo or acid vats or concrete construction pillars but when he is arrested when he faces the guns he fouls his trousers they are very human invincible when free pathetic when taken you should not be intimidated by the trusted man espresso coffee was brought and small chocolates the germar cleared them and stubbed out a cigarette in the saucer perhaps when they leave their country when the mullahs words are still fresh they believe they are a sword of islam a soldier of the faith my experience they forget so soon they are like all the other killers they are i believe addicted to excitement adrenaline is their narcotic i said to you that they wished to be close to see the fear in their victims eyes so they will try to use a knife to cut a throat or a handgun from a metre they are disturbed people and they will not gain the same excitement from a bomb or from a rocket attack the bomb and the rocket are the last option but will not provide the same excitement if you take this trusted man go into his cell try to talk with him then i believe you will be sincerely disappointed at what you find when the wine was finished they drank brandy fenton had the cigar box brought for him he will be a lonely man he will seek the admiration of the sympathizers but will not share with them he will have the paranoia of the isolated he is nauseatingly sentimental above everything he will seek praise always he will want that praise i think also he wants the body of a servile woman not an equal because that would frighten him what is most dangerous about him he is terrorized by the thought of failure he wants to go home of course he does but to praise and adulation i think to a psychologist he is a rather tedious pitiful figure let me know what you find they left the table eased into their coats on the pavement the german caught fentons arm and whispered close in his ear through a fog of cigar fumes but hear me ali fellahian who controls the trusted men who sanctions their journeys was invited by my superiors to visit us for some of us it was a shameful day in the history of our service to play host to a criminal and our lips bled because we bit so hard on them to maintain our composure he took our hospitality and he threatened us we were left with no area for misunderstanding the economic and diplomatic consequences of publicizing the activities of his killers on our territory should you destroy or capture this piece of excrement now bothering you you should consider very carefully the implications of triumphalist statements a wonderful meal we should do it more often fenton took a taxi back to thames house cox was poring over a leave chart but pushed it away yes fenton told him lunch had provided a most valuable opportunity to quiz a distinguished german antiterrorist officer he had gained a good insight into the mind of their enemy but how much further forward were they fenton gazed at the ceiling and found no relief there what worries me whichever way we jump will be the wrong way i did hear you harry unless my ears deceived me take responsibility at the nearest point the bird was a hundred metres from his cover at the furthest it was two hundred metres it was a hunter and quartered the stretch of water and reedbed between the sight of it made him lose the ache in his hip through his care the bird could fly could hunt many times in the hauralhawizeh and off the faw peninsula he had watched these birds flying overhead when they flew hunted had no sense of danger he knew no enemy approached him the pain in his hip was lessening and he thought that by the next morning he would have regained his mobility and be strong enough to go back for his target the bird flew in long slow lines still handicapped but able enough glided the gold and brown of its neck bent to study the land below and it dived in a sudden moment the wide wings were tucked in and the bird fell when it came up flapping hard for height he saw the flailing legs of the prey held in a talons grip the bird the wild creature came back to him and set down on the grass in front of his cover he saw the last writhing movements of the frog as the curved beak hacked at it the bird ripped at the frogs carcass until only scraps were left in the life of farida yasmin no one had ever told her she was importaut with her guidebook to the village and the neighbourhood around it she had sat on the bench read it and reread it then read it again so that the words danced on the pages and no longer had meaning no one had ever told her she was valued from the bench she had walked to the beach and gazed out at the sea she had been alone on the sand and shingle and had seen the faraway boats that hugged the horizon line the next day or the day after the next night or the night after that far further down the coast the tanker would divert towards the shore and a small boat would run from it would collect him she would be left behind abandoned she had walked through the village as far as the church then turned and retraced her steps and come back past the pub the hall and the shop where she had bought postcards that would never be sent and a saladfilled bread roll and the green she had stood on the far side of the green the guidebook opened and looked around her she saw the cars come and go from the house she saw the detective at the door and the armed police huge men in their bulging vests she watched the pattern of their day earlier the detective had run from the house and had spoken with a priest she couldnt hear what was said but the body language was of rejection she noted the camera above the door at the house and believed as the afternoon darkened that she saw the red winklight of a sensor she wanted his body under her in the position she had seen on television films she wanted to ride over him dominate him and hear him cry out that she was important valued essential and critical as no one had ever done before he went off the beach into the small boat and out to sea to board the tanker she wanted the memory of it what would happen to her then afterwards no one had ever told her that she was loved not her father the bastard and not her mother the bitch not the kids at school or at college or at any time afterwards love was the black hole without a bottom without light in her life from the bench she saw the villagers coming on foot and by bicycle and in cars as the afternoon faded to the hall ordinary people and they didnt seem to notice her sitting on the bench with the opened guidebook ordinary people who ignored her she stood stretched wiped the rainwater off her forehead and shook it from her shoulders the lights of the pub were on the first cars were scraping the gravel and there was the first laughter she wondered how long it would be before the ordinary people gathering in the pub and the hall knew her name and her importance she went away from the house she thought shed seen his shadow pass the window and she determined that she would be there to witness it when the rocket was fired she drifted slowly up the road towards the side lane near the church where her car was parked ive said all i want to say about her and thats too much shes never coming back here again if she showed up at the door id slam it in her face too right i would cathy parker watched him she leaned against the kitchen door as bill jones stamped out into the narrow hall for his coat and his train drivers satchel he was a big man two stones overweight and she thought it was the blood pressure that reddened his face when he spoke of his daughter the last thing he did before glowering at her and barging out of the front door was to hook a football scarf round his neck he went out to drive a train from derby to newcastle and back cathy parkers own parents had wanted her to be a pretty and feminine girl and shed fought hard against it bill jones would have wanted his daughter to be a boy with him at home matches sitting alongside him in the workingmens club following him into train driving whats she done with her life shes screwed it and now shes screwing us annie jones was a small woman grimly thin in face and body with prematurely greying hair she hadnt spoken while her husband had badmouthed their daughter and cathy didnt think shed have spoken when the detectives had come to the house to search through the few personal things that gladys eva jones had left there before the links were cut cathy made a pot of tea while the mother sat at the kitchen table she had no difficulty in drawing the woman out it was a skill that went with her job we tried to love her but god knows it wasnt easy she didnt want for anything we havent money but we gave her what we could it didnt satisfy her you see miss parker we were never good enough for her and nor was anyone else round here she went to the university bill wont admit it but he was proud she was the only kid in the street that had got to university i thought if she hadnt friends here shed find them there perhaps the people she met there werent good enough either the few times she came back the first year away i could see how lonely she was theres not much here but you dont have to be lonely not if youll muck in gladys wouldnt do that nor at the university neither i think she was always pushing for more control of people but it was so obvious that they didnt want to know her its not nice to say this about your daughter but shes a stuckup bitch bill cant talk to her but its the same for me i tried but she never came near to halfway to meet me then she went into that religious thing she came back once after shed joined them dont get me wrong ive nothing against foreigners having their own religion but it wasnt right for her she came back in her robes her face half covered and some of the kids in the street gave her some lip shes not been back since do you know where she is now do you know what shes doing shes in real trouble now isnt she or you wouldnt have been here and the detectives wouldnt have come she wants to belong somewhere special wants control wants people to talk about her is she going to get hurt please miss parker try to see she doesnt get hurt cathy left her sitting at the kitchen table staring out of the window above the sink at the songbirds wheeling around the hanging sack of nuts once on a course with the german gsg antiterrorist unit shed heard an instructor bark at the recruits about to practise a storm entry to a building shoot the women first she drove away from the mean little street headed for the motorway and london the instructor had said that the women were always more dangerous than the men more likely to reach for a weapon in the last critical seconds of their lives when there was no hope of survival she was wondering whether farida yasmin was a help to the iranian or a liability cathy thought of the girl confused and willing blundering forward with the man farida yasmin craved a little spot where the sun shone on her but cathy didnt think shed find it a talent of cathys was to make instant assessments of the people she investigated farida yasmin was unimportant and she would write only the briefest of reports on her visit the girl was a loser but there was nothing she could do to prevent her being hurt and she felt quite sad she knew about loneliness if we dont make it it will be the fault of all these wretched boxes but thank you for the thought luisa and i have always been interested in wildlife simon blackmore went back to his wife in the kitchen they had been washing the plates cups mugs saucers that had been wrapped in newspaper by the packers the man at the door had said his name was paul that he was on the parish council that he was the man to fix any little difficulties confronting them was always pleased to smooth the way for new arrivals hed told them there was a meeting in the hall that evening of the wildlife group with a talk on migration from a warden of the royal society for the protection of birds then hed asked whether luisa typed and had explained how the group had lost its typist the most selfish people ive ever known here and i was born in the village the worst sort of in comers the sort of people who dont give a damn for the safety of those they live among simon blackmore had seen the way that the man had looked at his wifes wrists at the slash scars across the veins what youre being offered geoff sweetheart is per cent more than youre getting now its fantastic on top of that theres the inhouse bonus scheme the private medical thing theres guaranteed threestar minimum accommodation when youre working out of london businessclass flights into europe youll be on at least double the pittance youre getting now at the end of the day your pay at the moment is actually insulting they dont deserve people like you the sooner youre gone the better get your letter in straight away write it tonight i stopped off in the travel agents on the way from your place they said mauritius or the seychelles are great im talking honeymoons sweetheart as soon as youre back from that dump tomorrow day after tomorrow lets get tramping round some property call me love you geoff markham heard her blow kisses down the telephone and cut the call his mind was too distracted to make the calculation of a per cent increment on his existing salary he was thinking of the young man out at the rim of the reedbeds and of the firm certainty of his gaze watching the marshlands and him too frank perry stood by the telephone in the kitchen gutless bastard he stood by the telephone and read the lengthening list of scratchedout names bill davies shrugged i suppose i shouldnt have done that cut him off your list sorry i dont go to church cant bear listening to his dreary sermons i just thought given the circumstances i thought it would help if he showed support perry turned to the detective he was beaten down greyfaced the hand resting on daviess shoulder shook as it grasped at the jacket held tight to it was i out of order last night not for me to comment i can just take it meryl cant shes drowning one more thing one more another bit of chaos shell go under how long im not supposed to talk tactics or strategy bill please the detective thought his principal was close to defeat and that was not the policy hed done them all he had stood with the glock on his hip beside cabinet bigshots and foreign leaders and turned ira informers and he had never felt any sense of involvement he thought that whatever he said would go back to meryl perry theres a fair bit going on dont ask me what were beefed up most of which you wont see it was said at the beginning that our tango couldnt last hostile ground lack of resources your location more than a week what day are we were at day five a tired nervy smile played at perrys mouth whats the al haig story davies laughed out loud as if the tension were lifted monday right getting to the end of bloody monday its appropriate united states army general al haig was in belgium on a nato visit the sort of trip where there are convoys of limousines about a half a mile long a security nightmare the convoys hammering along a main route of course the search teams have worked over it but they missed a culvert in the culvert was a bomb handiwork of a leftist antiamerican faction the detonation was a fraction late and anyway it malfunctioned the car armourplated didnt take the full force kept on going and the escorts in the culvert had been enough explosive to bounce haigs car right off the road and make a crater fish could have lived in al haig said i guess that if we can get through monday then we can survive the rest of the week its about hanging on in there weve about got through monday mr perry i can hold her for two more days if nothing else breaks her first it was the end of the day and the quiet was all around him the bird sky danced displaying for him its regained flying skills but there was the quiet he no longer watched the bird no longer took pleasure from the extravagance of its flight he watched the geese and the swans the ducks and the wheeling gulls and he looked for a sign the quiet playing in his ears they did not stampede they did not skim the water with flailed wings to take off in panic they did not shriek as they would when disturbed they were quiet as if they were warned vahid hossein could see the positions of the policemen on the far side of the marsh on the higher ground he had no fear of them he knew where they were they would have thought they were still unnoticed but he saw each movement of their bodies as their legs backs hips shoulders stiffened and they shifted their bodies for relief there had been an iraqi sniper on the jasmin canal who used the svd dragunov calibre rifle with an effective range of metres he was never seen and he had shot eighteen men in three weeks a prisoner had said afterwards that a mortars shrapnel had hit him as he went to his firing position on the banks of the canal in the early morning it was luck that a random shell had killed him the birds on the jasmin canal were always quiet in the hours before the sniper fired he sensed the presence of a watcher he felt a new atmosphere he believed himself now and he had only the evidence of the quiet to be challenged a slight frown of apprehension had settled on his forehead at the fall of the day as the wind quickened and trembled the reedheads he made his plan to go into the water away from the bank towards the place he had seen yesterday deep in the beds of old gold reeds and near to the central water channel he could not see the watcher could only sense the new quiet that had settled around him chapter fifteen sitting with the damp of the ground seeping into the backside of his trousers and with the warmth of his dogs under his jackknifed legs in his vantagepoint andy chalmers listened to the night sounds there was no moon no break in the rain cloud he was behind thick cover if there had been light he would not have been able to see the reedbeds and the water channels it was possible that the man had an image intensifier nightvision equipment he would not give him the chance to identify his position chalmers did not need to see the land around him instead he listened there was the quiet the rumble of the sea on the shore the call of a distant fox a policeman two hundred metres away stifled a cough and another one four hundred metres away stood to urinate he was still he was silent when the fox called his fingers felt the hackles rise on the necks of his dogs and he soothed them where they lay if the man was there chalmers knew he would hear him the wind that came from the west had turned which pleased chalmers it scudded off the distant trees and fields and came across the marshland riffling the leaves and branches behind which he sat he could control sight and sound but not the body odour of smell sight sound and smell all carried great distances over open ground at night but in the high mountains where he worked he regarded smell as the worst of the stalkers enemies he had left the keys to his caravan where he lived at the back of the senior keepers cottage with mr gabriel fenton the few coins from his pocket had been abandoned on the train he carried nothing of metal in his pockets it was his routine to make the owners guests discard everything that could clink rattle rub together before he started the stalk his dogs were as still and silent as himself there would be no sound for his prey to hear and no noise to disturb the birds in the reed mass the wind was as he would have wanted it and would carry his smell away from the man if he was there an american a guest of his owner had once brought foul pungent creams with him on a stalk and believed they would block the mansmell that a stag might scent chalmers had made him strip and douse himself in a stream to wash the stuff off him a french guest had rolled in sheep droppings and that also was useless the only possibility of hiding mansmell from a target stag was to keep the wind in the stalkers faces he had not yet smelt the man if he was there he sat and wrapped himself in his patience let the night hours drift and he listened he could sit still silent but he did not doze did not allow himself to edge towards sleep if he had dozed slept then he would not have heard in the cold the rain and the quiet chalmers set himself games to play with his memory so that his senses were never less than alert memories of stalks with guests of the owner and clients who paid for a day what he earned in two weeks the guest from holland who had failed at the start of the week in the disused quarry to put six bullets out of six with a telescopic sight into a fourinch target at a hundred metres he had refused to take him out mr gabriel had backed him and the guest had been sent to thrash a river for salmon the guest front the city of london with new clothing and a new rifle good on the targetshooting in the quarry who had been led for five hours towards an eightyearold stag with a crown of antlers been brought to within eighty yards for a side shot hed given the guest the loaded rifle the browning calibre cocked it hed been on the telescope on the beast and the bullet had struck its lower belly it had fled wounded he had told the guest he was a bloody butcher and had been out half the night and all of the next morning with his dogs to find the beast and limit its misery chalmers was encouraged by the quiet of the reedbanks there should have been movement and spats over nesting territory and the cries of the birds the client from germany who had demanded to shoot the stag with the greatest crown spread of antlers but that beast was only six years old and in the prime of its breeding life the client had hissed the sum he was paying and what he needed as a trophy chalmers had told him that if he showed no respect for the beasts he could go back down to the glen with his rifle unused the man had crumpled then whined about the money and had been led forward to shoot an old beast at the end of its life theyd passed within thirty yards of the younger stag as theyd moved towards the target beast and at the end the client had thanked him for the best stalk of his shooting days chalmers had walked away from him because he acknowledged neither gratitude nor praise he thought the quiet was because the man was good was among the birds in the reeds and on the water and was still the guest panting and unfit had been in dead ground and had pulled a packet of cigarettes from his pocket chalmers had snatched the cigarette from the guests mouth hed made the stalk last ten hours two of them crawling against the rush of a streamfilled gully finally when the beast was seventy yards from them hed told the guest youre not fit to shoot youre a bloody ruin and hadnt given him the rifle the memories kept the cutting edge to his senses the birds were too quiet he knew that the man was good and that the man was there in the marsh he waited patient he felt a respect brother to brother for the man out there in the water the same respect that he felt for the big beasts he stalked and tracked weve lasted through monday hed had to feed the boy and himself hed heated the last of the precooked meat pies in the fridge and taken the remaining tub of icecream from the freezer hed found a science programme on the television for stephen and theyd eaten off their laps hed taken the trays back into the kitchen and gone upstairs she was on the bed in darkness he sat beside her they say he has a week he cant endure more than a week its closing round him were on the fifth day we have to hang on in there where is he fenton asked i dont know markhams voice distorted by the scrambler echoed back at him i only know that hes sitting out there in the bloody bog have you called him has he sitrepped i wouldnt dare to call the ungracious little beggar im only the fetcher and carrier i reckon hed garrotte me if i disturbed him doesnt he know the importance of continuous contact he knows it if you told him it geoff does he realize how much is riding on his back that too i expect you told him ill call you when he deigns to make contact bye mr fenton fenton shivered he was alone but for the company of a thirdyear probationer who watched the telephones it was always late at night when an operation was running towards climax that he shivered not from cold but from nerves in the day surrounded by acolytes the confidence boomed in him but parker had gone the american with her and the elder of the probationers the old warhorse from b section cox had left early to prepare for a dinner party it would be the end of him if the boy chalmers failed he would be a casualty washed up sneered at shown the earlyretirement door halfway across the world was another man who would be sweating on the fear of failure he did not know what an office high in the ministry of information and security would be like but he seemed to sense that man shivering in the same sweat as dribbled on his own back he had talked of contftil but late at night he reflected there was not a vestige of control for either of them it was always like that never different when the little people took charge and the power of the high and mighty was stripped from their hands he would sleep at thames house that night and the next sleep there until it was over because he had volunteered to take responsibility the career of harry fenton lay in the grubby hands of andy chalmers home is where we are home isnt about people isnt about things home is where you are and stephen and me there isnt anything for us here you said home was about friends but there arent any theyve gone anywhere we are together is home i cant take it not any more she lay with her back to him her voice was lowpitched and flat calm perry thought she was beyond weeping it was coming to the end of a complex day for the intelligence officer the demand for information clarification of a situation from tehran led to his walking along the corridor with the flowers on his arm and the grapes in his hand one among many visitors the brigadier in tebran had insisted the intelligence officer nervous wary had left his embassy office in the middle of the day he had not seen a tail but always assumed one followed him he had driven to the home in west londons suburbs of a colleague from visa section parked outside the front of the house been greeted at the door and invited inside without stopping he had gone out of a back door crossed the rear garden to the gate tracked along an alley between garages and taken his colleagues car he had driven to the offices and yard of the carhire company at the extreme of south london and asked about a bmw rented out to yusuf khan a shadow of hesitation crossed the young womans face and he had eased his wallet from his pocket a hundred pounds palmed across the desk in twentypound notes had lightened the shadow he was shown hurriedly a photograph from an insurance file of the wrecked vehicle he was told of the hospital where the injured man was treated did she know about a passenger the police had not spoken of one it was already early evening by the time he reached the hospital after checking for the location of delivery postnatal he headed for the casualty ward he was another visitor one of many who anxiously came to see the sick the injured and the maimed he had the flowers and the grapes as if they guaranteed him admittance he walked slowly down the centre of the ward through the aisle between the beds scanning the faces of the patients he seemed lost and confused but none of the harassed nursing staff came forward to help him a corridor was ahead of him signs for the fire escape and to the side a trolley carrying resuscitation equipment he took a risk because tehran required it of him he edged forward with the fools smile on his face only when he was beside the trolley did he see the policeman with the machinegun on his lap i am looking for my sister and her baby there was a door with a glass window in it behind it a second policeman was reading a magazine that half hid the bulk of his firearm he saw the bed and the bandaged head of yusuf khan not here no babies here thank god this not the place for babies he gazed at the bandaged head the linking tubes the opened eyes the head shook the tubes wavered the eyes blinked with recognition absolutely pal this is not the place for babies he saw the tears gathering in the eyes and he thought he saw a trace of guilt flicker there i must ask again he walked away he had seen what he needed to see he laid the flowers and the grapes on the ward sisters desk when he left his colleagues house in west london he sped back to central london and his office at the embassy with the urgent report to be sent by secure coded communication to tehran locked in his mind is that what you want a van coming to the front door all those bastards out in the road watching you want to give them that satisfaction your things everything thats personal to you your furniture your clothes your pictures your life paraded for them theyll spit at the car as it takes us away is that what you want his hand was on her shoulder and his fingers massaged meryls bones and muscles she never looked at hiwi and she didnt speak the brigadier was a careful man if his back was to be protected it was necessary for him always to be careful he was that rarity in the service of the ministry of information and security an intelligence officer who had made the transition from the previous regime he had crossed sides the majority with whom he had worked as a captain in the savak were long dead hanged shot butchered for their service to the shah but three days before the mob the street scum from south tebran had entered and sacked the savak offices on hafez avenue he had taken a suitcase of files from his workplace and made contact with his enemy the files were his credentials with them were his memories of names locations and faces in the confused days that followed he was to the new men of iran a small treasured mine of knowledge the names of former colleagues the locations of safehouses and the faces of informers all had tripped off his tongue as he bought himself survival the new regime of course was innocent in the matters of security and counterrevolution the change coat prospered as his colleagues died when the captured americans from the embassy protested that they were not employees of the agency the changecoat could identify them when the mujahiddin rose in revolt against the imam he could put faces to names he had been promoted to major and then colonel in the vezarateettelaat va ammyate kishvar and now held the rank in the vevak of brigadier but he was too intelligent too cautious a man to believe that his position would ever be secure and above suspicion a few detested him a few more despised him the majority those who knew his past were wary of him the protective screens with which he surrounded himself were the zealots commitment to the new regime coupled with a total ruthless efficiency no word of criticism for the mullahs in government and influence ever crossed his lips no mistake in his planning of operations was ever admitted if the mildest words of criticism were ever spoken he would be denounced and pitched from his office there were many and he knew it who would clamour to fire the bullet or tighten the noose around his neck vahid hossein had been like a son to him the communication from london was on his desk the hot fumefilled night was around his high office tears and guilt meant betrayal were evidence that a coward yusuf khan had talked it was his hope alone in the cigarettesmokefilled office that the man who had been like a son to him would be shot dead it would be worse if the great tanker which was the pride of the fleet were intercepted as it slowed in the shipping lanes to launch the inflatable was boarded and impounded he weighed the possibilities open to him then wrote an instruction for the vevak officer who worked as an official at the building of the national iranian tanker corporation the ship was to sail in the morning there was to be no attempt at a pickup for his own survival to avoid an inevitable fate he cut the link to vahid hossein he did not hesitate i want to go shopping i want stephen to go to school i want you to go to work i want us go walking i dont want ever again frank to see a gun i want to be happy again theres nothing left for us here downstairs the television droned on under daviess tuneless whistling to himself there was a muted cackle of laughter from the hut at the back and the revving of the engine of the car at the front to keep the heater going everything they listened to all around them was sourced by the guns please im begging it of you please perrys voice quavered to his wifes silence in a way its like khe sanh not that i was there they were so nervous as if frightened of each other littelbaum would not undress her cathy had done it herself stripping while he had turned his back to her to shed the old tweed suit the crumpled shirt and the underclothes that werent quite clean he had gentle hands and they touched her breasts with a teenagers awe as he lay on her was inside her khe sanh was staking out a goat we put down a base the middle of nowhere and we invited them to come and get us we thought the north vietnamese army would destroy itself when it came on to our wire cathy thought it was his nerves that made him spatter out the bullshit and she reckoned he hadnt a woman in riyadh was as lonely as herself it was a long time since she had had sex this was shipdeck romance without commitment and in less than fortyeight hours he would be on the flight back to where he had come from we reckoned we had it right at khe sanh had learned the french lessons from dien bien phu the french hadnt the resources we had but they believed in the same principle which was putting out a bait with the opportunity to smack the bad bastard when he comes sniffing she was not into publicservice sex she was not available to the germans the israelis and the italians who came to liaise for a few days at thames house she was not a convenient bicycle for men far from home the american was as lonely and as diffident as herself and hid it behind the gruff allknowing professionalism as she did she had known they would end up there on her bed when she had suggested brusquely that shed cook him supper it was what shed thought she needed after the long drive down from derby with the girl preying on her mind in her car outside the door as shed fished in her bag for the keys inside when shed brought him the big whisky in her bedroom where shed led him by the hand hed looked like a scared cat in a corner he was above her going so slowly as if terrified of failing her and talking youve got to have nerve when you get into this game and you have to be prepared to take casualties the young fellow markham he doesnt have the nerve doesnt accept that footsoldiers get hurt youve got to go for broke we werent prepared to at khe sanh nor the french at dien bien phu we lost they lost but the principle was right she didnt give a tinkers toss for khe sanh and dien bien phu it was a relief to have the smell of a man with her his weight on her and the size of a man in her she moved as slowly as he did and she dreaded the end of it she didnt care that he talked you know cathy i think the worm has turned she squeezed him she raked his back with her short nails that she never bothered to paint as other women did she laughed out loud are we off goats you are a lovely fine woman and i regret i apologize im not doing much good for you we are on to worms tell me about worms she heaved up against him against his bones and the wide flab of his stomach too long since she had known it the pleasure seeping through her and she thrust again and she heard her own moan and she was not lasting and he was quickening and it was to her lonely each day and each night a little piece of pleasure that had no future worms can turn the defence is in place the guns are covering the goat the predator has to come it is not acceptable to the predator that he goes back to his lair without a kill he cant bug out cathy cant go back to tehran with an empty gut and the odds against him are stacked higher and the marksmen are waiting for him its turned thats the feeling in my water turned advantage lost what i say christ cathy he gasped and cried out she held him she knew that she would never hear from him nor of him again the flight would go he looked down at her with devotion she pushed him off im hungry come on lets eat she went naked as if the shyness was shed to the kitchen and heaved open the fridge it would be instant bloody curry out of the microwave she heard him call tired with a quaver in his voice from the bedroom the worm might have might just have turned please im saying it again and again dont go i cant walk away once was one time too many im nothing if youve gone do you think i havent thought about it going packing and running i have to stand and face it for what i did its nearly over nearly finished please stay please perry held her against him he wondered if the detective or the men in the hut were listening he clung in the darkness to meryl the cups and saucers for the coffee the biscuit plates and the glasses for the fruit juice had been stacked on trays and carried away into the kitchenette area the chairs scraped the wooden floor as the audience settled gratifyingly the hail was almost filled but the wildlife group always attracted the villages best response peggy was busy rounding up the last of the lost crockery emma carstairs was fussing with the blinds elecking they would keep out the nearest glow from the streetlamp barry fiddled with the beam from the slide projector and called for jerry wroughton to move the screen fractionally mary was helping to manoeuvre mrs wilsons wheelchair into a better position to see the screen mrs fairbrother sat aloof in the front row mr hackett behind her and dominic and his partner talked softly there were more than fifty present a good turnout on a bad night the numbers of village regulars were augmented by a few who had driven from dunwich a carload from blythburgh and more from southwold paul clapped his hands for attention and the chatter died first well done for coming on a filthy night second apologies that we wont be having minutes from the committees last meeting and cant hand out the usual list of summer speakers i reckon most of you know the problem weve had with getting things typed up any volunteers no hands were raised but there had been a growl of understanding at the mention of the problem third my pleasure in welcoming dr julian marks from the rspb who is going to talk to us on the subject of migration dr marks to generous applause a longhaired man with a gangling body his face tanned by weather stepped forward dr marks said loudly im taking it i can be heard everyone hear me at the back yes excellent i want to begin with a thankyou two actually thank you for inviting me but more important an especial thankyou from the rspb for your last donation which was an extraordinary amount from a village of this size and reflects a very caring and decent community fundraising on that scale marks this village as a place of warmth a place of overwhelming generosity now migration the lights faded the beam of the projector caught the screen few in the halls audience saw simon and luisa blackmore slide soundlessly into empty seats in the back row none present would have known of her fear of crowded brightlit rooms you know living as you do alongside those wonderful empty marshlands the most beautiful of the migratory birds the marsh harrier youre protected and stephen and me he was at the door he was only trying to break down the fucking door with a gun to kill us in our home it cant happen again i promise its what theyve told me you cant move for men here everywhere protecting us meryl twisted on the bed to face him her arms were around his neck she had his promise and clung to it gussie in the summer months dug gardens in the village when he had finished at the piggery then went home for his tea then to the pub in the darker winter months when he couldnt use the evenings to turn over the vegetable patches at the carstairs and the wroughtons and at perrys house he went straight home from the pig farm for his tea then to the pub after the pub his mother his younger brothers and sisters already gone to bed he sat in the chair master of the house and read the magazines he bought in norwich stories about combat and survival and he dreamed he sent away for mailorder books and reckoned himself expert in counterterrorism lowintensity warfare and the world of the military he should have been listened to in the pub his father was gone living the last four years with some tart in ipswich and he was the breadwinner for the family he had his tea when he wanted it home revolved around him and his earning power he believed as the wageearner that he was the equal of any man he met in the pub but he never found quite the popularity he thought he deserved his life with the other workers in the pigfields with the people in the culdesac where he lived or in the pub where he propped up the bar each evening was a constant search for that elusive popularity stories never heard through to the end jokes never quite laughed at his opinion rarely asked he was big well muscled could throw around the straw bales on which the pigs slept with ease and because of his size he had never known fear he had not told her that the option was withdrawn no longer existed perry said it again in her ear as he held her it cannot happen again because if anything else happened it wont it cant anything gussie was the loudest gussie was the one drinking fastest talking the biggest talk more pints of strong beer were passed across the bar by martindale two hours theyd been going and the talk was in the drink his wife the timid dorothy martindale had called him back from the bar into the doorway why did he allow the swearing cursing drinktalk because without these people theyd be at the wall tramping to the bankruptcy hearing that was why shed gone back upstairs to the flat over the bar the till rang again they were the only customers hed have in that night everyone else was in the hall vince said what im reckoning if the bastards still here when summer comes the season starts we can kiss goodbye to visitors gussie capped him no bloody visitors no money need the visitors donna said somethings got to be done some buggers got to have the balls to do something it was all the custom he had and all he was likely to have if the visitors stayed away because armed police were combing the village whod let kids run round whod sit on the green with a picnic or go walking on the beach most important whod sit on the bench outside the pub with a warm pint and crisps for the kids whod be there if the village when the season came was a gun camp hed be finished if there were no visitors and the others with him gussie shouted they got to know theyre not wanted got to know it straight and theyre going to vince wanted a plate of chips martindale left the bar and went upstairs to ask his wife to make a plate of chips he could charge a pound for a plate of chips he apologized to her but they needed each pound going into the till hed told her when theyd started in the pub that it would be a money trail and now he was grateful for the money earned by a plate of chips he went back down to the bar and gussie wasnt there he thought gussie had gone to piss and his glass half full was on the bar counter he seemed not to hear the complaining whine across the bar the banks letter was in his mind and the letter from the brewery that stated he was underperforming martindale saw gussie through the front window crossing the carpark and weaving he was carrying a light plank one of those the builders had left when hed said he couldnt afford for them to complete the work on the outside lavatories martindale watched him lurching away into the darkness beyond the reach of the lights the plank on his shoulder he held her meryl had his promise and the tension of her muscles ebbed she lay soft against him he heard the brief triple ring of the bell then blakes voice and daviess wishing him a good night davies said frank heard it that the bloody place was quiet as a grave he heard blake settle in the dining room and check the machinegun they shared if he hadnt given his promise she would have taken down the suitcase from the top of the wardrobe and left he had been stifled in the house ahead of him was a meal alone in a pub then the suffocation of the room in the bedandbreakfast bill davies walked past his car he had to think had to be alone there was no escape from the need to call home there were enough of them gossiping in his section for him to know the talk of a marriage going down some said that actually they felt the better for it when it was over a few said in a bar with drink that when it was over the loneliest time in their lives began he had to steel himself to talk with lily in the hope that she would let him chat to donald and brian it would probably be like the last time silences and refusal then the challenge as to when he was coming home to which he had no answer then the purr of the cut call he had to think had to walk had to know what he would say the rain lashed down the road in front of him towards the halls lights and the pubs bright windows was empty there was a shadow of movement at the side of the road beyond the throw of the lights from the hail and he thought it would be one of the old idiots who took their dogs out sunshine or rain and was sheltering against a tree or a hedge he wrapped his heavy coat closer round him his shoes and the trousers at his ankles were already soaked he would say i love you i love my boys our boys i want to be with you i want to share my life with you i am a policeman i carry a glock pistol i protect people who are under threat i cannot change i cant go back to chasing thieves seeing kids across roads i have to live with it you have to live with it living with it lily is better for both of us than splitting splitting is death death for me death for you death for donald and brian anything is better than us meeting on the doorstep on saturday mornings if im not working and you looking at me like im dirt and letting the kids out with me for four hours a football match and a mcdonalds give it another chance the words jangled in his mind and he was so tired he had been sitting for twelve hours in the dining room of the house with his flask of coffee and his sandwiches with his glock and his machinegun with his newspaper and listening to them he was trying to put lily forefront in his mind and his boys and they were second best to meryl perry lily wouldnt understand about meryl perry wouldnt the shot blasted out he froze there was no pain no numbness and he was standing the shot had missed he spun but they didnt do pitchdarkness practice at lippitts hill they did daytime firing or were under the arclights in the shooting gallery he was reaching under the heavy coat under his jacket for the glock he had it out of the holster he was turning aiming into the blackness in front of him he was screaming for control for dominance armed police throw your weapon down show yourself but he was in the light and the rain was in his eyes and couldnt see a target if there had been anything to aim at he would have fired not shouted finger on the trigger guard like they taught where was the bastard get forward to me crawl or i shoot i fucking shoot weapon first then you move bill davies had never had his gun out before never drawn it for real now he saw the movement his finger slipped from the guard to the trigger not simunition in hogans alley not on the range his finger locked on the trigger and he began to squeeze he blinked tried to focus on the aim into the darkness a plank fell towards him bounced twice and came to rest at his feet there was a whimpering in front of him and an identifiable movement he had the aim on it and his finger was tightening come out come out or i shoot davies bellowed at the blackness the shadow came with it a whining cry the young man crawled on his knees and elbows towards the light davies knew it was over he had been so shit scared and it made him angry he saw the slack mouth of the young man and the terror in his eyes he had seen him in the pub they used planks in ireland kids and women used to stand in darkness put their weight on a plank end wait for a patrol to pass then heave up the other end of it to let it smash down on tarmac or paving its sound the replica of a bullet firing they did it to wind up the soldiers it was sport he had been at the edge of firing it was unnecessary but he caught the collar of the young man and dragged him across the road out into the streetlight he threw him flat on his stomach drove the barrel of the glock into his neck put a knee into the small of his back and onehanded frisked him he could smell old beer and new piss he had been at the edge of killing a drunk whod played a game he stood high over him and used his foot to turn him over he saw the big stain where the young man had wet himself and the scratches on his face from being dragged over the road surface the man made little noises of terror and davies realized he still covered him with the gun he shouldnt have but he kicked the young man hard in the wall of the stomach go on get back to your mammy tell your mammy why you pissed your trousers ever try it again youre dead the young man scrambled to his knees then to his feet then lurched away sobbing davies watched him as he ran towards the hall and the pubs lit windows he walked back to his car outside the house and slumped in the seat he didnt know why he hadnt made the final squeeze on the trigger that would have killed the kid and his whole body shook he knew he would make no phone call that night wildlife is a jewel we are fortunate to see the brightest of the jewels making the incredible journey to ad from west africa each year coming back to us to our place each spring is the marsh harrier we are a privileged people thank you the applause burst around dr julian marks the lights came on they had all heard the shouting in the road had all turned in the halflight under the projectors beam looked at the door and seen paul slip busily out barry carstairs attention elsewhere led the applause he was about to offer their thanks to the speaker when the swing doors burst back open the silence fell paul shouted its gussie the police nearly shot him it was the detective at the perrys he had his gun on him and then he kicked him to shit i thought he was going to shoot him christ we all know gussie hes hardly brain of britain but he was damn near killed there was a stampede to the door the crowd surged past simon and luisa blackmore and out into the night many were in time to see gussie staggering across the brightly lit forecourt of the pub jerry wroughton said the rain running on his face this nonsense has gone far enough forgetting her reservations of the previous morning emma carstairs said its time somebody did something martindale saw him first and dropped the glass he was drying vince turned on his stool gussie stood in the doorway gasping for breath his hair was plastered down on his forehead and his eyes showed stark terror his face laced with bloody scratches they could all see the dark patch at the crotch of his jeans and the rips at the knees none of them laughed gussie stammered he was going to kill me the man at the perrys the cop he had his gun on me i was only joking him but he was going to shoot me i thought i was dead and he kicked me i wasnt doing anything it was a bloody joke vince stood his full height the drink gave him the stature and the courage dont know about you lot but i dont think those bastards have got the message myself im going to see they get it its time the shits were gone when the first rock hit the window meryl woke half conscious she heard the cheer she groped for frank in the darkness beside her but he wasnt there there was another crack of breaking glass and another cheer she pushed herself off the bed and heard franks voice frantic calling for stephen and the rush of feet through the kitchen below her and into the hall hed promised her shed had franks promise she went to the top of the stairs the bell rang three bleats blake had a vest on the gun drawn paget was in front of him paget did the door and blake covered him as it was opened she heard the shouting the obscenities heard her name and franks clearly davies squeezed through the halfopened door and paget slammed it behind him more rocks maybe halfbricks and perhaps an empty metal dustbin clattered against the door she was at the top of the stairs and they had not seen her blake yelled what the fuck is going on here davies was leaning against the hall wall and the water dribbled from his coat on to the paper its about a bloody moron whats half the flicking village got to do with a bloody moron i was walking the bloody moron did me with a plank i thought it was a shot i bloody near fired christ i had him in my sights he was just drunk i roughed him if its not happened to you then you wouldnt know what its like bloody hell bill davies looked up the stairs and saw her it was as if the panic cleared off his face and the tiredness his expression was a mask he said calmly as if shed heard nothing everythings under control mrs perry theres been an incident but itll be over in a moment please stay upstairs mrs perry wheres stephen stephens with juliet seven sorry with mr perry stephens fine please stay upstairs they didnt want to know about her as far as they were concerned she was just a woman she heard the murmur of the voices of davies blake and paget and she caught the name juliet seven and the words safe area and mention of sector two and sector four her man her home and her garden there was a window at the front of the landing at the top of the stairs beside the airingcupboard door she peeped past the curtain a little tableau was laid out below her for a moment there was quiet as if they regrouped reconsidered as if the fainter hearts ruled they were all there on the green the village ids were at the front and behind them were vince and gussie and paul and others she recognized who worked on the farms or had no work or took the small fishingboats with visitors and seaanglers further back half hugging the shadows were barry and emma carstairs jerry and mary wroughton and mrs fairbrother deeper into the shadows but she could still see them were dominic and his partner and the vicar she knew them all paul came from the blackness holding out the bottom edge of his coat to make a basket when he loosed it stones fell to the road the kids scrambled for the stones snatched them up and hurled them against the walls of the house and the windows and the door and the cars parked at the front she saw hatred she had seen such mobs on television flickering contorted faces from africa and asia and from the corners of eastern europe but theirs was an anonymous madness these faces she knew and the faces of those who stood back in the shadows and watched there was a flash of light in the far blackness then the light lit the torso of a youth she recognized him he was from the council houses and helped carry ladders for vince he held a milk bottle and the cloth stuffed in the bottles neck was lit the crowd roared approval there must have been fifty of them maybe more the youth ran forward past mrs fairbrother and mr hackett past dominic past emma and mary barry and jerry past paul and vince gussie and donna and his arm arched to throw the bottle she heard the pandemonium in the hall below then the bolt scraping open and the key turning through the window she saw paget go out crouch fumble at his belt then throw his missile the youth dropped the bottle and turned it splintered and the conflagration of fire burst where he had been the gas canister detonated the wind took the greywhite cloud past the light of the burning petrol and into the black darkness she heard the choking the coughing and the screamed protests they had gone all of them to the cover of darkness this was not ireland or nairobi wasnt guatemala city this was her home the fire guttered the gas dispersed shadowy figures moved in the darkness the two mobile cars were now drawn up to make a barrier in front of the house the argument raged in the hall below her frank and bill davies in spitting dispute she was not supposed to hear then frank propelled stephen across the hall and up the stairs before shrugging into a vest davies wrenched open the door she held stephen and felt the blast of the cold air she crouched frank was outside with davies and paget she could not see them she was down on the floor and clinging to stephen holding his head against her and pressing her palms over his ears he would be on the step shielded by the bodies of davies and paget protected by their guns and their gas against his friends her friends he had to shout to be heard across their low front fence and the grass heard into the deep shadow frank had to shout its all right you fuckers you can go home you can go home and be satisfied that youve won as much as youre going to win i promised meryl do you all remember meryl you should remember meryl she did enough for you lot i promised her that nothing more would happen i was wrong i had forgotten you all of you i cant see you now any of you in the dark but please stay and listen dont creep away on your stomachs dont pretend it didnt happen you will remember tonight what you did for the rest of your lives if youre still there if youre listening then you should know that you have won a little victory you have broken my promise to meryl shell be going in the morning and taking stephen with her shell be trying to find somewhere to stay shell have to ring round people she hardly knows or check into a hotel shes never been to everyone she reckoned was her friend is here soit wont be easy for her to find somewhere not me though not me the tears streamed on her cheeks and fell on the hair of her childs head youre stuck with me before tonight i might just have gone with her but not now your victory is that youve driven out a wonderful caring woman and her child you dont win with me im a proper bastard your worst fucking nightmare an obstinate sod what i did why theres the threat i provided the information that killed a busful of men i was prepared to betray a busful of men so what happens to you is low down on any relevance scale to me i dont care what happens to you and im staying got that can you hear me when you next go to church put money in charity boxes when you next volunteer for good works and good causes think of what you did tonight to meryl but the cruelty doesnt work with me she could not hold back the tears you see you dont frighten me im not frightened of yobs with stones where i was for what i did if id been caught there id have been hanged until dead thats not a trap under the gallows and quick but a rope from an industrial crane and its being hoisted up and its kicking and strangling and slow theres not a few drunks watching not a few cowards theres twenty thousand people you understand being hanged from a crane frightens me not you she lay on the floor beside the door of the airingcupboard clutched her boy and squeezed her hands over his ears i bought some time im told i delayed a programme for the development of weapons of mass destruction the warheads would have carried chemicals or microbiological agents might have been nerve gases and might have been something like anthrax you of course wouldnt have known the people targeted by those warheads they would have been saudis or kuwaitis or the gulf people they might have been israeli jews when youre so selfish when you live complacently in an island of your own making you wouldnt think of the millions of other souls who exist around you are you happy she heard the hoarseness of his voice there is a man who has been sent to kill me he is somewhere out there in the darkness i know very little of him but i know about his society his culture he is a muslim a child of the islamic faith he would not understand you from his faith and his culture he would believe that my community has closed ranks around me not isolated me i can find more love for him the man sent to kill me than for you my socalled friends she heard his last shout into the night are you there are you listening the door slammed behind him the key was turned the bolt rammed home chapter sixteen he felt puny insignificant and unimportant geoff markham walked beside the stream that wound ahead of him between the sea and the southmarsh behind him it skirted the village before drifting inconsequentially into northmarsh the wind was up and had blown away the rain he was unimportant because he had not been telephoned the night before he had been killing time at a piano recital twelve miles away in another town he had sat in ignorance at the back of a halfempty draughty baptist hall his mobile telephone of course had been on but the call had not come a trifle of life would have been injected into the performance if his telephone had bleeped but it had not davies had told him an hour earlier that morning of the nights events he had seen the scorched grass where the milk bottle had ignited and seen the smoked slivers near to the new tree was the small patch of burned ground where the gas canister had detonated only an unimportant junior liaison officer would not have been telephoned davies had told him what was going to happen that day not askedl him for his opinion but told him he had stormed away he was unimportant he realized because he did not carry a gun the guns were what counted now he was drawn towards southmarsh the guns ringed the marshland just as they were around and inside the house it hurt him to feel the minimality of his importance and no communication either from the little stinking bastard with the dogs markham didnt know where he was what he did what hed seen and couldnt call him for fear of compromising his position there were two letters in his pocket they were not typed up or remotely ready for sending but they were drafted in his handwriting he thought later he would go to the police station and find a typewriter and envelopes he had drafted the letters after the recital back at his guesthouse accommodation fenton had said down the phone fifty minutes earlier were not a marriageguidance operation geoff if she wants to go then im not going to lose sleep over it but he stays whatever if you have to chain him to the floor he stays he walked towards where the little verminous bastard was not that he would see him but where he would breathe the same air the two drafted letters were in his pocket dear mr cox i write to inform you of my resignation from the service i am taking up a position with a merchant bank in the city i would like to express to you to mr fenton to colleagues my appreciation of the many kindnesses that have been shown me my future employers wish me to start with them at the earliest possible date and i look for your cooperation in that matter sincerely and dear sirs i have received your letter setting out my terms of employment and find them most satisfactory accordingly i have resigned from my current employers by the same post and have requested the earliest possible date of release i much look forward to joining your team and will advise you soonest of when that will be sincerely once they were typed up they could go in the afternoon post and then geoff markham would no longer be unimportant he walked on the path turned a corner and could see past a wild clump of bramble the mass of the reedbanks the dark water channels and a ruined windmill that had no sails the bright light played on the dead reedtips and the birds flew above the muddy banks i wouldnt go any further if you dont want a bollocking from a police thug id stop right there he spun to the right a few yards from him the man sat on a weathered bench markham recognized him but couldnt place him a dapper little man thinning hair and a nervous smile with binoculars hanging from his neck quiet isnt it wonderful but theres a policeman ahead with a vile tongue and a big gun there was a chuckle like that of a teenage girl but from the soft full lips im watching the harrier its a joy to behold the man pointed markham saw the bird cartwheeling in awkward flight he squinted to see it better it was more than half a mile away and its colours merged with the reedbeds it was far beyond the windmill over the heart of the marsh he could see swans geese and ducks on the water but this was the only bird that flew and strangely its motion was that of a clumsy dancer incredible bird the marsh harrier it migrates each spring from west africa to here it would have been hatched on southmarsh and then in the first autumn of its life it flies all the way back to senegal or mauritania for the winter then come our spring it returns comes back to us i find that wonderful two thousand miles of flight and our little corner of the universe is where it returns to he remembered where he had seen the man he had bought a sandwich two days earlier at his shop dominic evanss name was over the door that morning davies had given him snarled them the names of those who had been in the halfshadow who had not intervened he was one of them it comes back to us its trust makes for a huge responsibility it can rely on our care and kindness a pity mr evans that frank and meyl perry cant rely on that well of care and kindness whats remarkable this bird came back last week and it was injured it had been shot i didnt thiril when i saw it last week that it could survive its flying not quite at full strength yet but its hunting and its getting there its almost a miracle i said mr evans that it was a pity frank and meryl perry cannot rely on your care and kindness thats not calledfor its the truth what do you know of ultimate truths i know that you were there last night one of those who stood back and let the mob have its bloody vicious fun you feel qualified to make a judgement i make a judgement on those who skulk at the back dont have the guts to come forward thats mighty high talk im talking about cowards who know what is right and stay silent do you want to know do i want to hear a string of snivelled excuses not particularly i am not proud of what happened frank and meryl perry need someone from among you bastards to hold out the hand of friendship i dont know your name youre another of the strangers who has invaded our little place till you came we were just ordinary people living hidden and un achieving lives we were like everybody else everybody anywhere we were not challenged i dont know your name but stranger i am homosexual queer got it i live with my friend and i love him but i am discreet i do not cause offence i do not draw attention to myself if i did then in this little place i would be labelled a pervert i buy tolerance with my work as the village historian i can tell you where the old shoreline was and the old churches and the old shipyard all that stuff but at least i take this place seriously if i were blatant i would be ostracized yes i should have spoken up for frank and meryl i like them but im a coward yes im ashamed so yes i go with the tide but its like the sea and the history here it makes for a sense of futility little gestures against the strength of the sea over many centuries have proved the worthlessness of mans efforts we bow before the force of the inevitable markham stared out over the marshland and the peace that settled on it you wont be here when this is over stranger well be left to pick up the pieces and youll have moved your caravan on where you can make judgements on other ordinary people is it satisfying work you sneer at me because i didnt publicly offer my hand in friendship to the perrys let me tell you no listen to me twice in the night when i wouldnt be seen ive put my coat on and determined to walk to frank and meryls door and each time i failed to find the courage will you tell them that im ashamed of my cowardice no markham said icily he cursed himself for his cruelty the man was gone stumbling away he wondered how he would have been if the challenge had faced him the warm sun was on his face geoff markham watched the flight of the bird and he had no sense of what was remarkable what was a miracle do you know what barney what harry i think its an away goal come again i think the yanks scored away from home harry fenton and barnaby cox stood at their adjacent office doors duane littelbaum flushed yawning had his feet up on the central table scanning a newspaper whats that mean got his leg over with miss prim parker you sure cathy was at her place at the console her eyes were on her screen she never looked up didnt glance at the soles of his shoes look at her you ever seen her so feminine god next shell be wearing lipstick mascara and eaudetoilette ever seen her so becomingly coy even shy you noticed geoff markhams door the number of the day on it just before you came in she scratched out one day and wrote day six and underneath shes put the worm has turned and i havent decrypted that cypher but she and the yank sniggered like kids as an expeenced senior dedicated intelligence officer id say the evidence points to last nights naughtiness not many been there before last chap so he said who tried to get his arm up her skirt that adonis from d branch said she damn near broke it off at the elbow brennard claims he was there admits she was so stressed out that she didnt know who he was well done the yank hes been useful but i wouldnt want mr littelbaum or his people to believe we are overly dependent on them if youre with me i wouldnt wish them to believe were in their pocket or not competent in our own theatre a wolfish grin played at the sides of harry fentons mouth our show done quietly yes you are harry managing this matter the grin vanished time will tell i live in hope davies brought him a mug of coffee perry had lifted his plans out of the chests bottom drawer in the sitting room and carried them into the dining room he had asked davies if he minded the intrusion and the detective had shaken his head it was only a small job a problem with the air filtration on the production line of an assembly plant in ipswich davies had moved his machinegun and the spare magazines across the blanket over the table to make room for him then headed for the kitchen it was the first time that frank perry had taken out some work in a week only a small job which wouldnt pay more than a thousand pounds but it was his little gesture of defiance he had noticed that davies didnt ask before going to the kitchen to make coffee and he thought the detective was at home now comfortable in their house perry thanked him for bringing the coffee meryl was upstairs packing she had slept alone poring over the workshop plans tracing the course of the filtration pipes perry reckoned out where the new motor should be placed and what power it must have to create the necessary airflow down the pipes to the unit there were two more consultancy jobs in the drawer one larger than this and one smaller and after that there was nothing he was tapping out calculations and jotting the numbers while she packed the ceiling beams and floor planks of the old house creaked under her weight above him she was in stephens room he didnt know how much she intended to take everything or the bare minimum if she took everything cleared the childs room of clothes and toys then she was going for ever she had called stephen in from the hut and hed come reluctantly his days were now split between the television and the hut hed noticed that just as he had noticed that davies was now more comfortable in the house he had not asked how much she intended to take because he had not dared to hear the answer the footfall moved above him she would be in the gloom of their bedroom she had left the child on his own to pack his toys perry heard the thud as she pulled down the biggest of the cases from the top of the wardrobe and then another he stared down doggedly at the plans for the new filtration unit are you all right sir why shouldnt i be wheres she going havent the faintest idea she has to go somewhere her mother and father died in a coach crash and shes never spoken of any relatives shes no friends where she came from we only have each other we thought it was different shall i book a hotel that would be best where should the hotel be how the hell should i know davies slipped away left him perry swore he had made a bloody mistake had missed a bloody decimal point he ripped up the sheet of paper on which hed written his calculations threw the pieces to the carpet and started again shed be packing the blouse hed bought for her last birthday and the diamond cluster ring with a central sapphire that hed given her last christmas and the underwear shed shown him when she came home from norwich three weeks ago everything that mattered to her and to him would be going into the suitcases he corrected the positioning of the decimal point it was the principle that mattered he would not surrender why did no one understand that he had to hold on to the principle davies came back in perry saw the smudge of lipstick on his collar the damp patch around it and knew the detective had comforted her how much is she taking not too much not too little how long is she going for not for me to say sir where is she going an hotel in london ive said ill book it davies asked him if hed like a refill of coffee and perry nodded he was wondering when she was in a hotel in london and the detective was relieved from the duty when a new man had come to replace him down here whether davies would see her seek her out his fingers smacked clumsily against the keys of the calculator it had been her idea simon blackmore held tight to luisas hand he had had the same idea but it was she who had articulated it they walked through the village with purpose either they did it or they left they both knew that and did not have to speak it if they had not started out on their walk through the village to the house on the green both of them would have gone to the garage beside the cottage and brought out the empty packing boxes and started to fill them they would already have rung for the van and telephoned the estate agent and they would have gone separately when they had first seen the cottage theyd each thought the village was a small corner of heaven a place of perfection for them but as luisa blackmore had said pulling on her coat before the start of their walk a place in heaven had to be earned it was a fine morning the sunshine played on the tiredness of her face and on his and on the brick walls of other cottages where the honeysuckle and the climbing roses were already budding the light shimmered off the neatness of lawns cut for the first time that year they went past the pub not yet open and the empty carpark and saw the landlord grunting as he manoeuvred beer kegs from the outbuilding to the main door the caretakers bicycle was leaning against the wall of the hall a young woman sat on the bench and read a book the shop was open the builder went by in his van the man who had told them about their damp problem and they had seen him the night before and he waved to them as if nothing had happened in the darkness they went on to the green towards the house all the time they walked on the road and on the green simon blackmore held his wifes hand on which there were no fingernails her coat cuffs hid her wrists and the old marks of razor slashes under her coat across her breast was a thick scarf and under the scarf and her blouse were the burn scars he supported her it was necessary to give her support because of the knee injury from long back they came to the front gate they were watched eyes stripsearching them by the policemen in the car at the front they were within the vision of the camera on the wall above the front door simon blackmore squeezed hard on his wifes hand and rang the bell they waited the cameras image would be watched the policemen in the car would be reporting he was middleaged and frail she limped and her face showed harmless exhaustion nothing about them was threatening the lock turned the policeman wore a bulletproof vest over his shirt and his hand hovered near to the pistol in his waist holster two bulging suitcases were in the hall behind him his expression cutting his eyes and mouth was of contemptuous hostility holding his wifes hand looking up at the policeman simon blackmore drew a deep breath he said we heard him speak last night we were in the crowd but not of it we havent met him were newcomers so he wont know us he said his wife would leave but that she had nowhere to go and that she would need to find an hotel we live at the far end of the village near to the church at rose cottage its only our third day here we have come to offer the lady and her child a place in our home a refuge surprise clouded the policemans face he told them to wait there on the step he came back a couple of minutes later after a hushed conversation inside and said theyd be visited and he told them that the perrys were grateful they walked home do you think shell come simon i dont know but for both our sakes i hope so the bird flew above him it glided with him as if escorting him vahid hossein moved very slowly through the reedbanks sometimes the bird would wheel and fly back past him and sometimes it would hover over him the wingbeat seemed stronger each time it flew in the depths of the marsh he went so carefully to be certain that he did not disturb the nesting birds when he waded the mud clogged up to his knees and he had to use his strength to drag himself forward through the reedstems when he swam the weight of the rocket launcher and the missiles on his back pushing him down he did so with great caution he was never in the open water he never broke the reedstems he sensed that a man watched for him when he rested exhausted from the mud and the weight of the launcher in the bag on his back he was relieved to realize that the bruised hip now caused him less difficulty in the cold of the water there was no pain and the restriction on his movement was less marked he was sufficiently fit to go forward to move against the target only when he was near to the shoreline when it circled over him did he talk softly to the bird he was in dense reeds and he moved them aside singly and he passed close to geese i wish you well friend and i regret that i did not find you at the jasmin canal or at the faw marshes or at the hauralhawizeh there were good birds there but they were not your equal i would have been grateful there friend for the comfort of your company as i am grateful here i will remember you vahid hossein did not believe it stupid or sentimental or childlike to talk to the bird will you remember me i think so you will not forget the man the soldier who cleaned your wound and fed you i believe that when you come back next year from wherever you go in the cold winter you will look for me in his exhaustion vahid hossein did not recognize the danger to him of rambling and incoherent thought he was weakened and hurt and he did not know it he dragged himself across the mud of the shoreline through the last of the reedstems he was still and gasped for breath goodbye friend look for me search do not forget me a sparrow flew away cheeping as he scrambled the few yards for the cover of the trees and undergrowth on fenn hill to meet farida yasmin they would shout his name in the streets when he was home he did not feel the exhaustion he had the love of the bird and believed himself supreme the great anchor chain rose from the sea the power of the huge engines edged the tanker away from the mooring buoys its cargo gone the deck of the tanker and the bridge were high above the water it would be a long climb they would have sailed two hours before but for the late arrival back on board of seven of his crew they had claimed they were lost ashore and the master had believed they smelt of womens bodies they always went with whores when allowed ashore and they were all good muslims and they brought back on board foul magazines that would be thrown into the sea when the tanker days later reached the straits of hormuz and the last leg for home they would make full speed twentyfour knots and be near to the port of rotterdam in the late evening where they would collect the pilot before sailing into the separation zone they would reach the waters off dungeness in the hour before dawn the next morning it was still possible for his instructions to be changed and for him to pick up the man under the cover of darkness lift him off the beach but it would be a long climb for the man if his orders were changed on a bucking ropeladder from the sea to the deck and safety farida yasmin sat on the bench and watched the muted life of the village pass her by she could see the green and the far end of the house today the police cars cruised more frequently on the one road she had been through the village twice gone to the sea twice and up to the church she hated those times when she was away from the bench when she could no longer see the end of the house but she thought it important to break any pattern she set she should not spend too long on the bench a woman with a brightly coloured coat had come and sat with her and had talked about the village she seemed lonely and bored sofar ida yasmin had smiled sweetly and fed the questions that had kept the woman talking the woman had been with her for an hour it was a valuable hour in the police cars going slowly by the men would have seen her listening earnestly and would have thought she belonged while the woman had talked looking at her with interest smiling laughing with her farida yasmin had been able to see the end of the house over the stupid bitchs shoulder she glanced too often at her watch time was passing she sat on the bench and she thought of the smooth skin of his body the discolouration of the bruising and she held her fingers against her lips because the fingers had touched his skin and hair and the bruising but she had nothing to tell him that would help him excuse me miss under his cap he had a dull pudgy middleaged face below his face was the top of the bulletproof vest against which he held his machinegun hello she made her voice calm pleasant the car was parked behind her and the driver watched them it was bright daylight and she had no weapon he was protected and armed can i ask what youre doing miss she grinned imperceptibly she opened her legs and she straightened her back to emphasize the fall of her chest what you wish you could be doing officer letting the rest of the world take the strain youve been here a long time miss doing nothing my good luck to have the time to do nothing a small rueful smile slipped his face hed have seen the shape of her thighs and the outline of her breasts as shed intended so what are you doing here she still grinned but her mind raced at flywheel speed it was the moment at which she was tested it came to her very fast and she clung to it she had no time to consider what she said she must follow her instind there might be an old photograph of her but she believed she looked sufficiently different im at nottingham university were doing a study on rural problems i chose here didnt i do well you dont seem if i might say so to have done much studying watch me tomorrow if youre still here officer you wont see me for dust whats your name miss im carol rogers geography at nottingham do you have identification miss rogers i dont actually i left everything like that where im staying in halesworth does it matter shed given the name of a popular girl a right bitch at the university the policeman could take her to the car and sit her in the back and radio through the details and wait for confirmation of her identity if carol rogers was still at the university going after a masters and was called from the library then farida yasmin had failed if she failed when the light shone into her face and the questions hammered her she might break as yusuf had broken her hand touched her breast she thought it was just routine that he was doing his job and was undecided dont you have anything driving licence cash card the voice boomed from the car come on duggie for christs sake he turned away and walked back to the car when they drove past he looked at her hard she bit her lip she wouldnt tell him that she had been questioned she thought of her future when he had gone anxiety about the future had gnawed increasingly at her through the day she would be hunted and looking over her shoulder always waiting for a policeman to ask her for identificahon but she could not leave the village not while she had nothing to tell him that would help him and then the pride flushed in her because she had come through the first test of her skill davies ended the call and he finished scribbling notes on his pad they were waiting on him the principal had his arm around his wifes shoulder davies said two officers in uniform went round to see them maybe they hit the door a bit hard but it took blackmore five minutes to get her to come out of the kitchen and talk to them they got it out of her eventually who she was and what had happened to her its not a pretty story control ran it through the computer theyre what they say they are i dont know whether its the right place for you or the wrong place we couldnt have you visit there frank nor you meryl come back here youd be a mile apart but it might as well be a hundred its your decision both of you youd stay there meryl until the conclusion i think were close to that hours from it but i dont know and i dont know whats afterwards i cant tell you how long is afterwards perry said listen afterwards ill go in my own time of course ill go but its not them the people here who decide when davies said quietly they check out he was british council in santiago capital city of chile first posting abroad for simon blackmore he would have been running a library at the embassy bringing out the odd slice of shakespeare chucking british culture around and finding a girlfriend it was late in the girlfriend was luisa himenez and she wasnt suitable for a young fellow from the british council not at all leftwing political the ambassador wouldnt have liked that one little bit in there was a military coup that deposed and killed the neocommunist president salvador allende then a roundup of sympathizers she went into the net shed have been screened first in that concentration camp they set up in the football stadium then faced the heavy stuff the interrogators probably we trained them we usually did gave her a hard time a hard time is an understatement blackmore would have badgered his ambassador for action and that would have been a waste of his time and then he went direct to amnesty international by his efforts she was adopted as a prisonerofconscience there are very few who get to that status and sometimes it can make a small difference the military were bombarded with letters it meant hassle for them for her it reduced the chance of the old oneliner died of medical complications without simon blackmores efforts she would have disappeared into an unmarked grave she was quietly released four years later when the government was whipping up interest in a trade fair before she received prisonerofconscience status the interrogators had tortured her no fingernails did you notice did you see her walk away limping they broke the ligaments in her right knee and surgery wasnt on offer there are slashes at her wrists attempted suicide when she thought she was going to break oh what we didnt see shes got burns on her breasts which they used as an ashtray the blackmores have experienced persecution and isolation which is why theyre offering a hand of friendship and they cant be frightened any more their understanding of living and suffering is different from what youve found here but meryl i cant tell you what to do go to them or go to a hotel they might be right for you they might be wrong its your decision he came to the hidingplace andy chalmers hadnt slept in the night nor in the day he could control tiredness had contempt for it and for hunger but he had biscuits in his pocket for the dogs in the night he had listened to the silence and in the day he had watched the flight of the bird to stay awake and keep alert he had chosen to concentrate his thoughts on the big birds of his home under the mountain slopes the bird he watched was half the size of the eagles pretty and interesting but without majesty if he had been home that day he would have gone to the eyrie on a crag face of ben more assynt scrambled on the scree then climbed and taken cut hazel branches from down beside the loch with him to repair the eyrie from the storm damage of the winter at first watching the bird in the early daylight andy chalmers was confused the bird hunted it dived on a young duck and carried it to the heart of the reedbeds he understood that he could see that the bird had no grace in its flight but was able to hunt it was recovering from injury could have been a strike against a pylons cables or a shotgun wound after it fed the bird circled one area at the heart of the reedbeds it was too immature without the width thickness in the wingspan to have a mate nesting below and at first he had been confused he watched that place he waited for some reaction from the other birds for the ducks to rise screaming or swans and geese to clatter for open water but he saw only the circling bird until the afternoon then a single curlew had flown startled from the place he watched it had taken him minutes to reiize that the bird was no longer over that same place and could not have stampeded the curlew in his mind he made a central point for the arcs the bird flew and that point changed moved gradually away if he had not been so tired andy chalmers would have understood sooner the central point for the arcs of flight neared the far shoreline of the marsh where the trees and scrub merged with the reeds he did not know why the curlew had crashed out of the reeds only that its flight had been a moment of luck and had alerted him there was a pattern here that he was struggling to understand at the limit of his vision he had seen a sparrow break cover from the scrub the bird no longer circled wheeled but climbed it was a distant speck when andy chalmers moved from his cover and went down into the mass of reeds he took the dogs with him would not be separated from them it was only when he reached the focus of the harriers arcs that he realized it was a hidingplace and as such it was well chosen many years before enough years for it to be before his birth the marsh waters had rotted a trees roots the tree had fallen the branches had decayed an empty oil drum had been driven by the winds and tides against the remaining branches and had wedged it was a refuge a safe place where the trunk peeped above the water was the stripped carcass of a duck and in the drum was the faint smell of a man the bird had shown him the place he could have passed within two yards of the trees trunk and the almost submerged drum and would not have seen the bidingplace he had the line the bird had given him the line to the shore wading through the mud and carrying his dogs swimming and having them paddle after him he found not a trace of the man he tracked he had followed men who had come on to the mountain to raid the eyrie nests and those men took precautions faced prison and had cause to be careful this man was better than any of them he had the point on the shoreline from which the sparrow had flown he had the marker at the edge of the reeds he lay still in the water and listened there was a tangle of bramble a few paces away he could smell him but couldnt see him the dogs were against his body with only their heads above the water he held his breath and waited he did not have a profile of the man could not be inside his mind to know how he would react and how he would move it was more interesting there was more unpredictability in tracking a human than a deer the tiredness had left him he lay in the water was fulfilled and listened the dogs would have told him if the man was close the dogs smelt him as andy chalmers did but knew he was no longer there he came out of the water and the dogs bounded forward splashing clear he found rabbits bones and the rear leg of a frog he knew the man had gone moved on meryl kissed him she had her coat on and she held her stephens hand there was another coat over her arm and four suitcases behind her davies was at the back perry couldnt read daviess face as meryl kissed him rankin was closer he tousled stephens hair and his machinegun flapped loosely on the webbing when he bent to pick up the childs football youll be all right ill be fine bills going to shop for you ill manage the bell rang you wont worry about us i wont im just so frightened at the third blast of the bell rankin peered into the spy hole then nodded to davies the key was turned the bolts drawn back davies watched them were they ready had they finished it hadnt been there before but perry saw compassion in rankins face and he noticed the sharp movements of daviess jaw as his teeth bit at his lip hard bastards and they were moved he had not been upstairs while she had packed he had not found the quiet corner in the house away from the microphones she kissed him one last time her boy wore a new england football shirt that paget and rankin had given to him god alone knew how theyd obtained it must have had a shop in the town opened up at dawn perry felt helpless as if the eyes the micrchones and the watchers ruled him he wanted it over her gone before he wept you should go meryl ill see you some time soon keep safe be careful dont forget ever our love dont time you were gone meryl he could hear the cars outside the engines starting up davies said calm voice dont stop mrs perry we believe that the area outside is secure but still dont stop the pavement time is the worst straight out and into the lead car theres no going back for anything keep moving directly to the lead car rankin pulled the door open davies hustled them forward past the two men who waited on the step they went at a charge perry saw his meryl go and stephen with the football pushed forward by davies towards the door of the lead car the two men came behind them with the suitcases and pitched them into the rear car rankin snapped the front door shut he didnt see them go didnt have the chance to wave he heard the slam of the doors and the roar of the engines the best thing for now is a fresh pot of tea he said she had taken a position beside the lavatories near the hall from there she had a view of the gable end of the house and a small part of the green the light was going hours ago farida yasmin had learned the patrol pattern of the unmarked cars and each time they came by she was behind the toilets and beyond their view she had hung on there because she had found out nothing that would help him she stretched her body hello my dear still here then the woman had come behind her on the path that led to the beach i was just going i cant remember what you said why you were here the woman would not have remembered because she had not been told farida yasmin explained pleasantly its a college project on the modern pressures affecting rural life it seemed an interesting place to come to im getting the feel of it then ill be looking to interview people i dont know what youll learn about us from our toilets she had her back to the green and the house she hadnt seen the cars come they swept past her she saw the child and a woman in the back seats of the lead car and a man who had his head turned away sat in the front there were cases in the second car piled high clearly visible in the rear window their headlights speared away into the early dusk the woman coughed deep in her throat drew up the spittle spat it out through her gaudy lips she murmured theyve gone damn good riddance farida yasmin shook the shock swept through her she watched the taillights disappear around the corner at speed now she had learned something but it was nothing that would help him she began to walk briskly from the toilets past the front of the hall the woman called after her come and see me when you start your interviews she had been cheated the bird hovered in the last of the afternoons watery sunshine then dived beating its wings it strutted close to him he saw the wound there was a tiny scrap of grease proof paper the sort used to wrap the meat his mother brought home from the butcher in lochinver and he found soaked muddied mince buried in grass where the bird had walked and pecked as if it had been tamed the bird came close to him the head keeper had a peregrine falcon in a cage behind the house and near to his caravan it had no fear of him because it had been fed by him since the day hed found the abandoned fledgling wounded by ravens andy chalmers had come out of the marsh stinking of it the bird trusted him other than the head keeper he knew of no man who would nurse an injured bird and win its trust the head keeper was one of the very few men that the taciturn and sullen andy chalmers had respect for the dogs picked up the scent they meandered either side of the path and crisscrossed over it without water to go into it was hard even for a skilled man not to leave a scent for dogs he let them lead through the wood he felt a sense of burgeoning regret the dogs burst from the wood and tracked at the side of a grazing field a cars lights illuminated the top of the hedgerows receding he went around the perimeter of the field he saw the tyre marks he could smell the man and the marsh the tyre marks were at the gate of a field on the verge of the lane he wanted to go home he had no hatred of a man who had nursed and fed a bird he wanted to be back with his mountains he called on the radio for markham to come and collect him and gave no explanation in the far distance silhouetted against the darkening sky was the shape of the church and the shimmer of the village lights it was not his place and not his quarrel he had no business there chapter seventeen you are certain its what i saw in the rear car was the heap of suitcases on the back seat and two men at the front in the lead car were a child looking out through the window a woman staring straight ahead a man with his head turned away and more men in the front she did not recognize she had not seen the child before but the woman had been there weeks earlier when she had come to photograph the house farida yasmin had been walking up the road through the village when the two cars had come back past her the same two men in the front of each but no passengers and no suitcases on the back seat of the second car she had walked on in the darkness there was a cottage with an overgrown garden and a sold sign over a forsale board short of the church on the other side of the road the curtains were loosely drawn on the windows facing the road but at the back of the house they were not pulled across and spilled light on to the garden the grass at the back ringed by untended flowerbeds was long and leafstrewn the shirt the child wore was bright red and there was a crest on the chest of rampant leopards and the logo sign of a vehicleinsurance company the same shirt she had seen him wearing in the car the child kicked the football round the grass he played on his own the hero and the star as soon as shed met him at the field gate shed told him what shed seen and now she repeated it in the car as shed blistered him with the information he had seemed no more willing to believe her than he did now the cars came back without him and his wife and the child it was done fast to deceive you in the darkness theyve moved him to make it easier for themselves cant you see it theyve made a trap and now they dont have the responsibility of protecting him when its sprung they want you at the house on the green they want to kill you there when they dont have the responsibility for him you are sure the doubt creased his voice she told him that she was sure she had seen the boy the child with the football on the lawn lit by the back windows of the cottage the trap was the house on the green where the guns waited for him they were beside the car in black darkness among the scrub of the common ground beyond the village it hurt her that she could not convince him dont you trust me you should without me on their terms you would walk into a trap trust me we are a partnership thats equal parts dont you see that she told him that he was nothing without her and he seemed to reel away from her she would go back walk through the village a last time come back and tell him what she had seen he squatted down holding the launcher in his hands as if it were a childs valued toy or a believers relic she told him how long she would be he had already gobbled down the sandwiches she had brought him he stank of the mud in the marsh and the still water farida yasmin walked back into the village there were lights on in the church throwing multicolours through the high windows and she could hear the organist practising over the hedge she saw the child boot the ball into the far darkness beyond the spill of the light and leap and whoop with pleasure as if he had found freedom she walked the length of the green she saw the cars outside the house and the same drawn curtains as had been there before she could see from the streetlight that the camera set high on the front wall of the house tracked her then lost interest its lens veering away it was enough she was certain she heard the rustle of a sweetpaper hello its the student yes my friend peggy told me about you hope i didnt startle you just walking the dog im paul im your man when you start your interviews she endured his patronizing talk as they went back past the green the darkened house and the lens through the village it was useful to have him beside her when she went by the lens when she was caught in the headlights of one of the moving cars walking with him gave her the appearance of being a part of the community she told the man paul that she would definitely find him when she came to do her interviews and he left her at the pub the child was no longer in the garden she saw the shape of a man through the gap in the curtains she cut off the road stumbled across the common ground wove between the gorse trees and bramble thickets to the car its as i said it was im certain after she had bought the sandwiches for him she had gone to a chemists in the town and selected a perfume before he had come to the field gate she had anointed her body with it i deserve to be trusted farida yasmin whispered he was still hunched down beside the wheel of the car holding the launcher he had not moved i want to be with you his eyes stayed down locked to the launcher and the ground at his feet ive done enough to deserve that i can help carry what you need youve taught me i want to be there when you fire the launcher i want to see it happen and be a part of it she was crouched close to him and her fingers touched the smooth oiled surface of the launchers barrel i can do it help you she saw his head move decisively side to side he denied her her eyes tightened in confusion havent you thought about me havent you considered what i want what about the risks ive taken wheres my future because of you because of the people who sent you ive lost everything im hunted youll go be picked up on the beach so whos thought about me ill be caught interrogated locked up is that what you want he never looked at her she caught his hand and held it tight in her fist there was no response are you going to take me back with you thats best isnt it that i go back with you to the beach and on to the ship thered be a life there for us back where you come from wouldnt there it was her dream they were together on the great deck of the tanker it was night and the stars were above them and they ploughed through the endless water and they were alone and the same perfume that she wore now would be on her neck then she would be introduced to high functionaries and her part in the death of an enemy would be explained and grave men would bob their heads in re sped and thank her for what she had done she could see the startled faces of her parents and the astonished dull faces of the girls at work when they learned the truth of what farida yasmin had achieved im finished here so you dont take me with you tonight i understand but i go on to the ship with you dont i in the darkness he began to clean the firing mechanism of the launcher by torchlight he had been shown the tyre marks geoff markham had been marched through the wood had blundered after the lightfooted shadow of andy chalmers in front tried to keep up with him and his dogs and had then been pushed without ceremony down on to his knees as the torch was shone into the cavity at the back of the bramble thicket he had queried it again rejecting what he didnt want to hear he had been dragged up pulled towards the water he capitulated and said it was all right yes he accepted chalmerss conclusion if he had queried again he would have been pulled in his city clothes into the water and hed have been propelled towards a treetrunk and a submerged oil drum there was a crunched sound under his feet the torch beam pointed out the stripped rabbit bones he stood on i just want reassurance there is no other explanation hes gone he had been lost he had driven round a web of lanes he had finally found chalmers sitting with his dogs by the gate of a field he had expressed his first doubts at the grunted report of the tracker then been hijacked and taken off into the woods he didnt want to believe what he was told because of the catastrophic implications of chalmerss assessment could he merely have moved deeper into the marshland no he said bitterly but we dont know where hes gone gone in the car could he be returning no gear left hides empty hes cleared out they walked back to his car it was the worst situation he would be on the secure line to fenton from the crisis centre to report that they had lost their man thered be the hissed slip of fentons breath and he would repeat that they had lost their man and then a volley of oaths would bleat in his ear he was familiar with analysis and intellectual storm sessions and with the computer spewing answers what he had been shown was a short length of tyre marks in the dirt at the side of a lane and by torchlight a hollowed place in the depth of a bramble thicket he took on trust the description of the hidingplace the torch had been switched off they came through the dense woodland and the low branches all seemed to whip his face and not chalmerss and where there was a soft pit in the ground his feet found it and not chalmerss with his scratched face and sodden feet he followed the smell and could not see the man ahead of him until they reached the car the stench of the man and the filth of the dogs filled the small interior the water dripped off chalmers and the mud on the dogs was smeared across the seats i want to go home too right markham snapped home you will go but not much of the journey in my bloody car he drove at savage speed down the lanes towards the main road and the town and the crisis centre they had lost him it would end at the house on the green where the bloody goat bleated at the end of its bloody tether he hit the brakes swung the car through the lanes bends pounded the accelerator beside him chalmers stinking and dripping slept do you like to talk about it no mrs perry i dont like to i dont want to pry i will say one thing to you only and then please it is a closed book it was over molotovs dont win against tanks we went back to our homes which was stupid i was denounced by people who lived in my street when the soldiers came i and others tried to flee over the roofs from my parents apartment we were identified by the people in our street when we were on the roofs they pointed the soldiers towards us they were the same people i had lived with played with as a child they were my friends and my parents friends and they showed us to the soldiers we saw what happened last night we heard what mr perry said thank you luisa thank you from the depths of my heart what i like to talk about is old furniture and gardening its a good time to get cuttings in meryl said id like to help you with that blake was long gone back to the house bill davies had dozed on his bed the room was in chaos blake always left it that way clothes on the floor towels on the bed davies was reminded and it hurt of the room his boys shared he still hadnt rung home couldnt face it he climbed off the bed and sluiced some of the tiredness out of his eyes at the basin hed call by at the house to collect his car then search for another dreary little pub to eat in he reflected that the home where meryl had been taken in was oftlimits but hed have preferred to have gone there talked to her shed kissed him when shed thanked him and had cried as hed held her awkwardly shed been so bloody soft and vulnerable too long since it had been like that with lily he changed his shirt couldnt go back to the house in a shirt with meryls lipstick on the collar he went down the stairs the door to their living room was half open he realized she had been waiting for him listening for his descent she came with a quick scurrying step out of her living room and he could see her husband in his chair by the fire and the poor bastard had some shame in his eyes she held the sheet of paper in her fingers he understood she handed him the account he didnt argue and didnt say that he had seen her standing in the shadows behind the mob he took the banknotes from his pocket and paid her for his bed and for blakes he went back up the stairs and packed their bags she was waiting by the door she said its not my fault im not to blame we need the money we wouldnt be doing anything like bedandbreakfast unless we had to it was lloyds that took us down we were names you know what my husband had set aside for retirement went to lloyds we cant exist without the money ive nothing against those people the perrys but we have to live itll be remembered long after youve gone that we put a roof over your head it wont be forgotten im only trying to limit the damage to our business a man like you an educated man im sure you understand the door closed behind him he carried the bags down the carefully raked gravel drive he stopped in the road saw the light peeping from the curtains where she was then turned and walked towards the village and the green he was called on the radio and was told the stalkers report the man had moved was lost he started to run he pounded down the road towards the house there was the slight scent of damp in the air as meryl unpacked in the small bedroom she took from the suitcase only what she would need for that night and what stephen needed simon blackmore came up quietly behind her she was tortured what they did to her was unspeakable amnesty international members from all over the world bombarded the dictatorship with letters demanding her freedom but above all it was her own courage that saved her life and her determination to come back to me you make me feel small and my own problems minuscule inevitable i suppose but already i regret leaving frank i dont think it appropriate that we start a seminar on mans inhumanity but its necessary that you understand us we all have our own opinions and thank god our own consciences to drive us enough of that now meryl smile please she did her first in six days im going to talk to luisa about antiques and gardening theres places round here where you can still get a good old table or a chest at a real knockdown price and ill talk about wine and downstairs there is a bottle open and waiting so youve lost him cox was hurrying and for once ignored his habits didnt go to his office first to shed his coat smooth his hair and straighten his tie straight to the central desk in the work area he had been called from dinner bloody marvelous what else have you got he was the man in charge and he threw the responsibility of failure at his subordinates thought there were a few things i could rely on wrong again thought i could rely on you not to lose him fenton who had already ladled abuse at his own subordinate markham squirmed parker kept her head down the others at the table whitefaced avoided coxs eyes except for duane littelbaum who eased his shoes off the table and laid down his cocacola can his advantage is small and temporary only littelbaum murmured he has to come to the house if hes moved hell come tonight you should relax we all get scared when its out of our hands youre not unique cox glanced at him savagely whats he got fenton dived for the book on the table as if it were his saviour what we think from the questioning of yusuf khan its probably an rpg rocket antitank grenade launcher if the indications from that bedside conversation are correct then he has a weapon with a maximum effective range of three hundred metres particularly useful at night the old warhorse from b branch snatched the book from fenton it has an internally lit optical sight for night shooting or might have the passive starlight scope against tanks even a deflection shot itll put a five centimetre hole through around twentyfive centimetres of armourplate at a hundred metres it cannot miss cathy parker leaned over the warhorses shoulder it can penetrate at least twenty centimetres of sandbags fifty centimetres of reinforced concrete and not that it applies well over a hundred centimetres of earth and log bunker christ cox shuddered littelbaum smiled and swung his feet back on to the table but it has a signature flash and smoke discharge its best if he fires then you locate him and you go get him if theres anyone left alive afterwards to get him cox left them in their silence kicked open his office door and threw his coat on to the floor itll be tonight hell come tonight frank perry looked away from davies he sat on the floor his body weight against the bottom of the door ask a bloody stupid question and get a bloody unwanted answer there was a small rightangled space between the hall and the kitchen door protected by interior walls the question why had davies gone upstairs and dragged the double mattress off the spare bed and the single mattress off stephens bed and wedged them on their sides against the two interior walls and made an igloo between the hall and the kitchen door why he sat and cradled a tumbler of whisky no water he could have asked blake and paget as they heaved in the sandbags theyd filled the sand and the empty bags had come an hour earlier there had been a sharp exchange at the front gate because the delivery driver had dumped the sand and said it wasnt on his work docket to stay and help fill the bags perry sat with the weight of the vest on his shoulders davies was inserting a chair into the igloo space a hard chair from the dining room pushing its seat against the kitchen door and then he draped the ballistic blanket over its back the sandbags were already in place at the hall end of the igloo he drank the whisky which burned in his throat and upper stomach the third one that blake had poured him he thought pretty soon he should go and piss it was better that she had gone with stephen he could sense the change in the mens mood like theyd cleared their decks while davies built the igloo blake was checking the weapons and hed cleared all the rounds out of the machinegun magazines then loaded them again there was a box on the carpet beside his feet with the big red cross on it and hed been asked again for his blood group hed given it to them a week ago but theyd said they were just checking and hed heard them talking hospitals with meryl and stephen gone what had changed he thought was that they no longer had the responsibility for the protection of a human being frank perry was an item he was baggage protected because of its symbolic value he gulped the whisky paget and rankin were in the hall they were going off duty the new shift was in the hut what he didnt understand was that they seemed neither pleased to be going off duty nor reluctant to leave by the time they were at the door paget and rankin were already muttering about the different brands of thermal socks davies said hes moved we dont know where he is or where hes coming from would you please mr perry go quickly to the lavatory then settle into the proteded space because hes moved we think hell hit tonight perry downed the drink stood and slurred his laugh bit overdoing it yes bit over the top yes for one man with a rifle we dont think its a rifle mr perry we think itll be an antitank armourpiercing rocket launcher ask a bloody stupid question he used the cover of the stones of the churchyard those that were beyond the throw of the coloured lights from the church itself valiid hossein had the weapon tilted against his shoulder and the barrel with the twokilogram projectile loaded gouged into his flesh from the churchyard he could watch the lights of cars on the road it was important to him to find the pattern they made the slowmoving patrols of security men would be the same here as outside the bases of the americans in riyadh or jeddah patrols were always predictable it was what they did the slow cars came by going into the village and out of it every nine minutes with only a few seconds difference in each journey from the churchyard he slipped over a wall and into a garden he crossed that garden and two more often at the abyek camp he had practicefired the rpg and it was simple and effective he had fired it in the faw marshes when the iraqis had counterattacked against the bridgehead with armoured personnel carriers and the t amphibious capability tanks he knew well what it could do he moved across two more gardens he would have preferred to be close so that the target man could see the blade or the barrel it was better when they saw it and the fear flitted over their faces then he felt the excitement in his groin vahid hossein was in another garden crouched and still a door opened and a dog trotted out into the pool of light it approached the edge of the light and yapped but was frightened to move into the darkness the rain began again a man stood in the door and shouted for the dog which knew he was there its courage grew because the man was behind it it was a small dog and it bounced with the ferocity of its barking if the man came close he would kill him a blow to the neck if the dog came he would throttle it he would not be stopped the rain pattered on him the man strode towards the dog towards the place where he crouched lifted it up smacked it and carried it back into the house he moved again she had given him the exact description of the house on the far side of the road into which the target had been moved a drink meryl she shivered stephen was upstairs in the room allocated to him and had said it was a dump shed pulled his lorries out of the case and scattered them on the floor for him on the bare boards that would be nice she grimaced at the cold air the window was ajar behind the curtains and the wind rippled them red or white theyre both from the rhone valley cave de tain lhermitage its only a little place but theyve been making wine there since the days of the romans were very fond of it i think the lovely thing about the study of wine is that one is never an expert always learning thats a good maxim for life whichll it be red please to put some life into me shall do im sorry about the window but luisa likes windows to be open so that she feels the wind she cant abide to be closed in you understand of course she hadnt noticed it before but he wore a thick jacket over a crewnecked sweater she looked at the grate saw old ash and clinker simon blackmore would have seen her glance at the fireplace sorry we havent got round to cleaning it yet but we dont have fires luisa cannot abide lit fires they burned her with cigarettes but some of her friends were branded with a poker from a brazier ill get a sweater no no dont he played the gentleman took off his jacket and draped it on her shoulders then poured her wine she was quite touched it was ridiculous but sweet shed ring frank later and tell him and if when she telephoned she could not be overheard shed tell him they were daft but lovely and they lived in a freezer he said apologetically that he ought to be in the kitchen helping would she excuse him if he left her alone let me do that help luisa absolutely not youre our guest and need a spot of pampering there were two bookshelves in the room she went past the window and crouched to look at the books he had the launcher on his shoulder and his finger on the guard he was down among a mass of garden shrubs beyond the hedge and the road was the cottage he had seen the targets shadow against the moving curtain then the coat of the man between the gap in the curtains then the shadow he had the sights set to fortyfive metres the car came past dawdling its lights brightening the hedge in front of him he was not concerned with other cars only with the cars that carried the guns and cruised slowly the darkness came back to the road and he made his last checks paget said what i always say you get what you pay for rankin said fair enough what you pay for but if you want the proper gear then by god youve got to pay they were on their way back to their lodgings in the town after the end of their twelvehour shift behind them in the barricaded and guarded house the principal was someone elses headache for twelve hours they were free of it when were out in the bloody boat this weekend i want to be warm then its gonna cost you daylight robbery as bloody usual as you said joe you get what you pay the flash of bright light exploded from behind the hedge on the far side of the road it illuminated the dead hedge leaves an old holly tree and the trunk of an oak across the road brilliant in colour came a line of shining gold thread going arrowstraight in front of the cars windscreen the flash came and the thread unravelled in a split moment of silence the threadline crossed the road cleared the opposite low wall and a small garden and went straight into a downstairs window it was almost in petrifyingly slow motion the blast from the flash fire behind the hedge hammered into the car as joe paget braked and with it was the whistle shriek of the gold threads passing the thunder of the detonation pierced dave rankins ears and he froze there was a blackness in his mind and he could feel the air stripped from his lungs this was not lippitts hill nor hogans alley nor any bloody range theyd ever been on not any exercise the wheels had locked when paget had braked and his sight was gone they were slewed across the road and dave rankins ears were dead from the blast sound paget gasped its where she is rankin bawled get there get there to it where she is paget had stalled the motor rankin was swearing at his window electric the pace at which it came down the engine was coughing back to life rankin had the glock off his belt paget had the car swerving back on to the centre of the road fucking get there joe paget put the car back into gear and rankins head jerked forward and slapped the dash paget accelerated they were coming towards the house there was just smoke billowing from the front window of the house from the black hole where the window had been and curtain shreds and silence the reflex for rankin was to get out of the car help make the area secure radio in he had the door half open when he was thrown back in his seat as paget hit the pedal look for fucks sake dave look pagets free hand off the wheel reached out and caught rankins coat front loosed it and pointed it was a moment before rankin comprehended then he saw him there was a high wall of old weathered brick that kept him on the road the headlights caught him he was running with an awkward fast stride towards the end of the high wall and the graveyard beyond the headlights trapped him he was in army fatigues but the mud on them blocked out the patterns of the camouflage as he ran he twisted his head to look behind him the lights would have been in his eyes blinding him and he ran on the car closed on him rankin had his head and his shoulders his arm out of the passenger side window the wrong side window he tried to aim but couldnt hold steady the glock was a closequarters weapon practice on the range with the glock was at never more than twentyfive metres the heckler amp koch that hed carried all day that he would have given his right ball for would have done the job perfectly but was back in the wendy hut with the relief brake joe and give me some goddamn light the braking bloody near cut him in two his back thudded against the doorframe rankin went out through the window fastest way and tumbled on the tarmac the breath was squeezed out of his body he dragged himself up winded and so bloody confused paget spun the wheel the headlights hit the man as he straddled the graveyards boundary wall rankin was down low kneeling and saw him the lights threw huge shadows off the stones he was at fifteen paces and going fast but the headlights held him they didnt practise it at the range but he knew what to do rankins fists were locked together on the butt on the glock and he punched his arms out and made the isosceles he tried to control his breathing to hold the aim steady his finger was on the trigger thirty metres going on thirtyfive he took the big deep breath to steady himself forty metres going towards the shadows thrown off the stones he aimed at the back of the running man into the middle of the spine and squeezed hard on the trigger the running man was between a cross and the shadowy form of an angel stone he fired again the crack belted his ears he saw the back of the running man as it dropped double tap rankin shouted i got him i fucking got him joe the engine was left running bloody good dave had him i dropped him paget went over the wall and right towards the church porch rankin covered him heard the shout scrambled over and circled to the left it was what they had endlessly practised both of them at lippitts hill until it was routine and boring two guns never presenting a target and closing for a kill one going forward the other covering the other going forward and one covering they closed on the gap space between the cross and the angel there was a dark place a little beyond where the shadows of the two stones merged and beyond it there was clear lit ground they stalked the space sprinting between the stones freezing and aiming calling the moves to each other you ready dave ready joe rankins aim was into the shadows he was behind the cross paget reached up with his torch from behind the cover of the angel the torch beam wavered through the shadow and fell on the grass there was no body on the grass no corpse and no wounded man the beam moved over the grass and there was no weapon discarded there no blood i thought i saw him go down you thought wrong dave after fifteen bloody years sixteen years actually dave you waited sixteen years and then you fucked up dave rankin knelt on the grass where there was no body no blood no weapon and he shook as a pair they were laidback private superior bastards they always did well on the range and never had to be sent for a coffee and a smoke to calm themselves before trying again to get the necessary score to pass the reappraisal they were the best they were the ones the instructors pointed out to the recruit marksmen sixteen years of practice and sixteen years of training no body no blood no weapon he knelt on the damp grass and the energy seemed to drain out of him he hung his head until paget pulled him roughly to his feet in this life dave you get what you pay for they didnt pay much i would have sworn id hit him theres no blood dave they got us the noise of the explosion had careered around the village it pierced the doors and windows of the houses the cottages bungalows and villas where the televisions blared the argument of the evenings dramas it split into kitchens and dissolved desultory meal conversations it hammered into the talk in the bar and silenced them there it startled a man with a dog on the road a woman who was in the back of her garden filling a coal bucket a man who worked at a lathe on the bench in his garage and a couple making love in the flat above a shop the blast sounded in the houses gardens and lanes of the village and in the barricaded house it murmured its way into the safe area between the mattresses past the filled sandbags and blake swore softly davies dropped his hand on to frank perrys shoulder and there was silence then the radio started screaming for them nobody in the village moved quickly to leave the protection of their homes there had been the noise then the silence then the howling of the sirens only after the sirens had come and the quiet had descended again did the villagers gather their coats wrap themselves in warmth and come out of their homes to go to look and to gawp the rain had come on heavily eventually they came from their corners of the village their shuffled steps muted huddled under umbrellas the first of them reached the house lit by arclamps as the ambulance pulled away they gathered to watch he came back she had heard the explosion and had rejoiced he could not have done it without her now she would persuade him vahid hossein came as a shadow out of the darkness to the car to her she tried to take him in her arms to hold him and kiss him but he flinched away he gripped the launcher to his chest and rocked then he slid down against the wheel arch of the car there should have been triumph but his eyes were far away whats the matter you got him didnt you what happened there he never replied to her farida yasmin stormed away from him she blundered across the common ground towards the lights of the village the rain sheeted down on to her she backed off the road as a police car came past her with its siren wailing splashing the puddled rainwater on to her thighs and waist she had heard the clamour of the explosion and clenched her fists and believed she was a part of it she saw the crowd ahead of her in front of the cottage home she had identified for him she joined the back of the crowd she came behind them and watched as they stared ahead heard their whispered voices she was not noticed the rain fell on her hair and her face the crowd was held back by policemen but she could still see the blackened walls of the room through the gaping window the arclights showed her the firemen picking through the room she listened they say its a gas explosion thats daft theres no sodding gas she was behind them they were not aware of her was it the new people it was the perry woman not the new people was it meryl perry just her wheres he wheres perry never came it was just meryl who came thats rough i mean it wasnt anything to do with her was it frank was in his house with his guards it was meryl the stupid bastards got the wrong place the wrong person she slipped away she left as she had come unseen she walked back the rain clattering on her she felt small weak emergency traffic passed her and ignored her as she cowered at the side of the road she was little and unimportant she had thought that night beside the car as the sound of the explosion had burst in her ears that she would love him that she would be rewarded because he could not have done it without her and he would take her with him and she would be at last a person of consequence she stumbled across the ground went between the thicket and gorse clumps splashed in the rain puddles she was gladys eva jones she was an insurance clerk she was a failure she was sobbing as she had sobbed when her mother had carved criticism at her and her father had cursed her as when the kids at school had ostracized her and the kids at college had turned their backs on her she saw the outline of the car and the rain spilling from the roof on to his shoulders he had not moved it was the wrong person he was never there it was his woman his hand came up and grasped at her wrist he did not need her his strength pulled her down they were not a partnership and there was nothing to share she was on the ground in the mud she would never know love his hands prised at her clothes the knee drove between her legs and she felt the rain beat on the exposed skin of her stomach i want to see her it was an hour since the explosion and the first scream on the radio and for most of that hour no one had told him they had kept him in the area inside the mattresses and the sandbags and theyd filled his glass a man had come in a crisp uniform rank badges on his shoulder and had used the soft language that they taught on courses for handling the bereaved and then gone as soon as was half decent damn you i want to see her listen blakes chin shook want away but you cant perry shouted ive the right davies said calmly you cant see her mr perry because there is nothing to see that you would recognize most of what you would recognize mr perry is on the wallpaper or on the ceiling it was your decision mr perry to stay and this is the consequence of that decision better you face that than keep shouting get a grip on yourself it was as if davies had slapped him he understood the slap on the face was to control the hysteria he nodded and was silent paget came in through the front followed by rankin who had his arm round stephens shoulder the child was whitefaced his mouth gaping the child sleepwalked across the hall slowly and rankin loosed his supporting arm and let him collapse against perry he held the boy hard against him and thought about consequences he saw the stern faces around him and there was no criticism there was nothing if the child had cried or kicked or fought against him it would have been easier but stephen was limp in his arms he heard rankin say i thought i had him dont understand thought i saw him go down he heard paget say hes like a dripping tap he missed and the daft tart cant accept that he missed with a double tap the woman screamed they were on the ground in front of her in the epic entre of her torch beam she shrieked for her dogs and ran she walked her dogs each evening before going to bed summer and winter moonlight or rain policemen from an unmarked car ran towards the screams it was several minutes before they could get a coherent statement from the panting shouting woman of what she had seen black toby his ghost his woman black toby with her what he did to be hanged its where they hanged him hanged black toby they went forward with the spotlamps her trailing behind them and her dogs skipping ahead in the darkness chapter eighteen e was hunched forward peering into the misted windscreen chalmers was beside him with the dogs under his legs they didnt speak geoff markham wrenched the car round the bends in the lanes back towards the village and the sea once more he had listened to fenton on the telephone and been too drained of emotion to take offence at the rambling cursing diatribe thrown at him hed just finished at the borrowed typewriter had just sealed the envelope when the first news of disaster had broken and hed been in the crisis centre trying to make sense from the confusion of the reports when the second package of news had come over the radio hed collected chalmers from the canteen the envelope with the letter in it was jammed in his pocket like a reproach dear sirs i am in receipt of your letter setting out your proposals for terms of employment i have changed my mind and am no longer seeking work away from the security service i apologize for wasting your time and am grateful for the courtesies shown me obligations commitments duty foldfashioned words used by wririlded fartsl seem to have overwhelmed me im sorry if you find this difficult to understand sincerely he felt sick small i want to go home markhams eyes never left the road after two catastrophic news reports and after the battering from fenton he needed a butt for his anger and a chance to purge the guilt welling in him chalmers was available markham snarled when the works finished you go home not a day or an hour or a minute before we made a mistake we could have made the same mistake if the target had been in a tower block of a housing estate in a good suburb anywhere but we did it in a village like this at the back end of bloody nowhere we made a mistake by thinking it was the right thing to move his wife out get rid of her to clear the arcs of fire we lost her losing her is damn near the same to me as losing him it was convenient to ship her out so we took that road its crashing down around us its disaster listen hard if you say that its not your quarrel then youre just like them you are an imitation of those people in that village they are moral dwarfs it was not their quarrel so they turned their backs and walked away crossed over to the other side of the bloody street you arent original its what weve heard for the last week so find another tune youre staying till i say you can go i thought better of you but i must have been wrong ive no quarrel with him geoff markham mimicked no quarrel want to go home forget it let me tell you i considered taking you down to the hospital morgue i could have walked you in there filthy little creature that you are with those bloody dogs and i could have told the attendant to pull the tray out of the refrigerated cupboard and i could have shown her to you but i couldnt have shown you her face you arent going to the morgue because i cannot show you meryl perrys face it doesnt exist thats why we arent going there down the lanes towards the village we all want to cross over the road and look the other way dont worry about it youre not alone i understand you because and im ashamed ive said it myself i went after different work outside what i do now crossing the road for me was sneaking out of the office in the lunchhour and going for a job interview looking the other way was listening to my fiance and hunting for a cash increase im ashamed of myself i wrote a letter tonight mr chalmers and the price of the letter is my fiancee and what ive learned since i came here is that i and you cannot walk away from what has to be done as they approached the village the clock on the church tower was striking midnight its chimes muffled in the rainstorm to the left were the pigsheds in the field to the right was the common ground of scrub and gorse and in front of them was a policeman waving them down markham showed his card and a rain soaked arm pointed to a pool of arclights the dogs ran free and they walked towards it the wind brought the rain into their faces why cant you believe you have a quarrel with this man hes done me no harm theres a woman damn you with no head he saved the bird what bloody bird hes done the bird good he thought chalmers struggled to articulate a deep feeling but markham hadnt the patience to understand him youre talking complete crap the blow came without warning out of the darkness a shortarm punch closed fist caught markham on the side of the face he staggered he was slipping going down into the mud a second stabbed punch caught the point of his chin the pain smarted in his face he saw men hustle forward the rain peeling off their bodies they were grotesque shadows trapping chalmers swarming around him as his dogs fought at their an ides their boots and were kicked away show him show him what the bastard did he doesnt think its his business so show him they dragged chalmers forward markham heard a squeal of pain thought chalmers had bitten one of them and he saw the swing of a truncheon there was a tent of plastic sheeting inside it the light was brilliant and relentless he saw her get him up close get him to see what the bastard did she was on her back geoff markham had to force himself to look her jeans were dragged down dirtied and wet to her knees and her legs had been forced wide apart her coat was ripped open a sweater had been pushed up and a blouse was torn aside he could see the dark shape of her hair but little of the whiteness of her stomach above it the skin was bloodsmeared bloodstained bloodspattered her mouth gaped open and her eyes were big frozen in fear he knew her there was the old photograph of her in the files of rainbow gold the eyes had been small and the mouth had been closed she had held her privacy and worn the clothes of her faith looking past the policemen and over andy chalmerss shoulders he stared down at the body he had seen the bodies of men in ireland and theyd had the gaping mouths and the open eyes and the fear that remained after death he had never before seen the body of a raped violated woman before they had built the plastic tent the rain had made streams of blood on the skin except for cathy parker and her report relayed to him that morning they had all lost sight of gladys eva jones the loser and now he saw her except for cathy parker and then it had been too late they had all ignored her because they had rated this young woman from a small provincial city as irrelevant in matters of importance not worthy of consideration he saw in his mind the photograph of the face of vahid hossein and the cold certainty that it held chalmers said nothing markham stammered god the bastard a frenzy he must be a bloody animal to do that a man in a white overall suit looked up coldly from beside the body and said clinically thats not a frenzy she was strangled the cause of death is manual asphyxiation thats not her blood shes not a cut on her its his what does that mean it means that the animal is severely wounded knife or gunshot there is evidence of sexual penetration probably simultaneous with her being strangled during the sexual act during the exertion of manual strangulation he bled on her markham turned away he said to no one to the mass of grimfaced men behind him so theres a blood trail so the dogs v will have him a voice from the darkness said theres no blood trail and theres no scent if you hadnt noticed its raining in pissing rain theres no chance markham gestured for them to loose their hold on chalmers and walked away chalmers was behind him he groped back towards the car and the road for the rest of his life he would never lose the sight of gladys eva jones he stumbled and slithered in the darkness the letter in his pocket would be soaked and the envelope sodden will you please mr chalmers please go out and find him are you going or are you staying staying frank perry lay on the floor between the mattresses and behind the sandbags stephen slept against him his head was in the crook of his stepfathers arm so be it are you criticizing me i just do my job criticizing isnt a part of it ive some calls to make davies had towered over him what happened to the people who took meryl in mr and mrs blackmore are unhurt they wont leave what remains of their house and theyre staying put grimly he turned away and disappeared among the shadows of men whose names frank perry hadnt been told perry closed his eyes but knew he would not sleep he could hear davies on the telephone it would be easier if any of them had criticized him the brigadier took the call which woke him from a light sleep on the campbed in his office the voice was very faint the brigadier shouted his questions but the answers were vague and there was breakup on the line in his frustration he shouted louder and his voice rippled from the office room down the deserted corridors and into empty darkened rooms he heard the muffled voice of the man whom he had trusted like a son and barked out questions had he succeeded was he clear could he make the rendezvous point on the channel beach how many hours would it be before dawn what was his location had he succeeded the call was terminated the pad of paper on which he would have written the answers to his questions was blank he played back the tape and heard the insisting shout of his questions and the indistinct answers in the background competing with the answers he could not understand was the splash of water the cold of the night was around him he thought of a beach in the black night where the seas waves rippled on the shinglestone shore where vahid hossein was hurt and waiting in his mind was the death that would follow his failure he weighed the options of survival his own survival the hush of the night was around him and moths flew distracted at the ceiling light above him he rang the nightduty officer at the offices of the national iranian tanker corporation across the city and he spoke the coded message twice in the minutes that followed the brigadier called the number of the mobile digital telephone and there was no response he was alone surrounded by darkness frank perry heard the approach of the lorry and then its engine was cut he heard the voices and the clatter of iron bars being thrown down as if dropped from the lorrys flat bed he was thankful a small mercy that the child slept and did not criticize him the people of the village slept with guilt and with self justification with doubts and with resentment or stared at their dark ceilings there were few who had not walked up the road and along the lanes and gone to look at the cottage home when it was floodlit by the generators most had seen the wide hole where a window had been and the torn curtains that fringed it and some even the long bag of zipped black plastic carried away to the closed van and the uncomprehending eyes of a child escorted from the building by the policemen in their vests and carrying their guns no one believed the bland explanation of a gas explosion none had cared to examine their part in what they had seen heard with their friends and their families they had gone home when the show was over and they had darkened the village made it silent switched off their house lights crept to their beds in a few short hours it would be the start of another day and there were not many for whom their lives would be the same the rain over the village had gone as fast as it had come leaving the moon to pour bright white light into the homes where they lay whats that what the hells happening frank perry was careful not to wake stephen he eased himself into a halfsitting position but did not shift his arm against which the child slept there was the noise of sledgehammers beating against metal at the front of the house and the back davies was cold without emotion you said you were staying thats what i said so its because youre staying what is it what is it thats happening we call it a blindicide screen its old army talk in aden thirty years back the opposition had a swedishmade antitank rocket that was used against fixed positions it detonates the boring charge early why you should sleep itll keep till the morning you know what the bastard let me sleep joe bloody paget let me sleep didnt wake me to tell me i bloody knew but there wasnt a body and there wasnt any blood and the bastard said id missed joe bloody paget youre a miserable sod joe you know what you are not just a miserable sod a mean fucker perry half listening dozed with stephens warmth against him letting me sleep when you bloody knew id hit him thats below the bloody belt how long have you known you bastard that i got the shite he could feel stephens slight spare bones for a moment he had thought he lay against meryls warmth he shuddered the mornings light seeped into the house through drawn curtains and reached into the safe area between the mattresses and the sandbags rankin was cocky bouncing paget was behind him with a slow grin spreading the assembled company didnt see him he thought he did not matter to them any more he heard the lorry drive away i mean telling me id missed when i knew id hit that is a professional slur joe if i say so myself forty metres minimum and no light a moving target that is one hell of a shot what is it joe come on i want to hear you bloody well say it they were all laughing blake and davies had been up all night but paget and rankin had dossed down on the kitchen floor to catch a few hours sleep perry asked quietly if he was hit why do we need the blindicide screen he had interrupted them they turned to look down at him and the sleeping child they were the only friends he had and none of them cared a damn for him they were strangers davies said his name is vahid hossein he fired a single grenade from the launcher theres a flash at the front and a flame signature at the back mr paget and mr rankin were going off their duty shift they engaged him he ran into the churchyard mr rankin was presented with a difficult shooting opportunity he took it fired twice but with a handgun at the limit of its effective range there was no blood and nobody mr paget assumed that mr rankin had missed his target thats phase one later a woman walking her dogs on the common starts bawling about black toby god knows what shes doing out with dogs in the middle of a deluge she says she saw a lifeless woman and a blackfaced man on the ground shes going on about some nonsense that happened two hundred years ago police officers went to the scene and found a young woman raped and dead but no man the young woman was a muslim convert and the eyes ears fetcher and carrier for vahid hossein she was covered in blood but it wasnt hers the man who raped her while he strangled her bled on her from his gunshot wound mr paget and mr rankin use softnose bullets in the glock and that is phase two phase three is incomplete he is wounded mr perry but he is not dead although hed lost considerable quantities of blood he was strong enough to leave the murder scene he is out there in pain and still in possession of the rpg launcher the rain in the night has washed away the chances of tracker dogs finding him he did not take the converts car we do not believe he has tried to leave an hour ago an inflatable was launched from an iranian tanker in the channel and came to a rendezvous on a beach he was not there to be lifted out we had it under surveillance but took no action thus we believe hes still here the military are beginning a search for him now we classify vahid hossein as more dangerous than at any time you mr perry are the cause of his pain his suffering if he has the strength in our assessment he will make a last attack on your home that mr perry is the reason for puffing up the screen around the house that will prematurely detonate we hope an armourpiercing grenade and is that why you were laughing the wind swept the cloud away leaving the sun balanced precariously on the seas horizon geoff markham thought the young man tolerated his presence on the bench overlooking southmarsh they had dossed down in the car he had woken at the first smear of light but chalmers had slept on curled in the back seat with his dogs a babys peace on his face only when hed woken had the sourness replaced the peace once it had been light enough to see the village the expanse of the green and the high iron poles in front of the house with the close wire mesh netting hanging from them he had eased out of the car chalmers hadnt spoken hadnt given any explanation but had called for his dogs and emptied out the last of the biscuits from his pocket for them he hadnt said where he was going or what he intended but he had walked away with the dogs scampering at his feet geoff markham not knowing what else he could do had heaved himself out of the seat locked the car had stretched coughed scratched then went after him his shoes sloshed with water his socks were wringing wet and his shirt and coat had not dried out in the night the letter was damp in his pocket the wind was sharp off the sea raw on his face a coastal cargo ship nestled on the seas horizon line the birds were up over the beach and over the marsh he was cold damp and his stomach growled for food where did the arrogance come from the belief that his small efforts had changed the movement of events he wanted to be in bed warmed close to vicky and ordinary without responsibility free from the consequences of his actions if he posted the letter he would have none of the things he thought he wanted he slogged on it would be the supreme moment of conceit if he posted the letter it would be the statement of his belief that he changed events he found chalmers sitting very still on the bench and the dogs were beside him chalmers never looking at the sea wouldnt have seen the coastal cargo ship he was watching the southmarsh what disturbed markham most about him was that the young man seemed merely to tolerate him and feel no need for his company the bench was where geoff markham had met dominic evans the shopkeeper it was set high enough for him to overlook the sea the beach the sea wall and the marshland where the reedtips whipped in the wind the sun throwing low light shafts made it pretty his mother would have liked it there and his father would have taken a photograph eight of them materialized in single file along the path behind the bench where markham and chalmers sat in silence buried under the weight of their equipment they marched past the bench and briskly down towards the trees that shielded the shoreline of the marsh from his view it would have been settled after the death of meryl perry the secretary of state would have bowed to irresistible pressures and taken the control out of poor old fentons hands the military would have stepped eagerly into the void he knew the men or at least the unit from ireland he knew the kit they carried and the weapons he had seen the troopers from the regiment slip away at dusk from bessbrook mill and the fortress at crossmaglen seen them run towards the threshing blades of the helicopters on the pads in the barracks at dungannon and newtown hamilton they were the quiet men who seldom spoke who waited and nursed their mugs of tea and rolled their smokes and moved when the darkness came or the helicopters started up the rotors markham watched the column snake down the path towards the southrnarsh and the black water where the wildfowl bobbed in the low suns light two carried the parker hale sniper rifles one had the snub mm antiarmour launcher another cradled a generalpurpose machinegun and was swathed with belt ammunition across his torso one had the radio the stun grenades and the gas grenades three went easily with their armalite rifles held loosely they didnt look at him nor at chalmers and his dogs geoff thought it was the moment that his relevance and coxs and fentons ended their faces and hands were blacked up sprigs of foliage were woven into their clothes it was as if he thought in bitterness the job was taken from boys and given to men he looked obliquely at chalmers beside him and the very calm of his face abetted the bitterness control had gone to the guns of the killing team everything he had done was set at nothing snatched from him by the men with guns who went down into the marshland and the reedbeds the last one had slipped from his sight thats it were wasting our bloody time he said savagely chalmers remained impassive silent time we were gone time if you know how to use one for a bloody bath chalmers sat on the bench and his eyes searched the clear gold blue of the skies over the marshes sending you was ridiculous a humiliation for the service they should have been put in twentyfour hours ago theyre the professionals theyre the bloody killers theyll find him he stood up chalmers squinted at a point high above the reedbeds they wont find him his head never moved his gaze never shifted enlighten me on what is that stunning insight based they wont find him because he isnt here chalmers spoke from the side of his mouth his head was stock still and he peered into the lightening sky he isnt here not here then excuse me please tell me what the fuck are we doing he saved the life of the bird and i have time for that and now hes hurt i have respect for the beasts where i work i have a duty to them when theyre hurt he fed the bird and treated the birds injury the bird is searching for him and cannot find him if the bird cannot find him then hes not here markham sagged back down on to the bench he looked out over the reedbanks and the water the wind came into his face and his eyes smarted he peered into the clearing sky far below where he looked were the birds of the marsh and the regiments troopers he searched for it but it was a long time before he saw the speck of dark against the blue he held it and perhaps it turned and he lost it it was very high where the winds would be fierce chalmerss eyes were never off it geoff markham blinked and his eyes watered as they strained again to locate the speck beside him chalmers sat rock still and relaxed leaning back as if to be more comfortable his dogs scrapped at his feet when markham found the bird again he could have yelled in triumph he was trained in the analysis of covert computerized data he was offered work at what theyd call the coalf ace of fiscal interpretation and he could have shouted in excitement because his wet sore eyes identified a speck moving at a thousand feet up about a thousand yards away he saw the bird and it had moved gone north and it still searched he could have hugged chalmers because the keenness of this stinking youths eyesight had given him hope at last i am sorry what i said was out of order i apologize did you think of telling them the military that he wasnt here no he wanted only to be alone a woman police officer a cheerful pleasant girl with a blonde ponytail of hair and a crisp clean uniform knelt awkwardly because of her belt which carried handcuffs gas canisters and a stick on the hall carpet to help stephen with a colouring book and crayons to be alone and to think of her blake dressed but with his shoes kicked off slept on the settee in the living room while his eyes were closed and his breathing regular his hand rested on the butt of his gun in the holster of his chest harness his radio burping staccato messages from his jacket pocket to remember her davies in shirtsleeves because he had two bars of the electric fire on was at the familiar slot of the diningroom table with the newspaper spread out reading the market and the financial comment he coordinated the radio link to the crisis centre and the locations of the mobile patrols and to mourn he was not allowed by davies to go upstairs to their bedroom not protected there mr perry im sure you understand he was not allowed by paget to go out through the kitchen door into his sunlit garden rather you didnt mr perry wouldnt be sensible they denied him the space that he yearned for perry sat on the floor between the mattresses and behind the sandbags chalmers moved it was a full halfhour since geoff markham had given up on the search for the speck the sky was clearer brightening blue with pale cirrus corrugated lines of cloud and it hurt more to look for the bird he was thinking of the future of his career whether he would be positioned back with rainbow gold whether he would be assigned to a university town where there were faculties of nuclear physics and microbiology growing botulisms at which iranian students were enrolled or whether he would be dumped into the new team working on illegal immigration or the old irish unit or narcotics when chalmers moved chalmers was already twisted round his eyeline no longer on the skies above the marsh the regiment men would be down in the reedbanks and the water now and there was nothing to show their presence chalmers stood his back turned to them and moved there was no discussion no conversation no explanation chalmers whistled softly for the dogs to come to his heel then started to track back up the path towards the village he walked with his head craning upwards as if the sight of the bird the speck was too precious to be lost and markham was left to trail behind the path brought them back to the village between the hall and the pub chalmers strode surely briskly never looked down to see where his feet trod and puddles splashed on to his trouserlegs cars scuttled past them and a van with a builders ladder lashed to the roof but that was the only motion of life in the village it was a bright sunny morning with cheerful light and a bracing wind but no one walked and took pleasure in it he thought the fear and the shame were all around in the houses the road and on the lanes as if a plague had come and the inevitability of disaster was upon them a fierce rapping knuckle and glass and a protest shout startled him he saw a woman at a window her face contorted in fury the woman pointed at her cut front lawn one of the dogs had crapped on it the second lifted a stumpy rear leg against the venus statue that was a birdbath chalmers didnt call off his dogs didnt look at her or seem to hear her just walked on and all the time he studied the skies markham stared pointedly at the far side of the road they went by the house on the green the sun making silver patterns on the new wire of the screen chalmers never glanced at the house as if it held no interest for him they went through the village a few times markham looked for the bird and could not find it he thought of it high in the upper winds soaring and circling and searching and he thought of the power of the birds eyesight and he thought of the man vahid hossein in pain and in hiding andy chalmers had talked of respect and of duty to a beast that was hurt he didnt think they would understand at thames house and it was pretty damned hard for him to comprehend why respect was due to a wounded killer and what duty was owed him chalmers walked remorselessly through the village and out of it beyond the village was a rivermouth then more wavewhipped beaches at their furthest point were the distant bright colours of a holiday community nestling in the sunlight a path ran alongside the river on top of an old flooddefence wall in the fields between the village and the path cattle grazed on grassy islands among the pools of the winter floods chalmers was ahead of him high above the river and the fields and all the time he gazed upwards hungry thirsty the foul taste in his mouth his shoes sodden his feet cold his back stiff geoff markham followed blindly thinking of food coffee a shower dry socks a clean shirt and dry shoes and he careered into chalmerss back jolted against it chalmers didnt seem to notice him beyond the fields going away from the village and the banks of the river and the raised pathway was northmarsh the sunlight gently rippled the water the sun caught the flight of the bird now lower in the sky but still high above the swaying old reedheads of the northmarsh the bird had come down from the upper winds and now it quartered over the marshlands it was as he had seen it over the southmarsh the bird searched chalmers walked to where the path cut back towards the village then stepped over a fence of sagging rusted wire and settled himself down on the small space of rabbitchewed grass beside the water and the reedbeds his dogs began to fight over a length of rotten wood there was peace quiet and serenity until markham heard the birds call do you want help do you want the guns here no he watched the bird search and listened for its shrill insistent call man its joel im doing night duty sorry to disturb you yeah i know what the time is duanes been on hes very perky they have the jerk winged and holed up duane says its close to over i need your sayso for getting the wheels moving yknow camera microphones lights action i guarantee you that the mullahs are about to have a very bad day they are going to squirm like

need thanks oh the jerk got the targets wife last night theyre so fucking incompetent its not true but the games still running how many sausages for stephen how many for the nanny policewoman did davies like his eggs turned over should blake be woken rankin had found one of meryls aprons and wore it tied to his lower stomach so that his waist holster cleared it and perry hadnt been asked how many sausages he wanted nor about the raid on the refrigerator there would be a plate for him in the kitchen with sausages bacon and eggs whether he wanted it or not he wasnt consulted because he was only the bloody principal he felt a sickness in his stomach he ached for meryl paget came past him carrying two loaded plates heading for the dining room the french windows and the outside hut where the new team were on duty he had to be with her and alone to kneel and cry for her forgiveness the policewoman shepherded stephen into the kitchen davies followed with his newspaper and blake in his stockinged feet he was an afterthought the life of the house went on they were all sitting at his kitchen table paget called out and you mr perry got to keep body and soul together they did it for stephen forced their cheer down his throat just going to the toilet start without me the window in the lavatory had an antithief lock and the key was in the small wall cupboard he bolted the door behind him they were his only friends and the mark of their regard for him was that they tried to clear the mind of her boy from what he had seen heard the night before they tried hard had to because what he had seen would have been so hideous brainscarring he heard the banter and the laughter round the table as he unlocked the window he crawled out through it took the one fast step across the narrow concrete path climbed jerry and mary wroughtons fence and dropped into their garden he had to be alone chapter nineteen hed hoped on the way out from london that there wouldnt be anything sentimental littelbaum climbed out of her car and hoisted his bag from the rear seat gruffly he wished her well she told him it was only a dropdown zone asked him to check that hed his ticket and said that she couldnt stop cathy parker didnt offer her cheek to him or her hand he watched her drive away and she didnt wave or look back by the time he was inside the turmoil of the terminal she was far from his thoughts he was early for the flight back to riyadh and he would have a decent time to search among the air side shops for chocolates for maryellen and something maybe a scarf to post to his wife he always took chocolates back to maryellen and esther had a drawer filled with the tokens hed sent her he queued at the checkin morning duane he turned alfonso dominguez took the chore of administration work at the bureaus offices in the london embassy hi fonsie didnt think youd make it apologies for not being able to drive you down here but the good news ive gotten you an upgrade its the least you deserve have you been in con tad the last hour no wasnt able to thanks for swinging the upgrade the embassy man shouldered forward to lift the bag on to the scales and was smarming the girl at the ticket desk he liked to think he had a reputation as a fixer and eased the formalities his arm was round littelbaums shoulder as they walked together across the concourse and his voice had the hushed whisper of confidentiality i hear you done really well duane thats why i bust my gut to get you the upgrade youre not up to speed on the news i just got it state departments lining up trumpets and drums the briefings everythingll come out of washington its gonna be our show theres decks being cleared i reckon youll have a personal call from the director tonight thats what mary was saying could even be a call from the secretary its our shout and were going to milk it do the brits know littelbaum grinned theyll be told when they need to be i did well better actually than i thought youre too modest duane he enjoyed the admiration good of you to say that fonsie i said at the start it would take a week and this is the seventh day and its pretty much all wrapped up soon as the state department get the word hes in chains or a body bag itll be the big blast coast to coast round the world live tv littelbaum said gently ive been working for this for so long what ive finally achieved fonsie what nobody else has achieved to the same degree is the fracturing of the code of deniability tehrans deniability is crucial in their operations and its broken its been the screen theyve hidden behind and were taking the screen down and going public and hold on to your seat fonsie hold on tight because the repercussions can be ferocious what im saying we have the mullahs by the balls too right duane whether the tomahawks fly whether its resolutions and sanctions at the security council backed by teeth its going to be a hell of a rough ride but weve the evidence of statesponsored terrorism weve gotten the smoking gun but you know what the massive repercussions of the breaking of deniability have turned on events in some shitty backwater fonsie you wouldnt believe that place its been played out among folk with clay on their feet nowheresville i think i have your meaning duane shame about the casualties irrelevant you got to look at the big picture you dont have casualties you dont win i kicked the brits in the right direction what surprised me they bought the crap i gave them ate it out of my hand what i say for what was at stake the casualties came cheap youll be top of the pile duane i think i will be do we have time for a drink the slick in the water lapping against him was an ochre mix from the mud he disturbed and the blood he dripped vahid hossein had gone to the limit of his strength to reach his hidingplace a filthy handkerchief from his pocket had been used as a field dressing to staunch the wound when he had left her after the woman had screamed and her dogs had snarled when the beam of her torch had found him then bounced away as she had fled he had pushed himself up from her body he had not realized he had bled on her until the torch showed him the blood he had gone away into the night and pressed the handkerchief into the wound but it had pumped blood on to his vest his shirt his sweater and his camouflage tunic he had known that he must absorb it not permit it to fall on the ground he crossed because there would be a trail for dogs to follow in the darkness he had gone though the pigfields skirted between their halfmoon huts smelt the disgusting odour of the creatures guiding him was the call of the seabirds and the soft motion of water ahead it was as he reached the water went down into it that the numbness of the wound gave way to the pain in his chest and with the pain came the exhaustion there had once been a track leading through the heart of the marsh an old pathway long since flooded under the pathway in dense reeds a culvert drain had been built of brick lying on his side vahid hossein kept the wound above the level of the water the pain came in rivers now if the marshes had been at the faw peninsula or on the jasmin canal if he had been with colleagues with friends the pain would have been lessened by morphine injections there were no colleagues he was far from the faw and the jasmin there was no morphine the pain sucked the strength from his body if he lost consciousness he would sink lower in the drains water and drown he reached into his pocket for the muddied soaked photograph held it in his hand and gazed at the small distorted face of his target the sun shone on the water at the entrance of the drain dappling among the reed stems if he drifted to sleep if he sank into unconsciousness he would drown if he drowned he would never look into the face but sleep unconsciousness would kill the pain the bullet had been from a handgun one lowvelocity bullet fired at the extreme of range was still misshapen and splintered somewhere inside the cavity of his chest the entry wound was low under his armpit and he had not found an exit wound the bullet had struck the bones of his ribcage and been diverted deeper into the chest space he coughed he could not help himself it came from far down in his lungs he writhed in the confines of the drain he needed space air and couldnt find it he held his sleeve against his mouth to muffle the sound of his cough and he crawled towards the segment of bright light at the mouth of the drain he saw the blood on his sleeve and it eddied from the coarse soaked material into the flow of the water vahid hossein did not know how he would survive through the sunlit hours he prayed for the darkness and prayed to his god for strength with darkness with strength he would go for the last time to the house the blood and the mucus ran from his hand and over the photograph he clutched and into the water they would be waiting to hear of him and learn of what he had achieved he thought of barzin and her body in darkness the awkwardness with which she held him and he wondered if she would weep he thought of the brigadier with the bearhug arms and the laughter that was between them the trust and he wondered if the tears would come to the cheeks of his friend he thought of hasanisabah and the young men who had gone down on the narrow steep rock path from the fortress at alamut and who would never return he thought of them and they all each of them succoured his strength the image of the young woman living or dead was never on his mind she was past the sun was on his face protected from sight by the waving reedbanks he eased his head and the shoulder above the wound out into the light he was so tired he wanted so desperately to sleep it was not an option he recognized the delirium that snatched at his concentration but could not resist the call for him to show strength and courage they were all around him the people he knew in his heart and in his mind he heard their words and they cried to him from close by he reached above the drain his fingers groping in soft mud against the reedstems for the launcher the voices near to him and shrill told him he must hold the launcher through the sunlight hours and never sleep hold it until night came it was blurred small the bird cried out above him and flew its search over him the pain was back the dream was over he saw the bird searching for him and heard its cry in the silence it was the same silence he had felt before when he had believed a man watched for him he struggled to get back into the recess of the mouth of the drain but he did not have the strength and his fear was the same as hers had been when she was under him and choked and scratched at his face the bird hunted him chalmers saw the bird dive the man markham slept beside him lying on his back with the sun bathing him sheltered from the wind and the dogs were close to him andy chalmers had heard the bird call and it had not been answered he saw it tuck its wings against its body and plummet a stone in freef all bright light shimmering on its wings he watched it for the briefest moment pull out from its dive and spread its wings to cushion the impact of the fall he heard its cry for a few seconds it hovered over the reeds then dropped as a marker he took an old withered tree that rose above the flood marsh dead branches with a crow perched on it the bird came up sky danced over the reeds then dropped again a faraway tree draped in ivy which was alone among the willow saplings on the distant extreme of the marsh was his second point his mind made the line between the perched crow and the ivy tree the bird stayed down and he knew its search was over chalmers leaned across the sleeping man ruffled the hair of his dogs necks murmured his order to them and slipped into the water he moved away from the shoreline where markham slept and the dogs watched without sound he had the line to guide him he half swam half walked and although the water was icy against his body he was not aware of it he kept the line in his mind he felt no anger no passion no hatred the shore was behind him hidden from him by the reedbanks he went quietly slowly along the line his mind had made cathy parker said to fenton and cox hes complacent and conceited its not what he said but its his body language littelbaum thinks hes walked all over us like were the hired help twice he had flapped his arm at the bird the second time more feebly than the first he could not drive the bird away from him if vahid hossein could have reached it the bird he loved he would have caught it held it while it clawed his hand and gouged at his wrist and he would have throttled the life out of it but he could not when his hand came close the bird fluttered further away eyeing him and flew and circled him but when it came down it was always beyond his reach to survive he would have killed the creature he loved and all the time the silence grew around him again digging for strength the pain surging he lunged he was on his knees and groping at air the bird mocked him danced in front of him as he sagged back his face screwed in pain he saw in the far distance the man walking towards him on the raised pathway coming closer alone and unprotected was his target the photograph had fallen from his hand when he had reached for the bird floating on the muddy water near to him he gripped it looked once more at the crumpled photograph and at the man the pain in his body told him it was not the delirium that comes to the wounded before sleep and then death the man walked towards him vahid hossein thanked his god and grasped the launcher in his hands as firmly as he could is that you fenton penny flowers here did you know our esteemed american allies were already counting their chickens theyre planning to go public as soon as theres a corpse or a prisoner they reckon a little bird tells me that its going to be their day which is in direct contradiction of what i understand to be our policy on this thought you should know he walked in the beauty of the landscape and did not believe he deserved to meryl was dead the woman he had slept with loved with bickered with lived with was lying on a tray in the mortuarys racks because of him when they had walked on that path together after going to the beach she was always on his right side so that she could better see the waterbirds in the marshland his right arm dangled at his side and his hand was open as if she were about to take it and hold it as she did when they were alone and together the sun warmed his cheeks but his body was cold insensate he had not taken a coat out through the toilet window but had escaped in the pullover that had been warm enough for the house as hed walked on the beach the selfpity had dropped away from him and now on the path going towards the marshland he remembered only what he had done to friends for frank perry friends had been the rock of life and she was gone because of what he had done to friends burned them to death he could remember each meeting with them and how he had bought them he had purchased his friends and they were burned to death because of him and meryl had paid the final price in a quiet private voice he asked for her forgiveness and the agony of his crime distracted him from the beauty all around him poor meryl innocent ignorant meryl meryl who knew little of the world beyond her door for whom islam was a mystery into her home he had carried history and faith terror warheads and a killer and he tried to ask for her forgiveness she had been innocent and ignorant and happy with it it was a country and a culture a people an aspiration of power of which she had known nothing and wanted to know nothing and he had dragged it into her life and that nothing had killed her his friends too were in his mind their faces their kindnesses their laughter and their burned bodies and she was dead and she had not known them she was gone from him too late to ask for her bloody forgiveness life went on he said it out loud to make it real life goes on the dogs pounced at him from hidden ground below the pathway came through the old sagging fence beside the water where it turned towards the church tower life bloody goes on the dogs tripped him from his dream state he lashed at the nearer one with his shoe and it danced clear of him he peered over the fence and saw the sleeping minder markham he could have walked on the man lay and slept in the sunshine and breathed easily markham had told him the consequence of his actions enough of asking for forgiveness and enough of thinking on friends because life bloody well went on like it or not he stepped over the fence slipped down past the leafless willows and crossed the shortcropped grass the dogs snarled and cuddled down beside the sleeping man markham he crouched shook the mans shoulder eyes opened the face contorted in astonishment what the hell what the fucking hell are you doing here markham looked around him fast the empty grass the still water the unmoving reedbeds and he reached up and dragged perry down i could ask you the same question nothing better to occupy yourself what are you doing shit because hes here markham stared out into the impenetrable mass of slowswaying reeds then glanced down at the dogs because the trackers gone in there after him get down the sarcasm was wiped from his lips perry lay on his stomach beside markham here so where are the guns there are no fucking guns theres just an unarmed civilian tracker in there searching for him markham spat what the hell are you doing out of the house he said weakly i wanted to be alone i went out through the toilet youre serious i wanted to think that is about as irresponsible as is humanly possible im just a parcel nobody cares youre a bloody symbol men protect you because of your status as a symbol christ you werent idiot enough to think it was personal were you were not here because we bloody like you its our work its what we do what were you thinking of i thought you were as much my friends as the men who burned to death where is he somewhere out there being hunted he lay on his stomach nothing moved ahead of him to disturb the peace he closed his eyes and pressed his head down on to the shortcropped grass the sun was on his neck and he felt only the chill of regret in his mind he saw the burned bodies cox said to the secretary of state if our american friends our dear and closest allies are allowed to run with this then we sail on uncharted waters and among unknown reefs we will be sucked into their vortex do we want that are we prepared to be tugged along by the nose at their beck and call and in the interests of their propaganda coup its a huge step so often the quiet passing of a covert signal achieves more than the beating of cymbals but sir it is your decision pandemonium broke loose in the domestic routine plates clean food finished washingup done the principal had been forgotten where in gods name was he the kid had been the centre of attention and the requirement to distract him and the military were doing their thing and that had softened the alertness it was only when the nanny policewoman had gone to the downstairs toilet and shouted back that it was locked from the inside that he had been remembered they scattered blake upstairs to check the bedrooms paget going out to search the garden rankin hustling through the ground floor davies scanning the green and the road and not a sniff of him as they pounded around her the nanny policewoman told the kid it wasnt anything to worry about paget broke down the toilet door the window was open the sunlight streaming in they were gathered behind him to look the bastards done a runner thecacophony of voices filled the hallway after all weve bloody done for him bloody put ourselves on the line for him sort of thanks you get from a selfish bloody bastard what the fuck is he thinking of forgotten in the silence the child shouted dont dont youre his friends they stood for a moment heads hung shamed fenton said into the telephone so good to speak to you of course i feel i know you although weve never met lets put that right lunch today i think i apologize if youve something in your diary but i promise you it would be worth your while to scratch it out theres a nice little place off st jamess on the right third street up from pall mall italian one oclock excellent ive heard so much about you whats it concern try remembering a man known as frank perry one oclock i look forward to it hugely the chance was given him by his god the bird was above him sometimes coming down into the reeds to perch and watch him but always beyond his reach one final chance was given him by his god to take him to the garden of paradise he thought of the great men who had gone before him slipped from the mountain at alamut made long journeys stalked their target and he would meet them as an equal in the garden of paradise and sweetfaced girls would wash the wounds on his body under trees of fruit blossom and take the pain from him he was weak and could move only slowly he had seen where the target had come down off the high pathway and he had not seen him climb back he knew where he would find him and prayed that he had the strength to take him he smelt the burning of the bodies as the flesh melted on the bones he heard the terror of the screams he saw the women weeping he had been in their homes and they had cooked celebratory meals for him and their husbands frank perry jerked up his head from the ground whats happened nothings happened the minder markham whispered sourly what about the tracker dont know havent sight nor sound of him and for him the hunter is it just a job or does he care you wouldnt understand i understand what i did you were convenient they used you every inch of the way does he care the man out there the man who killed meryl hes professional doing a job for his country as were doing a job for ours as a person he doesnt care dying for his country let me tell you something mr perry that might help you to comprehend the islamic activists in egypt blow up tourist buses but its not personal they get caught they get tried in courtroom cages and are sentenced to hang on the gallows you and i would beg for mercy but they dont when the judge passes the death sentence they jump up and down in excitement and they are smiling and laughing and praising their god he wont give a shit but you cannot comprehend that would he know about the bus would he know what i did hed know could you live with that the sight of the bodies and the smell i dont have to its not my problem but i do and its my torment he pushed himself up on to his knees on to his feet and stood at his full height the minder markham was tugging at his trousers and trying to drag him down but he braced himself and stood straight he saw the birds gliding in the dark water pools and the gentle motion of the wind in the reedheads and the calm unbroken reflections he saw the harrier swoop low over the reeds there was an awesome beauty in the sunlight and peace he identified the corruption that had led him to the crime of responsibility for the burned bodies and the smell he had been somebody he had been the man who was valued who was met at the airport with the chauffeured car who was taken into the room in the house behind the pall mall clubs who talked to a quiet audience and explained the detail of the satellite photography he had rejoiced in the attention of being somebody as if a corporate badge hung from a neck chain on his chest he had thought himself important but he had only been used he shouted i am here i am worthless it is what i deserve the minder markham struggled to pull him down i know what i am i am nobody the harrier danced on the reedheads at the edge of his vision and the sunlight caught on the barrel of the launcher do it because i deserve it in the depth of the reeds there was the dazzle of fire with the fire was the grey belch of smoke and the telltale goldthread signature climbing away from it the sound thundered towards him the birds rose screaming threshing shrieking from the pools between the reedbanks the trail of fire rose high above his head away into the blue denseness of the skies then seemed to hover as the harrier had and then it fell a white line of smoke marked its passing there was a dull explosion away on fields to the north the birds quietened and circled and who would have looked after the boy mr perry i didnt think then start thinking get down he dropped to his knees ahead of him the reeds erupted as if spitting out what before had been hidden the young man stood he was small and thin the water ran from his shoulders and from his face he reached behind him and lifted up the launcher tube and without hesitation he threw the tube far from him over a bank of reeds and it splashed down in clear water then he bent before reappearing frank perry could see the dangled legs across his chest and the lolling head behind his shoulder and he came slowly as if a great weight burdened him frank perry watched the young man carried the body of vahid hossein through the reedbanks and out of them the minder markham went into the water when they were close and made to help the young man but the weight of the carcass was not to be shared the young man stepped from the mud and on to the cropped grass the water and mud cascaded off him and off the corpse he climbed the bank grunting at the effort of it and straddled the fence of rusted barbed wire he whistled for his dogs he went up on to the high pathway with the weight of the body on his shoulders frank perry noticed the harrier soar above and wondered whether the bird was watching them they walked in file back towards the village led by the young man with his burden the villagers had heard the explosion some pretended they had not some broke from the link of their conversation listened then talked again some heard it and crept away to a corner of privacy it was not possible to escape the sound of the explosion davies heard it and blake paget and rankin and the nanny policewoman clutched the child to her in the moments after the windows had rattled at the house the soldiers working through the southmarsh towards the snipers rifles heard it gussie brought the news to the pub he had run at full pace from the pigfields overlooking northmarsh theyve got him theyre bringing him in hes dead at the edge of the village geoff markham hurried to keep up with chalmers who carried the body easily moving with a fast loping walk perry was behind and it was as if it were nothing to do with him he saw the crowd gathered on the green across the road from the house standing loosely watching and waiting when markham caught up with him he walked beside chalmers and the head of the carcass lolled lifelessly against his arm why did you do it there was no answer no turn of the head no attempt at explanation markham thought he understood the gesture of respect for the beast how did you kill him chalmerss lips were set tight markham looked into the dead eyes of the corpse and saw the pallor on the face there was a clean cut bullethole in the tunic and a great bloody stain discolouring the material round it at the neck there was the mark of a bruise a deeper colour just below the ear he saw them together very close two filthy soaked wild creatures there would have been no fear on the hunted mans eyes in those last moments and there would have been a gentleness on the hunters face as he had readied the heel of his hand the same gentleness on the moor and the mountain when he came close to the wounded beast and its pain did he say anything no answer did he fight no answer did you feel anything geoff markham thought that andy chalmers wouldnt be feeling sadness or remorse it was what was owed to a wounded beast it was not about a quarrel it was about ending the misery of pain he had no more questions there was nothing more that he could think to ask and maybe it was right that he should have no answers to the last moments of the life of vahid hossein he thought of his commitment to the ideology he believed in and of his untamed defiance and he thought of the death of meryl perry and of gladys eva jones he thought of those who had milked the access knowledge of gavin hughes and those who had put the launcher in the killers hand he thought of those who had tied the rope to the ankle of frank perry tethered him and armed the guns and waited for the predator to close on him he had no answers it seemed unimportant at that moment to geoff markham that he would never know what had happened in those last few seconds as the launcher was fired high into the sky and away from the target never know of the confrontation between the two dripping dirty men in the marsh the crowd edged back as andy chalmers walked across the green with his burden davies was at the open door and blake and paget with rankin watching the young man came to the front gate of the house and dropped his shoulder so that the body fell easily from it it crumpled twisted on to the grass the crowd stared down at the death mask and the bloodied uniform as if at a creature from the darkness the water oozed from the uniform and the last of the blood markham reflected that somewhere a woman would weep for vahid hossein the crowd stayed back as if they were still in fear of this intrusion into their lives who had made them make choices as if he still might sting might bite as if he still possessed the power to hurt them the first of the soldiers to come said it come on you bastards its not a flicking peepshow show him some dignity geoff markham said quietly if we went now andy i think we could make the afternoon train to get you home he walked towards his car unlocked it opened the door for chalmers and his dogs before he climbed in he walked with purpose to the shop where the postbox was he wanted to be the solitary private man the man who sat alone in the corner of a bar or a train carriage he wanted to be a part of the strange neutered unshared life of a counterintelligence officer he wanted to walk into peoples lives and be able to walk out again he wanted to be lonely like the woman with the red hair who was a legend he took the sodden letter from his pocket and dropped it into the postbox as he drove away with chalmers sitting expressionless beside him and the smell of the marsh water filling his car markham saw the crowd reluctantly dispersing and he saw paget spreading a bedroom blanket over the carcass of the beast he had welcomed his guest at the restaurants door smiled and held out his hand in greeting harry fenton had seen the rank suspicion on the intelligence officers face he had led him to the corner table fenton had grinned before they sat and his back to the restaurants clients he had quickly unbuttoned his shirt lifted his vest had exposed his chest as if to convince the guest that no recording device was strapped to his body i thought it was good that we should meet because misunderstandings can so damage our mutual relations he had laid his mobile telephone on the tablecloth taken the menu cards and hed told the intelligence officer that he would order for him he had thought the intelligence officer would have cleared the shortnotice invitation with his head of section with his ambassador and ultimately with his tehran control the man had been wary but not nervous and fenton had thought him an experienced professional there are four names that i wish to throw at you my friend and you should listen most carefully to what i say because the implications of our conversation are a matter of some importance they ate fenton heavily and the intelligence officer with little enthusiasm the mobile telephone had lain silent beside fentons place its a question of deals we are into the business of negotiation let us begin with the names there is the name of brigadier kashef saderi for the mission mounted into this country we have ample evidence of his involvement yusuf khan formerly winston summers currently under armed guard in hospital farida yasmin jones now dead strangled there is vahid hossein each time he had given a name harry fenton had smiled and looked up into the intelligence officers eyes the man didnt blink or turn away himself confronted with names he would have wanted to puke up his food of all those he knew at thames house and worked with hed thought only little miss prim parker would have held her composure as well as the intelligence officer had of course she would it was cathy who had come back from the airport with the idea of shafting the bastards the esteemed allies smiling into his guests face he let the names sink then resumed eating he cleared his plate he had ordered gelati for them both and requested espresso coffee to follow around vahid hossein a net is currently tightening the tables around them had cleared bills were paid the restaurant staff found coats umbrellas and shopping bags for their clients fenton admired the calm of the intelligence officer the coffee was brought the mobile telephone bleeped fenton sipped at his coffee he let the telephone ring he returned the cup slowly to the saucer he lifted the telephone and listened a smile played on his face he thanked his caller the intelligence officer watched him for a sign he drank again from his coffee cup wiped his mouth with his napkin then leaned forward vahid hossein is dead my condolences he was brought out of the marshes like a stinking slimeridden rat dead its the way these things end i suppose without decency we are faced because of the weight of evidence with a most serious situation involving relations between our two countries yes harry fenton raised his hand flicked his fingers imperiously for the bill to be brought him allow me to answer my own question no it can be that it never happened but never happened comes at a price astonishment spread for the first time on the intelligence officers face and he bit his lip it never happened and therefore it never happens again i repeat it never happened and your agents never again threaten the life of frank perry its an attractive solution to both of us the intelligence officer reached out and grasped harry fentons hand the deal was done with their locked fists he paid the bill and carefully pocketed the receipt it was the last of harry fentons lunches a few minutes later after the close whispering of details they were out on the pavement and he waved down a taxi for his guest he started to walk back towards thames house the body would go from a closed van into the cargo hold of the aircraft the threat against the life of frank perry would not be renewed the americans arrogant shits were shafted and their staffers would have no brief to spell out in front of the cameras peace was preserved deniability ruled and the bridges remained in place the bottles would be broken out of barnaby coxs cabinet to celebrate a good most satisfactory show he walked at a breezy pace and he laughed out loud it had never happened back at thames house he told cox what he had achieved and the raid on the cabinet began fenton was downing his second drink might have been the third when an assistant director wandered into the office ive just heard well done barney up on the top floor were all very pleased but then we always had confidence that youd get it right my congratulations barney the body had been taken davies had gone paget and rankin had left before him loaded their kit into the car and driven away geoff markham had stayed as little time as possible the workmen had dismantled the poles and the screens hanging between them the crane would be there in the morning to lift out the hut and the technical people to disconnect the electronics the workmen had carried out the sandbags and had helped to manhandle the mattresses back to the beds upstairs only blake the last of his friends remained but would leave at dawn the dusk fell he had opened every heavy curtain in the house and the lights blazed out over the green he had torn out all of the net curtains peeled the sticky tape from the mirrors and placed their pictures back on the walls he had pushed his easy chair in the living room away from the fire and into the window he sat in his chair and the brightness of the lights lit the path the front gate and the fence he saw them come jerry and mary first then barry and emma they came out of the darkness beyond the throw of the lights and they laid the flowers against the gate and the fence the gang from the pub followed them with more flowers a few minutes afterwards it was mrs fairbrother peggy and paul the call had come from london a drinkslurred voice against a background of laughter and bottles clinking with glasses and music had told him that the danger was past and would not return that he was free to live his life the boy her child sat at his feet and watched with him as the cluster of flowers grew the vicar brought freshpicked daffodils the voice had said that what had never happened was over early in the morning after blake had gone he would ring for a van and after he had fixed for it to take away their possessions he would make the arrangements for the funeral and after the funeral he would drive away from the village with her child he would drive to a place where he and her dild could remember her and give her love a place where they were safe together from guns and friends he sat in the chair his fingers gripping the boys shoulders and watched the stream of shadowy figures come in silence from the darkness pause by the gate before hurrying back to the safety of their homes together they listened to the distant sound of waves breaking relentlessly against the shore and stared out beyond the floral penance into the emptiness of the black night
