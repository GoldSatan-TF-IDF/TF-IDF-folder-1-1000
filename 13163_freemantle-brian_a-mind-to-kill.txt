a mind to kill brian freemantle chapter one jennifer had never imagined in her wildest dreams that she could be this happy it went way beyond happiness it wouldnt have made sense to anyone if shed tried to put it into words because there werent words to express properly how she felt the best she could do to describe it and only to herself was as a total completeness everything was complete her perfect life and her perfect marriage to a perfect husband and the most beautiful most perfect baby in the world all absolutely and totally complete and secure as if there was a wall between her and everyone else to keep out anything bad as high and as protective as the wall encircling the mansion shed just left jennifer sometimes became frightened like she was unsettled by the reflection now although it was something else she never tried to explain to anyone not wanting to be laughed at her fear was that she anyone didnt have the right to be as lucky as she was so secure so sure of everything and everybody of herself that feeling was easier to rationalize than the overwhelming happiness it was she knew a guilt shed never ever be able to lose absolutely shed read all the newspaper reports and gone through everything with gerald so many times hed grown angry and wouldnt talk about it any more before finally accepting there was nothing to reproach herself for so it wasnt that it was the even earlier unease it had been there from the very start of the affair the first night even long before shed ever fallen in love with gerald and realized that it wasnt simply an affair after all the moment in fact shed decided shed been stupid to become involved with a married man and that everything was going to end in the mess it had not of course the tragedy that had actually occurred and from which shed emerged unscathed and uncriticized to her own very special lockedaway happiness a happiness she still found hard to believe she deserved soon after the tragedy she had considered seeking psychiatric help unable to accept geralds assurances by themselves anxious for an unbiased unemotional opinion but she hadnt and now jennifer was glad shed never found it easy virtually impossible in fact to talk about personal intimate things even to people close to her even to gerald the thought of exposing herself to a stranger mentally stripping herself naked had stopped her then and now it made her physically shudder just to think about it as she came to the turn off to the kindergarten jennifer had to wait because of the traffic congestion on the london road smiling at another thought she guessed a psychiatrist would judge how she chose to lead a lot of her life now as that of someone seeking atonement she had immersed herself in charities and contributed substantially to every appeal and fundraising approach made to her the charity thought reminded her that for the rest of the month maybe longer she probably wouldnt be able to collect emily so regularly virtually everything was set up for the aids ball at grosvenor house but jennifer gave minute attention to every detail of anything she did or organized seeking confirmation of confirmation a habit shed developed as the leading trader in geralds company before their marriage now she didnt trade any more another lingering although very secret regret shed transferred her neverlose determination to another activity to the benefit of people not as fortunate as herself and there was still one item the most important not absolutely guaranteed a lot of the intended success of the ball depended upon final confirmation of the royal promise to attend shed give it another day or two before approaching the palace again what she did so well wasnt atonement jennifer knew she had nothing to atone for when her other commitments allowed she collected emily herself instead of delegating to the nanny because she adored the child and wanted her always to feel as safe as she did she contributed to fundraising because gerald could more than afford it and she organized charity events superbly well because it was a practical and worthwhile way of occupying her mind as well as passing on just a little of the good fortune shed never believed it possible to have jennifer managed the turn at last hurrying the final few hundred metres when she saw some children alreadybeing bundled into cars miss singleton formed a physical barrier at the kindergarten entrance not releasing any child until she recognized the parent or the nanny the teacher beckoned emily forward at jennifers arrival and announced shes been a very clever girl today emily proudly held up the postcard of a cow and jennifer entered into the solemnity of the moment taking her time to read the handwritten declaration on the back that it had been awarded to emily lomax for recognizing the letter c wonderful jennifer enthused im very proud of you will daddy be i know he will they began to return to the car emily automatically reaching up for jennifers hand waving with the other to various children who called to her ive got a card in my bag sallys having a party next week can i go of course shes four like me but you were four three months ago does that matter jennifer laughed no she wants a dog a real one jennifer carefully secured the child into the rearfacing safety seat brushing the bundle of curls from her forehead and kissing her maybe if shes a good girl shell get one she doesnt know what c means yet perhaps she will by the time her birthday comes why must i look backwards i cant see you like this this ways safer noone else in my class has to sit like this if theres an accident you wont get hurt although the gap was sufficient jennifer waited until an approaching van passed before pulling out is there going to be an accident no never never promised jennifer why cant i sit the other way then jennifer smiled i think youre going to be a lawyer when you grow up whats a lawyer a very clever person cleverer than daddy noones cleverer than daddy what are we doing after lunch what would you like to do go to marwell zoo and see the animals then thats what well do jennifer was late triggering the remote control as she came off the london road and had to wait for the high security gates to open fully before she could start up the drive it was several moments before the square georgian house became visible through the trees annabelle was waiting just inside the entrance ive got a prize announced emily producing the postcard for knowing what c is what is it asked the nanny cow declared the child well done praised the girl were going to marwell this afternoon as a reward said jennifer as they walked down the corridor towards the rear kitchen weve got a long way to go wed better hurry said jane ive waited so long almost seven years for you to feel as happy and as content as this oh dont forget the knife we mustnt forget that chapter two the office had gained architectural awards and the city nickname of the goldfish bowl to which gerald lomax proud of their aggressive commodity record added for piranha fish built literally on the rubble of one of the iras worst city bombings that totally destroyed the original building in which jennifer had worked it was a glasswalled expanse bare except for banks of computer stations lomaxs office was suspended above it against an inner wall the side overlooking the trading floor also glassed from carpet to ceiling so was the corridor from the elevator to lomaxs eyrie the goldfish bowl selfconsciousness had long ago vanished so noone on the trading floor noticed jennifer emerge from the lift three did look up curiously at the noise she made tapping her knuckles against the glass as she walked towards her husbands room her left hand was buried deeply into her large shoulderstrapped handbag lomax raised his head surprised as she entered darling i didnt he began murdering bastard the first sweeping slash opened the left side of gerald lomaxs face from ear to chin he threw himself backwards so hard his chair overturned crashing into the seethrough wall but every trader below was already staring transfixed attracted by the screaming accusation jennifer for gods sake lomax was on his hands and knees when she stabbed him twice in the back he clawed upwards levering against the desk and she stabbed him through the hand actually embedding the knife in the wood and lomax punched her in the side of the face splitting her lip as she wrestled the blade free then grabbed out for it as she did so to drive it upwards into her free hand jen for a moment they clung together in a frenzied dance but he was already weak from the cuts and stabs and she was easily able to get the knife back the next slash was across his nose almost severing it lomax hit the wall again although remaining upright but his eyes were flooded by the slashing blow and he couldnt see to protect himself any more dont jen stop she drove the knife into his stomach so forcefully the blade went completely through his body and hit the glass twisting it out of her hand lomax actually pulled it from himself and struck wildly at her hitting her in the arm but she jerked it from his grasp again this time she held it daggerlike stabbing again and again driving him back initially against the glass and then on to the ground as he lay there helpless she stabbed and slashed more her head thrown back as she laughed hysterically blood gouted from lomax spurting over the glass before dribbling down in wavering streaks finally leaving the knife protruding from his back jennifer lurched exhausted to her feet and stood legs spreadeagled to overlook the trading floor her outstretched hands pressed against the pane more blood trickling down from her own wounds for a moment she remained there panting before throwing her head back to laugh over and over lips tight against her teeth in a triumphant grimace when the police cautiously entered the office jennifer was sitting on the floor with gerald lomaxs body cradled in her arms weeping uncontrollably she looked up and her voice broken by sobs said hes dead stabbed please help me as they separated her from the dead man the photograph of emily that lomax always kept on his desk fell from between them it was encrusted with blood chapter three john bentley liked murder but decided almost at once there wasnt going to be any personal benefit from this one there would automatically be some publicity from gerald lomax being a millionaire city highflyer and bentley was ready to bet a mistress with big tits would emerge within fortyeight hours but it wasnt like the other twelve hed solved without a single failure to justify the promotion to detective superintendent at the age of thirtynine and the legend he worked so aggressively to maintain if there was anything at all remarkable about this one it was that it was virtually over before it began an open and shut domestic stabbing in full view of sixteen credible witnesses the only thing to do was organize the routine find the motive when he found the mistress and hope she had a pretty face as well as big tits for the photographers it would still count as a success on his record which was all that really mattered the ambulance paramedic leaving his partner applying the emergency dressings to jennifers arm and hands crossed towards bentley gesturing down to the blood on his jacket the man said shes badly cut needs suturing and shes in pretty deep shock he rubbed at the bloodstains its a bastard getting this stuff off bentley looked towards the vacanteyed woman wouldnt believe she was capable of it would you she did a pretty good job the poor sod is cut and stabbed to buggery whatever he did it upset her a young pathologist whom bentley didnt know was bent over the body mumbling into a handheld tape recorder itll be sex classic syndrome predicted bentley he turned to two policewomen in the outer corridor go with her in the ambulance ill come later jennifer allowed herself to be laid on the stretcher trolley and bentley stood aside for her to be wheeled past him her eyes were closed but there was a faint smile on her face call us when the bodys ready to be moved said the ambulanceman as they went by bentley nodded staying to the side of the room for the overalled forensic team to enter he recognized anthony billington at the head of the group hed worked with the obese man on three of the previous murders all fairly straightforward said the scientist looks that way agreed bentley shouldnt take us long lets get everything just the same we always do said billington curtly i know placated bentley fucking prima donna he thought the room was becoming crowded so he went into the outer corridor from there he looked down into the trading room malcolm rodgers his inspector had everyone seated at their terminal stations giving statements to attentive constables it really was straightforward if it hadnt been part of the routine there wouldnt have been any reason for his even being there the pathologist scuffed out of the office and immediately began stripping off his protective suit he smiled at bentley and said hewitt felix hewitt they shook hands bentley was a gaunt tall man who towered over the medical examiner multiple stab wounds and extensive lacerations said the pathologist i wont know until after the postmortem obviously but id say at least five would have been fatal quite a concentration around the heart area as if she was specifically hitting him there that and the face a lot of cuts there like she was determined to disfigure him hell hath no fury said bentley i havent got much on so i can let you have a report by tomorrow thatll be fine rodgers emerged from the lift for which the doctor was waiting to descend looking down towards the trading floor rodgers said first time ive known sixteen statements all saying the same thing in virtually the same words this is going to be the easiest ever the two had worked on eight of the previous murders and spent a lot of time together socially their wives liked each other no question about it agreed bentley itll be another woman guaranteed flat here in london country house in hampshire where the little wife lives most of the time with the baby while the cats away the mice play wonder what the mistress will be like classy guessed rodgers lomax was loaded he could afford the best he looked needlessly at a notebook this is the second wife names jennifer worked in the firm to begin with brilliant from what they said down there first wife jane died of an overdose bentley turned hopefully from looking down at the trading floor anything suspicious the inspector shook his head she was a diabetic it was an insulin imbalance according to what theyre saying was lomax having an affair with this one while the first wife was alive for almost a year apparently so he made a habit of it seems that way lucky bugger from the doorway billington said were through with the body can we get it out of the way a uniformed policeman further along the corridor looked enquiringly at bentley who nodded and said please the policeman glad of something to do began talking into his radio she said anything asked rodgers shes in shock according to the paramedic shell know who the other woman is we might as well go and find out both men were keen rugby fans and on the drive along the embankment the conversation was about that saturdays international between england and wales both had tickets rodgers whose mother had been born in swansea offered a bet on wales which bentley took they gambled between each other a lot bentley usually won if this had been a difficult one it could have buggered saturday up suggested rodgers putting their scotland yard identification on the dashboard as he parked in a consultants reserved space jennifer was in a single ward one of the policewomen outside the room rose at their approach and said they did the stitching under local anaesthetic and the doctor insists theres no shock theyre happy for her to be interviewed the second policewoman made room for them as bentley and rodgers entered the tiny ward bentley formally identified himself and rodgers and then said youre jennifer lomax yes you know why were here gerald said the woman hurriedly anxious for everything to be kept in its proper routine sequence bentley recited the official caution before she could say anything more as he did so jennifer frowned towards him head curiously to one side have you got anything to say demanded bentley it wasnt me said jennifer it was jane chapter four trapped you bitch there was a laugh go away leave me alone terror jarred through her what had she done it didnt make sense nothing made sense she didnt understand she didnt know of course you know go away i will if i choose to but wont if i dont and theres nothing you can do about it i can do whatever i like with you youre mine why this wasnt happening couldnt be happening it was a dream a horrible dream a nightmare you know bloody well why i dont honestly i dont jennifer squeezed her eyes shut wanting to close everything out wanting most of all to close out the memory of geralds slashed and bloodied body look at them they all think youre mad thats what everyone is going to think jennifer did look forcing herself at the small ward window through which the two detectives she had refused to talk to without a solicitor being present were frowning in at her and then at the two policewomen actually in the room with her as she did so the elder a sergeant came forward and said whats the problem mrs lomax see the tone that echoed in jennifers head in the southern drawl she had forgotten was triumphant to the policewoman jennifer said nothing im all right thank you youre not youre possessed but noone is going to believe you because theres no such thing as ghosts or possession is there she could beat her jennifer decided had to beat her for christs sake if jane was in her mind then she could read her mind had already shown she could so she didnt have to speak it was just appearing to talk to herself that would make people think she was mentally deranged of course i know what youre thinking but that wont do i told you youre trapped mine to do with what i want and i will do what i want with you so youll say the words for people to hear and theyll decide youre insane why implored jennifer aloud and unable to stop herself shed spoken no no no you murdered me you and gerald bastards the accusation ended in a scream and jennifer physically winced at the sound in her head i didnt we didnt it was an accident you did it yourself an accidental overdose liar it was a roar this time and jennifer winced again and the woman sergeant came forward once more mrs lomax im all right really both hands and her left arm were heavily bandaged a saline drip needle was strapped to her right hand to gesture which she did slightly genuinely hurt the anaesthetic is wearing off do you want me to call a nurse or a doctor its not that bad you cant begin to believe how bad its going to get jennifer remained tight lipped she had to think work it out but she couldnt think without jane the voice knowing what those thoughts were dont sit there like a little child all puckered up youve got to learn theres nothing you can do to stop me ill find a way said jennifer falling back against the supporting pillows feeling the strength drain from herself dont give up couldnt give up of course you cant give up thats going to be part of the fun my fun maybe youll even go genuinely mad trying to beat me i will beat you insisted jennifer i know youll try wasnt that what attracted gerald in the first place the jennifer stone implacable determination to win in all things even husband stealing well see whos the stronger she needed help but who indeed we will jennifer was drawn again to the ward window by the arrival of more people and here is your solicitor announced jane it was there were in fact two geoffrey johnson who led their way into the ward was the family lawyer a plump usually smiling man who smoked oddly shaped and carved pipes and drove a vintage bentley that evening he wasnt smiling momentarily he stood beside the bed twitching towards a handshake he didnt complete when he saw her bandages equally unsure of how to greet jennifer he instead at once introduced the other man as humphrey perry criminal law isnt my field he apologized humphreys our senior partner on the crime side perry was a tall dolefulfaced man with a hedge of black hair encircling a polished bald eggdomed head unlike johnson whose suit was muted check perry wore a lawyers uniform of black striped trousers with black jacket and waistcoat complete with a looped gold watchchain as he pulled forward the chair just vacated by the woman police sergeant now outside talking to the two detectives jennifer saw that perry had very long skeletal fingers at the end of the introduction he moved his head in acknowledgement but didnt immediately speak he didnt smile either theyre frightened of you shut up no shouldnt have spoken given a reply what frowned perry he had a deep sonorous voice i wasnt talking to you said jennifer then oh god she hesitated in a rush she blurted you are going to think i am mad but i am not i know people saw me kill gerald but it wasnt me it was jane shes possessed me johnson coughed and looked down at the floor perry remained expressionless taking a large legal notepad from a very scuffed briefcase he said whos jane lomaxs first wife mumbled johnson still head bent she was diabetic died of an insulin overdose six years ago knowing she was blushing fighting against the absurd impulse to giggle jennifer said she says i murdered her that we both did gerald and i which we didnt its ridiculous perry spent several moments ensuring the lead from a silver propelling pencil protruded to precisely the length he wanted and jane talks to you jennifer slumped back against the pillows again closing her eyes against reality because this couldnt be real i told you youd think i was mad they do they do she says you do said jennifer dully feeling a wash of exhaustion shes talking to you now persisted perry yes how in my head you hear a voice oh dear god wailed jennifer desperately realizing how it was all sounding to the two men help me please help me i will mrs lomax i truly will but you must tell me what happened what you can remember i can remember everything she had to concentrate be rational with this rational expressionless man good so tell me from the very beginning from the time you got up this morning jennifer didnt speak immediately then became horrifyingly aware that she was sitting with her head to one side as if trying to hear something being said to her she straightened abruptly conscious that both men had noticed as strongly and as positively as she was able she said gerald wasnt at home last night he stayed here in london at the flat but he called this morning to talk to me and to emily he always did when he didnt come home i drove emily to playschool and then arranged tonights supper with our housekeeper gerald was coming home tonight it was lamb welsh gerald liked lamb there was a sudden surge of emotion choking her she coughed scrubbing a bandaged hand across her eyes hes dead geralds dead johnson looked wildly around the room as if seeking help perry remained unmoving one immaculate leg crossed over the other notebook balanced on his knee it was perry who spoke do you want a doctor jennifer shook her head not replying you discussed dinner with the housekeeper encouraged perry jaggedvoiced jennifer said playschool ends at noon i went to collect emily i usually do unless im here in london with gerald i was a little late emily had got a prize for learning her letters i promised to take her to the zoo as a reward she trailed away her shoulders beginning to heave again did you pressed perry not wanting a break jennifer shook her head but didnt answer she felt lost falling into darkness her stomach hollowed why not jane told me to get a knife and to come to london do you remember doing that yes but it wasnt as if i was driving what was it like as if i was a passenger was jane talking to you during the drive no what happened when you got to your husbands office im not sure you said you could remember everything i thought i could tell me as much as you can we parked the car we interrupted perry yes repeated jennifer distantly we parked the car i remember going into the building getting into the lift then i was covered in blood bleeding myself and gerald was dead you dont remember the killing no just the blood blood all over gerald he was dead wonderful darling gerald was dead or doing it it took longer this time for jennifer to stop crying she sobbed into the bandaged hand hurting herself with the tug of the saline needle trying to bring her other hand up to her face managing to mumble a protest only when she heard johnson say to the other lawyer that he thought they should call someone im all right i want to go on you dont remember doing it repeated the criminal lawyer relentlessly no nothing at all no you were bleeding yourself prompted perry there were policemen and ambulancemen they put me on a stretcher and brought me here very good jennifer whimpered suddenly jerking back as if pulling away from something what demanded perry shes mocking me again again shes been doing it ever since i got here telltale tit your tongue will split and all the little puppy dogs will get a little bit when was the first time you heard janes voice asked the lawyer today never ever before no she was mad had to be this couldnt be happening to any sane person none of it if she closed her eyes really tightly it would all go away no jennifer corrected not a dream a nightmare real horribly terrifyingly real are you under any medical care mrs lomax before your admission here i mean no said jennifer tightly knowing the question had to be asked but resenting it i could check obviously will have to in fact i want you to said jennifer hurriedly i want you to check with everybody you can to know that i have never in my life suffered any psychiatric illness and that gerald and i were idyllically happy i will mrs lomax good said jennifer in brief defiance it slipped at once you think im mad dont you no and if i am going to represent you and brief counsel on your behalf i shall never lie to you lied the lawyer not mad but a liar about hearing voices i was setting out my position avoided the man so whats your answer to my question i think you are suffering a mental illness yes ive won ive won i am not mentally deranged wouldnt give in couldnt give in will you agree to a psychiatric examination i demand a psychiatric examination perry retracted his pencil point with the care with which he had exposed it and closed the notebook as he did so jennifer saw he had apparently made several pages of notes the lawyer said i dont want any statement made to the police ill tell them that you will be arraigned before a magistrate initially for the formality of a remand in custody there will be no question of bail so i wont bother to apply for it in the circumstances i will ask for that remand to be in a prison hospital wing when youre fit enough to leave here magistrates cannot try a case like this i want you to suffer the whole process i dont give a damn what you want said jennifer to perry she explained jane says she wants me to suffer everything the lawyer nodded showing no surprise you wish me to engage counsel the best you can get is there anything else i can do whats happening to emily how could she have forgotten emily until now instead of replying perry looked sideways to the other solicitor johnson said shes being well looked after by the nanny i want to see her at the moment thats not possible maybe even not advisable refused perry when i dont know admitted the baldheaded man maintaining the promise of honesty maybe not for quite a long time in the corridor outside john bentley accepted with a philosophical shrug the lawyers refusal to allow a statement sure he knew a way to get around it beside his superior malcolm rodgers gestured to the policewomen reentering the ward and said according to them all she does is talk to herself madder than a march hare or a bloody sight cleverer than one challenged bentley meaning queried perry voices in her head possessed by the first wife seeking revenge come on you ever seen a better performance for a plea of diminished responsibility demanded bentley no conceded the lawyer but why kill him in the first place when i find the woman lomax was screwing ill tell you promised the detective in the few hours since seeing jennifer lomax hunched beside the bloodsoaked body of her husband bentley had changed his mind about this being a case with no personal benefit his intuition which he usually followed told him otherwise it wasnt intuition that convinced him lomax had a mistress though that was good old hardassed experience all he had to do was shake the trees and he knew how to do that too back inside the tiny ward jane said just think what its going to he like shut up in an asylum with genuinely mad people for the rest of your life stop it screamed jennifer and thats the way to get there chapter five the role of chamberlain was created in medieval european courts establishing the most important functionary in any royal household a chamberlain was the buffer and passport to any king or queen with his promoting approval eager courtiers were guaranteed title fame and wealth by his obstructing disapproval anxious fortunehunters were forever doomed to oblivion and poverty today there are few european royal courts and those chamberlains that remain do so largely in powerempty office from which they emerge bewigged gartered and plumed for ceremonial occasions in between which they shuffle back to memories of bygone ages and absolute authority rivalling that of the monarchs their predecessors served england is one of those few european countries in which a monarchy and the office of chamberlain still exist one more of doubtful ceremonial value than the other there are however four other very active courts in which operate chamberlains whose sacrosanct judgement is absolute and whose unwritten laws are as unchallengeable as their interpretation of enshrined british legislation they are the inns of court and the chamberlains of their members disdain any title loftier than clerk they need nothing higher than that which every sensible barrister knows those that dont learn fast enough or leave for other professions bert as christened not bertram feltham was the chief clerk of the temple chambers of sir richard proudfoot qc a fiefdom he ran with a ruthlessness that had been enviously likened by lesser chief clerks in other chambers to that of the principles by which the borgias operated and machiavelli would have admired he submitted briefs to his barristers before formal acceptance as protocol required but every one of the chambers eight queens counsel including proudfoot himself knew feltham had vetted the case and personally selected to whom it would be presented in advance of the first discussion and there was never any discussion about anything whatsoever that feltham considered unsuitable he selected his submitting solicitors with the care with which he accepted their cases it was a network that had developed over twenty years and worked after so long more by instinct than by legal formalities those honoured with felthams exdirectory home telephone number knew automatically what might be something for bert those that didnt have the knack only had the office number and feltham rarely accepted their calls humphrey perry had the home number and he rang it that night from the car phone before leaving the hospital grounds you cant be serious protested feltham he had asthma and wheezed wouldnt you like to hear about it there was a long pause you know i dont like wasting my time and this is wasting my time perry felt a bubble of uncertainty despite being in what he considered an assured bargaining position you have to eat lunch somewhere im on a diet smoked salmon and puligny montrachet el vino tomorrow twelvethirty before it gets crowded im nor going to take it lets just have lunch then its been a while dont be late perry arrived early to secure a basement table in the corner the wine was already open when feltham entered precisely at half past twelve he was a man in need of a diet case discussion usually began over lunch his face had the reddening of blood pressure too it was an inverted snobbery some even said felthams personal joke to reject the darksuited uniform of law in the way he dressed today the brassbuttoned sports jacket was brown and black striped with fawn trousers the shirt collar was button down there were perfunctory handshakes perry poured the wine as he did so he said you did well with the hallett case there was a ritual that had to be performed but today there was reason additional to the expected flattery it was predictable wed win the case of peregrine hallett was the most recent cause celebre sir richard proudfoot himself had defended the society financier with minor royal friends against a charge of sharerigging a company takeover exposed a flaw in the banking act that now needed parliamentary legislation to correct and gained hallett an acquittal with costs and a public apology from the trial judge not to most it would have been feltham whod judged the potential from the beginning all good for the chamber wheezed feltham reciting the inviolable credo he did order smoked salmon although a double portion with a salad he soaked in dressing and a side order of new potatoes hows the diet going slowly there was a lot of press coverage about your business in the papers this morning attractive woman isnt she although there was no need for him to diet perry limited himself to a single order of smoked salmon without extras im not interested humphrey shes the beautiful wife of a millionaire commodity trader whom according to what you told me last night and what i read this morning she killed because shes a menopausal paranoid schizophrenic obeying the voice of his first wife i didnt say she was menopausal she isnt the rest is more than sufficient feltham added more dressing to what salad remained you know john bentley feltham nodded headline hunter good copper though best murder track record in the met this isnt going to be one hes proud of he thinks theres another woman and that the voice in the head is all bullshit a preparedinadvance defence feltham looked disappointedly at his empty plate it doesnt matter which way you present it jennifer lomax murdered her husband in front of sixteen people shes guilty im not into formal pleas of mitigation and you know it im surprised you called me i really am he nodded to cheese and port vintage warre in preference to the dow she wants the best she wants a miracle why are you trying so hard lomaxs american parent put all their european business through our corporate division feltham nodded i sympathize and understand and id do it as a favour if it were possible but look at it objectively from my point of view even if the voice in her head is bullshit we couldnt win i dont take cases that are lost before they begin i wouldnt put this to any of my seniors they trust me theyd think i was the one whod gone mad you did do well with hallett feltham looked steadily across the table for several moments weve already talked about that theres an exchange inquiry going on into some copper dealings lomax fronted for some far east dealers how did it go wrong a tokyo dealer got overextended went on buying to cover his losses with money he didnt have persuaded the finance minister in bolivia to use government money for a private portfolio they asked lomax to set up was lomax part of it no sure absolutely but itll go to court here inevitably how long id say itll run for three months maybe four some lichtenstein royalty were conned and a hollywood producer high profile as well as a good earner guaranteed feltham sighed so weve got a problem one that can surely be resolved my seniors trust me repeated feltham its a matter of integrity i understand said perry who did and saw nothing hypocritical or even odd in felthams remark what about jeremy hall feltham smiled you stay on top of things we both do said perry smiling back jeremy hall was the newest arrival at sir richard proudfoots chambers the first barrister in ten years whose acceptance hadnt been subject to felthams veto hall was proudfoots nephew hes under my care arent all your people special care feltham gestured for a second port at its worst shes mad said perry she herself is demanding a psychiatric examination so well know soon enough at its best its a cleverly planned murder all right so its guilty whichever but the moneys guaranteed and if there is another woman hell be able to push the spurned wife defence and she is beautiful so the publicity to the chambers is as assured as the fee it wouldnt hurt just occasionally to be on the side of the underdog would it she cut him to pieces according to this mornings papers temporary insanity all part of the same mitigation im still not totally happy im not saying its perfect how much prelim work would be involved in the copper case two months minimum and the case would run for four at least itll be very worthwhile id have to explain the lomax brief to sir richard of course he was very pleased at the way the hallett thing turned out ive heard the lord chancellor was impressed sir richard would make a good judge agreed feltham smiling in acknowledgement of perrys preparation id be sorry to lose him of course of course agreed perry the chamber accepting an obvious guilty plea wouldnt go against the consideration would it the contrary in fact feltham smiled again good point well made are we agreed then i think so im sorry if i was brusque at the beginning perry shook his head in dismissal whats hall like young a little brash good pass marks not a bad court presence itll improve when ive trained him up special case as i said father was a name at lloyds family was wiped out by the insurance crash the old man killed himself sir richard let hall into the chambers literally as an act of charity he didnt have any money to go anywhere else riches to rags smiled the baldheaded man something like that said feltham unimpressed by the attempted joke whens the remand hearing this afternoon at the hospital you want him to be there perry gave another dismissive gesture itll only be a formality properly handled there will be some mileage in it for the chambers wont there ill look after him promised perry its been a good lunch thank you best of luck with the diet thanks feltham rose but remained standing at the table unwinnable cases are a bastard arent they an absolute bastard agreed perry all sixteen queried rodgers until i get the name insisted bentley the place is a fucking goldfish bowl someone will know who he was screwing like they knew he was popping jennifer while his first wife was alive when do you want to start directly after the magistrates hearing itll be up and down five minutes at the most you want me to warn lomaxs office no said bentley lets surprise them chapter six jennifer was totally exhausted eyes sunk into blackringed hollows skin so numb it tingled and was sensitive to touch as if it had been burned it was a constant effort in the daylight to retain the consciousness shed wanted so desperately to lose during the night but hadnt been able to because of the drip it hurt to reach up with her right hand and the bandages on her left made it difficult to knuckle the drooping tiredness away even to see around her the hospital doctor peter lloyd had refused to give her the stimulant shed asked for saying it would counteract the painkillers she was having hed done so standing well back from the bed when jane had made her call the man an awkward bastard it had been lloyd whom she thought looked too young to be a doctor whod given her the time of the magistrates arrival and shed tried before humphrey perry came to tidy herself with a brush and makeup but she couldnt control the shake any more her lipstick had smudged unevenly and shed had to stop where her lip was swollen and split and the liner was a mistake on eyes already too dark the tears when shed cried from frustration as well as grief had made the mascara run and she hadnt been able to clean properly the marks from her face and knew she looked dirty and unwashed she wouldnt let me sleep not at all she kept on at me all night jennifer announced as the solicitor came into her room she saw one of the two departing policewomen shaking her head do what i like do what i like its all right perry didnt think hed shown any reaction but supposed there must have been something he felt a twitch of pity despite what shed done mentally sick people werent responsible for their actions however horrifying its not i look like a mad woman you sure do honey perry didnt think he would have recognized the gaunt cadaverousfaced woman lying on the bed in front of him as the svelte sophisticated person photographed and named as jennifer lomax in that mornings newspapers if she continued to look like this it would contribute to the only plea it was possible to enter itll only last a few minutes today ive got to stop her youve got to help me stop her you cant neither can he i will promised perry emptily hed probably be back in the office in time to call the psychiatrists hed employed in the past mason was good so was denning hed use both and anyone else they suggested get it over as quickly as possible bert feltham was right unwinnable cases were a bastard what have you done already demanded jennifer she gripped the edge of the sheet and then covered one hand with the other to stop the trembling it didnt were going to use sir richard proudfoots chambers theyre the best is he a qc perry hesitated with a choice of reply to a question he hadnt wanted proudfoot is yes jennifer caught the qualification he is going to represent me isnt he proudfoot himself she felt her eyes closing despite herself and stretched her face to keep them open distorting her features and making her broken lip hurt his junior at first jeremy hall avoided the solicitor was she consciously pulling faces at him fleetingly he wondered if it was safe to have the policewomen out of the ward there didnt seem to be anything in the room she could use as a weapon but it will be proudfoot at the trial theres some way to go before we get that far cant you see hes lying you stupid bitch jennifer moved to speak but stopped trying to assemble the words first straightening against the pillows i am not pleading guilty i am not guilty and i am not mad and i want the best not a junior youve got the best believe me it was going to become very tiresome before it was all over hall was going to earn the chambers copper brief how old is jeremy hall i dont know how long has be belonged to the chambers perry shifted uncomfortably theyre the best because they only take the best i want a qc the most foremost criminal barrister there is hes going through the motions thats all any of them are going to do things have to go in sequence in a proper order recited perry weve got to have this committal hearing and the proper medical and clinical examinations and then pretrial discussions before we even get into a proper court you must trust me i wont let you down but i think it would be advisable to give geoffrey johnson your power of attorney to make sure everything goes smoothly while youre youre indisposed ive brought the authorizing document for you to sign he doesnt give a fuck all he wants is the money ask him what hes going to charge jennifer didnt momentarily pleased she was able to resist instead she remained looking at the man feeling the despair as well as the frustration and exhaustion there was nothing she could do she was helpless she tried to bite her lip gnawing back the whimper forgetting the split thats exactly what you are helpless jane says im helpless perry sighed at the new face she was pulling but glad the delusion had taken over youre not you know youre not your lips bleeding listen to the lying bugger what about emily jennifer was pleased again excited that shed managed to change the subject without janes intervention she ran her tongue over the cut we told you last night shes all right that the nanny is looking after her perry hadnt bothered to check and made another reminder note to see if geoffrey johnson had done so it was more johnsons responsibility as the family lawyer he had to tell the man about the power of attorney too i want emily told that i love her that i cant come home at the moment but that i love her and will see her soon how exactly do you think youre going to see her soon ill ensure shes told that jennifer felt another dip of despair she had noone she abruptly realized no mother no father not alive any more gerald and emily were her life had been her life noone else what about rebecca rebecca was a friend shed help had to help stupid not to have thought of rebecca before been allowed to think of rebecca before she qualified abruptly she pulled herself upright aware shed had her head to one side again listening had to stop that stop looking mad theres a trader at geralds company were friends rebecca nicholls i want her to come here she can see emily for me perry made a note of the name with his carefully pointed propelling pencil im going to oppose any transfer from here today the doctors dont want it but youll need clothes perhaps i can ask he paused is it miss or mrs nicholls miss where was jane why wasnt she jeering mocking perhaps i can ask miss nicholls to do that for you if she will she will said jennifer confidently incredible she hadnt thought of rebecca before although perhaps it wasnt but now she had so it was all right rebecca wouldnt treat her as if she was mad rebecca even believed in clairvoyants went to fortune tellers there was movement from the door and people entered as a group ahead of those jennifer recognized bentley and rodgers and the policewomen there was a tightly costumed openfaced woman with rigidly permed grey hair slightly behind her was a distracted disordered man who appeared to have difficulty with two files he was trying to carry in addition to a briefcase a second man also carried a briefcase and was supervising the policewomen manoeuvring ahead of them two tables like the one that fitted over jennifers bed for meals she had so far been unable to eat a nurse and a doctor at the very rear carried chairs the room became almost impossibly overcrowded from the rear dr lloyd said we could all move to somewhere larger if you like the greyhaired woman looked at perry and said im happy if you are its not going to take long is it the voice was the strident one of someone accustomed to being obeyed in an apparent afterthought she turned to the distracted man and said do you mind its going to be brief as far as i am concerned agreed perry the other man said strictly formal he put his files and briefcase down on one of the hospital tables and looked at jennifer curiously for several moments before fumbling with his papers perry edged around the bed to put himself beside the other man they nodded to each other before introducing themselves by name to the woman the distracted mans name was norman burden despite the formality both men seemed to know her anyway but for the benefit of the unidentified court clerk at the edge of her table the woman named herself as gillian heathcote in the same breath she said briskly right lets get on with it shall we burden immediately called bentley who made a movement as if coming forward but in fact didnt because there was no room he recited the memorized oath and then unprompted said that at threethirty the previous afternoon he had responded to a call to the commodity trading offices of encocorps inc in leadenhall street there in a thirdfloor office he had found the body of an american gerald james lomax there were extensive injuries there were at least fifteen stab wounds as well as a number of deep cuts slash wounds to the face neck and body there had been a considerable loss of blood and the office which i ascertained to be that of lomax was heavily bloodstained mrs lomax who was also bleeding extensively from knife injuries was slumped on the floor against an internal window in my opinion she was close to unconsciousness she was removed to this hospital where i saw her at six fortyfive last evening at seventhirty i formally charged mrs lomax with the murder of her husband bentley paused looking expectantly towards burden prompted the prosecuting solicitor said there are a number of other enquiries to be made before this matter can be proceeded with and i would formally ask madam for a remand in custody i have no objection to that remand initially being here in this hospital i understand from the doctor he considers mrs lomax should remain under observation for several more days it was as if she didnt exist thought jennifer outraged they were talking about her and across her but noone was even looking at her mr perry invited the magistrate i have no objection to that course madam at a later date in view of mrs lomaxs injuries and other matters that need consideration i would ask for any further remands to be in a hospital wing of a prison what about my objections everyone looked at jennifer as if for the first time visibly stunned by the outburst before there was any other reaction jennifer said i am not guilty i want everyone to know that mr perry demanded the woman tell the bitch to shut up and let you speak shut up let me speak blurted jennifer then no oh no damn damn damn caught you forgot i was here didnt you now now soothed the doctor almost unseen dont patronize me as if i were mad none of you i apologize said perry hurriedly as i said there are other matters to be pursued medical and specialist examinations i said dont patronize me jennifer screamed at her lawyer then still shouting to bentley tell them what i said when you charged me mrs lomax please tried perry tell them yelled jennifer go ahead said gillian heathcote nodding to the detective the frumpy cow is patronizing you worst of all dont patro started jennifer then stopped say it she says youre patronizing me worst of all she says demanded the magistrate bewildered when i charged mrs lomax she said she hadnt killed her husband that it was jane bentley paused in a rare moment of embarrassment jane lomax was the first wife of the murdered man gillian heathcote smiled bleakly turning to perry i understand i want everyone to understand said jennifer her voice cracked from shouting she came forward on her pillows wincing as the drip needle bit into her arm she couldnt support herself and at once fell back against the pillows aware the magistrate had instinctively retreated at the movement jennifer tried to prevent it but she couldnt stop the crying i didnt kill him i loved him i think we can bring this quickly to an end said the magistrate anxiously i agree to a formal remand for seven days she remained half standing looking at perry again i fully understand your problems but i think you should do all you can at future hearings to keep your client under some sort of control god this is fun this really is so much fun jeremy hall came hesitantly into his uncles rooms momentarily stopping completely when he saw bert feltham comfortably seated beside sir richards desk proudfoot himself was framed against the window overlooking the inner temple and the manicured grass leading down towards the thames come in come in encouraged the older barrister interesting case to discuss the lomax killing said feltham uninvited you read about it in the papers briefly said hall he was a big man the height accentuated by a build developed at cambridge where hed gained a rowing blue anxious that it wouldnt turn to fat he tried to scull as many weekends as possible he appeared far too big for the chair towards which proudfoot gestured him its going to be a highprofile case get your name in the papers encouraged the older man he was tall too the greying hair swept back but worn comparatively long to fashion into two distinct wings on either side of his head he affected a slow measured delivery when he spoke either in court or out that afternoons stance was a favourite too hands clasped behind his back winged head slightly forward a lecturing pose from the papers it looked like a simple domestic said hall after only nine months in chambers he wasnt in a position to argue against any brief but there wasnt any reason unquestionably to accept whatever he was presented with there was still some lingering regret at having had to join his uncles practice in the first place instead of being able to make his way independently in a rival chambers although he reassured himself there was even less reason to let pride outweigh the practical reality of earning a decent living after working so bloody hard for so bloody long getting a double first as well as his rowing blue and the pass marks he had in the bar examinations that and the fact hed had no alternative as his mother had told him at his fathers funeral beggars couldnt be choosers he didnt enjoy being a beggar itll be a guilty to manslaughter said feltham confidently diminished responsibility so it comes down to a plea of mitigation said hall whats that going to be humphrey perrys instructing arranging the usual psychiatric things short sharp but extremely profitable said proudfoot from the window it wont do the chambers or you any harm in fact im anxious for you to do it weve had a long run of wins wrong for a practice to appear only to take the ones theyre sure of and this wont be a loss itll be a brilliant plea he smiled which i knowit will be for a sad sick woman proudfoot finished what he was saying at an open cabinet and as he leaned forward to accept the sherry his uncle offered hall was suddenly curious why such a case had to be pressed upon him over sherry by the chambers head even if it was his uncle according to office lore feltham would have already accepted the brief anyway still unwilling to accept a fait accompli hall said ill be by myself absolutely confirmed proudfoot to feltham hall said shes mad no other reason or motive police havent finished yet but there doesnt seem to be any doubt cut her husband to pieces in front of sixteen people and then stood there laughing ive fixed a meeting for you with perry for tomorrow so much for the pretence of discussion before acceptance thought hall pointedly confident he could do it because proudfoot was his uncle hall said theres nothing else to it is there nothing else said proudfoot i dont understand the question it seems almost hall paused almost too mundane too small compared to most of the things we do ive explained my thinking on that said proudfoot i understand capitulated hall detecting the older mans irritation he was being railroaded hall realized eleven tomorrow morning ok here in chambers said feltham who already knew it would be because he maintained the appointment diaries and knew halls was hungrily empty fine agreed hall a well publicized murders the best fast track for a reputation confided the chief clerk this could be a good beginning itll be my first murder admitted hall but not the last if you handle this one right as proudfoot served him his second whisky after hall had left the room feltham said that was a sharp question about a hidden agenda his ability was more important than his relationship to me insisted proudfoot hes damned clever the man added to his own glass disdaining the earlier sherry perry wouldnt do anything underhand about the copper thing would he feltham shook his head smiling there isnt a solicitor in london whod try to cheat me certainly not one whod get half a chance to do it a second time its more than their jobs worth thats good to hear said proudfoot were not wasting our time on a tuppenny murder for nothing patricia boxall didnt really want the relationship to end but knew it was inevitable so she suspected did jeremy if it came down to a straight comparison jeremy had more going for him than alexander he was adventurous in bed and made her laugh a lot but she wanted more than chinese takeaways and spanish plonk in front of the television watching videos of old oxford and cambridge boat races alexander had an independent income and belonged to all the good clubs she had been just two tables away from mick jagger the night before last that was a hell of a race hall said you showed me before we were drunk for a week after that patricia wondered whod paid must have been fun i got a case today the murder thats in all the papers shes mad isnt she seems that way what can you do enter a sympathy plea any money in it not a lot i wouldnt think it wont last long why do it then i havent been offered anything else admitted hall and i dont like having to watch old videos of boat races because im broke any more than you do lets go to bed then well said john bentley triumphantly noones admitted anything yet cautioned rodgers wait cautioned bentley just you wait how long an hour five pounds says itll take more than one session youre on chapter seven rebecca nicholls was slim and blond and enjoyed the effect she had upon men particularly upon those to whom she was clearly unavailable as she was to this overconfident policeman whod emphasized his rank and held the handshake too long and dressed like an upmarket car salesman in other circumstances she might have amused herself with this encounter but this afternoon these most definitely werent the circumstances not that she was nervous she could handle it but she wished there hadnt been the feeling of uncertainty she wasnt an uncertain person rebecca allowed the open admiration of her legs when she crossed them otherwise sitting demurely with her hands in her lap in the secretarys side office inwardlysteeling herself against looking in the direction of lomaxs adjoining room plastic sheeting had been draped completely over the outsides of the vast windows hiding everything but she didnt need any reminder of the scene inside that still needed the police release to be cleaned she hoped she didnt break down although there was a perfectly understandable reason if she did having witnessed a murder and now being questioned about it for a second time like it was perfectly understandable for her to have shivered when shed entered so close to the unseen horror they shouldnt have done this here in the building itself if they had to do it at all it should have been somewhere outside a police station even im sorry to trouble you again bentley who prided himself on his adjustable interrogation technique was sure he knew just how to handle this haughty bitch nice legs though all the way up to her ass good tits too ive already told your sergeant what i saw inspector corrected bentley nodding sideways to the other man rodgers is an inspector not a sergeant rebecca sighed inspector then im just filling in the gaps trying to fit things together said bentley the tone still apologetic what is it you want to know demanded rebecca impatiently youre very busy of course of course but i want to help if i can although i dont see how bentley appeared to study rebeccas initial statement open before him youve been at encocorps now for ten years rebecca supplied when the pause stretched quite so ten years bentley smiled up youre american i transferred from the new york office six years ago ive already told your inspector this as well bentley detective superintendent bentley was thick all mouth and trousers it wasnt going to be too difficult at all indeed you have did you know gerald lomax in new york before he came here rebecca hesitated not before he transferred here to run the operation no but you did know him we met during his home visits home visits meaning when he went back to new york is this important there was another sigh bentley regarded her blank faced what ms nicholls i dont see what relevance there might be upon his murder in how and when i met gerald she shouldnt have made the challenge gerald what smartassed fucking car salesman is that what you called him gerald he was your boss rebecca uncrossed her legs knowing she was in control you ever been to america superintendent it was silly using his sort of emphasis on the rank but she couldnt help it wonderful country but you havent noticed that in america people call each other by their given names bentley smiled contentedly slipped my mind but hasnt how and when you met gerald any relevance miss nicholls she wouldnt be haughty in bed probably went like a steam train ive told you i cant see any everything is relevant in a murder investigation ms nicholls rebecca was disconcerted by the way the man kept stressing the ms i would have hardly thought what happened here yesterday requires much investigation weve all told you what we saw she shivered again like i said im just fitting the parts together rebecca breathed out again heavily ive worked for encocorps for a total of ten years quite obviously i would meet gerald lomax during his trips to new york he was a colleague the bastard was groping maybe guessing maybe someone down below had an inclination but thats all there was all there could have been they were waiting for her to admit something and there was no way she was going to do that gerald lomax came to london nine years ago im not sure of the precise date youre not queried bentley appearing surprised i told you i wasnt bentley paused looking down at the scattered papers on the desk in front of him gerald lomax was transferred from new york i believe so youre not sure of that either no you worked for encocorps for ten years and gerald lomax was only transferred nine years ago surely there was a years overlap in new york when you would have worked together rebecca smiled stretching the indulgent pause as long as possible patiently speaking slowly as if for someone who needed simple words to understand simple things she said i joined encocorps in their paris office i worked there for two years before going to new york by which time gerald lomax had been moved here i worked in new york for two years before coming to london does that fit your parts together bentley made an expansive gesture with spreadapart hands perfectly so you met first during his visits to new york thats what i said a business colleague what else rebeccas growing confidence dipped there werent any social occasions she shrugged there may have been situations in new york that could be described as social business receptions things like that may have been none that you can specifically remember no what about mrs lomax what about her do you know mrs lomax rebecca gestured behind her to the trading area below we worked on the floor together before she married gerald so you knew her as a business colleague like you knew mr lomax we were friends were are we dont havent seen as much of each other since she had emily and moved to the country youre emilys godmother arent you who told you that demanded the woman actually turning to stare down at the working floor bentley made a vague gesture someone said it in one of the statements you are arent you yes so you know mrs lomax very well i suppose so yes you sound reluctant it depends upon what you mean by very well what do you mean by very well ms nicholls damn the ms rebecca said we really havent seen as much of each other in the last couple of years longer maybe as we once did thats what i mean that weve kind of drifted apart you were much closer when she worked here when she lived in london yes did you know of her affair with gerald lomax when she worked here thats an impertinent question bentley smiled thats what policeman do ms nicholls ask impertinent questions did you yes because you were close friends or because in these working surroundings bentley gestured to the openplan allglass working area its difficult to hide anything as a friend first then it became pretty much common knowledge how did you feel about it feel about it gerald lomax was a married man it was their business not mine you didnt have any moral feeling i said it was their business why did jennifer lomax kill her husband rebecca didnt have to feign the surprise at the abrupt hard demand i havent the slightest idea how on earth should i know shed found out hadnt she about you and gerald rebecca didnt speak from the warmth she knew she was colouring there was nothing to find out about gerald and me its difficult to hide anything in a place like this reminded bentley there was no proof the bastards down below might have guessed but they didnt know she and gerald had been far more discreet than he had been with jennifer so they didnt know and noone could prove anything i had no relationship with gerald lomax rebecca was pleased at the steadiness in her voice its a nice flat isnt it what geralds here in london a nice flat ive only been there once at a party for emily but yes it is a nice flat she shouldnt have qualified the visit when would that have been it must be more than a year ago what was he getting at theyd always been discreet there too not weeks ago or just days no the security would have influenced lomaxs choice i suppose said bentley conversationally he loved questioning people who despised him thought they were cleverer very american rebecca felt emptied by uncertainty i dont understand youre on the cctv recording ms nicholls weve got you several times its a long loop but it doesnt go back years rebecca nicholls sat motionless without expression for several moments before she began to sob there were no tears bentley and rodgers afterwards agreed that it was always the same once the dam broke you got washed away in the confessional flood water until in the end you had to say something positive to get them to stop telling you the sexual fetishes of their grandmothers pet hamster rebecca nicholls admitted the affair had begun a month before emily had been born and gave dates and hotels where she and gerald lomax had travelled together on overseas business trips in addition to her accompanying him on the threetimesayear updating and assessment returns to new york but jennifer never knew you want me to pull down those screens and tell me that again demanded bentley he had what he wanted he didnt have to go around in circles any more this was the part when she learned he wasnt the dickhead shed thought him to be but the hardest bastard shed ever met and that hed been playing with her enjoying himself all the time are you going to charge me with anything fucking a married man isnt a crime not in this country at least what then she showed no outrage at the dismissive obscenity hed won she supposed it was a spoil of victory to humiliate her bring a proper prosecution against jennifer lomax she didnt kill gerry because of me sure it was going to be a good case after all fuckable woman eternal triangle jealousy revenge all the ingredients plus a bloody clever convincing almost load of bollocks about hearing voices telling jennifer what to do bentley was conscious of rodgers looking at his watch beside him he gave an imperceptible nod in return gerry was going to tell her get a divorce did he pounced rodgers sharing the questioning now no he said hed tell me before he did but he didnt say anything so he hadnt told her it was wrong reflected bentley to believe it was only men who had their brains between their legs so you tell me ms nicholls why you think jennifer lomax came in here yesterday and tried to turn her husband into hamburger the americanism for an american had come to him after hed begun speaking and he was proud of it i wasnt responsible for his death real tears began at last if it hadnt been you it would have been someone else said rodgers it was well past conclusion time we loved each other we were going to get married and live happily ever after said bentley yes jennifer was a mistake like jane had been a mistake jesus thought bentley its a bastard the search for eternal happiness maybe hes found it now whats going to happen to me youll be called as a witness i wont testify dont tell me what you are or are not going to do ms nicholls warned bentley savouring the attitude rebecca had attempted towards him at the beginning if you try to be stupid youll be subpoenaed and if you refuse in court youll be jailed for contempt among all those tonguelicking dykes and if you try to leave the country ill apply for an international arrest warrant which wont achieve much but itll guarantee your name and photograph all over every newspaper you can think of and everyone can make up their own mind whether you were responsible or not bastard believe it ill lose my job you probably will agreed rodgers it had just gone past the floodgates time bentley thought the same thank you for your help i dont want to go back downstairs not this afternoon go home then said bentley isnt there any other way pleaded the woman tentatively not even on your back with your legs splayed thought bentley a man has been murdered horribly my only interest is in seeing that justice is done she has to know jennifer i mean she already does doesnt she bentley pointed out i suppose so gerald should have told me gerald should have done a lot of things he didnt and not done a lot of the things that he did picked up rodgers as the door closed behind the girl he stood looking down critically at the other man what the hell were you trying to do to me about seeing that justice is done they both laughed bentley said lomax must have had a dick like a donkey and used it like one agreed rodgers you took a hell of a chance about a security camera we dont even know if there is one she wouldnt have known either she was too arrogant he grinned just like one of those television films wasnt it lucky insisted rodgers but i was right about another woman wasnt i you took longer than an hour to prove it argued rodgers ceremoniously bentley took a fivepound note from his wallet and handed it to the other man you could have done it under the hour said rodgers accepting the bet i cant stand superior cows like that i enjoyed myself bringing her down that was worth five pounds can you imagine those legs locked around your neck rodgers offered the money back you were right about the case itself bentley took his money back wrapped and parcelled weve got the classic womanscorned scenario whats the voice in her head going to tell her now that she tried but lost said bentley its a fucking nuisance weve got to go through things properly that was part of it wasnt it realized rodgers refusing any statement until she had a solicitor jennifer lomax is a very cunning killer judged bentley weve got ourselves another good one here malcolm itll run for the second night in succession bert feltham got a call at home from humphrey perry things look very different announced perry there was another woman it looks as if jennifer lomax found out shes faking the voice in her head it still inevitably had to be a guilty plea but it could turn out better noone liked insanity bentley wants to interview her tomorrow at the hospital your mans got to be there with me obviously what time ten there could be more mileage in this than we thought isnt that why i have your home number perry was being wise after the event but feltham didnt challenge him chapter eight jennifer jennifer stone as she then was had been encocorps leading london trader during her last two years with the firm it had been one of lomaxs early jokes that hed fallen in love with her professionally long before hed been attracted in any other way all traders have to know markets to be able to assess margins and percentages but the very best additionally can feel to judge instinctively when a price has peaked and is about to fall or whether it has the buoyancy of a few more points or a commodity can go up a few more cents to attain that extra eighth or quarter per cent that turns a good position into a spectacular one jennifer could know and feel and had the added ability of a gambler able photographically to memorize every card played in a poker game indeed it was a soon abandoned party trick for her mentally to add and multiply and subtract complicated equations faster than people could compete on pocket calculators all of which still only made up part of the legend of jennifer stone it was completed by an awesome determination to be the best to overcome any opposition or obstacle in any trading deal upon which she embarked it was another of gerald lomaxs remarks that hed had jennifer in mind when he attached for piranha fish to the description of the totally glassed office as a goldfish bowl the combination of abilities and attitudes made jennifer special and without conceit or arrogance she knew it like she knew she definitely wasnt mad to allow herself to think that would be the final abandonment giving jane the ultimate victory and shed never do that it had been good fulfilling to have an unusual unique mind to be different living as shed lived after her marriage had never been quite enough shed never admitted it but shed felt wasted unused when shed finally accepted it would be untenable for her to remain on a trading floor controlled by her husband or work on another in competition against him now she didnt have that special mind any more it had been stolen from her invaded and when she forced herself beyond the horror of geralds killing and the numbing ebb and flow of exhaustion and the terrifying unbelievable unreality of what was happening to her ghosts didnt exist spiritual possession was nonsense jennifers overwhelming feeling was of outrage of being mentally raped shed lost gerald whom shed adored she wasnt going to lose anything more she was going to defeat jane stop whatever it was being done to her whatever it took whatever she had to do to achieve it shed never lost anything upon which shed set her mind in the past and she wasnt going to lose now it took a long time for jennifer to get to that conclusion jane was constantly with her every unsteady step of every weary thought knowing each thought as it came jeering and gloating over every one to goad jennifer into the furious even shouted responses that were met with sighs and headshakes from the successive guarding policewomen bur jennifer learned in the persistently interrupted disjointed process it was unconscious at first an impression rather than a proper awareness her boneaching exhaustion triggered it at janes mockery of how grotesque she would look after the second utterly sleepless night she intended to impose that and the physical sensation of numbness which jennifer had imagined to be all part of the same fatigue until that is she made a different connection the tingling like the tingle of knocking the humerus in her elbow seemed to precede by the merest fraction of a second the sound of jane in her head when there was no voice a momentary gap in the possession there was no numbness it wasnt a positive experiment jennifer then hadnt learned enough in the evening of the second day confronted with the agony of not sleeping again jennifer very positively experimented waiting for a moment of normality when the nurses were fixing another drip before blurting please give me something very strong tonight to make me sleep the feeling at once suffused her no jennifers jaw hurt in her determination not to speak no you dont want it there was a note from the night staff yesterday that you didnt sleep agreed one of the nurses you were distressed please gritted jennifer through clamped teeth careless of the pain from her lip i need something so tired very tired jennifers skin was on fire worse than ever before you all right said the second nurse youre very red just want to sleep if she said anything about jane they would dismiss her wanting a sedative as part of the madness not give her anything say it jennifer stayed rigid faced say it damn you ill see what i can do promised the first nurse it should be all right jennifers shaking which the nurses and the policewomen had become accustomed to was from the physical effort of hanging on of staying silent until the nurses left the room as soon as the door closed behind them jennifer said beat you she spoke very quietly her head sunk on her chest the nearest policewoman looked aware of the mutter but not hearing the words you wont not again well see jennifer was euphoric wanting to laugh laugh then jennifer tightened her mouth again another mistake warned me against it jennifer tried but couldnt stop the moan at the screech of anger that pounded agonizingly through her head beat you she managed beat you again you cant drug me out they cant drug me out why are you so frightened then so angry there was another echoing scream as loud as before so angry jane lost control havent you lost control to me she wasnt going to laugh aloud but she was still buoyant at the excitement of fighting back not going to do you any good though is it still wont be able to convince anyone youre not mad still the rest of your life in a mental asylum jennifer shook her head ill find a way like i found this way jennifer brought her head up at the arrival of two new policewomen for the nightshift changeover anything asked the newlyarriving sergeant ignoring jennifer the departing sergeant said spent all afternoon mumbling to herself totally off her head listen to them im not off my head shouted jennifer none of the women bothered to look at her jennifer stones a stupid drone so much off her head might as well be dead shitty poetry dismissed jennifer i thought it was funny jennifer went to speak but quickly stopped halted by the entry of the nurse whod changed the saline drip now she carried a kidney bowl covered by a cloth ill override it the doctor says its ok that you need to get some sleep waste of time please said jennifer offering her free arm sighing at the prick of the needle going into her arm thank you thank you so very much jennifer never fully lost consciousness it was like the sort of halfasleep awareness shed sometimes had when she knew she was dreaming and stayed like a spectator refusing properly to wake up except this wasnt a dream but the distant frenzied voice of jane trying to get through the sedation becoming even more hysterical when jennifer refused as shed refused with the real dreams it was still early although daylight when she did surrender but jane wasnt inside her head jennifer remained lying as she was waiting but there was nothing and hurriedly jennifer began thinking of the day ahead seizing the respite humphrey perry hadnt given a time but she expected him to come that morning with the barrister hed said jeremy hall nice enough name but not a qc it probably wasnt etiquette to make the protest direct to the man but she would bypass perry completely and if he didnt like it engage another solicitor she couldnt be bothered with niceties as desperate as she was shed still do her best not to offend hall of course make it clear she wanted to retain him as well but insist her defence be headed by the most experienced person proudfoot himself in fact she hoped perry would have already contacted rebecca would they let rebecca come personally here to the hospital no reason why they shouldnt it would be better if she could talk to rebecca direct rather than relay messages through perry she needed to talk to someone besides police and lawyers needed a friend her only friend she had to make a list in her head of the clothes she wanted brought in suits she supposed for the court appearances when she was discharged from here and from the hospital wing of whatever prison she was sent to and for the psychiatrists meetings important she talk to perry about that today get things set up immediately to be declared sane not totally off her head and stop being regarded by everyone like the bearded woman in a sideshow except she supposed that when everybody at last believed her shed be considered even more of an oddity a lot to think about think about and get under way end the whole terrible nightmare it was good being able to think like this think clearly logically as shed always been able to think to have her mind back when would it start again the chanting and the mockery a distracting question not important what was important was getting everything she had to do established in her head not to forget anything good to feel better and she did feel better not fully rested because she hadnt rested fully but enough sufficient to be able to work things out as she was working them out now she wasnt shaking either her hands and arms were throbbing from the cuts but not badly wouldnt need painkillers just another sedative that night knew how to get it now how to beat jane the numbness warned her no you dont i had a wonderful nights sleep you heard me not a sound liar shes awake at it again jennifer shuffled herself upright at the policewomans voice the dayshift sergeant was at the door looking enquiringly at the yawning pair getting up stiffly from the easy chairs in which they had spent the night the new arrivals positioned themselves with their backs to jennifer so that she didnt hear the muffled exchanges but she was conscious of the looks from all of them for the first time they didnt appear patronizing one smiled and nodded at something one of the others said what demanded jennifer superintendent bentley is coming to see you this morning announced the day sergeant what about instead of replying the woman said how is the voice janes started sure said the sergeant and smiled sideways at the other newlyarrived policewoman who smiled back what is it insisted jennifer exasperated youll have to wait for the superintendent im as curious as you are stop it the policewoman remained smiling the sergeant said that damned voice again you know it is do i theyre taking the piss out of you jennifer jennifer fought back a response grateful for the entry of the nurse with washing water and the repeated announcement that the police were coming to see her and your lawyer he asked me to tell you when she began her makeup jennifer realized her hands were shaking again although not as badly as the previous morning today there were no smudged lines and the swelling on her lip had gone down enough to complete the colouring she managed her hair more successfully than the previous day too her eyes were still ringed although not as darkly as before she was glad there was no sensation to warn her of jane easily able without interruption to call to mind everything she wanted to tell humphrey perry she actually smiled when the shiny domed solicitor came into the ward ahead of another man who politely held the door for the policewomen to leave perry remained expressionless introducing jeremy hall who did smile back although very briefly the police are coming to see me announced jennifer at once we know said perry thats why were here to talk to you first there are things i want to sort out with you jennifer began but perry cut across her we want to establish something at once mrs lomax they dont give a fuck about what you want jennifers skin began to burn i want in fact to hear your story said hall the voice was very deep more resonant than the solicitors an actors voice almost and it was not until she concentrated fully upon the man that jennifer realized how big he was broad as well as tall she decided surprised that he reminded her of gerald younger maybe but only by a few years same blue eyes and the direct talkingonlytoyou concentration she could even find a similarity in the voice although geralds hadnt been so deep it registered mostly with her in the selfassured unhurried way in which hall actually spoke a person confident of his own ability unlike everyone else he wasnt frightened of her expecting her without warning to do something violent not that he would have had any cause to worry as obviously fit as he was a sportsman she guessed what sport an active energetic one to have a build like that rugby maybe the two men took the chairs vacated by the policewomen why dont you try to compare the size of their dicks jennifer jumped but managed to hold back from replying the effort made the shake worsen momentarily hear what exactly it was this voice that made you go to london coaxed hall jane yes you couldnt stop yourself it wasnt me it was jane using my body your husband hadnt been home the previous night no he stayed away two or three nights a week on average but he was always home at weekends that was the arrangement was there any other arrangement mrs lomax intruded perry theyre out to trick you jane says youre trying to trick me perry sighed audibly the other man didnt perry said you didnt answer my question i didnt understand it were there any difficulties in your marriage demanded hall directly what have we got here janes voice was excited i still dont understand insisted jennifer a feeling began a faint nausea deep in her stomach perry sighed again more loudly were you and your husband happily married or did he spend two or three nights away from home for other reasons no said jennifer as forcefully as she could gerald was not having an affair you sure im not jennifer shook her head but didnt speak i am going to do my best to defend you against a charge of murder mrs lomax said hall thats one of the things i want to discuss with you please hear your counsel out broke in perry again we have to get things clear in our mind before the police interview see dont give a fuck make your point demanded jennifer to the younger man she wouldnt be bullied you will be if i am going to do that defend you you have to be completely honest with me jennifer succeeded with a half smile i know its bizarre preposterous but i am possessed by geralds first wife jane she thinks gerald and i conspired in her murder which of course we didnt the inquest verdict was that she died from an inexplicable overdose of insulin you did you did hall refused to respond to perrys look instead he stayed upon jennifer and said you know full well that is not a viable defence it is as you say preposterous unless of course you expect a lesser charge to which we can plead diminished responsibility which would result in a custodial care sentence with reviews until you could be declared recovered and then released back into the community he paused released after a comparatively limited term of imprisonment the heat jennifer felt was more from anger than from janes presence her first impulse was to shout at the man but she stifled the urge instead calmly she said how much opportunity have you had to discuss this case with mr perry not a great deal conceded hall it had in fact been less than two hours and that included their conversation on the way to the hospital in the car it was proving more difficult than hed expected to get rid of this voiceinthehead nonsense but shed obviously prepared it for a long time so he supposed he had to expect some resistance what has he told you about how i intend to plead not guilty not guilty to murder and not guilty to any lesser charge jennifer insisted its no good he doesnt believe you yes accepted the barrister what has mr perry told you about psychiatrists that you wish to undergo psychiatric examination and assessment jennifer let her anger go at last so what the hells all this about diminished responsibility and short sentences i will plead not guilty to a charge of murder and only to a charge of murder nothing less and be declared sane and be found not guilty mrs lomax said perry patiently that is not an option no court no judge will accept it any of it make them hall had been sitting almost languidly one leg triangled over the other as always the chair appeared too small now he put both feet firmly on the ground and leant towards her to emphasize what he intended to say there are other circumstances in which a charge of murder could be proceeded with then why are we having this discussion demanded jennifer uncaring how often she interrupted you expect to be declared sane said hall i am sane she was irritated by perry sitting there taking notes with that ridiculous silver pencil if you were declared sane and a court accepted that opinion from psychiatrists there would be prosecution evidence from sixteen witnesses of your having stabbed your husband to death the mandatory sentence for murder is life imprisonment in the circumstances of this case i have to warn you a judges recommendation could be for that term to be a minimum of twenty years got you one way or another why should i want to murder a husband i adored pleaded jennifer here comes the man who believes he knows said perry as bentley came forcefully into the ward its time for us to have a proper conversation mrs lomax declared the murder squad detective confidently the tiny room became as crowded as it had been for the magistrates hearing hospital tables were moved in again one almost completely occupied by recording equipment by apparent prearrangement malcolm rodgers became its operator plugging leads into the mains supply and quietly mouthing into the microphone to test sound levels satisfied he transferred the microphone to the table already positioned over jennifers bed whats going on demanded jennifer i can hardly wait shut up said jennifer forgetting herself the heavily breathing perry breathed out again looking at hall before saying we have agreed to a formal police interview in our presence without discussion with me jennifer was aware of rodgers hurriedly identifying the tape her by name and the place and date at which it was being made is there any reason for you to refuse demanded bentley at once youre like some experiment under their microscope the need to concentrate an awareness of challenges she refused to anticipate despite the lingering nausea made it easier to ignore the voice like turning down a volume my last legal advice was against making any statement she reminded stiffly looking at perry as she spoke this isnt a statement insisted bentley it is an interview to further our enquiries jennifer looked to her two lawyers for help when neither spoke she said but able according to your official caution to be presented in any prosecution against me i will permit nothing that will endanger your defence promised hall ask him how many times hes defended in a murder case demanded jane jennifer reminded herself she hadnt needed any specific reason to insist upon a senior practising topofhisprofession barrister to replace jeremy hall but if she had this could have provided it it wouldnt stop with hall and she didnt give a damn about offence either shed get rid of him and the stickthin idiot with a head like an egg to whom the length of a pencil lead seemed so important who do you know whos better it could still be produced in court persisted jennifer they were treating her like an idiot like a mad woman and she wouldnt allow that wasnt mad wasnt mad wasnt mad yes agreed the detective i assure you began hall im not impressed by your assurances snapped jennifer which well discuss after this meeting i want a nurse a doctor someone independent from all this mrs lomax tried perry get someone or get out theyll think its the madness coming out the assembled men regarded her solemnly doing nothing you isolated jennifer pointing to perry with her unrestricted hand go and get someone rodgers snapped off the recording as the solicitor left the room hall said this really is most unnecessary whatever it is you want jennifer looked at him but refused to speak there was some awkward foot scuffing from everyone except bentley who came close to overemphasizing the legstretched armsfolded seenitallbefore condescension within minutes less maybe rodgers returned with peter lloyd jennifer guessed the physician would have been given an explanation from the detective inspector but before anything further could be said she gestured with the unencumbered arm and said turn the tape back on give a time and the circumstances this really isnt persisted hall he wasnt sure of himself not in control any more and appeared disorientated do it rodgers did formally reestablishing the interview he did so looking uncertainly towards bentley for guidance but before the senior detective could say anything jennifer said to the doctor i want you to listen to everything thats said ill call you to court to testify on my behalf if this tape is tampered with to swear to everything thats going to be said hell think its paranoia all part of your hearingvoices paranoia i really have more important started the doctor no you dont its my life youre trying to save although not medically listen jennifer turned directly to address the microphone in front of her the making of this tape is being independently witnessed by dr peter lloyd of st thomass hospital very impressive jennifer said bentley you sure you can keep it up keep what up voices in the head telling you what to do it wouldnt be difficult breaking this arrogant bitch down any more than it had been to beat lomaxs replacement fuck hall would probably cut him off before he got a full confession but it wouldnt matter hed have enough sometimes things were almost too easy i dont choose to continue with this interview despite the agreement of my lawyers who will not be my lawyers after today announced jennifer talking directly into the microphone once more go on i didnt expect it to be as good as this youre right to be scared jennifer im on to you know what your plan was smiled bentley i didnt say you could call me jennifer she was breaking bentley recognized trying to hide behind pomposity hurt like hell didnt it finding out about gerald and rebecca woweeeee jennifer had assuaged the guilt of her affair with gerald and the neverquitelost feeling after janes death by knowing positively really knowing not simply convincing herself that her marriage to gerald was invulnerable complete unendangered absolutely and totally invulnerable which it had been she determined fighting back had to be it was a trick a cheap trick to get her to admit something anything that wasnt true wouldnt work whatever they wanted expected it wouldnt work to hall she said why are you allowing this stop it i dont want it to stop gerald was screwing your best friend jennifer and you didnt even know it any more than i knew he was screwing you oh this is wonderful perfectly wonderful the hysterical laughter echoed in jennifers head before hall could speak bentley went on thats it isnt it jennifer you found out your husband was having an affair with rebecca nicholls and worked out a perfect defence for a minimal sentence so that you could kill him in front of her thats why you stood at the window covered in his blood laughing down at her you wanted her to see didnt you no the denial wailed from jennifer as she snatched her hands up to cover her ears to stop hearing the words the drip rattled against its frame and she felt the needle tear out of her uninjured arm and then the warmth of the blood stop it go away youre lying all of you lying she slumped back against the pillows the room misting in front of her her bruised lips moving but forming no words this cant go on protested lloyd no said hall it cant ive allowed more than i should have done it has to stop now bentley wheeled upon the lawyer only just stopping himself from telling the man to go to hell the bitch had got away with it by faking the collapse like she was trying to get away with murder by faking insanity get up say something jennifer didnt hear the words lloyd pushed through to jennifers bedside more fully opening the halflidded eyes shes not properly conscious and she isnt faking it he became aware the tape was still operating i am formally warning you this womans health would be seriously endangered by attempting to continue this interview which she isnt mentally capable of responding to anyway rodgers wasnt quick enough stopping the tape to prevent it registering bentleys handslap of frustration against the table top it didnt however record jeremy hall saying to humphrey perry we made a mistake a very bad mistake chapter nine it was a room of angry people and a lot of confusion the ward sisters office into which lloyd herded them as nurses came running to his call he had forbidden the reentry of any policewomen insisting they witnessed jennifers recovery through the corridor window adding to bentleys fury the doctor said it was a genuine collapse said hall it had been a bad mistake to allow the interview getting the doctors agreement wasnt sufficient excuse he should have insisted upon more time properly to prepare the woman protect her and done that better protected her better before the police arrival someone with more experience wouldnt have let any of it happen rubbish rejected bentley the collapse is a fake like hearing voices is a fake ive got the motive like i knew i would its murder pure and simple and premeditated i wont have any prosecution accepting diminished responsibility or an unfittoplead attempt its not up to you what the prosecution will or will not accept reminded hall refusing to be bullied noone was sitting instead they stood either side of the small room like opposing combatants which hall supposed they were like david and goliath it was hardly a good analogy he realized goliath lost the detectives face tightened at the correction formally but with difficulty bentley said im going to conduct this investigation as a culpable homicide with no extenuating circumstances like mental illness and that will be how my report is submitted to the crown prosecution service thats what wed expect you to do said humphrey perry the solicitors irritation was personal it was virtually inevitable that what had occurred would leak back to feltham and hed promised the man hed keep an eye on jeremy hall to make sure something precisely like this didnt happen it would be best if he actually told the man himself to get his side of the story in first therell be no further interviews with my client announced hall is she your client demanded bentley belligerently sounded to me as if you were going to be fired until i am properly i represent mrs lomax insisted hall and while i do i wont allow a repetition of what took place in there cocky young bastard out to make a name for himself judged bentley he was going to have his work cut out doing it with this case and bentley decided hed be buggered if hed do anything to help you actually believe all her nonsense from the beginning mrs lomax appeared genuinely unwell to me you heard the voice mocked rodgers whod worked with bentley long enough to gauge his superiors mood and knew that at that moment bentley was as furious as hell i got sufficient indication of a mentally distressed woman which youll get a lot of tame psychiatrists to swear to in court its mrs lomaxs own wish to be psychiatrically examined said hall and well match you trickcyclist for trickcyclist to say that shes sane insisted bentley hall allowed himself to become angry at his own mistakes but had a barristers control against letting it happen professionally at the attitudes of others bentley was the sort of overconfident person easy to handle in court someone quickly coaxed into illconsidered response perhaps it wont be necessary i thought you knew mrs lomax wants to be diagnosed sane thats the cleverest bloody part of what shes doing isnt it said rodgers playing mad but saying she doesnt want to be hall decided to experiment to see how easy it would be to manipulate bentley ive told you i wont allow the interview to continue theres no real point in your staying here any longer is there who the fuck did this cocky little bugger just out of school think he was talking to red faced bentley said ill decide when and how to leave enquiries of course said hall mildly i was just trying to save you wasting time ill make up my own mind when im doing that too bentley caught the smirk on perrys face and realized too late what was going on theyd see who had the last laugh he promised himself vindictively the bloody woman thought she was making a fool out of him and these two smarmy sods thought they were making a fool out of him actually laughing but before it was all over theyd learn who the real fools were well set up the examinations as soon as we get the goahead from the doctor hall said to perry you have names several assured the solicitor aware of the renewed irritation from the two detectives at apparently being ignored it might have been unintentional but if it wasnt jeremy hall appeared to have mastered a useful courtroom technique well use several decided the younger man and i want each totally independent not one responding to the opinion of another appearing to remember bentley hall said how soon will you submit to the crown prosecution when im ready said bentley petulantly hall turned pointedly and dismissively from the man to perry again he said officially inform them were acting well need the earliest evidence exchange of everything she said and did immediately after arrest for the psychiatrists to assess as well lloyds arrival added another angry man to the room i dont consider mrs lomax sufficiently well to be interviewed further he declared looking challengingly between the police and the lawyers ive already decided it wont be continued said hall when will it be possible demanded rodgers i dont know several days said lloyd and only in our presence added hall in fact i think well review whether or not it will be continued at all in the light of medical evidence to lloyd he said mrs lomaxs collapse was genuine not feigned the doctor appeared surprised at the question unquestionably genuine i dont even understand the question ive had a lot of people collapse on me when they didnt have answers to the questions i was asking exaggerated bentley lloyd sighed impatiently mrs lomax was medically unconscious she remains extremely disorientated well require a statement from you to that effect said rodgers which ill be pleased to provide including the cause of the distress that preceded mrs lomaxs collapse came back lloyd irritably he was very aware he had given the medical permission for the questioning and he too now accepted it had been wrong hed been on duty for fiftysix hours and thought the british national health service and all hospital trusts were a total fucking disaster and wished he was allowed to tell someone i want to know the moment shes well enough for me to see her again insisted bentley moving towards the door it had been an absolute bloody shambles and hed been made to look a prick not once but several times he wasnt sure if rodgers was loyal enough not to spread stories hed spoken to the doctor but it was perry who replied well let you know as soon as we are told and decide upon expert professional advice whether it should be resumed at all in their car perry said why did you antagonize bentley like that to see how easy its going to be in court admitted hall and its going to be very easy indeed perry nodded impressed guardedly he said maybe it wasnt a good idea to have allowed the questioning we had medical agreement reminded the barrister the doctor who gave it is prepared to testify the collapse was genuine and to criticize police aggression which a jury will be able to judge for themselves when they see how quickly bentley loses his temper perry gave another gesture of approval you thinking of going along the sympathy road wronged wife temporarily driven beyond control by a cheating husband im keeping an open mind but its a strong possibility admitted hall wed need to get as many women as possible on the jury during selection id recommend that anyway said perry and lets get started right away with psychiatrists i really dont want any committee decisions thats important but i want them all singing to the same tune when it comes to giving their evidence in court so well discard any that dont concur for one that does perry didnt think the younger man was going to need as much handholding as he had first thought jennifers first conscious impression was of fog fog in her head so that she couldnt think clearly get her thoughts together or cotton wool head stuffed with cotton wool so that everything felt thick at once there was noise a lot of noise of a lot of people enjoying themselves laughing and shouting too loudly like people laugh and shout at a party after drinking too much but the fog began to lift and it wasnt a lot of people just one one that she knew just as she knew abruptly where she was and what she had been accused of doing and why the bored policewomen were slumped in their chairs ignoring her for their newspapers and magazines and knew worst of all most terrible of all what the detective had said about gerald and the woman shed thought to be her friend wasnt true couldnt be true gerald had of course its true no gerald didnt love you he did didnt love anyone except himself and fucking fucking anything that moved not true shes back said the woman police constable looking over her newspaper to her sergeant should we tell someone suppose wed better the younger woman started to move towards the summons button but the sergeant said ill walk down to the nurses station itll be something to do the sound in jennifers head was of cackling near hysterical laughter this makes it all the better brilliant fucking your best friend think they planned to kill you too murder you like you murdered me might have been a problem though couldnt go on killing wives he didnt want could he might not have got away with it twice dont want to listen oh youre going to have to listen jennifer listen to all of it hear what a shit he was what a shit rebecca was emily who was going to see emily for her tell emily her mummy loved her why not still ask rebecca she was fucking your husband so she might as well go on keeping it in the family shed have probably had the brat anyway after gerald had divorced you dont forget how clever he was getting whatever he wanted all he wanted was a brat not you you were a breeding animal like a sow stop mrs lomax jennifer became conscious of lloyd beside her bed conscious too that there was something sticking to her ribs and that thick leads connected her to a machine on one side but that the drip although the bottle still hung from its hook wasnt in her arm any more but there was a fresh dressing on what had been her uninjured arm almost as large as the one on the other arm it hurt seeing the frightened head swivel the doctor said you tore your arm rather badly where the needle was inserted im not sure you need it any more anyway whats the machine for heart monitor brokenhearted jennifer see it on the machine jennifer fought against a response and won have they gone yes im sorry i shouldnt have allowed it you heard what the policeman said yes wasnt true dont be stupid i dont know anything about that refused lloyd uncomfortably he wished another doctor had been covering emergency when shed been admitted he wouldnt have done that not gerald mrs lomax i cant help you with any of that i have to care for you medically you dont believe im mad do you thats not my field im concerned with your physical recovery to cover himself he should have a hospital psychiatrist examine her make a report should have done that before agreeing to the police interview course he thinks youre mad mrs lomax intruded the woman police sergeant do you feel well enough now to talk to my superiors again jennifer flinched back on the bed and lloyd wheeled towards the uniformed woman i have spoken to your superiors and told them there wont be any more interviews until i authorize it if i authorize it nor are either of you to attempt to question her if you do i shall insist upon your remaining outside of this room do you understand the greyhaired woman retreated to her chair face blazing thank you said jennifer are you my friend lloyd blinked at the question im your doctor you havent got any friends jennifer noone and im going to leave you too i dont want anything to get in the way of your realizing how totally alone and helpless you are she was alone jennifer accepted totally clever of jane to leave her to think herself deeper into abandoned despair to make mistakes like it had been a mistake to forget the numbness of janes presence there was an abrupt contradiction no it wasnt not clever at all alone she was able to think clearly even the fog had gone like shed thought clearly before made decisions what decisions were there to make now the most important the one never to forget wouldnt give up never had never would and not just for herself because there was someone emily if she gave up she would be giving up emily which was unthinkable by herself she had to fight find a way out and make a life with emily just the two of them the only thing that mattered now herself and emily she could do it had to do it there was no alternative what about the other decisions shed made earlier still the same and in the same sequence couldnt plan anything about herself and emily until shed proven herself innocent more difficult now there had been a motive a reason everyone would understand oldest story in the book hadnt gerald loved her ever all lies not all it couldnt have been all lies just sex then with rebecca shed never thought rebecca sexy the opposite in fact icy couldnt remember their ever discussing men talking about men sexually only remembered one man an american broker wesley or weston something like that flown over a few times after rebeccas transfer from new york spent one weekend with them in hampshire never laughed and wanted to talk metal futures all the time what was wrong with the sex she and gerald had nothing she hadnt thought hed liked sex certainly but so had she wanted it whenever he had integral part of successful ambitious people a strong sex drive did whatever he wanted like hed done whatever shed wanted maybe she should have known hed need sex when they werent together why hadnt he used hookers it wouldnt have been so bad if hed done that could have understood it accepted it even it wouldnt have meant anything a business transaction that was the pain not that hed slept with someone else but that it had been someone she knew believed to be a friend humiliating the office would have known inevitable that they would laughed at her about her gerald not getting enough at home has to look elsewhere he wouldnt have wanted a divorce wouldnt have wrecked their perfect life wouldnt have hurt and bewildered emily wouldnt have hurt and bewildered her just sex thats all it had been her own fault for not realizing the risk for being too complacent too late now gerald gerald whod loved her but had an affair was dead her life with him was dead too had to start again rationalize it accept it had happened and move on move on to her and emily needed to get a lot of obstacles out of the way first jane most of all big mistake for jane to have left to have given her time couldnt let her realize it had to pretend to despair to be devastated wouldnt be difficult she had been humiliated cheated gerald was a bastard even if it was a casual affair not a problem to despise rebecca bastard and a bitch easy enough to think like that had to be alert for the tingling sensation be even more alert for the gaps when she could say things without jane being able to interrupt why had gerald done it why hadnt she been enough for him shes crying said the police constable shes got every reason to said the sergeant they always do when they get caught out whys mummy had to go away mummies have to sometimes said annabelle when will she be back im not sure yet eat up i dont want to eat up and i dont want you to be a rude girl dont care no story tonight then dont want a story want my mummy chapter ten jennifer timed the sedative demand with the care of the previous night and resisted janes frenetic wakeup attempts even longer than before and felt better upon awakening than she had the previous day told you id find a way she didnt care any more about the sighed reaction from the attendant policewomen it wont help you you cant control me all the time can you whenever i want without her being able to stop it happening both of jennifers arms rose and in unison fell heavily back upon the bed the police sergeant moved towards the door ill stop that happening too youre my puppet jennifer jump puppet jump puppet jennifer managed to stop her arms jerking to the chant that time i can resist insisted jennifer excited by the discovery not enough to stop me doing exactly what i want with you and whenever i want to do it mistake jane youve just admitted im right for several moments jennifers head cleared then from a long way off there began a distant sound that grew louder by the second like an onrushing sirenwailing train except it wasnt a siren but a manic scream that rose and rose until jennifer thought her head would explode the pain so bad she screamed aloud herself with her arm no longer tethered she tried to clamp both hands against her head to close out the mindsplitting cacophony but couldnt because it wasnt coming from outside and her whole body convulsed with the vibration of the noise the agony was so bad it was a long time before she became aware of restraining hands an arm even encompassing her and only then when the pain at last receded as the sound passed it was peter lloyd with his arm around her a placating nurse on her other side both policewomen were at the foot of the bed eyes bulged pissed yourself jennifer dirty girl she had she was in fact soaked sweat glueing the hospital smock to her hair lank rats tails she screamed i thought my head was going to burst ive made a mess it doesnt matter we can clean you up assured lloyd still with an arm around her he squeezed her shoulder in added reassurance he wouldnt argue against the hospital boards decision about the psychiatric examination he hoped to christ her lawyers agreed the boards problem not his his was avoiding any fallout from what had happened yesterday the social services business was her lawyers too make sure the wounds didnt become infected thats all he had to do then pass the problem on it was still difficult to believe she could have done what she did but then hed never before treated even seen a murderer she wants to prove how helpless i am and i did didnt i were going to do some tests today said lloyd pressing on refusing any diversion what tests ask him what tests jennifer managed to prevent herself seizing a victory to prove im sane part of it i want to do that right away at the nurses pressure she held out her least bandaged arm for a blood pressure cuff to be attached what tests repeated janes voice insistently we must be medically sure youre recovered enough for a psychiatric examination explained lloyd unwittingly answering the question your heart monitor has been stable throughout the night thats why we disconnected it until that moment jennifer had been unaware the adhesive pads and their attaching leads had gone youre not started jane but the nurse was already releasing the cuff fine guaranteed the woman to lloyd because of the started the doctor then stopped determinedly he started again because youre officially facing a criminal charge weve approached your lawyers invited them to participate with a psychiatrist not from the hospital our tests are to be strictly medical neurological well take blood faeces and urine samples and i also want to do a spinal tap now jennifer curled herself up in a ball as the man instructed but continued talking over her shoulder are they bringing a psychiatrist shed intended dismissing perry and hall without the concrete assurance of a qc she remembered not important this early the absolute essential the essential upon which everything hinged was to be declared sane the insistence upon a senior barrister could wait the lord chief justice himself cant save you youre lost cant prevent yourself being lost call them ordered jennifer straightening herself as she was told and lying flat without a pillow to prevent any headache or nausea after the lumbar puncture tell them i want a psychiatrist as well that i wont have a neurological examination unless i have a psychiatric one precisely what the hospital board wanted accepted lloyd the responsibility and any unforeseen repercussions that of the womans advisors the hospitals accountability tightly limited to scientifically provable and universally acknowledged medical criteria thats your definite wish thats my positive instruction tell them that i demand it and that i want it today there was a sudden rush of confidence a feeling of being in charge she had other feelings other impressions but refused to let herself think of them what not things for you to know refused jennifer embarking on another experiment i beg your pardon frowned the doctor i wasnt talking to you smiled jennifer apologetically lloyd gestured for the nurse to leave with him ill call your solicitor think it make me the numbness worsened into a burn but jennifer easily resisted im finding weaknesses about you all the time arent i jane my mind was always better than other peoples im going to prove it and im going to enjoy taking that arrogance from you like im going to take everything else from you it wasnt jennifers demand but julian masons insistence that a neurological screening was necessary that persuaded jeremy hall to change his mind about a joint examination it wasnt explained mason a shared discipline but a complimentary one hall was as impressed by the man as he was by the argument julian mason was a past president of the royal college of psychiatrists a senior lecturer at essex university and the author of two acknowledged reference books on forensic psychiatry hall also liked that the man didnt look an absentminded longhaired psychiatrist baggy jacketed shapelessly trousered and meerschaumpiped mason wore a crew cut jeans and an essex university tshirt under an unzipped cotton blouson hall hoped he had a different outfit for court what hall appreciated most of all was the absence of any condescension at their meeting in his cramped rooms overlooking the car park at the rear of the chambers identifying him as the most junior member of the practice mason listened intently to the facts of the murder not interrupting until hall linked schizophrenia with the voice in jennifers head at once the man raised a halting hand youre the lawyer im the psychiatrist ill make the diagnosis bentley thinks shes faking people try how difficult is it for you to tell sometimes impossible sometimes easy seeing the reaction on halls face the other man grinned and said its very difficult to fake genuine mental illness people who try usually make lots of mistakes her husband was having an affair reminded hall could she have gone temporarily insane at discovering it theres no insanity as temporary as that youre talking of enormous hostile rage but she would have known what she was doing no matter how enraged in my opinion yes youll probably find others who disagree if thats the way you want to go i want to defend her to the best of my ability thats refreshing said mason in what could have been the first reference to halls inexperience lets hope i can do it im sure mrs lomax hopes the same they rose at the announcement of humphrey perrys arrival with the car perry and mason greeted each other with the familiarity of long association and hall remained silent for most of the journey while the other two men brought each other up to date with personal happenings mason it emerged was a bachelor but perry had six children all boys but none in law both the youngest two had dropped out of university one ironically from essex mason said he didnt know the boy but that perry wasnt to worry unduly a lot of kids rebelled at the educational grind at university level and most returned after a year out from the greeting mason also appeared to know the neurologist waiting for them at the hospital george fosdyke was a fussy quickspeaking man with a wet handshake who made a specific point of quoting a psychology as well as a medical degree when he was introduced to hall the mans stiff white coat glistened from starch and his baldness was practically identical to that of humphrey perry who stood slightly apart during the initial meeting hall thought the solicitor and the neurologist looked as if they had come off the same assembly line how is she he asked lloyd had quite a trauma this morning said the doctor she became very distressed at what she described as a terrible noise she thought was going to make her head burst but no collapse like yesterday heart and blood pressure are quite normal all the other tests done interrupted fosdyke i did the spinal tap myself as they walked towards the elevators mason said is she mobile she hasnt been so far said lloyd but shes not on any intravenous treatment any longer and shes off the heart monitor so theres no reason why she couldnt be youre going to do a brain scan mason asked the neurologist expectantly of course said fosdyke you any objection to her walking to the scanner good idea agreed fosdyke it was fosdyke who slowed first bringing the group to a halt at the sight of bentley and rodgers outside the guarded ward the woman police sergeant was with them lloyd said i didnt know they were here i gave no permission to resume the interview hall eased his way through the group to confront the detectives this is a medical and psychiatric examination so shes well enough to be interviewed not by you my client declines to talk to you this is obstruction bentley felt his temper slipping and made a conscious effort to stop it happening its her right and my advice it needed halls professional control to avoid his annoyance at bentleys presence becoming obvious and abruptly he determined to end the interference careless of the effect he knew it would have upon the other man he said wed appreciate no more irritations like this there will be no further police interviews with my client he indicated the uncertain policewoman who had obviously warned bentley of the examination from overhearing the arrangements being made nor will i accept the introduction in any later court hearing of anything my client says or does bentley moved to speak but hall refused the objection anticipating it your initial caution does not extend to remarks or actions overheard by police escorts which you well know or should know if you didnt youve been officially told now i want your policewomen outside my clients ward from this moment if you ignore what i have just said any of it i shall complain through a judge in chambers to your commander is there anything about which ive left you unsure superintendent bentley it was possible to gauge the detectives heartbeat from the throbbing of the protruding vein in his redmottled forehead and for several moments the man was beyond speech at last he managed i will report this to my superiors hall didnt have to force the smile at the ludicrously ineffective response id strongly urge you to do that he gestured through the window to the constable still inside the room please call her out rodgers did so at a nod from the senior detective as she emerged hall said please make it clear they are to remain outside from now on rodgers did that too as bentley stumped off down the corridor trailed by his inspector julian mason said what was that all about an overinflated sense of importance said hall hoping bentley was still close enough to hear inside the ward jane said look theyre here lets really see how stupid we can make you shall we jennifer tried to clench the sheet on either side of her wanting something physically to hold on to but totally against her will her fingers wouldnt grip splaying out helplessly instead its no good jennifer no good at all it wasnt as the group entered her arms flapped up and down in unison again but slapping harder against the bed and jane said now youre not a puppet youre a penguin tell them youre a penguin jennifer bit her lips between her teeth to prevent the words holding her breath but she couldnt stop a meaningless sound growling in her throat whats the voice tell you to say asked mason conversationally lets hear it jennifers breath came out in a rush that im a penguin oh dear god this is ridiculous im the one whos got to decide if its ridiculous or not thats why im here mason pulled up the chairs abandoned by the police sergeant fosdyke took the other both ignored the lawyers who pulled back against the wall furthest from the bed peter lloyd remained at the foot of the bed hall was conscious of the two policewomen side by side looking through the window from the corridor youre the psychiatrist smiled jennifer god am i glad to see you whats your name mason told her and introduced fosdyke as well jennifer extended her hand but as mason went to accept the gesture her hand began rotating as if challenging him to catch it mason laughed although not nervously so did the neurologist he didnt sound nervous either its not funny protested jennifer you could laugh at her no you fucking well cant does it hurt in your head when you hear the voice demanded fosdyke only when she screams she did that this morning why i said i could resist her can you came in mason sometimes how shell know if i tell you dont tell me then agreed mason tell him no whats she saying prompted the psychiatrist she wants me to tell you how i do it dont lets resist her the screaming started not as loud as before but still agonizing jennifer said oh no and felt herself begin to shake she tried to get her hands up to her ears but couldnt move her arms it stopped more quickly than before and she hadnt wet herself she screamed again said fosdyke jennifer nodded not immediately able to talk when she could she said stop it you talking to jane demanded mason you both of you youre patronizing me pretending you believe me but you dont do you because its not possible to be possessed is it i dont know admitted mason ive never heard of a proven case so why are you pretending to believe me dont you want me to i havent really got to try have i theyve made their minds up already jane says youve already made your minds up that im mad i havent denied mason neither have i said fosdyke theyre liars help me pleaded jennifer looking between the two men for gods sake help me how do you want to be helped asked mason get her out of my head find a way to prove that i am sane and didnt kill gerald im not sure i can do that admitted the psychiatrist but ill try and for me to do that youll have to help me anything whatever why not open your legs youre good at that tell me everything she says everything yes fuck him dont she says fuck you and that i should help you by opening my legs mason showed no reaction neither did the neurologist mason said she tried to stop you repeating everything yes so you defied her hes a cunt she says youre a cunt again neither mason nor fosdyke gave any reaction to the obscenities instead suddenly mason said you were having an affair with gerald lomax when his wife was still alive werent you whore whore whore jennifer didnt reply at once shes calling me a whore then yes we were having an affair you feel guilty about that of course she didnt mad whore yes said jennifer jane says i didnt but i did before his wife died or after before and after liar did she know it was going on no she didnt and she called me a liar no i bloody well didnt know you cheating whore were you going to tell her i wasnt gerald wanted to shes calling me a cheating whore why didnt he i asked him not to i didnt want to be the person to break up a marriage lying whore she says im a lying whore are you lying asked mason no what did gerald say that he didnt want things to go on as they were that he didnt love jane and wanted the marriage to end liar the voice roared making jennifer wince only slightly quieter jane said happy with me loved me until you came along what does the voice say anticipated mason that im lying that gerald was happy with her until the affair started you think thats true gerald said it wasnt you thought everything was all right between you and gerald didnt you pressed mason you want me to talk about rebecca do you want to answer me demanded jennifer angrily why do you respond to every question i ask with another question cant you think for yourself they got a crap psychiatrist jennifer because theyre just going through the motions you dont even know if hes qualified from the way hes dressed he could be a hospital porter are you am i what a qualified began jennifer before stopping she says youre a crap psychiatrist could even be a hospital porter mason laughed were really upsetting her arent we all the gauzethin confidence that she could confront jane had gone once more jennifer felt totally lost as if she was being sucked towards a whirlpool that would drag her down into a vortex from which shed never escape thats it honey thats how its going to be suffocating drowning like this it became difficult for jennifer to breathe it was as if someone had their arms wrapped around her squeezing the air from her and not letting her inhale any more she began to pant noisily youre panicking said the psychiatrist calmly dont do that he felt out enclosing her hand in both of his breathe with me slowly now he began to space his words in and out in and out in and out gradually too gradually the band around jennifers chest began to ease that was awful frightened me youre all right now she could kill me couldnt she make me kill myself good thought honey ill keep it in mind there was the cackling laugh your mind my mind somebodys mind thanks for the idea i thought you said you could resist her not when she makes me move my she stopped as first her left leg then her right kicked up under the bed covering shit shit shit you stopped telling me what janes saying she said making me kill myself was a good idea and that suffocating as if i was drowning was how she was going to make me feel it was what it seemed like when i couldnt breathe you can now yes so how else do you feel demanded mason quickly how do you think i feel dont answer my question with another question despite herself despite everything jennifer smiled at having her earlier protest thrown back at her frustrated impotent then she repeated how else do you expect me to feel very different from that whats he mean she wants to know what you mean if shes so clever tell her to work it out for herself tell me it was a shout loud enough to make jennifer grimace yet again dont tell her jennifer used the ploy shed learned uttering the words before the thought came in time for jane to intercept im not going to bastard shes angry called you a bastard good then quickly you didnt know about rebecca no do you believe it i want to hear rebecca say it dont you believe the police i want to be in a room somewhere where she has to say it in front of me why i thought she was my friend wouldnt do a thing like that to me have you got a lot of friends no does that worry you it didnt until now why does it worry you now i need someone to help me clothes and theres emily both lawyers stirred against the wall mason and fosdyke ignored them tell me about emily suggested mason jennifer smiled distantly shes our life geralds and mine he wanted a baby so much liar made me take the pill she says im a liar that he made her take the pill do you know if thats true about the pill jane was a severe diabetic thats what she died of an insulin overdose i know gerald was warned that medically it would have been dangerous for jane to become pregnant murderers shes calling me a murderer thats what she says that gerald and i murdered her so we could be together did you of course we didnt its an absurd thing to say gerald didnt ask you to take the pill i told you he wanted a baby very much but theres only emily i just didnt become pregnant afterwards i had tests we both did there was no reason why it didnt happen it just didnt will you hate rebecca if she admits the affair in front of you i dont know will you hate gerald i couldnt hate gerald ever not even if its true it wouldnt have been love just sex wouldnt you hate her just the same i dont think so why not the psychiatrist had come forward on his chair jabbing the questions at her if he needed another woman it would have meant i was inadequate wouldnt it that id failed it would have been my fault that you werent such a good fuck after all she says id realize i wasnt such a good fuck after all were you jennifer felt herself colour i thought we had a more than satisfactory sex life she forced herself to say youre embarrassed of course im embarrassed do you swear swear frowned jennifer fuck fuck fuck shes saying fuck all the time do you use the word i mean yes admitted jennifer at once so youre not offended by it no are you no tell me what you thought about driving up from the country i dont remember much about that it was as if i was a passenger what about when you got to geralds office jennifer shook her head i dont properly remember that i mean i do but not as if i was part of it it was as if i was looking on fosdyke stirred a signal what illnesses did you have as a child jennifer frowned the usual i suppose i want to know specifically im not sure specifically is it important very can we find out from your family i dont have a family my mother died twelve years ago my father four years later i dont have any brothers or sisters no aunt or uncle who could help both my parents were only children like i was we could try a trace through the family doctor offered peter lloyd from the bottom of the bed weve got his name on the case notes do that will you now said the neurologist without turning to the doctor who hesitated and then eased his way past the silent lawyers what about accidents persisted fosdyke being born she says my being born was an accident jennifer told mason who nodded but didnt say anything whats the proper answer prompted fosdyke no no broken legs arms no what about head injuries ive convinced them you havent any idea how insane you sound she says youre convinced im insane that i sound insane for the neurologists benefit mason said what about a head injury at any time no never how about your pregnancy perfectly straightforward wonderful no problems at all the birth itself the gynaecologist said it was the easiest hed ever known fosdyke turned invitingly to mason who shook his head to the lawyers the neurologist said im going to carry out a physical examination excuse us hall and perry filed obediently into the corridor to the hostile glares from the two policewomen the barrister continued walking until he was beyond their hearing before turning to the solicitor well i dont know a court that would put up with it said perry flatly i dont think i do either im frightened what the reaction might be to what ive got to tell her about emily said perry maybe i should wait until tomorrow hall shook his head forcefully not in the circumstances make sure lloyds with you what about you asked the solicitor seeking as much support as possible hall looked sceptically at the older man all right peter lloyd emerged from the elevator at the far end of the corridor when he reached them lloyd said the family doctor is faxing what medical records there are which arent very much we went through it on the phone shes never had a days illness in her life until now said perry as the doctor moved on to the ward and now shes making up for all the lost years inside the tiny room jennifer lay on top of the bed as fosdyke went through the neurological routine her toes contracted when a pencil tip was drawn across the soles of her feet and with her eyes closed she correctly isolated every point at which he lightly touched a pin against unbandaged parts of her arms and legs still with her eyes closed she correctly brought her fingertip unfalteringly to the tip of her nose and resisted his pressure when he pushed against her raised legs he repeated the test more gently against her injured arms but she was still able to respond if you cant prevent it dont worry but i dont want to hear anything the voice says in your head warned fosdyke i just want your answers to my questions jane isnt here broke in jennifer how do you know theres no tingling burning sensation why didnt you tell us about that earlier demanded the neurologist i didnt want her to know thats how im warned shes with me how i can beat her when were you born demanded the neurologist briskly june eighth nineteen sixtysix so youre thirtythree thirtytwo whats your name what frowned jennifer answer me jennifer lomax what was it before you were married stone jennifer stone where were you married caxton hall when january fifteen nineteen ninetythree what time two oclock your degrees economics and mathematics i took an additional module where oxford what was it double first before either man could speak further jennifer said why is this important thats for us to decide said fosdyke do you know what a brain scan is like an xray of my head they wont see me shes back says you wont see her im not looking for her whats he want she wants to know what you want its nothing to do with her tell me shes demanding to know she isnt going to said fosdyke do you think you could walk to the scanner its one floor below jennifer looked to lloyd who said do you feel up to it of course lloyd helped jennifer into a shapeless hospital dressing gown over the smock that had been changed after shed wet herself jennifer looked down at herself then smiled wanly up to mason not actually haute couture is it that worry you asked the psychiatrist jennifer remained smiling although sadly i was going to ask rebecca to bring some of my own stuff in thats ironic isnt it the two policewomen straightened into something like attention when jennifer came out into the corridor hands clasping the dressing gown around her they quickly fell into step behind the specialists who walked either side of jennifer it wasnt until they shouldered into the elevator that jennifer realized hall and perry had joined them noone spoke jennifer remained tensed for jane who never came the lawyers and the policewomen stood separately outside the scanner room sure he was beyond their hearing perry said you sure it was a good idea to antagonize bentley quite so much it was a good idea to close down any further interviews hall nodded towards the uniformed women and insist they remain outside from now on the prosecution is going to be kept strictly within the rules of exchange and disclosure does that matter considering the case theyve got hall smiled at the solicitor if theyve got enough then theyve got enough it was almost an hour before jennifer and the doctors left the scanner room in the tiny outside vestibule fosdyke said to lloyd weve got all the samples the spinal tap was with pathology an hour ago said lloyd then im finished he looked at mason who said ive got enough for the moment for a preliminary finding demanded hall jennifer felt the onset of numbness and blurted not in front of me i dont want her to know bitch too quick for you said jennifer she back asked mason called me a bitch ill need an hour to go through the tests apart from my own said fosdyke id like to think about it too before we talk lets make it an hour shall we suggested mason my rooms offered fosdyke weve got some other business to go through said hall he looked at peter lloyd and id appreciate your being with us noone spoke during the walk to the upper corridor immediately inside the ward again jennifer said to perry can you arrange for me to get my own clothes in here have someone call annabelle and go down to fetch them she smiled as the uninterrupted thought came to her would it be possible for me to see emily there was a moments silence between the two lawyers perry said thats the other business we have to go through mrs lomax social services want to get involved with care provisions for emily no screamed jennifer everything destroyed completely mocked the voice ill leave you all by yourself to think what its going to be like to lose emily for ever chapter eleven she cant be taken away shes all i have now there was no sensation of jane and jennifer forced herself to remain icily calm after the initial outburst panic or hysteria wouldnt save emily and saving emily keeping emily was abruptly the most important consideration the only consideration it was still difficult to sit on the side of the bed and not do more speak louder to make them understand dr lloyd was beside her still holding the wrist hed snatched up to check her pulse rate at the screamed protest is she all right demanded hall worriedly pulse is ok nodded lloyd dont talk across me demanded jennifer im perfectly under control jane isnt here i said emily isnt being taken away from me youve got to stop it stop it now is there no family on either side who could become legal guardians in your perry hesitated in your absence the question unnecessarily reminded jennifer once more of how totally alone she was and momentarily she couldnt reply swallowing she said no noone what about geralds family there isnt one he was an only child no uncles and no aunts and his parents are dead the local authorities do have a legal responsibility although i am surprised theyre exercising it so quickly warned the solicitor cautiously he ignored the now vacant chairs so did hall the doctor remained where he was beside jennifer on the bed although he released her wrist emily hasnt been abandoned left jennifer became aware of the two policewomen staring through the window must they look in like that im like a bloody freak show theyre not being allowed in here any more so im afraid youve got to put up with it said the barrister he should have anticipated the effect upon her of the official approach about the child but hadnt but then neither had perry at least thered been the forethought to get geoffrey johnson the womans power of attorney jennifer made an impatient dismissive gesture emily cant be taken away from me i wont let that happen hall breathed in heavily i wont hold out any false hope legally she can be if youre convicted ive not been convicted not yet seized jennifer im still innocent arent i yes conceded perry and hall regretted the doubt in the mans voice then they cant do anything emily is being cared for by a certificated nanny in a mansion for christs sake shes the best looked after child in england thats probably right at the moment agreed hall you want us legally to oppose any move by the authorities of course i do said jennifer with fresh impatience i want you to do every conceivable thing to block whatever they try to do i dont care what it is or how much it costs just do it there was a sudden empty feeling of helplessness please she half reached out towards the barrister before stopping embarrassed at the unthinking movement she was glad the man hadnt instinctively responded we could prove adequate care provision with an onsite visit attend ourselves perry suggested halfway through he remembered jennifers dislike of being ignored and turned away from hall to include her as he spoke arrange it said jennifer eagerly this nanny hall let the question trail annabelle prompted jennifer annabelle is definitely certificated norland trained assured jennifer shes been with us since emily was born emily adores her theres no question of her not continuing in the job pressed perry careless of the grammar of course not why should there be wed better establish that positively before any meeting with the authorities said hall he didnt have any real doubt from the womans behaviour with the psychiatrist and the neurologist that she was suffering some mental abnormality how much worse might it get if the child was officially put into care he probably could technically prevent the child being taken until after a court verdict but it didnt amount to anything more than postponing the inevitable he really didnt intend offering false hope but there was nothing to be achieved apart perhaps from a worse collapse from being too honest with her a doubt began to flicker it was curious that all talk of voices in her head ended at the threat of losing her daughter hall stopped the reflection positively wrong to risk preconceived impressions before hearing the professional opinion of the two specialists worth mentioning to them though youll do it all today stop the process before it begins demanded jennifer urgently before doing that i think its important to get things clear between us said perry during the interview with the police i got the feeling you were dissatisfied with your legal representation hall frowned it was something that had to be clarified and perry was the person who had to do it but he wished the timing could have been different his look towards the bed was for a reaction but for the first time he properly focused on the woman herself almost unconsciously his initial impression had been that jennifer lomax really had looked like a mad woman lankhaired bedraggled and distraught but today the eyes werent black ringed any more the blond hair had a semblance of a style and what little makeup shed bothered with wasnt smudged the swelling had gone down and the cut lip was scarcely noticeable she was in fact looking more like the woman whose photograph was yet again blazoned over that days newspapers although the headtilted almost arrogant confidence of the pictures wasnt evident in the woman at whom he was looking but then it would have been impossible to appear elegant in the hospital smock and towelling robe jennifer returned jeremy halls attention although not appraisingly but honestly he was a very broadshouldered man and she liked the way he looked directly at her not avoiding her eyes as if he was embarrassed or afraid of her the blue striped suit was beginning to shine at the elbows and she guessed the shirt was on its second wearing it looked like a family crest on the signet ring she really didnt want to do what she had to she simply didnt have a choice maintaining the calm enjoying being able to feel it without the southern drawl voice echoing in her head she said i am not mad but i could easily be made so by the nightmare im living in right now a smile came briefly except that i am not going to let it happen but for me to survive in any court i need the very best criminal lawyer it is possible to get which means someone with murder trial experience someone in fact whose very reputation is going to make a court listen to believe him because he believes me im not trying to be offensive or doubt you but im fighting literally for my sanity and my freedom and now im fighting for my child i cant concern myself with hurt feelings jennifer straggled to a stop not sure how further to explain herself i can assure you mrs lomax began perry but hall broke across the solicitors stoodtoattention formality no let me i am not offended by anything youve said today or prior to today we are still very much in the preliminary stages of your case weve talked about that like weve talked about my being a junior counsel which is the capacity in which i will act to the best of my ability no leader thats what we call a qc heading a case becomes involved now dont be offended for your part but what we are doing now is the nuts and bolts of a defence preparation which is the function of a junior counsel he found it virtually impossible to believe a woman who had just expressed herself so logically and reasonably was the same person who a few hours earlier had been ranting and raving obscenities so there will be a qc with previous experience of murder trials insisted jennifer just as pedantically hall said there are eight qcs in my chambers i will ask the most experienced in murder to represent you jennifer did not speak for several moments thank you i trust you for even longer humphrey perry remained staring at the barrister before turning to jennifer still stiffly formal he said so you wish to retain our services yes said jennifer although speaking to hall then briskly she went on you will personally go down for the onsite visit with the authorities yes when i am taken from here to the hospital wing of a prison will i be allowed to wear my own clothes yes guaranteed hall the hampshire visit will have to be arranged beforehand i want anna belle to sort out some clothes for me tell her to use her own judgement i want suits nightwear and a dressing gown obviously underwear and toiletries and makeup ill see its arranged promised the barrister there was a silence but it was obvious there was something more jennifer wanted to say what prompted hall turning to the doctor jennifer said when will you give medical permission for me to be transferred to a prison hospital lloyd hesitated two or three days youre very much better medically jennifer ignored the qualification although it registered to hall she said im not convicted i can have visitors i want emily brought here to this proper hospital to see me i dont want her brought into a prison i will try to arrange it promised hall perry strode intentionally fast to their assessment from the psychiatrist and neurologist to distance them from the doctor who lingered to speak to a nurse perry said that was totally outrageous no senior in your chambers will take over this and you know it they will if my uncle decides they should and why should he do that to keep his part of whatever deal you arranged with bert feltham for us to act in the first place i need your help humphrey not your condescension and i need you to understand that im not stupid hall stopped at the elevator turning to face the man well get on much better if we have that understanding ok its an indefensible case protested perry unthinkingly then whatever you promised sir richard must be mega said hall chapter twelve neither mason nor fosdyke was talking when the other three men entered the neurologists rooms both were lounged with polystyrene cups balanced on their chests fosdyke behind his desk tilted far enough back in a muchused roundback chair to gaze up at the ceiling mason with his feet propped on some unrecognizable carved protrusion from the front of the equally muchused desk the surprise didnt finish with desk and chairs in total contrast to fosdykes overstarched pristine appearance it was a cluttered disorganized room of halfopen drawers and sagged cabinets on top of one paintchipped cabinet a neglected unidentifiable plant had withered into the vague shape of a sacrificial cross the only cleared space on the paperlittered desk was around three photograph frames close by a tower was slowly rising from previously muchfingered polystyrene cups placed one inside the other fosdyke brought himself up at their arrival gesturing towards three straightback chairs obviously newly installed in an uncertain formal line opposite mason opposing combatants again thought hall fosdyke said waiting room issue im afraid he raised his coffee container like this can you believe cleaners and patients steal anything else god knows what for but i grind the coffee myself colombian there was another gesture to a table near the window where a full pot stood on its hotplate help yourselves lloyd continued straight on to the coffee perry hesitated then followed hall sat down looking around the room perhaps he thought the mess was a camouflage against further larceny the idle reflection was short lived a few hundred yards away there was a mentally ill murderer whod cut another human being her husband to pieces and this meeting to help her began with an apology about hospital furniture and coffee cups wrong hall corrected himself at once they were doing a job all of them performing different expertise from different perspectives but as proper dispassionate professionals not allowing the distraction or influence of personal involvement my first murder he reminded himself their attitude was right his was wrong still at the machine the solicitor turned and said you sure black no sugar accepted hall he hoped perry hadnt imagined hed waited to be served he was sorry taking it within seconds of perry giving him the container it was too hot to hold without a handle and he hurriedly placed it on the floor the returning lloyd repositioned his chair more towards the doctors before he sat down combatants hall thought again well invited perry whats the verdict limited from my side said mason lowering his feet to the floor so lets start with medically provable findings on cue fosdyke came further upright too assembling a few sheets of paper and some xray plates before him as he did so the psychiatrist said remember as far as i am concerned this isnt a verdict its a very preliminary impression fosdyke coughed quite obviously mental problems insanity even can be brought on by physical factors or illness we know now from symptoms still recorded in the archives that george iii wasnt mad he suffered from porphyria which wed control by pills today he was playing with his notes but hall didnt think the neurologist needed them as well as for organic reasons apparent mental illness can be caused by head or brain malformation or injury continued fosdyke looking up a difficult birth the use of forceps or caesarian section things like that can result in cerebral anoxia damage the temporal lobes and bring about epileptic dysfunction in later life cortical atrophy even perry stirred smiling sideways to hall this could be better than any defence weve thought of so far if i could find any of it which i cant stopped fosdyke immediately puncturing the expectation he made an inclusive gesture towards lloyd as a part of my assessment weve carried out faeces urine and blood tests earlier today there was even a lumbar drain to examine spinal fluid for any cranial bleed or infection in nothing we have done have we found the slightest evidence whatsoever of any medical conditions or illness from which mrs lomax might be suffering most certainly nothing that would reflect upon or cause the mental collapse she appears to have undergone what about physical damage or malformation pressed hall reluctant to lose an acceptable defence avenue she responded a hundred per cent normally to every sensory test i carried out in the ward refused fosdyke in the examination room i even extended the scan beyond the brain to include the upper part of the body there is absolutely no brain abnormality or malformation to account for mrs lomaxs behaviour neither is there in the upper body anything that could be interrupting the oxygen or blood supply to the brain for instance in short invited hall fosdyke lifted the plates and printouts from the scan and said in short jennifer lomax is physically and neurologically probably the fittest thirtytwoyearold woman ive ever examined in my life actuarilly shell live to be a hundred hall finally picked up his cooled coffee it was excellent despite its container theres no other test left you could carry out the neurologist shook his head im sorry so am i said the barrister with feeling beside him perry said to julian mason which means our hope comes back to you im not sure youre going to be any better pleased said the psychiatrist he got up refilled his cup and stayed slightly propped against the window in an attitude reminding hall of how his tutor had sometimes tried to explain particularly esoteric points of law the recollection prompted a reminder of its own which he put aside until hed heard mason out you cant have found nothing challenged perry in irritation mason smiled unoffended the problem may be that ive found too much but that i need even more hall detected a move of fresh irritation beside him and quickly said perhaps you should talk us through it the psychiatrist paused preparing himself but unencumbered by any notes youve got to understand from the outset that one session like we had today was always going to be totally inadequate ill need more probably a lot more if im ever going to be of any practical use to you or to a court of course we accept that said hall what were looking for today is a suggested way to go forward mason nodded extending the gesture towards the neurologist george was looking for a pathological cause for mrs lomaxs condition and didnt find one on face value mrs lomax is showing some of the classic symptoms of schizophrenia there are no pathological tests for schizophrenia its decided upon by the psychiatrist from visual and behavioural perception for which they observe the symptoms devised by a german psychiatrist named schneider technically its called the schneider present state examination mrs lomaxs most obvious symptom is second person auditory hallucination people in this case one person are talking to her equally obvious is delusion of thought insertion jane can think for jennifer is aware of jennifers thoughts is inside her head listening mason paused to sip his coffee and hall waited far from impatient at the lecture rather he wanted a lecture whatever defence they decided upon he was going to need the phrases and the methodology to be able to use and understand them there are some other schizophrenic indicators resumed the psychiatrist the apparent uncontrolled movement of her arms and legs not having many friends is schizoid using obscenities is another the actual murder would come under the heading of dyssocial personality disorder humphrey perry didnt have halls patience so shes genuinely mentally ill not properly aware of what shes doing so we can suggest shes suffering diminished responsibility or is unfit to plead no said the psychiatrist shortly no ive treated and diagnosed dozens of schizophrenics a lot of paranoid schizophrenics whove killed and ive never before encountered anyone like jennifer lomax so shes faking it persisted perry easily able to dance to a different rhythm i dont think that either there was a sharp sideways look from lloyd the neurologist gave no reaction and hall presumed the two specialists had fully discussed everything before their arrival he had to remember the absence of the voice as well as raise the query from the long ago cambridge debate he said until this moment ive understood everything youve said now youre losing me what was the first thing that interested her when we met knowing i was a psychiatrist demanded mason perry shook his head your name recalled hall exactly and she smiled a schizophrenic wouldnt have been interested in my name nor have smiled to fit the circumstances of the introduction facial reaction is usually dysfunctional out of context or keeping with the moment she frowned in the right places at the right time and she smiled in the right places at the right time mason seemed surprised his polystyrene container was empty and added to it mouthing obscenities is a common manifestation but being embarrassed by them isnt when she told me jane had called her a good fuck and i asked her if she was she visibly blushed discomfited although she admits to using the word herself the context of everything she did and said is vitally important and everything she did and said fitted as if there was a person none of us was aware of taking part in the discussion perry sighed too heavily and mason grinned at him you think im enjoying saying this even considering possession faked dismissed the solicitor then answer me this demanded mason coming forward with the challenge that reminded hall again of his cambridge tutor when hed laid a trap for an inattentive student if you were faking a mental illness and were confronted by two supposed experts he waved his hand towards the neurologist like george and i what would be absolutely vital for you to know once again uncomfortably perry shook his head whether we believed you or not supplied fosdyke reentering the conversation and confirming halls guess of a rehearsal when we came out of the scanner peter and i said we had sufficient and hall asked if it was enough for a preliminary finding and jennifer stopped either of us replying came in mason she actually said not in front of me i dont want her to know and claimed the voice called her a bitch for not letting us speak even if wed intended to all part of a damned clever act suggested perry ive never encountered a schizophrenic that clever that quickly theyre cunning but not conventionally or logically so insisted mason we need to know a lot more about her personal history a hugely lot more in fact but we do know from the newspapers she was a highly intelligent trader in lomaxs office before they got married some papers are calling her a genius so ok lets go along with your disbelief that shes genuinely ill that shes faking it if shes faking it why is her only concern to be declared sane that doesnt make any sense mentally ill she has a defence a sympathetic sentence sane and shes a calculating murderer looking at life could the voice be her own invention without her realizing it suggested perry her guilt that jane died after shed started the affair imposing her own punishment upon herself mason smiled at the lay effort a very outside possibility there would have been symptoms before that would have shown up on her medical records i would have thought so would i agreed fosdyke what other contradictory features are there intruded hall people who are mentally ill dont argue as forcefully or as logically as she did they shout and scream but again out of context she argued logically schizophrenics dont complain of feeling frustrated or impotent at their condition she does recited mason the meeting today was disjointed on our part once more he gestured towards the neurologist in fact the closest we came to a structured schneider clinical interview was when george asked her the personal questions during which i intentionally miscalculated how old she was after she told me her date of birth fosdyke pointed out she corrected him at once reminded mason that wouldnt have been important to anyone suffering a schizophrenic dysfunction that all queried hall anxious now to get to his own points the psychiatrist shook his head there are appearance exceptions theres even a clinical description for it but predominantly mentally ill people dont bother about how they dress theyre usually a mess with no attempt at colour coordination her appearance upset jennifer she was embarrassed at looking like she did in a hospital gown and robe that somebody else would have worn before her and didnt fit her anyway he paused needing more coffee and ive got a problem about the uncontrollable limb movements thats why i wanted her to walk to the scanner even before i knew there was going to be sudden arm or leg movements if she was faking she would have performed something as we walked down the corridor for the scan she didnt and ive never got a genuinely mentally ill person into a scanner unless theyve been catatonic or sedated said fosdyke theyre invariably terrified of being put into what looks like a claustrophobic tunnel we actually hesitated to test her out she asked us what we were waiting for there was an abrupt empty silence in the room the concentration settled upon hall who stood up and used the coffee machine as mason had to become the centre of everyones attention by letting him do so instead of hurrying condescendingly to fill the vacuum perry had deferred to him establishing the proper solicitorbarrister relationship hall hoped it wasnt an isolated concession he didnt enjoy the idea of being manipulated by perry and feltham as he was sure he was being manipulated perry hadnt even bothered to argue against the accusation when confronted with it hall said im still confused but id like to get some things clear in my mind after an initial examination you cant say shes suffering a mental illness nor can you say shes faking one no i cant agreed mason a person a very clever person like jennifer lomax could have learned of schizophrenic symptoms even know what schneider guidance is by reading a psychiatric text book yes agreed mason and theres no pathological reason for how shes behaving none agreed fosdyke i havent read up on it yet but i remember a discussion when i was a law student about multiple personality disorder anticipated the psychiatrist smiling once more at a lay question wouldnt that come within the range of schizophrenia agreed hall wishing he hadnt been interrupted its an american favourite said mason still smiling although not patronizingly it goes all the way back to and the film the three faces of eve joanne woodward won an oscar playing a woman in whose body three separate personalities existed a housewife a goodtime girl a sophisticated woman im not interested in hollywood films dismissed hall aware of humphrey perrys vague smirk the american psychological association is offered mason it has published accepted papers that the condition affects up to five hundred thousand americans practically all women in nineteeneighty it was accepted as an official psychiatric diagnosis even though at that time only two hundred cases recognized as genuine were on record in nineteenninety a man in wisconsin was charged with rape for having sexual intercourse with a consenting twentysixyear old who became a sixyearold child during the act at the beginning of the trial each of the twentyone personalities occupying the woman had to be sworn in separately could what mrs lomax appears to be suffering be multiple personality disorder hall saw that his instructing solicitor wasnt smirking any more in america probably conceded mason its not a diagnosis accepted here as far as i know although there are widely known case histories ive actually heard the three faces of eve discussed among professionals as if it was a clinically diagnosed and proven case not a movie its never been offered as a defence in an english court to my knowledge said perry nor mine said the psychiatrist youre going to get other opinions as well as mine of course of course agreed perry happy to be back on solid legal procedural ground then use an american psychiatrist whos familiar with the syndrome we will accepted hall at once but you want more sessions very much so id particularly like to examine her under hypnosis if shed agree to it can people lie under hypnosis demanded hall recognizing a new opportunity theyre less inclined to there are some people who cant be hypnotized if she were if she agreed and was a suitable subject would you be able to decide whether or not she was faking the voice asked hall i might get a better indication than ive got so far offered the psychiatrist guardedly i think shes undergone enough examinations of every sort for one day came in lloyd protectively i agree said mason at once theres something you dont know hall said remembering it only took him minutes to explain the local authority approach about emilys care but before he reached what he thought might be important mason broke in to demand how shed reacted outrage at the very beginning recounted hall then calmly logically shes instructed us to oppose it but there was something i thought might be important there was no second voice she was quite rational throughout did she explain that frowned mason no perhaps you should have been there the psychiatrist shook his head itll be a starting point tomorrow with the hypnosis if she agrees cautioned lloyd jennifer did at once fifteen minutes later still without any physical sensation of janes presence she asked too for the sedation to keep the voice away during the night dont you want to hear about the preliminary findings asked mason experimentally no refused jennifer anxiously and at once he said what demanded feltham they were in el vino again because jeremy hall had insisted on returning to chambers and perry hadnt wanted obviously to meet the chief clerk there and feltham was annoyed because he didnt like being around this late lunch was his time words to the effect that he knew there was a hidden agenda and that to keep whatever else was on offer hed get a leader sir richard himself he hinted for the lomax case cheeky bugger what did you say one advantage of not having to return to the office to work was that he could drink claret instead of lighter white wines the st emilion was excellent nothing didnt you even deny it i dismissed it said the case was indefensible how is it shaping up bloody nightmare hall is taking it all so seriously as if there is a worthwhile plea to enter and hes far more confident than i thought he might be at our first meeting had me call the hampshire social security people from the car on our way back and then dictated a list of instructions as long as my arm before we got here his last insistence was that i go down to hampshire with him tomorrow when i asked him how he expected me to do that as well as everything else he said he had every confidence in me feltham nodded to another claret judges dont like cocky young beginners you want me to have a word in his ear no said perry just wanted to keep you up to date with things how is she totally mad no leader from my chambers is going to appear in court and talk about ghostly murderers decided feltham positively i dont give a damn whether jeremy bloody hall is a nephew of sir richards or not hell do as hes told like they all do in jennifers hospital room less than two miles away the sedative began to take affect the last thing of which jennifer was aware was janes distant voice you cant begin to guess the plans ive got jennifer its much more fun than i thought it might be im sorry so am i said patricia boxall beside him in the darkness ill be all right later promised hall was it still too late to leave call alexander from the car probably it had been close to midnight before theyd got back from the poxy italian restaurant with its stale spaghetti and acid wine wake me she said turning away from him if the sex was over then so was everything else chapter thirteen the traffic was heavier than they anticipated but they still arrived almost an hour ahead of the appointment with the council and care officials when they turned into the driveway and stopped for the gate to be opened after identifying themselves through the speaker grill two men with cameras and another with a tape recorder ran from an unseen car parked opposite there were momentarily blinding flashes and the man with the tape recorder said may i ask before the gates opened and perry accelerated through bastards exclaimed the solicitor frightened the hell out of me werent you told of this when you spoke to the house hall asked johnson annabelle said shed been bothered but didnt tell me there were ambushes outside the gate said the family solicitor alerted by the gate telephone annabelle parkes was at the open door by the time they reached the square creeperclad mansion the nanny was a plump roundfaced girl who wore her hair short and disdained any makeup the impression even for someone who could only have been in her twenties was motherly which hall decided was an advantage there was a firm nononsense handshake but no smile coffee was already set out in the drawing room at the front of the house overlooking the terraced lawns and the distant coppice which hid the gate it was a room of heavy velvet drapes and brocaded furniture which hall guessed to be regency it could he supposed have been georgian in keeping with the period of the house some looked similar to the antiques his father had sold trying to stave off the lloyds bankruptcy there were a lot of photographs the majority of jennifer with lomax with emily completing the family in several they were smiling and laughing in virtually all of them apart from two posed studio portraits the one of jennifer reminded hall of the picture that most of the newspapers had used she was more than simply beautiful he decided the headtilted confidence hed earlier recognized made her intriguing too meeting her in any other circumstances would have made him curious to discover just how intelligent she was as she poured coffee annabelle said ive kept emily home from kindergarten i didnt know if they if you would want to see her shes upstairs in the nursery playing you said you wanted to talk before the others arrived and ive packed clothes quite a lot to give mrs lomax a choice she takes a lot of trouble about how she dresses mrs lomax is resisting emily being taken into care announced johnson we can do that certainly until after any trial but its very necessary that we know if youre prepared to remain here looking after the child thats what im employed to do said the girl stiffly and are happy to continue doing so pressed perry absolutely thats good to know said hall im surprised this approach came from the council so quickly im probably responsible confessed the girl ever since it happened weve been besieged by newspapers and television people they even got over the perimeter wall and came up to the house through the tradesmens entrance when we wouldnt let them through the main gate i complained to the police said i had a child here that i wanted protecting hall sighed nodding yes you probably are we were confronted by some of them at the gate i wish id been given some indication complained johnson im sorry if it was the wrong thing to do it wasnt said perry in fact reassured hall it might even make things easier the girl went to a bureau near the window returning with several envelopes handing them to johnson whose authority she already knew annabelle said they put these in the postbox at the gate too offering money for photographs and for interviews i thought youd want them and theres some other mail as well ive kept it all for you johnson accepted the package moving away from them to go through it hall checked his watch deciding there was sufficient time describe mrs lomax to me he demanded suddenly annabelle frowned i dont she started then of course im sorry a wonderful woman we got on very well together perry had frowned too then his face cleared and hurriedly he got out a pad and the silver pencil did she and mr lomax ever fight the girl shook her head thats the strangest part about whats happened ive never known them argue ever she smiled for the first time almost unnatural we used to say we queried hall theres a housekeeper who also cooks and a daily lady and a gardener and theres another man who comes in to help the gardener she gestured behind her theres a lot of ground mr lomax stayed in london during the week coaxed perry rarely more than two nights and when he was away he always telephoned as i say they were devoted to each other did mrs lomax ever talk to you about someone named rebecca asked hall there was another frown i think shes a friend of mrs lomax came here a long time ago but mrs lomax didnt mention her more recently in what way just talk about her shrugged the barrister refusing to lead no what about illness was mrs lomax ever ill hardly ever caught a cold hall searched for a way to ask the most important question without doing so directly did she ever complain about headaches the girl shook her head not that i can ever remember anything about her head at all has she gone mad demanded the forthright girl it seems theres an illness said perry will she get better shes been examined by specialists said hall you didnt answer my question she never complained about anything to do with her head or behave strangely annabelle hesitated only the day it happened tell me about it theres hardly anything to tell really she went to collect emily from playschool she usually did they came home excited because emily had learned a letter of the alphabet and mrs lomax said they were going to the zoo theres a zoological park nearby we went into the kitchen and then almost at once mrs lomax walked out did she say anything nothing was she walking normally i suppose so i was sitting emily up i was scarcely aware of mrs lomax leaving you didnt see her take a knife annabelle shuddered slightly no i didnt even know shed left the house i thought shed forgotten something in the car or gone to the bathroom or something it wasnt until i went looking for her when our lunch was ready that i saw the car had gone a woman in a black dress that also looked like a uniform appeared at the door and said ive let the people from the council in the gate mrs jenkins the housekeeper identified annabelle can she help you at all i dont think so said hall thank you from the bureau by the window johnson said its difficult to believe isnt it what asked perry the other solicitor waved several letters all from the charities jennifer worked for and supported he looked down at the topmost one in view of recent circumstances we will of course have to ask you to stand down from the committee he quoted charity certainly seems in short supply doesnt it there were two cars carrying a total of five people two of them women one of the men in the uniform of a police inspector that drew up outside annabelle met them at the door as shed greeted hall and perry the housekeeper directly followed the group into the drawing room with more coffee which annabelle distributed while everyone else exchanged cards i hope this preliminary meeting is useful declared the county solicitor stewart baxter youll agree our concern about the child is justified no said hail i wont the man blinked in the circumstances the only circumstances that need concern you is the welfare and safety of a fouryearold child broke in hall emily lomax is being cared for by a certificated nanny living in a house with a fulltime staff it is her mothers wish that she remains so he looked towards the two women a doctor named maureen snare and social worker victoria pryke emily is here for you to see and speak to if you wish the local police were summoned to protect her said the social worker quite properly so agreed hall but not to protect her to remove from the estate trespassing journalists who could have terrorized a child as young as emily he crossed demandingly to johnson hand outstretched for the appropriate letters these followed when the journalists were expelled and will be produced by me when i protest to the press complaints commission as i will protest about those blockading the gate and by whom you were doubtless confronted the pause was perfectly timed i sincerely hope none of you cooperated to provide a headline about emily being taken into care because she isnt and if any such stories appear i shall officially complain to your authorities and not only demand a full and public retraction but an explanation for why people in your position commented upon a matter that has sub judice implications the second pause was as well timed as the first but as you were accompanied by an inspector from the local force to which the press complaint was initially made it is im sure unnecessary for me to have that concern humphrey perry guessed immediately there had been cooperation at the gate from the look that passed between victoria pryke the fairhaired man described as a member of the same division named eric pringle and the hotfaced police inspector paul hughes it was a passing realization perry was far more interested in jeremy hall on this showing he wasnt by any means the cheeky bugger of the previous nights judgement he was an extremely aggressive advocate who appeared to possess another essential weapon in a lawyers armoury the ability to seize a weakness and hammer it into defeat this isnt at all the sort of meeting id hoped it would be said baxter he was a large selfsatisfied man accustomed to deference and was disorientated at not getting it now how then can we help you smiled hall we have to take into account the fact of mrs lomaxs arrest and the reasons for it insisted baxter he was red faced too although from irritation not guilt at what had happened at the gate hall made much of examining the exchanged cards before coming up to the man youre a lawyer you know i am i accept that criminal law may not be your field but we can surely agree the principle of innocence until the proof of guilt yes said the man tightly then arent you acting prematurely our only concern is emilys welfare persisted victoria pryke a prim cardiganandpearls woman then were all on common ground said hall youve seen the circumstances in which emily is living he gestured towards annabelle and youve met the nanny in whose care she is im sure ms parkes will be only too pleased to show you her certificated qualifications and diplomas he hadnt expected it but annabelle returned at once to the bureau in which shed kept the media offers and came back with several documents offering them generally to the group victoria pryke took them passing them one by one to the doctor who in turn offered them to baxter you have a nursing qualification queried maureen snare looking up specifically in paediatrics elaborated annabelle triumphantly and wed be pleased to assure you of emilys care and well being in any other way we can finished hall finally wed like to see emily herself said the fairhaired social worker as annabelle left the room baxter said this is obviously a matter that will have to be considered after mrs lomaxs trial after stressed hall at which time it will be most vigorously opposed by me for the same reasons youve been made aware of today emily was holding annabelles hand when they entered but confronted with a room full of strangers she took her hand away and wrapped her arm around annabelles leg the nanny put a comforting hand around the childs shoulders emily was wearing jeans and a thomas the tank engine tshirt her hair bubbled in curls at the front was plaited at the back secured by ribbon with the same cartoon motif both the woman social worker and the doctor hunched down to emilys level hello said the social worker hello how are you asked the doctor all right at annabelles touch against her shoulder emily added thank you and looked up apologetically at her nanny thats why weve come to see you said the doctor to see that youre all right again the child frowned up at annabelle why thats our job said victoria pryke the child stood regarding the council group steadily do you like it here asked the social worker emilys face crumpled although more in bewilderment than at the hint of tears i live here with annabelle persisted the woman there was a smile shes my friend like your mummy is your friend persisted the social worker emilys bewilderment became more obvious my mummy is my mummy but shes not very well my daddys away i wont let this continue indefinitely warned hall are you mummy and daddys friends asked the child unexpectedly no admitted victoria pryke we want to be your friends to make sure youre all right while theyre away annabelle does that said emily and hall decided every lawyer should be blessed with witnesses like the child do you want a more specific answer than that he demanded no said the doctor straightening the other woman briefly remained crouched then she stood no she agreed as annabelle led the child from the room victoria pryke said there was no way we could prevent our photographs being taken at the gate it was done before we knew what was happening we were approached by a man with a tape recorder we didnt speak into it said perry seizing the opportunity to enter the conversation focusing publicity upon a child would be the last thing youd welcome as a social worker wouldnt it the woman was the first to leave the room ahead of the rest of the group the three lawyers stood at the window watching the departing cars perry said you mean it about complaining to their departments of course if the reason for their being here is published it would be monstrous if emily were brought into it because some bloody social worker wanted her picture in the papers they turned at annabelles reentry theyve gone she said surprised its over at least until after the trial promised johnson shell be found guilty wont she demanded the girl forthright again there could be mitigating circumstances said hall but shell go to jail probably a special one for treatment broadmoor there are others poor mrs lomax what have you told emily about her mother not being here asked perry just that shed had to go away at first then i said shes ill and needs special doctors and that her daddys away working he often was hall nodded she wants to see emily before shes transferred from a proper hospital youll have actually been telling the truth annabelle frowned is it safe therell be doctors there but it would be quite safe anyway will she frighten emily with her illness i mean she might appear odd say things she wouldnt ordinarily say is there any way i can explain it to emily in advance so she wont be frightened hall shrugged helplessly you could say its the medicine shes taking when tomorrow said johnson ill collect you by car annabelle nodded use the tradesmens gate they dont watch that so much there was a remote control beam in the drive which automatically opened the main gate when it was broken by departing vehicles lessening the need to slow but at halls insistence the surprised perry stopped the car as soon as they emerged there were three cars and a television van outside now at once men disgorged from all of them a television strobe burst on before the running cameraman got to them the man with the tape recorder whod been there when they arrived said can we have your name as mrs lomaxs lawyer is emily being taken into care there were some offers wed like to consider said hall can you give me some cards there was a confetti of pasteboard as identification was thrust through the open window at him what can you tell us demanded the man with the recorder that there will be a complaint to the press complaints commission about everyone whose card i have here as well as their organizations for harassment and totally unwarranted intrusion i will also complain in open court at an appropriate time and invite comment from a judge as perry swept the car out on to the london road hall said well be back in london by early afternoon youll be able to file the complaints today wont you yes said the solicitor tightly dont forget the authorities here either we know now that they gave interviews we wont forget promised perry perhaps youd drop me off at the hospital on your way past relax dont fight against me ill fight him he wont be able to do it just listen to me nothing else noone else theres a lot to talk about to get you well masons voice was even monotone hed unstrapped his plainfaced wristwatch and was holding it towards her it moved back and forth very slightly can you see the numbers dont look yes i can see them whats before twelve dont play games eleven it was hard so very hard jennifer tried to make rigid her entire body to hold it stiff so there couldnt be any movement she didnt want to keep her lips stiff too so that only her words would come out not janes whats after one stop it eleven to one one to eleven eleven to one one to eleven incanted mason like a mantra like a clock back and forth back and forth fosdyke and lloyd stood motionless against the wall by the window hall intentionally stood half obscuring the window the only unrehearsed part he felt uncomfortable intrusive was mason right that strongminded people were more easily hypnotized than the weakwilled the mentally ill he supposed the psychiatrist had to be that was his job shut up dont listen count the numbers to me the right way your right way one two picked up jennifer three four stop dont do it five six jennifers voice faded good said mason soothingly very good five six no jennifers legs jerked but not as fiercely as before little more than an exaggerated twitch hall thought she looked so much better in her own clothes into which shed insisted upon changing the moment hed entered with the suitcases jeans and a sweater her legs actually crossed at the ankle as she lay back on the bed no need to do that warned mason you can stop jerking your body about youre in control not jane and you can close your eyes if they feel heavy thats it relax the next leg twitch was hardly noticeable there unhurriedly mason restrapped the watch you know youre not asleep dreaming dont you yes that weve got a lot to talk about yes do you want to talk to me jennifer yes so you wont lie to me no promise i promise whats the most important oath you could swear on to keep that promise jennifers brow furrowed emilys life will you promise on emilys life to tell me the truth all the time yes what about geralds life geralds dead how did he die stabbed cut who stabbed and cut him jane wake up dont listen dont want to listen yes you do jennifer is jane telling you not to listen yes listen to me not to him lets stop her jennifer drive her out cant cant yes we can i want you to do what i tell you i want you to stop hearing the voice cant she wont stop go away jane we dont want you said mason he didnt raise his voice hall was suffused with a feeling of unreality this sounded more insane than when jennifer was spouting the words supposedly from someone else you cant stop me cant stop her lets put her in another room then close the door think of jane in another room with the door closed a very thick door closing out the sound go on close the door can you do that close the door yes no shut her out jennifer its easy to shut her out from another room the doors very thick no yes have you closed her out yes shes not so loud now is she put in another room like a naughty child who the fucks he calling a naughty child no not so loud now hardly hear her at all listen to me there was a vague leg movement hardly hear her thats good thats very good easy to ignore her now weve shut her out do you want her shut out yes gone completely yes never get rid of me the sound started shes talking but not loudly is she real is jane real in your head jennifer yes shes trying to scream but it doesnt hurt so we can talk now without her yes whats that going to be like wonderful do you hate jane no what then just want her to go away wont go away ever youve got to wake up in a minute youll be mine again then tell me how much you loved gerald totally and he loved you totally whos rebecca rebecca nicholls works with gerald is she your friend fucked gerald fucked gerald not now you thought she was yes why isnt she your friend any more had an affair with gerald did you know they were having an affair no never suspected it no the police think you did not true is jane true or did you make her up shes true here now but in another room still hear her do you know what a cyclothymic personality disorder is jennifer no id really like you to tell me i want to know dont know whats a paranoid personality disorder dont know you sure you dont know yes can you tell me what an anankastic personality disorder is no you sure you cant id really like you to if you can i cant trying to trick you dont answer him without turning to the men ranged behind him mason raised his hand in a dontinterrupt wardingoff gesture he continued it to take a pen from the inside from his shirt pocket can you see this pen yes its very hot very hot indeed do you believe me it was a cheap ballpoint plastic cased yes im going to put it against your arm lloyd started forward but fosdyke snatched out stopping the protest it was difficult for hall to hold back he was sweating his back clammy his hands wet jennifer winced jerking away almost at once a perfectly round red burn mark formed on the arm in which the drip had been before she tore it out does your arm hurt it burns i want to do some tests is that ok yes im going to ask you some questions again and every time i do before you answer im going to put the hot pen on your arm if you tell a lie it will burn but if you tell the truth it wont do you agree to that yes define a cyclothymic personality disorder asked mason putting the harmless pen to jennifers arm i cant hall tensed forward no mark appeared trick musichall trick define a paranoid personality disorder the pen casing went down i cant no blister formed define an anankastic personality disorder the pen descended i cant jennifers skin remained unmarked does it still hurt where i first put the pen yes im going to put it there again its going to take all the pain away and the mark will go hall felt an unnerved sensation at the back of his neck as he saw mason place the pen on the angry mark almost at once the red began to fade there wont be a mark promised mason all the pains gone hasnt it yes hall was conscious of a relaxation from the two doctors alongside him he didnt look at them and they didnt look at him in front of him mason was asking jennifer do you like the cinema yes did you go with gerald sometimes did you ever see a film called the three faces of eve no you sure yes whats a multiple personality disorder dont know mason learned forward with the pen again putting it against jennifers arm and repeated the question the skin remained smooth and even youre aware people are trying to help you yes so its very important to tell them the truth yes so i want you to tell me the truth remember its very important yes did you kill gerald because he was having an affair with rebecca didnt kill gerald jane killed gerald would you have killed him if youd known no why not youd have been humiliated wouldnt you yes but i couldnt have killed him thats not right killed me you bitch what would you have done asked him to stop asked him what was wrong youd have wanted your marriage to go on yes do you love gerald yes even though he was having an affair with rebecca just sex was it just sex with you and gerald when your affair began yes you didnt love him at first no did he love you no who fell in love with whom first me with gerald i suppose what did you do said i wanted it to end liar let me in jennifer i want to talk to you let me in to talk to you she wants to talk to me i dont want to talk to her i want to talk just to you why did you want to end your affair if you loved him i dont understand he was married to jane let me in why was that important didnt want the marriage to break up why did you sleep with him in the first place he was attractive i wanted to from where he stood hall could see sweat glueing masons shirt to his back the man held a handkerchief to wipe his face jennifer appeared quite relaxed eyes half closed legs still crossed at the ankles he couldnt make out any discolouration on her arm where the burn had been minutes earlier it wasnt wrong then no only when it became serious yes liar liar liar why because it was serious a threat not to you jane wasnt well spare me do her dying made it easy though yes did you think that might happen how could i by killing her we didnt kill her you did you fixed the dose do you believe in ghosts no why not its ridiculous ghosts dont exist janes in your head possessing you yes ghosts must exist if janes possessing you i know but they cant i wont accept it im frightened ive scarcely begun yet what are you most frightened of people not believing me would it send you mad if they didnt she wont send me mad she says she will but she wont ill beat her beat everyone as a trader oh yes i will how are you going to beat her i dont know tears began slowly to make a path down jennifers cheeks although there was no sound she scrubbed a bandaged hand across her face fosdyke moved at last reaching forward and patting masons shoulder the psychiatrist nodded again without turning i want to go backwards now back to when you were young a baby even all halls voyeuristic discomfort went forgotten to frowned disbelief jennifer relived emilys birth no pain shes coming beautiful so beautiful and janes death sorry im so very sorry and her first day arrival at encocorps im going to be the best here top the trading commissions make a million and the sadness of the randolph celebration meal after her oxford graduation i know mummy would be as proud as you are daddy the voice change from adult gradually to baby talk was imperceptible and it wasnt until they went through teenage into puberty into childhood that hall became conscious of it it took him almost as long to realize the purpose of the regression when the frequent medical questions registered and he realized the exercise was not for the psychiatrists benefit but for fosdykes a search for pathological causes for whatever it was jennifer was suffering none emerged it was late into the afternoon and masons shirt was black with perspiration before he finally stretched up from the bed and for the first time jeremy hall became conscious of the odour of too many people being for too long in a small room he became conscious too that he was contributing to it when i clap my hands youll become aware not just of me but of other people said mason and from now on youre to help your barrister jeremy hall as much as youve helped me will you do that yes said jennifer and i want you to help everyone else like me doctors like me there will be a lot who want to talk to you is that all right yes and if i want to talk to you again like this well count the numbers on the watch will you do that for me whenever i ask you yes promised jennifer she blinked opening her eyes more fully at the sound of masons hands coming together did i help she demanded at once absolutely said mason thank you minutes later back in the neurologists convenient rooms mason helped himself to the everready coffee looked around the assembled men and said she hasnt learned how to fake her condition from text books ive no doubt whatsoever that jennifer lomax is as sane as any of us in this room maybe more so just as ive no doubt whatsoever that jennifer lomax isnt inventing the voice in her head its there so ive got the first case of ghostly possession in british criminal history demanded hall i dont know what youve got replied mason ignoring the intended cynicism but ive got a paper thats going to turn psychiatry on its head worldwide you sure demanded john bentley in frustrated disappointment ive gone through every line of the inquest evidence and talked not just to the investigating officer but the coroners officer as well assured rodgers jane lomax died from an accidental overdose of insulin theres nothing we could use to reopen the case fuck said bentley viciously i would have just loved sticking jennifer bloody lomax with a second murder can you imagine the bombshell that would have been easily said rodgers who feared the other detective was endangering professional objectivity through personal pique but well have to make do with what weve got and what have we got everything wrapped up and tied in ribbon said the inspector were ready to go fastest case ever dont rush the submission to the crown prosecution let them go around in a few more circles until we submit the evidence they wont be able to brief psychiatrists reminded rodgers theyll need to do that a week decided bentley well wait a week were going to see mummy in hospital would you like that whats wrong with her her head hurts the doctors are making her better is she going to die no darling of course not chapter fourteen until perrys hurried call jeremy hall had not intended being at the hospital for emilys visit it had nothing to do with the eventual trial and although that trial his first murder was of great professional importance hed already recognized objectively that he was spending too much time personally involved in situations with jennifer lomax which more properly should have been handled by the solicitor at that moment talking far too quickly to him on the telephone quite apart from offending the man himself trickled into the gossip mill that filled to overflowing the inns of court trough it could and he was sure would be represented as his nervous inability to delegate anything through fear of failure which even further apart would be compounded by his having apparently willingly accepted a totally indefensible brief the outcome of which could only be failure anyway so why was he bothering perrys call abruptly changed the intention according to geoffrey johnsons mobile phone alarm from the car bringing an excited emily and the nanny to london hed been seen entering the tradesmens entrance to the mansion to collect them and emerged to confront at least three maybe more media cars he was now heading a cavalcade towards london one vehicle had already drawn level at a traffic light and attempted photographs through the window perry confirmed indignant at the question that hed filed the press commission complaint at their own ambush and individually warned the editors of every journalist whose card had been thrust through their window not just of that protest but also of the intention to complain to a trial judge once one was appointed add this to the commission complaint by fax today instructed hall coolly also fax all the editors you wrote to yesterday that we intend raising with a judge in chambers today the danger of their representatives perverting the course of justice how the hell perry tried to argue annabelle parkes will be called as a witness for the defence said hall patiently shes received letters which we have and can produce before a judge offering her money to talk to the press in advance of giving evidence in court financial inducement could influence the veracity of anything she might give the fact that we know it wouldnt doesnt affect my submission agreed agreed conceded the solicitor at once dont forget we havent been appointed a trial judge yet i havent forgotten that said hall make a point of it repeat the warning to the editors whose names and media organizations we have to the press association ensuring its distribution to every media outlet in the individual letters and the news agency release also say we are applying for a chambers judge to extend the precincts of any court in which mrs lomax might eventually appear to the house in hampshire emilys kindergarten and st thomass hospital and every residence or place of work of witnesses particularly medical and professional witnesses likely to be called by the defence therefore any media intrusion would constitute contempt of court perrys intake of breath was sufficiently loud to interrupt the instructions youll never get all that the man insisted its unheard of i dont expect to get all of it admitted hall and i know its unheard of which is why itll frighten the bastards off and i will get the house and emilys school and maybe st thomass which is all i really want he hesitated did johnson tell you where he was when he called guildford call him on another line ill hold and tell him i dont want him to get to the hospital for at least another hour perry put down the phone unquestioningly hall heard a mumble of conversation but not what was said the solicitor returned very quickly he doesnt think he can do it under that time anyway the traffics bad good said hall briskly separately fax the police station local to the hospital warn of a serious risk of a potential murder trial being endangered by an attempt to pervert the course of justice ask for a police presence to prevent that happening to be in place at the hospital within the next hour make sure a copy of that request goes to every editor and to the judge in chambers he paused again anything ive overlooked hardly any thought youre going to alienate every newspaper youve ever heard of whats that got to do with it a lot if youre thinking about your career im not im thinking of a client and her fouryearold daughter there was a moments silence in whose name are these letters to be sent hall matched the length of the silence mine he allowed another gap you want me to tell feltham or do you want to do it are you making a point with that question asked perry frigidvoiced just ensuring that everything is conducted in the proper manner said hall easily officially its my function then lets do everything officially shall we are you going to the hospital i am now do you want me to come youll hardly have time if youre to do all this i can manage im sure you can said perry attempting a small point of his own jeremy hall didnt hurry knowing there was no need the traffic was already almost completely blocked over westminster bridge and along both directions of the embankment by the time he got there he paid the taxi off and walked the last three hundred yards to the hospital there were at least six uniformed officers controlling the exit and entrance commanded by a superintendent inside the perimeter the traffic jam caused by their checking every entering vehicle and person was compounded by two police vans in which other officers were visible and three motorcycles a constable immediately announced his arrival over a radio when hall identified himself and the superintendent hurried from a plainclothes group with whom he had been talking you jeremy hall yes are you sure this is necessary he was a large man imposing in his uniform he was perspiring despite the wind off the river i didnt catch your name the man faltered hopkins i asked you if this is necessary hall extended his hand there was more uncertainty before the policeman took it hall said if i hadnt thought it necessary superintendent i wouldnt have asked for it to be done hopkins gestured back towards the group there are lawyers from four newspapers there one from television and executives they say its ridiculous hall looked towards the group he didnt recognize any of them those he guessed to be lawyers were older than he was itll be discussed before a judge in chambers im content for him to decide if its ridiculous or not arent you the policeman coloured slightly have you a time of arrival hall looked at his watch maybe in the next fifteen minutes apparently the traffics bad its an old bentley green if you know the route we could intercept with a police escort the attitude appeared to have changed abruptly thought hall i dont perhaps it wouldnt be a good idea i dont want to frighten the child any more than she has been already as he continued on towards the hospital he saw lloyd and mason hovering just inside the glassed entrance he went to go by the group outside but five detached themselves blocking his path you hall demanded a bulgebellied man yes what on earths this all about press intrusion sums it up i think not a crime insisted another of the group perverting the course of justice is sos contempt of court lets be reasonable smiled the first man this is absurd way over the top i agree that pursuing a fouryearold child and a potential witness to whom a bribe has already been offered is way over the top said hall im confident a judge will agree with me this afternoon overenthusiasm dismissed a third lawyer a mistake but it doesnt need to be handled like this well cool our people down and that will be the end of it judges get irritated if their time is wasted chamber hearings are for emergencies dont you know hall surveyed the men ranged in front of him wondering if the physical barrier they formed was prearranged or accidental i do know very well and im quite prepared to confront a judges irritation i hope you all are too as he shouldered his way through he heard a voice say arrogant young bastard another voice sneered out to make a name for himself the two doctors were waiting for him directly beyond the door mason said what the hells going on hall told them very briefly masons face cleared by the time hall finished speaking the psychiatrist said very forceful very necessary said hall he was aware of lloyds attention shifting over his shoulder and turned to see the arrival of geoffrey johnson with emily and the nanny more police had come out of the waiting vans and were lined along the entrance listing the numbers and taking driver details of the cars indicating their intention to turn into the hospital behind the solicitors bentley all the lawyers and the other men with whom theyd earlier been standing were there too there was a lot of arm waving particularly from the sweating superintendent a solid police line formed across the entrance immediately after johnson passed through abruptly the indicators of the following cars were cancelled a strainedfaced annabelle parkes hesitated momentarily when she came through the doors the relief palpable when she saw hall the only man she knew beside her emily looked very frightened not just clutching the girls hand but pressing close to her leg as she had in the mansion her hair wasnt in plaits today but frothed around her head she wore a red tartan dress with white bows her free hand clutched a muchheld pinkeared white rabbit that wasnt white any more and a card already slightly bent it was mason who went forward ahead of hall the psychiatrist scooped down ignoring annabelle and said to the child was that fun annabelle went to reply but stopped at the head shake from hall not really said emily uncertainly grown up games arent was it a game a silly one i thought they were going to hurt us they were shouting and taking pictures you remember mr hall asked the psychiatrist nodding behind him emily looked at the lawyer a smile hovering yes hes told them to stop playing like that they wont any more wont they annabelle asked no said hall thank god for that geoffrey johnson entered from parking the car in time to hear the last part of the exchange ive just spoken to humphrey the hearings fixed for three its jarvis sir ivan jarvis was the most cantakerously irascible judge on the inner london circuit who deeply resented the mandatory retirement age and whose place upon that circuit according to the rumour mill was to be filled by sir richard proudfoot jeremy hall said it should make for an interesting hearing youll want me anticipated johnson hall nodded looking at the nanny you too possibly to swear the financial offer letters and what went on before what about emily at the mention of her name the alarmed child looked up and said where are you going nowhere promised annabelle nowhere without you i dont want you to go away emilys lip quivered and her voice broke noones going to leave you said mason quickly youre not going to cry are you yes said the trembling child truculently what are you here for asked the psychiatrist gently emily looked up questioningly to annabelle and then said to see mummy you dont want to cry when you see mummy do you no lets not then who are you demanded emily with abrupt child logic im a doctor trying to make your mummy better whats wrong with her shes not well hall was glad it was the psychiatrist and not him confronting the nottobeliedto inquisition is she going to die demanded the child with an equally bizarre lack of emotion no said mason its not an illness you can die from is she coming home today not today when mason straightened no longer able to remain with his legs buckled at emilys height as soon as shes better i want her to come home again and daddy she has to get better first ive brought her a present declared emily proudly what its a secret shall we go and give it to her with annabelle of course with annabelle all right as she began to walk emily handed the comfort toy and the card up to annabelle who took both hall wished the attention from a lot of people hadnt been so obvious as they made their way to the elevators but emily did not appear aware of it he led with lloyd how is she excited shes been ready a long time any difficulties lloyd shook his head nothing at all since she woke up i wish mummy could come home said emily as they got into the lift shes missed you too said mason could jane have gone not be there any more it seemed impossible to imagine but then what had happened was impossible to imagine totally utterly and completely beyond imagination or understanding but it wasnt happening any more today jane wasnt there hadnt been during the night either shouting and calling through the drugged fog to stop her sleeping for the first time for days nights shed slept without interruption and woken late but quite normally without any chant in her head now she felt rested fully recovered fully recovered and fully in control of herself not sharing her mind or her reasoning with anyone else better well again jennifer was standing waiting when emily came uncertainly into the room holding tightly to annabelle jennifer was glad because her throat filled and her eyes blurred and she couldnt think of the words that had been there ready to say just seconds before hello darling it was a croak like the funny voices they used when they played after school she coughed and said hello darling again normally this time and held out her arms emily didnt move at first then her face opened into a smile and she cried out mummy and ran forward into jennifers arms beside him hall was conscious of julian mason tensing and looked at the man who didnt respond instead he remained fixed upon mother and child head actually craned forward hall thought the transformation in jennifer lomax was remarkable shed obviously washed her hair and the perfection of the cut showed in the way it looped in a shining coil just short of her shoulders the dress was too formal for the morning but he guessed shed chosen it for its long sleeves which only allowed a fraction of the bandages to show shed compensated with the makeup just lip and eye line probably he thought all shed worn on the school runs she wasnt actually crying but her eyes were wet which he understood and unclouded which he thought was encouraging she appeared in fact absolutely normal they clung together for a long time before jennifer eased herself away but only far enough to be able to kiss the child it wasnt until she looked over emilys shoulder towards annabelle that she became conscious how many people there were she said hello annabelle thank you for bringing emily and then to hall as a focus i thought this was for me to see emily at once johnson said theres no reason for me to be here and retreated back out into the corridor peter lloyd followed i think i should stay said hall impromptu his mind completely changed from the beginning of the day and mason said he wanted to remain too jennifer sighed and for a moment hall thought she was going to argue instead she shrugged turning back to annabelle pulling emily on to her lap in the chair as she did so the conversation with annabelle was stilted and selfconscious emilys presence a bar to any proper answer to jennifers litany of questions ambiguously phrased again because of emily both were relieved when the child broke in refusing to be ignored plucking at the bandage protruding from jennifers left sleeve and then feeling the dressing on her hand emily said in sudden alarm did you have an accident yes said jennifer is that why youre here yes and then youre coming home jennifer hesitated when im quite better when will daddy come home jennifer had to swallow very hard i dont know he might have to be away for a long time why because mason remained tensed forward oblivious to everything but the woman hall was just as intent a doubt growing within him jennifer lomax was entirely normal a loving mother hugging a child from whom shed been separated so the hunchedforward man beside him had to be wrong jennifer lomax had to be a clever enough woman and they knew she was clever to defeat hypnosis and fool an experienced psychiatrist she hadnt faked a voice in her head ive got a paper thats going to turn psychiatry on its head worldwide he remembered did julian mason want to believe it to achieve some sort of academic notoriety i love you mummy emily was saying i love you too my darling i want you to come home i will as soon as i can jennifer had to cough to clear her throat i brought you a present announced emily proudly slithering from jennifers lap to scurry across the room unasked annabelle offered the card emily returned with it behind her back until she reached the chair with a conjurors panache the child produced it and announced i know m for mummy hall had a fleeting sideways image of the letter and of a stick figure with crossedeyes and spikey sunray hair before jennifer yelled no emily started back crying out in immediate terror as jane roared brat filthy little brat kill little brats jennifer grabbed out getting one hand around emilys throat but not managing to link it with the other because of the dressing and because emily tripped and actually fell backwards to get away from her mother jennifer started to rise from the chair bellowing strangling hands outstretched towards the cowering child but annabelle got to her first scooping her up and turning at the same time jennifer clenched her clawed hands into fists and began pummelling the nanny trying to force her to the floor i want her give her back hall was aware of mason moving and of lloyd bursting through the door followed by the policewomen but was unable to move himself paralysed by what was happening lloyd got between jennifer and the staggering nanny taking the blows blood burst almost at once from his nose but he managed to grab one of her arms it offbalanced jennifer who stumbled giving the police sergeant time to grab the other arm the constable wrapped her own arms around jennifers body half lifting her from the floor the bulllike bellowing continued and as soon as her feet came back on to the ground jennifer began hauling the three clinging to her around the room rocking to dislodge them the side table overturned spewing its contents and the bed slewed across the room scattering chairs hall moved at last seizing annabelle still shielding the child and bustled them out of the room into the waiting arms of a whitefaced geoffrey johnson hall turned back into the room but remained in front of the door barring it he at once realized that jennifer was about to throw off the police sergeant so he grabbed that arm as well conscious that the wounds had opened and that both jennifers arms were sticky with blood hold her just keep her steady demanded mason dancing around the struggling group to get in front of the woman with four people holding her jennifer came briefly to a breathless pause at once the psychiatrist was before her hands out to hold her head jennifer reared away trying to bite him but missed eleven to one one to eleven eleven to one mason chanted back and forth back and forth eleven to one one to eleven jennifer was bulging eyed nostrils flared breath rasping into her there was one desperate heave which almost dislodged them but then the panting eased and the sightless eyes receded can you hear me jennifer asked mason monotone yes who was it who did that jane i tried to stop her i said no but she came too quickly she was waiting always waiting always here they were all shocked mason less than the others annabelle wasnt with them in the ward sisters office because the trembling breathcaught emily refused to let go her hand from beside the bed that had been made available and lloyd was delayed restitching the burst open wounds before sedating jennifer ive had to tell the hospital management we cant risk the danger to other patients announced lloyd when he finally entered his white coat was blood splattered and he had cotton wool plugs in both nostrils his nose was beginning to swell there wont be any danger declared mason you cant still maintain that shes sane after that demanded hall he was totally confused about the psychiatrists professional opinion at that moment he felt confused about everything im prepared to argue it and im prepared to bet others will be too how much damage has been done to emily mason made an uncertain gesture kids are resilient but that was pretty bad pretty bad exclaimed hall it was bloody terrifying she tried to strangle her own daughter would have done if she hadnt been stopped ive already asked for a child psychiatrist said mason and a paediatrician too added lloyd he spoke adenoidally because of the plugs it was a mistake as far as emily was concerned letting her come to the hospital admitted mason one that wont be repeated insisted hall i think it was a mistake for all of us not for me it wasnt said mason honestly and hall thought again of the mans remark of having a sensational psychiatric paper chapter fifteen jeremy hall hadnt expected the gauntlet of cameramen through whom he had to pass for the hearing and did so unsure if their jostled presence was defiance or attempted intimidation he didnt like the way they kept shouting here jeremy this way jeremy as if he knew them he walked staring straight ahead refusing to look in any direction humphrey perry was in the corridor with johnson both men looked isolated and uncomfortable like stowaways stranded on a desert island the newspaper group had at least doubled from that of the hospital forecourt that morning there was a lot of noise and some laughter a clublike camaraderie perry said ive heard what happened with the child it sounds awful it was worse than awful answering a lot of uncertainty though not according to mason it hasnt the concentration from further along the corridor was obvious the laughter had seemed to increase at halls arrival perry said youve thrown a bomb in the beehive here and we couldnt have got a worse judge than jarvis hell know whose chambers youre from cant be helped i wish it could my tutors used to talk about the impartial objectivity of the law remembered hall academics with no idea of the real world dismissed perry matching the cynicism weve drawn a short straw which is a problem the case was getting out of hand out of his protective hands and he was worried a problem about which we can do nothing said hall realistically you spoken to feltham since you left chambers no sir richard wants a meeting after this is over i want to ensure emily is ok and that she and annabelle get back to the house safely i said sir richard wants a meeting repeated the solicitor emphatically i heard what you said well have it not just after the hearing but after im happy about the child and the nanny he turned to johnson youll take them back of course it was phrased as a question although it wasnt of course blinked the family lawyer who had fervently decided during the journey from hampshire how fortunate it was he hadnt chosen criminal law the judges clerk came into the corridor obviously startled at the number of people awaiting the hearing perry hurried off to identify himself momentarily disappearing into the melee that formed at once around the surprised court official it seemed a long time before perry reemerged he was clearly flustered making jerky shruggingoff gestures as he returned along the corridor towards them the times mail sun and express have engaged senior counsel all qcs every organization is represented god knows how many barristers bloody field day which shows how worried they are pointed out hall not as much as i am said perry with feeling thanks for that expression of confidence this is extreme so ive already been told they did not have to gown up for a chambers hearing able to enter immediately there was a general summons sir ivan jarvis appeared even more surprised than his clerk by the number of barristers before him jarvis was a tiny wizened man whose smallness was less obvious in a robe and wig and from the elevated bench of a crown court now on the same level as everybody else the man appeared almost to be crouching like an enquiring squirrel behind a table the size of a car park his head twitching from face to face there were several spare smiles at barristers he recognized from the press side a total lack of expression in the direction of hall hall perfectly concealed his inexperience of hearings in chambers letting perry lead to their expected place any hesitation doubly covered by the confusion of seating the hissvoiced squabbling newspaper contingent which the clerk attempted with the arm waving urgency of an endofterm photographer trying to assemble a disorganized class for proud parents endofterm souvenir the muttered disputes were heightened with sighed rearrangement and jarvis said in a voice unexpectedly loud for such a small man get along get along this is a simple application not a major trial hes in a bad mood whispered perry unnecessarily from behind hall it still took almost another five minutes for the media lawyers to be seated in their selfelected order of priority only at the very end of the chaotic process did hall identify at the rear of the court the superintendent hopkins hed half expected bentley and rodgers who looked back at him stonefaced but not the uniformed hampshire constabulary inspector who had been with the council officials for the onsite child care meeting hall twisted more fully frowning to perry who said hughes remember if hed cleared the roads around the house like he should have done all this wouldnt have been necessary so why shouldnt he be inconvenienced ill call him agreed hall approvingly and go and remind bentley hes precluded from talking about anything that has happened at the hospital and what his policewomen witnessed why demanded perry soft voiced just do it jarvis pawed some papers in front of him and said mr hall jeremy hall rose bowing his head deferentially and said i appear before you today my lord to press the application that has already been laid before you from the chambers of sir richard proudfoot halted the judge that is so my lord i dont believe i have had the pleasure of your appearing before me the pleasure my lord is mine i hope but very much doubt he thought an extreme application mr hall reflecting an extreme situation my lord i hope youll be able to satisfy me of that im confident i shall be able to well see behind him hall heard the scuff of discomfort from humphrey perry from halls left there was a continuous undertone of coughs and foot movement and paper shuffling jarvis looked towards it and said a matter of some considerable importance then i would not have brought it before your lordship did i not consider it to be so thats encouraging to be told mr hall hearings in chambers are not to be requested lightly the movement sounds grew from the other side of the room hall didnt look in their direction at the conclusion of this hearing my lord i am confident you will accept my invitation to find that the circumstances are anything but to be considered or judged lightly then we must hope mr hall that we are both satisfied myself more than you proceed for the first time hall looked sideways to see smiles of satisfaction on the faces of several opposing lawyers they were all relaxed languidly sure of themselves he had sketched prompt notes for himself but mentally adjusted with the benefit of the unexpected hampshire police officer within minutes seconds it seemed of his trying to detail the press ambush which he and perry had personally experienced jarvis began what progressed into a persistent barrage of interceptions initially with a totally unnecessary query about the time of day and length of their being inconvenienced every time hall halted without a choice but without any impatience either and far more importantly never once losing his way during the brief pause it took the clerk to carry to jarvis their officially written press commission complaint along with the bundle of letters promising money for photographs and interviews perry muttered hes against us and they know it across the room they know theyve won the judges disconcerting disruptions continued when hall offered the hampshire officer and geoffrey johnson as witnesses to the harassment the policeman totally misconstrued the constant challenges as criticism and conveyed the impression that the mansion siege had at times been beyond police control hall snatched his first opportunity yet you brought no action for breach of the peace no sir admitted the inspector nor for obstruction no sir why not it was the opinion of my superior officers the case would not succeed in court why not had suicide been an option at that moment hughes would have taken it i do not know sir the power of the press i assumed you yourself were subjected to harassment were you not the man desperately sought an escape and failed yes sir did the media surrounding the mansion show any respect for your uniform officer no sir admitted the miserable policeman they were aware there would subsequently be a trial of course frowned hughes thats why they were there trying to obtain background material so they were showing no respect for a court either the man hesitated no sir i dont suppose they were the policemans report of wallclimbing and back entrance intrusion established a consecutive narrative with the solicitors account of that days sixtymile car chase with cameramen leaning out of open windows whenever his car was momentarily brought to a standstill by lights or traffic congestion twice when traffic was slowed to a crawl on his way through wandsworth photographers had jogged alongside taking pictures what effect did this have upon the child prompted hall looking sideways at the other lawyers none of whom were smiling any longer she was extremely distressed said johnson and ms parkes she was also extremely upset her concern was for the child emily did not understand what was happening she thought she was going to be hurt were you nervous mr johnson very much so there were several occasions when i feared there was going to be a serious accident none of the press lawyers questioned either the policeman or the solicitor when invited by the time he reached the end of his application jarviss intrusion had virtually stopped hall concluded by insisting annabelle parkes would be called as a material defence witness at the trial of jennifer lomax finally finishing i ask your lordship to find there is a very real risk that justice will not be served if this behaviour is allowed to continue i therefore seek the protection of your lordship on all the points set out before you in my application which i repeat in the most humble manner i have not brought lightly nor wantonly there were a total of eighteen newspaper television and radio lawyers each of whom addressed the judge separately but with very little variation those representing the organizations identified by the money offer letters and by the cards thrust upon jeremy hall set the tone the behaviour described was reprehensible and apologies for any excess were sincerely made for each episode each lawyer individually undertook on behalf of his organization to guarantee that neither the hampshire house the kindergarten nor the hospital would be subjected to any further press interest or intrusion i submit however that it is unnecessary legally to extend the precincts of any future court to include these named premises said the whitehaired lawyer whod first accosted hall in the hospital grounds it is my contention that the press of this country are more than capable of policing themselves i would further ask your lordship to find that there was no risk of justice being interfered with by the letters that have been produced but which incidently ms parkes has not been called formally to swear to as having received while questionable such approaches are not uncommon in cases attracting great public interest the newspaper i represent has made no such approach nor will it once more i contend the press is capable of establishing its own standards there was a parade of agreement from lawyers that followed and those who hadnt initially given personal undertakings on behalf of their media outlets all asked to be heard again to do so jarvis allowed them never once interrupting for several moments jarvis looked between hall and the lawyers ranged against him jarvis did so with his fingers on the very edge of the table almost as if he was hanging on to prevent himself disappearing beneath it then he said i think the problems of this application which i accept mr hall is quite properly brought have been sufficiently aired i am minded to accept the assurances of the learned counsel that such behaviour will not be repeated and i am reluctant to extend on behalf of a judge not yet appointed the precincts of a court not yet convened i am not aware in fact of a precedent would you mr hall be prepared to accept the verbal undertakings offered before me today upon my making it clear that i would regard any transgression most unfavourably hall rose slowly wondering as he did so just how much he was endangering the career about which perry was so constantly warning him before answering your question my lord i would seek to address you on a matter of legal precedent it took him a total of fifteen minutes to list the ten most recent and most highly publicized cases in which trial judges had publicly condemned financial offers to witnesses in advance of their giving evidence at prominent trials he did so individually each time having the clerk carry the identified case record to jarvis who risked being even further submerged behind the growing wall of case books with the greatest respect my lord i would be reluctant to accept undertakings not supported by the strength of a legal finding by yourself what i have complained of today is not the overenthusiasm or momentary lack of judgement that it has been presented to you as being he was conscious of jarviss face hardening into an affronted mask and of the total silence of every lawyer in the room at what each would consider upstart impudence as you will see from the stated cases i have produced before you every time complaints such as mine are made the argument is advanced that the press should be allowed to put its own house in order to maintain its own standards and integrity which lasts only until the next time when the same excuse is put forward to yet another excess there is a need for a precedent a benchmark and it needs to be established by someone of your lordships stature and preeminence youve failed to cover an important point stopped the determined judge yet again you have assured me ms parkes is to be an essential witness yet youve failed to bring her before me to satisfy me she was the recipient of these letters why if it is your lordships wish then of course i shall make arrangements to have ms parkes brought here she is at the moment at the hospital bedside of emily lomax jarvis leapt in at the hesitation as hall had prayed he would and which was why hed paused hospital bedside i regret to inform your lordship that emily lomax was made so unwell by the events of the day that doctors at st thomass felt it necessary to put her under observation i am however pleased to inform your lordship the problem is not serious i expect the child to be released later today but she is extremely dependent upon ms parkes wishes the girl to be with her at all times it is for that reason i did not insist upon her being here but as i say if it is your lordships wish no not at all broke in the judge ill take the evidence of the inspector and mr johnson as sufficiently supporting as i was saying came back hall hurriedly i am particularly grateful it is before you my lord that i make this application today the mask had begun to soften he thought if my newness to the bar makes me precocious then i ask your lordships forgiveness and indulgence i am so solely in the best interests not only of a client in need of defence but also of a fouryearold child who today had noone to defend her and upon whose behalf i have made this submission to you there was an icelike chill in the room jarvis coughed a birdlike sound there is a complexion upon this episode that makes it an important one with profound legal implications i was unaware until this moment of the effect upon this tiny child and i am obliged to mr hall for bringing it to my attention i am persuaded therefore by the eloquence of the presentation to grant the application although to limit the precinct extensions to the hampshire home of mrs lomax and the childs kindergarten but not the hospital in which mrs lomax is currently undergoing treatment he looked directly at the press lawyers in doing so i would advise each of you to bring to the notice of your clients and your employers what has been said and ruled here today until the appointment of a trial judge the precinct order is mine and i will deal most harshly with any transgression as they left the room perry said jesus you took a risk talking of the childs collapse like that it wasnt a lie insisted hall it wasnt the truth either as much of the truth as any of the others were offering where the hell did you get all those stated cases of press complaints you werent the only one working late last night i was in the chamber library until midnight preparing for any press complaint hearing came in handy didnt it emily was in a playroom attached to a childrens ward when jeremy hall returned to the hospital but ignoring the toys she still clutched the muchhugged rabbit but her eyes never left annabelle when the nanny moved towards hall as he entered emily scurried alongside grabbing up for the ever present hand julian mason was there with a slightly built heavily bespectacled girl whom hall assumed to be the child psychiatrist he didnt think she was much older than the nanny the press have been barred from the house he announced to annabelle and i dont think youll have any problems going home if you do call me immediately he encompassed the other two in the room can emily go home whenever she wants we just waited for you said mason youve got to put ronnie rabbit to bed havent you encouraged the bespectacled girl to emily the child ignored her gazing up at hall instead why doesnt mummy like me any more annabelle wont tell me your mummy does like you said hall totally out of his depth and looking desperately at the others for help she loves you she told me she tried to hurt me like the men ive told emily its the medicine her mummys taking to make her better offered annabelle thats what it is seized hall she has to take the medicine to make her better but it makes her do funny things like today will she do it again no she didnt want my drawing she did shes got it now will i see her again shes asleep now getting better lets go home said annabelle briskly itll be late by the time we get there well come and see mummy another day will the men chase us like before no promised hall good said emily positively hall and mason walked annabelle and the child to johnsons waiting car at the entrance emily perceptibly held back frowning through the glass there was no traffic jam or obvious press pack im sorry about today hall told annabelle so am i said the girl i suppose nobody could have guessed it would happen hall looked at mason but said nothing waiting until the bentley eased from the hospital and turned immediately left towards the bridge is it going to affect the child not permanently said mason it wont have helped jennifer though im not sure there is anything that will said the lawyer everyone was assembled waiting in proudfoots riverview office when jeremy hall got back to chambers the qc and feltham were drinking whisky there was a halfempty sherry glass on the table beside perry there was no immediate invitation to hall proudfoot said i thought it was time we had an assessment the child is going to be ok theres still a lot more tests to be carried out upon mrs lomax i meant legal assessment said proudfoot impatiently he indicated perry weve heard what happened at the hearing weve got protection from the press which was very necessary said hall bentleys a headline hunter chipped in feltham wheezily hell tell his press friends why the child collapsed and theyll tell their lawyers wholl make damned sure it gets hack to jarvis he wont rescind his order hut hell make equally damned sure every judge on the circuit knows what you did hell think hes been made a fool of you didnt do yourself or the chambers any favours today said proudfoot it was right that the restrictions were imposed insisted hall youve alienated the press and the bench in one go said feltham just as insistently in the best interests of a client fought back hall he was tempted to help himself to sherry uninvited but decided against it arent you losing perspective here asked proudfoot its right that weve taken this case and its right a matter of professional integrity that we defend it to the best of our ability but at the end of the day it comes down to mitigation the plea for which after what happened with the child seems perfectly obvious shouldnt the application have been made challenged hall ive no fault with the application accepted the chambers leader but the press undertaking would have achieved the same effect as the definite order and we you wouldnt have been exposed to judges irritation do you wish to transfer the brief no said proudfoot quickly just remember that if youd like to discuss anything my doors always open he made a general movement with his whisky glass towards the chief clerk and ive never found berts advice unwelcome but i dont want it from either of you thought hall thank you for your support and confidence when he got home there was a message on his answering machine from patricia boxall that she couldnt make the following evening shed call hall felt relieved chapter sixteen jennifer gave up on everything on everyone even jane particularly jane the voice was always there mocking goading jeering and jennifer said words that werent hers and swore when she wouldnt have sworn she didnt argue any more didnt try to win any mental battles didnt care awake or asleep even drugged sleep there was a constant image blocking her mind more than jane occupied it emilys face emilys face contorted in openeyed terror emilys face broken in disbelieving fear as she twisted away emilys face blanking in horrified dread as she briefly lay helplessly on the floor emilys face screaming always emilys face the face of an emily knowing her mother wanted to kill her would have killed her until shed been stopped only just stopped wouldnt have been without the hypnotic key implanted in her brain thank god except there wasnt a god couldnt be what god would let this happen thats right prayers exorcism wont help you havent got anyone not even emily any more alone lost jennifers lassitude was absolute she wouldnt have washed unless shed been washed or brushed her hair if it hadnt been brushed for her or dressed if she hadnt been dressed or undressed makeup wasnt considered she made the very slightest effort with mason because hed saved emily but didnt bother with the other psychiatrists or psychologists or neurologists who followed intermittently with their questions and their tests but not any more trying to prove her sanity because she wasnt sane shed known for every second what she was doing when shed tried to get her hands around emilys throat but hadnt been able to stop herself only a mad woman would have behaved like that sometimes mad sometimes sane but mad when jane made her so couldnt win jane had won so why bother lost like jane said all gone everything gone jennifer didnt try to stop herself to stop jane during the examinations several more hypnosis sessions and more brain scans and having her head connected to electrical sensors and three times being injected with a drug theyd identified by name but which she couldnt remember any more than she could remember the names of all the experts whod conducted all the tests or in front of the rigidhaired magistrate whom jane called a menstrual cow and a menopausal mare and asked if she fucked pigs to the womans fury and who at the second hearing moved the remand to a womens prison the hospital pressed for the transfer citing the attack on dr lloyd as well as that upon the child and arguing their concern for other patients jennifer had heard the hospital lawyers argument and agreed with it jane had told her to agree with it shouting out jennifer was only vaguely aware but totally disinterested that jeremy hall or humphrey perry didnt any longer come so regularly although both attended the magistrates hearings as unconcerned as she was by their travelling with her in the ambulance to the prison on the way hall said she was going into the ward there not the general prison so it was nothing more than a change of hospitals youll be looked after there safe hes lying again full of dykes tongues in your pussy dildo rape youll be popular fresh meat your pussy will be red raw bleed maybe they wont care with the exception of the bars it did appear exactly like the hospital shed left even to the small separate room into which she was settled at the far end of the general groundfloor ward in which lay two women one with both wrists heavily bandaged the other called out something to hall and perry as they escorted jennifer through the long room neither man reacted and jennifer didnt hear but there was laughter from everyone else two uniformed nurses and two trustees in prison drab david emerson the whitecoated prison doctor who was walking with them called out thats enough girls the woman whod made the unheard remark said theres never enough thats how i stopped being an innocent virgin and there was fresh laughter a bigbusted broadshouldered matron who hadnt been in her office at the ward entrance abruptly bustled into the private room after them and said right now lets get you settled in shall we my love and at once began hanging jennifers belongings in the closet from a suitcase she opened without asking lovely clothes she said admiringly didnt take long did it no what frowned the matron its a psychiatric situation emerson explained to her at perrys gesture the doctor followed him out into the corridor with hall trailing uncertainly behind the more experienced solicitor to whom the remark about the clothes had registered like the suitcase opening said you wont forget that mrs lomax is a remand prisoner will you mrs lomax will get as good care here as she got in st thomass its the particular type of that care to which i was referring said the solicitor pointedly hall looked quickly back into the ward understanding jennifer was sitting docilely in the chair oblivious to what the other woman was doing the larger case was unpacked and shed started on the smaller one examining each article as she took it out fingering the material and looking at the labels i dont understand that remark emerson was saying he was a darkskinned man with wiry hair and a rugbyflattened nose mrs lomaxs psychiatric symptoms are still being assessed but shes obviously traumatized said hall i dont want anything to occur that might worsen her condition i dont the doctor began to repeat and then stopped for several moments he looked between the two lawyers then he said ill do my best id like better than your best doctor id like a guarantee said the barrister i cant be in the ward twentyfour hours a day the answer i would have thought would be to have people here upon whom you can rely when youre elsewhere said perry all i can do is my best insisted the man by the time they reentered the private ward which was actually bigger than the one in st thomass all jennifers things were put away and the two suitcases stowed in a locker above the closet perry said heres the inventory of her things id like you to sign receipt that should have been done at admission with her jewellery and money insisted the matron her identification plate read beryl harrison it was said the solicitor id like you to countersign it her valuable personal items remain in reception her clothes are here theres no regulation persisted the woman is there a reason not to demanded perry mildly theres no regulation said the woman doggedly to the doctor perry said perhaps you could take us past the governor on our way out well get it countersigned there the matron snatched the inventory from perry and scrawled her name below that of the admissions clerk satisfied perfectly thank you smiled perry the wardress who had brought them to the hospital escorted the lawyers back to the entrance leaving emerson and the woman with jennifer what happened to your nose get it smashed by some dyke emerson looked up startled from the st thomass case notes when jennifer repeated the questions then gestured to the dossier for the benefit of the equally startled matron voices in her head jane offered jennifer forcing herself to talk its jane this isnt going to be easy predicted the matron im not going to make it easy she says she isnt going to make it easy maybe i wont bother with my own admission examination today said emerson indicating the dossier again its all comprehensively listed here tomorrow will be soon enough frightened i might attack you fat nose she thinks youre frightened emerson ignored jennifer theres a lot of medical notes he said reading from the papers sedatives mostly i always think medications the best way to handle the difficult ones if theyre mad said the matron jennifer stirred to protest the madness but then sat back in the chair disinterested why bother i got a warning from her lawyers the younger one looked pretty new to me the solicitor started it qualified the doctor the young one came in at the end been around the block dismissed the woman i said wed do our best why dont they come and babysit if theyre so worried jennifer was only distantly aware of the discussion indifferent to whatever they were saying if she just slightly closed her eyes she could picture emilys face when shed grabbed out for her throat as if it was projected on to the blank wall opposite beautiful emily pretty emily terrified emily abouttodie emily theres a lot of money involved here cautioned emerson not looking up from the case notes in front of him expensive lawyers with big mouths could make trouble we will do our best wont we you treat the aches and pains david ill run the ward emerson who regretted allowing the domination in the first nervous months of his arrival but was resigned to the fact that it was too late to do anything about it now said ill leave you to give the medication then of course its been given intravenously at st thomass let me have the case notes ill look after everything she walked from jennifers room with the doctor releasing in their necessarily correct order the three locks securing the reinforced door of the dispensary with the three separate keys attached to her waist belt jennifer hadnt moved when she returned just a little prick in your arm the woman said and a little more than youve been getting at the other hospital so you can properly relax after the upheaval of coming in here youd like that dear wouldnt you as the needle bit into her arm jennifer was curious that jane hadnt made her arm move to try to prevent being closed out but it was the fleetest of passing thoughts which didnt matter like nothing mattered any more in the car taking them back towards the centre of london hall said you really think jennifer is threatened the absolute archetype said perry young beautiful wonderful body and rich one way or another with hardly an exception everything thats been denied all the rest of them in there therell be a queue hall shuddered to do what everything you can imagine quite a lot you cant weve got to stop it said hall furiously we cant prisoners run prisons not the staff said perry flatly what we did was all we can do what about the governor i made it very clear to the governor jennifer is a remand prisoner reminded perry he knew what i meant just as the doctor knew lets do it again in a letter or something it would make her even more of a target insisted perry how much more getting her face cut into more pieces than she cut her husbands when will it start asked hall dully they wont wait predicted perry they didnt the first trustee was a bottleyellow blonde and slight with no bust her fingernails were badly bitten the one who came in behind her had mousey hair in a pony tail and a black and red confusion of tattoos on both arms they were crude prison drawings jabbed with a pin for ink to be rubbed into the wounds fuck was spelled out across the fingers of her left hand hate across the right and high on her left cheek there was a droopedwing bird im frances said the blonde fran emma said the second one hello say hello hello are you frightened in a place like this asked emma a little id like some friends say it a little id like some friends well be your friends look after you said fran you need looking after here id like that say it id like that jennifer felt very relaxed warm thats why weve come said fran people helped you to dress and undress at the other hospital when you couldnt be bothered didnt they jennifer shook her head not bothering very warm warm and comfortable better than the other hospital can you be bothered now asked emma jennifer shrugged silly conversation not important nothing was important couldnt see emilys face on the wall any longer glad about that would you like us to help you get you ready for bed suggested emma its time you went to bed another shrug all right where she was here said emma let me help you she held her hands out for jennifer to grasp and when she did eased her out of the chair emma was in front of her fran behind jennifer felt someones hands on her breasts but it was very gentle not unpleasant nice very nice said fran say nice go on say it nice do you like that said emma softly yes say yes yes time to undress said the woman in front of her put your hands on my shoulders so we can help you obediently jennifer felt out putting her hands where shed been told the ponytailed girl leaned forward to make it easier and kissed her very gently on the cheek at first then on the lips parting jennifers lips with her tongue it was hard not soft like a tongue should be soft pushing and probing jennifer pulled back turning her head dont its nice said emma no said jennifer the hands from behind were squeezing her breasts and she shrugged to loosen the grip dont hurts nice if it hurts said fran mouth close to jennifers ear lets get these clothes off said emma theyre in the way dont you think theyre in the way jennifer felt the hands on her breasts loosen and lowered her head to see the buttons undone on her jacket there seemed to be a lot of hands hands in front and hands from behind busy fingers like spiders legs she thought it was funny and sniggered the jacket came off then the shirt she felt the zip go at the back of her skirt and fran pulled it down from behind with the waist slip step out now one step forward jennifer did as she was told in bra and pants the blondhaired girl came around from behind standing with emma both looked at her wonderful tits said emma wonderful i want the tits im happy with the cunt youre beautiful jennifer very beautiful say you like it say it now i like it no yes you are darling said emma not able to understand i like it no we think so i like it shouted the voice i like it both women smiled in front of her were all going to like it said emma we dont want that bra on any more do we jennifer felt the straps go and looked down as her breasts dropped forward very slightly beyond she saw fran on her knees and felt her pants ease down over her hips the girl didnt stand but stayed kneeling hands hard against jennifers buttocks bringing her crotch tight into the face jennifer felt something wet against her clitoris and wriggled to try to stop it dont please its nice darling you know its nice emmas voice was from behind both her hands on jennifers breasts kneading pricking the nipples between her finger and thumb hard soft hard soft dont youre hurting lay down urged emma it will be better if you lie down here we go unprotesting consciousness ebbing and flowing jennifer let herself be laid on the bed and was glad because she wanted to lie down she felt her legs eased apart and looked down and saw only the top of a blond head between her legs and felt a lot more wetness something stiff yet soft licking at her and something stiff inside her working up and down and she grew wet briefly momentarily the wetness stopped from outside although something inside still went up and down and frans head came up so that jennifer could see her smiling face and then it was gone again back between her legs she couldnt see the blond head any more because emma was in the way now bent over her breasts gently biting and sucking and biting and sucking it hurt but not badly and jennifer didnt protest or try to close her legs because she was too tired and really couldnt feel any more jane was trying to say something but jennifer couldnt properly hear maybe it wasnt words maybe it was just laughter i want her cunt now not yet we should have brought the cock next time let me have the cunt now shes tight on two fingers did she come yes this is going to be wonderful having her like this let me have her cunt now the two women hurriedly swopped neither spoke engrossed in new things new parts at last fran said this is fantastic her ass is tight too said emma hardly get my finger in i dont want to share her not yet we wont emma rose from between jennifers legs fran came down to the bottom of the bed and together they stood gazing down at the spreadeagled unconscious woman youve made her bleed said fran probably her ass she really was tight well bring the cock tomorrow thatll be fun i came said fran so did i but i want to come again i want you to fuck me with the cock yes thatd be good fun tonight as well as tomorrow as they passed the matrons office they both chorused goodnight and matron harrison said goodnight back she didnt have to go to the dispensary again because shed got what she wanted the first visit she stood for a long time gazing down at jennifers naked legspread body as the other two women had done in a babysoothing voice she said what did they do to you you poor little thing youll be all sore in the morning but dont cry little one nursey will make it better im going to rub it with nice soft cream thatll make it better nice and soft take the pain away there the voice said you dont know how youre going to suffer but jennifer didnt hear chapter seventeen there was no alternative to a mentalillness defence jeremy hall supposed he had known that from the beginning despite jennifers insistence and the unexpectedly conflicting opinions from a lot of the professional experts prosecution as well as defence quite a few of whom still had tests and examinations they wanted to carry out or repeat but all of whose findings so far were going to make that defence a mountainously uphill struggle hed let them go through the motions of course all part of justice being seen to be done but thats all it could be recognized routines with fancy names like schneiders first rank symptoms assessment to protect their judgement against contrary challenge and impressively to fill the invoice page when they submitted their exorbitant final bills hall was most surprised of all disappointed even by julian masons adamant refusal after jennifers agreement to have their final sessions with her under the influence of pentathol the truth drug to testify to a mental imbalance despite having personally witnessed jennifers attack upon the child any small doubts that hall had harboured and theyd been very small indeed had disappeared with that frenzied episode that to remember still made his skin crawl but mason wasnt alone just the only psychiatrist whod had the personal experience with the exception of milton smith the londonbased american psychiatrist who was prepared to give evidence of multiple personality disorder the independent and preliminary agreement of the other three defence psychiatrists was that although jennifer showed some signs of schizophrenia by hearing a voice and the depressed regression into which shed sunk after the attack on emily mental illness was too arguably uncertain for them to give a positive diagnosis so arguable in fact that each had so far indicated they were coming down on the side of sanity most bewildering of all was their unanimous finding like that of mason that the coherent if sometimes obscene conversational logic of what jennifer claimed to be jane speaking the prime indicator of schizophrenia proved rather than disproved she wasnt suffering from the illness halls problem of mounting any sort of defence acceptable to a court was compounded by each of the three prosecution psychiatrists although again agreeing some mental disorientation also being prepared to swear there was insufficient mental disturbance to amount to diminished responsibility which wasnt the end of halls problems thered been two separate neurological examinations during which jennifer had undergone electroencephalograms in addition to all the other tests administered by george fosdyke including brain and upper body scans both had registered absolutely normal showing no physical cause for jennifers condition hall accepted that what little he had was all he could possibly expect for a very fragile and uncertain mitigation plea apart from the outstanding psychiatric assessments which he didnt anticipate would do anything to help him and which shouldnt take longer than a week to complete perry had made brilliant background preparation because of jennifers possession claim the major thrust of his intended defence the solicitor had gone beyond obtaining a complete transcript of the jane lomax inquest discovering in doing so that bentley had done the same in an effort to uncover a missed murder by having a washington lawyer provide a full medical and personal history of gerald and jane lomax before their transfer to england perry had extended the lawyers investigation to include a dossier on rebecca nicholls which theyd had to make available to the prosecution under the rules of disclosure and which hall was sure would be made into a major part of the case against jennifer it appeared lomaxs affair with rebecca had begun at least three years earlier maybe even before that and that during their return trips to new york they had occupied rebeccas manhattan apartment virtually as husband and wife theyd continued to do that in the london flat during the nights lomax spent in london while jennifer remained in the country with emily when hed given hall the rebecca nicholls file perry had remarked that lomax seemed quite a bastard and after reading it hall agreed with the assessment in view of her mental state he would have liked a lot of it kept from jennifer but objectively realized it was a forlorn hope providing as it did the vengeance grounds upon which the prosecution were making their case which was founded on the incontestably concreted evidence of sixteen people witnessing the killing and which was going to be supported because of their doubt about mental illness by at least half a dozen of the countrys foremost mind doctors by contrast but he feared easily overwhelmed by the weight of evidence against her the biography he had of jennifer lomax nee stone was of a mensalevel woman who professionally had been relentless to succeed which she had and whose only known failing was to have embarked upon an affair with a married man whom shed subsequently married and who ever since had lived a faultless blameless charity organizing life he paused at the final thought charities that couldnt now fast enough get rid of her an embarrassing encumbrance the final acknowledgement of the obstacles he faced further unsettled hall who singlemindedly had set out on a bar career to become even more respected and famous but more importantly richer than his respected and famous uncle which required the same absolutely ruthless objectivity which his uncle possessed and of which irritatingly he knew himself at that precise moment to be a victim but an absolute ruthlessness which he personally hadnt so far shown if not his heart hed most certainly worn his integrity on his sleeve hed wanted to do his best for jennifer lomax was still determined to do his best for and by jennifer lomax but he had to accept reality and the reality was that he was defending a case as hopeless as hed recognized it to be from the very first sherryandbullshit session with sir richard and the inhalerpuffing bert feltham partners in cynical ruthlessness recognized but refused to recognize he reminded himself permitting no personal excuses hed been fooling himself allowing himself to forget and minimize the horrific awfulness of her crime because hed been too hungrily eager to make a career which he would because he was determined but not with this case hed given it a potential it didnt have had never had at once came another scathing personal examination if hed known it was an unwinnable case from the beginning which he had and known he was an inconsequential cog in some complicated higher chambers machination which he also had why did he have this incomplete feeling this belief he couldnt shake off that there was something more that he should have done should have recognized but hadnt gettothetopwhatever ambition nothing to do with it something quite different quite inexplicable there was a gap an empty place or a missing piece from a jigsaw with no missing pieces a complete picture that didnt have to be assembled he had all the parts every statement almost every scientific and forensic result every reason every motive every witness himself a witness to the madness even there couldnt be a gap a piece that didnt fit inexperience hall decided easy to rationalize to understand if he stopped looking outside and looked inwardly instead at himself which he was at last doing his first murder newspaper coverage because jennifer lomax was beautiful and her cheating husband was a millionaire the carnage of the crime hed wanted her to be not guilty so hed disregarded facts and common sense and more forensic evidence than any other murder case in the english criminal history of homicide about which hed read about or studied or been officially lectured about it had all been absurd fantasy the halfawakeatnight dream that indefensible though it appeared he was going to produce some incredible lastminute proof of innocence virtually impossible and almost certainly inadmissible under the rules of disclosure and lead the beautiful blond smiling jennifer lomax to face the cameras and a life of innocent freedom if he tried hard enough he could probably have imagined the soaring music lots of violins that normally accompanied such soapbox endings despite the selfhonesty the overlooked feeling wouldnt go it stayed nagging in his mind and he wondered if this was what janes voice in jennifers head was like until he realized what he was wondering that he was accepting the very presence of a voice in jennifers head and refused to let the speculation run his internal telephone buzzed to warn him that humphrey perry was on his way up from that days remand hearing and hall pushed the case notes aside before we begin hall said as the older man entered the room i want to say that i think the preparation is magnificent im in your debt thank you perry whose opinion of the barrister had changed during the pretrial weeks actually flushed i wish there was a possibility of it working out differently from how it will thats what i want to discuss said hall the way forward there was no change reported perry shes still wrapped in apathy abject depression is a schizophrenic symptom ive read all the expert opinions i commissioned them reminded perry what about outbursts usual abuse to mrs heathcote asked her how many times a day she masturbated and references again to jennifer herself being assaulted in the prison hospital what about that exactly pressed hall ask jennifer whos fucking her quoted the solicitor literally did you asked hall perry nodded after todays hearing she said nothing was happening that it was jane making her say it and immediately afterwards said it was true but that jane made her say that too hall sighed shaking his head mason says he thinks theres some abuse hall rustled his hand through the dossiers in front of him not in his report he telephoned he told me the same said perry thats why i made a point of seeing the governor again today he assured me shes in the safest place in the hospital and that hes made the matron personally responsible hall sighed again what about the election to go direct to a higher court bypassing committal perry smiled wryly if i hadnt applied for it i think mrs heathcote would have suggested it herself she seems to be the only person without the slightest doubt that jennifer lomax is stark raving mad ive sent her a note thanking her for her forebearance shes taken a lot of abuse hall tapped the files in front of him reminded despite what all the experts say its got to be diminished responsibility thats all it was ever going to be and because of what the experts say or rather wont say were going to have to introduce the episode with emily insisted hall bring it out when lloyd and annabelle parkes are on the stand and call the two policewomen you and johnson too perry shook his head sadly what a way to prove shes mentally unstable can you think of a better way so that i can avoid doing this it wasnt a criticism said perry quickly its the only thing you can do the best of a bad job did you tell her id need two or three sessions before the trial yes anything about a qc perry shook his head there hasnt been for quite a while now like i said her apathy is pretty complete hall moved the papers around again although aimlessly your preparation is brilliant you said frowned perry thank you so you know everything there is in the files the frown remained yes so whats missing perry stiffened affronted theres nothing missing im not suggesting you overlooked something its complete its me us its probably there staring us in the face but we cant see it i cant see it perry looked curiously at the younger man halls first case he remembered theres nothing i havent pointed up that would help us he insisted im sure youre right retreated hall maybe im trying too hard maybe you are agreed the solicitor it was only a short walk across the expansive car park to the back entrance to el vino and perry was at their regular corner table when bert feltham panted down the stairs perry waited for the man to recover his breath pouring the montrachet without speaking all set demanded the chief clerk finally todays outfit was a dovegrey suit with a tie to match worn with a black shirt he looked like a mafia capo from central casting as ready as well ever be medical experts are being a bloody nuisance but thats not unusual wont come out positively to say shes mad persuaded her to plead guilty not yet thats jeremys job ive done all the other donkey work lomax was a bastard prosecutions got a good case for a woman scorned feltham ordered a double portion of potatoes with his beef looking pointedly at the white wine margaux suggested perry good choice accepted feltham hows hall shaped up overall very well im impressed genuinely had a funny five minutes this morning about something that weve overlooked but then he agreed himself that he was trying too hard and whatever he thought it was didnt exist weve left the magistrates now its trial time when soon as we get a date and a judge think shed be persuaded to plead she was pretty firm at the beginning but shes gone downhill a lot since shouldnt be a problem all done in a day three at the most thatll help hes behind with his chambers rent perry gave a dismissive nod weve got the summonses on the copper affair i think we can accept that brief said feltham smiling broadly weve brought a friend announced fran this is harriet the newcomer was black with very short hair and tall towering over the other two prisoners hello and your other friend said emma holding up the dildo you like this friend dont you no please said jennifer the injection hadnt worked like it had on the other nights she felt relaxed but she wasnt drifting off to blot everything out say fuck me no you know you want it said emma say fuck me fuck me there we knew you did the black girl was undressing at the foot of the bed watching as the other two women on either side unbuttoned jennifers dress go away is that what you like fighting said the black girl leaning forward abruptly she slapped jennifer backhanded across the face careful warned emma dont mark her the black girl drew back strapping the dildo around her waist when it hung like a penis between her legs she said look jennifer for you say its nice no nice say it nice it is isnt it said emma but you were a naughty girl today jennifer you said something about the fun were having to the magistrates didnt you no it was jane we know you did matron told us and we told you what would happen if you did that didnt we the dress was totally open leaving jennifer in bra and pants from the top pocket of her prison overalls fran took a doubleedged safety razor blade one side was embedded between two pieces of wood bound in place with twine no whimpered jennifer theyre going to cut you screamed jane excited with one quick downward slash fran brought the exposed part of the blade down between jennifers breasts severing the strip between the two bra cups but missing her skin emma pulled both cups apart briefly leaning forward to kiss jennifers nipples the moment emmas head lifted fran lay the edge of the razor against jennifers right nipple well cut them off she said if you complain well cut your tits off and then you wont be pretty any more say you dont care that youd like it for the first time in days weeks jennifer bit her lips shut refusing the words the effort trembling through her excited said harriet look shes coming go on cut her just a little too soon yet refused emma she pointed to the prisontattooed bird on her left cheek would you like one of these jennifer ill give you one when the court hearings over i want her demanded harriet fran cut the pants away with the razor and jennifers legs were jerked apart for them to be pulled clear emma and fran stood either side still holding jennifers legs wide as the black girl climbed between them the artificial penis erect in front of her jennifer tightly closed her eyes refusing to look but she couldnt avoid the feeling when she was penetrated not that time or when emma followed or fran behind her this is the suffering i promise jennifer and its going to go on and on and never stop jennifer was shivering and sobbing when the matron entered the enclosed now empty ward heres nursey darling nursey with the lovely cream jennifer lay unresisting eyes still tightly shut needing the balm for the soreness scouring between her legs thats not nice is it darling shouldnt do that to you should they jennifer didnt speak didnt open her eyes shall nursey make them stop no again jennifer managed to hold the word back what she opened her eyes nursey make them stop shall she yes but youll have to help nursey how sign the form ive got here it says i can look after your chequebook for you that will be all right wont it why well pay them not to come near you youd do that wouldnt you pay them yes oh god yes no jennifer didnt say it how much do you think three hundred pounds i think dont you yes yes you make the cheque out to nursey and nursey will pay them not to come in any more thank you oh thank you bitch heres the authorization and nursey will go on rubbing this lovely cream in until the soreness goes its all right if nursey does it all the time isnt it here goes your money jennifer cheaper to he fucked the following day feltham appeared early at jeremy halls door weve been offered a provisional date if were ready we are when two weeks time the monday simon keflinbrown qc is against you robert morleys the junior whos the judge jarvis probably his last case oh said hall when your lucks out its out said feltham philosophically and he wants pretrial conferences chapter eighteen the only difference from their previous encounter appeared to be the greater number of files barricaded on sir ivan jarviss massive desk the squirrel collected more nuts the kernel of his case among them thought hall as he followed simon keflinbrown qc into the judges rooms keflinbrown led as if by divine right he was an urbane avuncular man who out of court affected broadstriped suits which the inevitably worn pastelshaded garrick tie rarely matched in court usually to the tolerance of judges to whom he was well known keflinbrown performed tricks to impress and influence juries hed produced one in the corridor outside immediately looking enquiringly beyond hall to ask who his leader was and reacting with exaggerated wideeyed surprise when hall said there wasnt one which the man had well known all along thought the woman was rich she is and shes satisfied said hall that still wasnt certain he remembered but he was happy with the retort should be an easy one i suppose it posed an equally easy retort why had keflinbrown accepted such a mundane brief but hall didnt ask it according to feltham the qc only took on surefire winners if he had the opportunity and had jumped at the jennifer lomax prosecution there was a smirk from morley whom hall guessed to be only four or five years older than he was although the man was thinhaired and paunchy and looked at least fifteen years his senior perry appeared disinterested in the exchange a man privately admitting lost battles before a shot had been fired jarvis greeted keflinbrown with a thinlipped grimace that passed for a smile but which had gone by the time he got to hall the judge completely ignored the other barrister and perry after the grimaced smile came the nod and after the nod the beginning of the required verbal minuet jarvis said mr keflinbrown and the qc said my lord and then jarvis said mr hall who echoed my lord adept from long practice at the intricate steps keflinbrown said with my friend mr robert morley i prosecute on behalf of the crown my lord and you are in a position to proceed we are my lord mr hall we will be ready on the suggested date my lord does being ready also mean you will be in a position to mount a satisfactory defence demanded the tiny man pedantically hall heard perry shift behind him on their way there the solicitor with questionable jewish cynicism had said confronting sir ivan after the press complaint was going to be like facing himmler with toothache hall said it does mean that my lord jarvis briefly shifted some files for no reason hall realized it was customary for the man to sit with his fingertips on the table edge which really did make him seem to be holding on to keep himself in view the judge said something like twentyfive prosecution witnesses mr keflinbrown a total of twentyeight if all are called my lord said the qc indeed said jarvis perhaps you can help us with that mr hall my instructions are to enter a plea of not guilty my lord said hall the point and purpose of the meeting he knew aware of the concentration not just from the judge but from keflinbrown as well not guilty pressed jarvis ominously those are my instructions repeated hall i have had certain advice in advance of this hearing said jarvis as you know mr keflinbrown the tightlipped smile flickered and died and as i am taking some pains to advise you mr hall i expect the correct propriety to be shown in my court at all times i am obliged my lord said hall realizing too late that he had spoken prematurely interrupting the old man before hed finished there was a moment of glacial eternitystretched silence before jarvis said as i was intending to make clear i do not like the time in my court to be wasted nor do i like indeed i will not in any way tolerate my court to be abused this time hall said nothing keflinbrown said quite so my lord im obliged mr hall prompted jarvis im obliged my lord it is important that your client is given every protection under the law available to her which i shall do my best to provide my lord were i for a moment to believe that wasnt being done i would take steps to ensure any failure or omission be immediately rectified hall waited to ensure the man had finished quite so my lord i understand certain medical evidence will feature strongly in this case that is so my lord with the benefit of evidence exchange is the prosecution in a position to suggest a certain course of events mr keflinbrown if it is your lordships wish i could discuss certain matters with my learned friend accepted the qc dancing to the judges lead mr hall my instructions are to enter a plea of not guilty to murder said hall i am not deaf mr hall i heard you the first time and several times after that surely you are aware we are talking of a lesser charge to which a different plea could be considered in which the mercy of the court could be exercised hall felt the perspiration wet across his back and hoped it wouldnt show on his face i regret to inform my lord that my client resists in the strongest possible terms that course of action there was another long pause as glacial as the first mr hall there is a period of two weeks before the scheduled trial date said jarvis i would suggest that in that time you discuss with your client in the clearest possible manner the offer that has been intimated by mr keflinbrown here today he looked enquiringly at his clerk is there a diary convenience say two days before trial yes my lord said the man not needing to look here declared the judge patting his hand impatiently against the desk ten oclock on the fourteenth is that acceptable to you both as my lord wishes said the qc thank you my lord said hall as they began to gather up their papers jarvis said mr hall i would have you remain if you so please for the first time the equanimity of keflinbrown faltered he filed out after his junior with his pinkly bland face creased with curiosity perry was frowning too hall wondered if jarvis intended the reminder of a headmasters punishment in the way the man kept him standing appearing suddenly engrossed in one of the files finally he looked up and said since our last meeting certain matters have come to my attention i do not intend to dwell upon them mr hall but i want you to understand without the remotest possibility of any misunderstanding between us that i will not tolerate any future nonsense i will not have the authority of my court put into question nor will i have it humiliated by being turned into a musichall there will be no tricks have i made myself clear mr hall completely so my lord as i will from now on if there is any transgression i am obliged my lord i will see you before me as arranged thank you my lord you will be careful wont you mr hall yes my lord keflinbrown was poised directly beyond the entrance he hurried forward smiling and said anything i should know about jeremy if it had been im sure sir ivan would have asked you to stay the smile went do you think you can afford attitudes on your first murder no replied hall honestly im not trying to create one disarmed the other barrister said hes a miserable old bugger well have to be careful so everyone keeps telling me hall hadnt intended the reply to sound as testy as it had youll let me know in advance before we see the old bastard again if theres anything to let you know about either way insisted keflinbrown and if youll take my advice youll do your best to fix it the way he wants perry whod waited patiently and politely out of hearing fell into step as hall continued along the corridor listening without interruption as they made their way from the building just before the exit he said youre not going to be let off lightly i know said hall shes got to accept diminished responsibility she wont then were in serious trouble sos jennifer lomax thats what i mean of course accepted hall knowing that wasnt what the solicitor had meant at all its called a temporary interruption announced the matron she lounged back expansively in her chair in control i got a heavy hint from the governor its time to ease off who gives a fuck about the governor said emma were going to what the fuck are you talking about demanded fran even more aggressively were going to leave her alone insisted the ward supervisor who says the voice was strident that of a woman accustomed to hitting before she was hit i did we got a problem here beryl demanded fran threateningly not unless you make it into one which youd be stupid to do bollocks said harriet weve got a brand new toy and i like playing with it i havent had enough yet were leaving her alone until after the trial insisted the matron she was glad of her position of command behind the desk it made her appear more confident than she felt beryl dont tell us what were going to do we tell you what were going to do said the tattooed woman we want to play while weve got the chance picked up fran she wont come back here after the trial shes off her head full of voices shell be sent to some secure mental institution for other people to play with she puckered her lips for the amusement of the others its not fair the huge woman shook her head smiling dismissively you just cant think can you what are you talking about now demanded fran shes got more than tits and a cunt for you to play with shes got money triumphantly the matron produced a sheaf of notes i promised to keep you away if she paid me and she did authorized me to withdraw her chequebook from admissions the smile expanded so now its ours all three women smiled back how much demanded emma hundred for you hundred for me ours gets split three ways you get the lot challenged harriet at once because im officially in charge and im taking the risk giving her to you for which we paid you reminded emma and here theres lots more more money than youve ever thought of and well get it providing were not greedy i want to fuck her again before she goes insisted harriet in reluctant agreement cut her a little i like seeing blood run she might not be going after the trial lured the matron dont forget ive looked after her at the remand hearings here seen the papers the police think shes faking the voice if the court agrees shes sane shell come back here for a time anyway hows that sound wonderful said emma perfect agreed fran all right accepted the still reluctant harriet then if she comes back here permanently we could sell her on when weve finished and get even more money couldnt we this could work out very well see exclaimed the matron when she entered jennifers ward an hour later they didnt come did they thank you now shes got you all to herself nurseys brought her cream i dont want you to do it either nursey likes doing it no open your stupid legs tell her you want it it was a personal test for jennifer to stop herself and she succeeded dont make nursey angry open your legs would nursey like another sort of present what jennifer felt a sensation in her legs a pressure to part them but she managed to resist it give me my chequebook a girl at school said she saw mummys picture in the papers she must have been mistaken insisted annabelle shes going to bring it tomorrow to show me which girl asked annabelle as casually as she felt able margaret roberts that night margaret roberts mother said she quite understood the telephone call and of course shed destroy the newspaper whats going to happen to poor little emily i dont know admitted annabelle such a lovely child yes an absolute tragedy yes chapter nineteen the repelling and physically real horror of lesbian rape literally of being their beckandcall sex slave shattered jennifers previous near catatonic shock of what had come close to happening to emily it would have been trite too easy too simple a metaphor for jennifer to have thought about awakening from nightmare upon nightmare but the return of jennifers implacable determination to overcome everything and everybody was very much like coming to her senses after being too long asleep she positively refused to equate one nightmare against the other each by itself sickeningly revolting but with this new awakening she could separate them believed even that she could get them into some proportion it hadnt been her jennifer lomax whod attacked emily it had been jane like it had been jane whod murdered gerald using her body not her responsibility then and she had been raped and sexually terrorized drugged at the very beginning and afterwards threatened with disfigurement if shed resisted not her responsibility either so it would be immature ridiculous to feel guilt or shame for what had happened like rape victims did no woman invited rape of any sort and she certainly hadnt invited what had been inflicted on her but which wouldnt be inflicted again ever the grotesquely fat matron with the probing finger had shown her how to stop it and never in her life had jennifer needed the same lesson taught twice certainly not this lesson the balance came at once there was an equation here matching it was knowing of janes presence which in her apathy shed almost forgotten opening her mind to the unseen presence like shed opened her legs to the monsters that she had very definitely been able to see and feel something else shed recovered with her wakingup determination and why she felt safe now without any tingling to warn her of jane it was difficult to be sure because she hadnt kept any sort of count but it seemed jane hadnt occupied her so much in the last few days almost as if the acceptanything unopposing indifference had taken the pleasure from the taunting jane was going to be surprised at the reversal upset hopefully at not anticipating it jennifer hoped so it would represent a victory a triumph over a presence a thing that believed itself able to control her every thought and every word and every action it was exhausting draining to fight against mouthing the rudeness and the profanities but shed learned how to do it as shed realized how to be sedated to keep jane as far out of her head at night as possible now she had to control her body movements too geralds murder should have been warning enough but hadnt been jennifer had been taken utterly by surprise at the total possession that had made her attack emily after that episode jennifer knew she had to be alert at all and every time for a physical outburst that could ridicule her worse possibly harm people in any situation with another human being but she could do it like shed always been able to do anything she set her mind upon the confidence ran through her a good feeling despite the caution that immediately followed shed never imagined how could anyone imagine confronting what she had to do now she still couldnt imagine just knew she had to do it had to survive would it become any clearer today how to do that perhaps although she wasnt sure pretrial conferences with counsel humphrey perry had called it in his pencilpointing way what about the long ago insistence not long ago in terms of time but certainly in terms of what had happened in between upon being represented by a qc something else shed let go hadnt even thought about after emily was there still time a question for jeremy hall along with a lot more she should have made a list against the distraction of jane appearing or should she it would be a hell of a recovery if she was able to resist janes intrusion and words and body movement and conduct a rational conversation with the barrister more than a hell of a recovery it would be that all important proof proof to herself more than to anyone else of her sanity as well as of her strength to resist even the scars on her arms and hands didnt depress jennifer the bribeobedient matron nursey will be good if youre good to nursey had removed the stitches that morning and left the bandages off allowing jennifer properly to look for the first time the right arm was worse the wound deep and jagged in a zigzag from wrist to elbow shed have to wear long sleeves all the time until she was able to get plastic surgery advice have the left arm and her hands done at the same time she was ugly like this emily would be frightened abruptly the reflection dipped could emily ever be more frightened than jennifer didnt allow the thought to finish she could only try to think of so much the most immediate things too soon yet there was too much in the way to plan how to build things with emily to make emily love her again she would of course plan and recover she had to emily was all she had left her life as soon as she got rid of everything else in the way soon she thought now there was a trial date she was impatient to get it over with there was movement from the main ward entrance and through the window of her separate room jennifer saw hall and perry approaching good morning jennifer said brightly the vague numbness registered seconds before the voice in her head said and good morning to you jeremy hall was surprised it was almost three weeks since his last meeting with jennifer lomax shed been zombielike then and according to perry had remained so apart from the shouted outbursts at every remand hearing in between today she appeared more in control of herself her hair and makeup immaculate sharpeyed aware of everything around her than at any time since the murder completely normal in fact its good to see you she said smiling tell him how much of you the dykes have seen and played with youre looking much better said hall as much for perrys benefit as well as for jennifers show him your sore cunt jennifer resisted for the second time she hadnt fully decided what to do about the rape and sexual assault satisfied enough for the moment that she could prevent it shes being obscene it doesnt matter said hall it does contradicted jennifer at once im fighting her refusing to say what shes telling me to and for that i feel very much better you stupid bitch you really are mad to think you can resist me jennifer saw the strained look pass between the two men before hall said theres quite a lot we have to talk about now that we have a trial date its not going to be delayed demanded jennifer at once no assured perry but we have to make a positive decision upon a defence there isnt one there is only one defence insisted jennifer not guilty because i didnt do it hall sighed jennifer i want you to listen very carefully sixteen people saw you do it the evidence against you is overwhelming incontrovertible and with rebecca nicholls the prosecution has a motive you dont have a not guilty plea its pointless ridiculous persisting with it all you have is a mitigating submission he paused and i have been given guidance by the judge and the prosecution that theyll consider a lesser charge and consider psychiatric evidence no said jennifer too loudly she saw the matrons head emerge questioningly from her office at the far end of the long ward you dont have an alternative jennifer insisted hall almost as loudly he was suddenly aware of calling her by her christian name what do the psychiatrists say barking mad the rest of your life among the loonies theres a conflict conceded hall noone will definitely say im mad seized jennifer triumphantly the american is prepared to testify to multiple personality disorder said perry everyone else talks of some indications of mental imbalance but they wont say im mad persisted jennifer of course they will youve got a voice in your head no admitted hall bastards it came with a roaring scream and jennifer put her hands over her ears and kept her arms tightly against her sides holding herself against giving in to the agony which she managed to do uneven voiced she said shes very angry yelling jennifer youre not understanding the implications of what im saying said hall gently even though the experts disagree theres enough for a defence of temporary mental instability theres supporting evidence to call with what happened with emily what this time the matron hurried the length of the open ward bustling through the door at the same time as knocking whats going on she mustnt be distressed nothing please leave us said perry perhaps i should leave us said hall not looking at the woman arent i doing well trapped whichever way you turn in her anger it was easier for jennifer to ignore the intrusion tightlipped she said it was jane who attacked emily which you know but i wont have emily brought into it into any of it which is the strongest reason i have for not agreeing to your defence quite apart from it not being true in the first place jennifer youre not making it easy for me for yourself im not interested in making anything easy if you wont accept my instructions then youre fired if thats your wish then i will make the case file and notes available to you said perry at once hall wished the relief hadnt been so obvious in the other mans hurried voice youll have great difficulty getting anyone else to represent you at this late stage youll probably end up defending yourself it would inevitably mean a postponement of the trial how long do you think fran and emma and harriet with that sharp little razor blade can be bought off and stickyfingered nursey you promised me a qc reminded jennifer no longer strident she didnt want a postponement to remain here for a moment longer than she had to jane was actually right bribery wouldnt work for ever no qc in mr halls chambers is prepared to lead in this case announced perry irritated that the young barrister hadnt accepted the escape that had been offered them help me said jennifer softly i want to said hall urgently matching her plea but youre making it impossible he hesitated shed already suffered enormously maybe in ways he didnt know and he was nervous how shed react if he consciously tried to frighten her further but he couldnt think of another kinder way if you dont agree to plead guilty to a lesser charge and the case runs its full course youll inevitably be found guilty as a sane person the murder was the calculated premeditated action of a wife being cheated by her husband youd probably be sentenced to at least twenty years hall paused again remembering julian masons belief of sexual abuse youd probably serve a minimum of twelve do you think you could survive twelve years in a place like this as opposed to a custodial sentence in a secure hospital unit where youd be eligible for release probably much sooner on the advice of doctors jennifer was gouged by fear and jane said thats how youre going to feel for the rest of your life for the first time jennifer responded i wont then quickly although spacing the words through tighttogether lips she said i wont give in im always going to be around when you do and you will over and over again hall slumped back in his chair defeated perry actually shrugged i accept your instructions to plead not guilty to the charge of murder said hall momentarily as pedantic as his instructing solicitor perry said dont forget jarviss religion hall nodded all the clinical and medical tests have been completed but i want to suggest something further youre possessed correct you know i am wed like you to undergo exorcism announced perry dont bother it wont work you mean by a priest or vicar queried jennifer yes whos jarvis and whats his religion got to do with it hall looked uncomfortable hes the appointed trial judge a very strong anglican whod be impressed by the involvement of a minister recognized jennifer yes admitted hall i didnt believe in any god before all this happened said jennifer i certainly dont after what ive gone through thats not really the point argued perry so id go through the motions of praying and whatever else is involved to score points with a judge scoring points with a judge is what trials are all about said hall matching the older mans cynicism if i dont believe it wouldnt work would it so jane would still be there and id have achieved nothing you wouldnt know that until youd tried said perry jennifer shook her head im satisfied with none of the psychiatrists being prepared to say im mad she must be mad erupted humphrey perry when they reached the courtyard outside the main prison gates only someone completely mad would have failed to see the only way out with a plea to a lesser charge i know said the younger man resigned we had a chance to get out why didnt you take it i want to help her how the hell can you do that she wont let herself be helped in the only way available ill enter the plea she wants go through whatever pantomime the voice in her head causes and let jarvis instruct the jury to return a verdict of the lesser charge made obvious from her behaviour in court that way shell get the care she so obviously needs perry gazed across the car at the other man acknowledging the ploy with an admiring nod but not immediately starting the engine jarvis doesnt want court time wasted on a full trial bugger what jarvis wants said hall show me a different way to achieve what has to be achieved in the best interest of jennifer lomax and ill take it i wish i could said perry solemnly so do i said hall jarvis will feel i dont need to be told what jarvis will feel stopped hall i know the ponderous silence stretched interminably sir ivan jarvis staring fixedly at hall and even simon keflinbrown who normally would have found the temptation irresistible didnt attempt any courtroom idiosyncracies there were no coughs no foot scuffing at last jarvis said could it be that i failed to make myself clear you made yourself abundantly clear my lord said hall hed wanted to cough but hadnt and the assurance croaked out then perhaps you havent made yourself clear to your client i have my lord during how many conferences since our last meeting three my lord logged meetings yes my lord i am displeased mr hall i have explained in the clearest possible detail the courses open to my client she repeats her instruction that she pleads not guilty to the major charge that of murder to the prosecuting barrister the judge said you have been apprised of this i have my lord im obliged to my learned friend turning to his clerk jarvis said whats the calendar allowance two weeks my lord said the man as usual not needing to consult the diary coming back to hall the man said you will remember what i said about tricks wont you i will my lord if you dont i shall be very quick to remind you in the corridor outside keflinbrown said i dont envy you one moment of it ill do what i can to help my case is proven before it starts after all thanks you did make three prison visits didnt you pressed the older barrister yes jennifer had remained as brightly alert as before and boasted about resisting the voice which she appeared to be doing certainly there hadnt been any unintelligible interruptions or swearing shed actually become angry when hed pressed her to reconsider the plea dismissing it and instead handing him a long list of clothes and accessories she wanted brought up from hampshire for her court appearances good said keflinbrown you know the old bugger will check dont you thats why he asked if they were logged youre joking theres nothing ever funny about sir ivan jarvis which youre going to find out hed spent the two previous weekends engrossed in the case notes and been unsure if he could spare the time to come out on the river this saturday in the end he decided he needed the relaxation in anticipation of what the next fortnight might bring but he was stiff not concentrating sufficiently at the beginning he frequently misoared and dug too deep to feather until he consciously forced himself to dismiss the case from his mind to get the slide moving easily and build up the rhythm hall got it finally feeling the cramped tension ease from his back and shoulders building up until the narrow boat was smoothly cleaving the water as he thrust beneath richmond bridge a group of japanese tourists leaned over the parapet to photograph him and hall wondered how many times in the next two weeks his photograph was going to be taken for what he reflected could be the obituary of a failed legal career it was inevitable that jennifer would commit some outrage from the dock and just as inevitable that because of it jarvis would intervene with instructions to the jury about diminished responsibility and most inevitable of all that the old man would consider it the sort of trick against which hed specifically warned forcing as it would the court to make the decision jennifer lomax had failed to be persuaded to make for herself trick or not and hall didnt totally agree that it was it would serve jennifer lomaxs best interests which was his primary concern as her counsel jeremy hall wished he could resolve the doubt in his mind that he was still in some way failing her he abruptly decided to cut the row short and spend the rest of the afternoon and evening going yet again over notes and statements hed already read so many times he knew them verbatim his rowing concentration gone again he missed his stroke altogether with his left blade veering the boat abruptly sideways and a group of people watching from mortlake bridge laughed at him he finished reading everything and considered calling patricia who hadnt telephoned him since the cantmakeit message on the answering machine hall supposed hed have to become accustomed to being laughed at in the coming weeks chapter twenty jennifer had a soaring uplifting feeling of release being taken from prison which she acknowledged at once was precisely what it was and what it should be since the day of geralds death she had been imprisoned first in the celllike hospital room and then in an actual cell although part of the prison hospital the escape wasnt total however there was in fact something new a torture that hadnt been inflicted before jennifer hadnt been conscious of the voice when shed emerged from her drugged sleep that morning as she usually was but when she became fully awake her body tingled with the numbness of janes presence but there wasnt a taunting voice instead at jennifers moment of awareness there was a cough the subdued sound of a watcher in the shadows which she accepted was the perfect description except that this watcher wasnt in the shadows waiting to pounce but in her mind but still waiting she didnt know for what or when jennifer positively let the thought linger challenging jane to read it and react to let jane know she wasnt surprised or caught out by the change of torment but still the voice didnt come there were though the occasional coughs of a patient stalker which jennifer ignored practically succeeding in submerging the occasional interruption beneath the growing euphoria at getting beyond four narrow enclosing walls for which she made meticulous preparation a cheque kept the insistent matron nursey will wash you just lay back on the other side of the locked bathroom door and provided the dryer to get her hair in perfect shape because the mirrors were larger she made up in the bathroom too she did so discreetly the lightest blusher the minimum of mascara a pale lipline determined to look her absolute best and most of all for every minute of every day that the trial might take to appear in control she decided shed made a good clothes selection during that last pleapersuasion meeting with jeremy hall for the opening day of the trial she chose the severe although loosely tailored blue dior suit and a plainly cut voile shirt to create the appearance shed favoured when shed worked at encocorps subtly feminine but more obviously nononsense businesslike it was also she remembered how shed usually dressed for the committee meetings of the charities and fundraising groups that had so very quickly found her name an encumbrance jennifer returned to the larger bathroom mirror to survey the complete effect glad the long sleeves completely hid the worst of the scars shed included gloves in her clothes request and considered wearing them to cover the damage to her hands but decided against it until shed assessed the court beryl harrison was waiting directly outside the bathroom when jennifer emerged she said you look lovely beautiful the reaching out was not really to feel the material but for some brief physical contact as jennifer followed the escort along the corridors towards the exit she passed emma and fran together as always emma told her to hurry back and fran said i like that outfit that would look good on me ill have to try it on jennifer strained to see something anything of the streets along which the prison van moved but the windows were small and heavily tinted and hardly anything registered one of the escorting wardresses a motherly woman said here it is then your big day jennifer smiled but said nothing there was a cough in her head a more positive throatclearing than any before jennifer stiffened but nothing came the same wardress said were almost there id sit back if i were you jennifer did although not knowing why the van began to slow and then abruptly there was an eruption of blinding light through three of the windows cameramen explained the wardress they shoot blind through the windows it hardly ever works dont know why they do it they wont have got you after the virtual isolation of the past weeks jennifer found the sudden bustle and activity strangely disorientating the yard beyond the shieldingoff highgated entrance was jammed with police cars and vans and men and woman in police and prison officer uniform the escorting wardresses formed up either side and walked her into the building almost directly inside was a reception office where her arrival was officially listed in a ledger and a clerk signed a receipt which jennifer realized was for her as if she was a product or a package still unspeaking they led her on nodding and occasionally greeting other officers and prison staff as they passed the cell at which they stopped was halftiled in its centre there was a scarred table with a tin ashtray in its middle there was a chair either side and two more against the wall below the barred window there was no bed or obvious toilet but there was a pervading smell of urine the wardress who had remained silent until now said do you want to pee or anything once youre in court youll be stuck not able to go i dont think so thank you its your last chance no if her brief hurries well be able to get a cup of tea before we have to go up said the talkative wardress to the other and then smiled as jeremy hall appeared at the door hall was smiling too humphrey perry was directly behind he was blankfaced the suits just right perfect good how are you feeling ok the excitement of no longer being incarcerated was ebbing away back in yet another cell not frightened asked hall jennifer didnt answer at once ive never been in a court before but no i dont think so theres quite a lot of ritual tradition dont pay any attention to it but you must leave everything to me not try to address the court yourself ill do my best not to let anything happen shes doing something different i know shes with me but shes not talking trying to upset me now by saying nothing just lurking perry whod brought up one of the spare chairs to sit beside the other lawyer shifted but didnt speak his chair grated jarringly how do you know shes with you asked hall i wont tell you remember shell know if i tell you maybe do something to stop me knowing she wondered if that would get any reaction but there was no sound in her head perry sighed hall said i forgot if you want to say anything to me you can do it through mr perry write a note or ask him to come up to the dock thats acceptable for several days itll just be the prosecution evidence and a lot more he didnt want to contemplate he thought fearfully all right weve done well with jury selection whats that mean ensured as best we can what might be the most favourable jury jennifers frown deepened i dont understand i challenged the men to the allowable limit and got them replaced by women he regretted now making the comment at all the composition wouldnt have meant anything to her if he hadnt mentioned it more sympathetic to me about rebecca you mean yes thats not part of my defence its the key to the prosecution which ive got to do everything to confront which i expect you to do very well hall half shrugged looking around the bare room you can have food brought in during the trial if youd like i dont think what they provide here is much good im not very interested in eating maybe ill think about it tomorrow but thank you for the thought it seemed a long time since anyone had treated her with any kindness or personal consideration she realized how much shed missed it suddenly she demanded are you frightened no blinked hall startled he was glad she hadnt asked if he was apprehensive which he didnt consider the same thing the most minimal element of fear and therefore hardly qualifying and if she had he would have lied to retain her confidence but he was apprehensive not of any one single danger but generally concerned mostly about the unknown whatever happened it was going to be a parody of a proper trial until jarvis intervened to stop it and hall accepted he personally would be the object of every sort of criticism and outrage and not only just most immediately and directly from jarvis but at every other legal level realistically jarviss influence disappeared with the old mans retirement and hall expected to retain his place in the proudfoot chambers even after sir richards elevation because he was the mans nephew but it would be a long time if ever before a brief was offered to him by name and even longer before bert feltham accepted one for him named or not im glad youre not frightened said jennifer and i appreciate what youve done for me i havent done anything for you yet hall reminded what youre going to do for me jennifer corrected i have to go and robe said hall standing do you want to make yourself comfortable before the court no refused jennifer again and i want to apologize for going on about a qc i trust you as they climbed the stairs to reach the robing room perry said yet another amazing transformation the voice has mysteriously gone away and youre the barrister she wants after all shell change her mind soon enough when she sees how im going to let the trial go what mind dismissed the solicitor allowing the contemptuous cynicism hall shrugged but didnt bother with a reply he was taking the only defence course open to him with jennifer lomax but he couldnt lose the feeling that he was in some way failing her preoccupied as she was by space or lack of it jennifer was surprised by the comparative smallness of the court her expected imagery came from films and television invariably american in which legal surroundings barely achieved their supposed officialdom from just the raised dais for the judge and the pen for the jury but otherwise looked like church halls where she was going to be tried didnt look anything like a church hall and scarcely appeared half the size of one jeremy halls word tradition came immediately into her still clear mind as jennifer entered the dock and gazed around her registering everything the brassrailed dock that was to be her place for the duration of the trial dominated the floor of the court only slightly lower in its elevated height to the carved woodcanopied and royal emblemsurmounted bench from which the judge would preside from the huge and momentarily unoccupied red leather buttonbacked throne in the well of the court seemingly far below her were the bewigged and ravenrobed barristers jeremy halls wig was far whiter his robe far newer than any around him with their instructing junior counsel and solicitors in battleready formation behind surrounded by so many artificial headpieces humphrey perrys domed bald head stood out like a pebble in a stream facing them but directly below the judges position was the robed and wigged court clerk with other officials and to their left a bespectacled greyhaired woman at a stenograph the press gallery was behind her and already full a flurry and buzz of attention erupting the moment jennifers head appeared above the rail a girl in a jean suit and a bearded man at the very edge of the gallery immediately began sketching in large pads heads jerking up and down like mechanical dolls as they tried to capture her likeness the jury box was on the opposite side of the court to the press tiered up on two levels remembering the downstairs cell conversation she counted ten women and two men they all concentrated upon her entry but with less noise than the press opposite the public gallery was behind and above far too high for her to see how many people were in it from the noise she guessed it to be crowded the seat towards which her two escorts gestured her was centred in the dock to micrometer exactness and appeared heavily padded until she sat down the leather didnt give remaining rock hard and jennifer accepted it was going to be an uncomfortable experience physically as well as in a lot of other respects down in his pit far below hall turned unexpectedly catching her eye he smiled and nodded to her she was unsure whether to respond but in the end nodded back although she didnt smile with the barrister facing in his direction perry leaned forward for a huddled conversation halls smile died his face at once serious there were more jerky nods of agreement before he turned back to the still empty bench there was a cough inside jennifers head the court will rise demanded the court clerk loudly it did in straggled unison jennifer had been ready aware of the clerk preparing to make the announcement but the unintended movement surged through her as she rose it would have brought her forward in a jump that might have spreadeagled her over the bar of the dock if she hadnt been ready for that too as it was she staggered forward and clutched out for the rail needing to cling to it in the effort to suppress the uncoordinated vibrations that racked through her body violent enough to have thrown her off her feet if she hadnt been holding on she felt the wardresses at either arm holding her and saw the entering judge stop and stare redfaced towards her his attention directed that of the lawyers most of whom turned the jury and media were already gazing at her in astonishment several of the journalists scribbling hurriedly mr hall demanded jarvis still standing is your client unwell beside her the chatty wardress from the prison van whispered come on love dont bugger about it wont help perry was already scurrying around to the edge of the dock just able to get his chin over the edge having done so there was nothing for him to say lamely he said to the escorts is she going to be all right the two women had prised jennifers hands free themselves to support her still shaking back to her chair having got her there they remained holding her up because jarvis was still standing its all right hissed jennifer as the sensation subsided sorry at a nod from the returning perry hall said i crave the courts indulgence my lord a momentary incapacitation which i hope does not recur said jarvis finally sitting as jennifer was lowered on to the rockhard seat the laughing started in her head hysterical and jane said hows that for openers and they aint seen nuthin yet beat you stopped it happening mumbled jennifer softly her head lowered to conceal the lip movement as shed tried to conceal it in hospital from the guarding policewomen she ached painfully from the effort of holding herself against the unintended movement not enough everyone saw are still looking a lot still were from the jury and the media although the lawyers had turned to look in jarviss direction small though the court appeared to jennifer the judge was still dwarfed by his surroundings the prisoner will stand declared the clerk and jennifer was unable to prevent herself wincing getting unsteadily to her feet again jennifer muttered help me to the wardresses who closed in tightly it was fortunate they did and that jennifer additionally snatched out for the rail again all feeling vanished instantly from her left leg she swayed into the escort on that side who grabbed her arm taking her weight it hurt where shed been cut as the clerk read out the formal murder charge jennifer felt the support disappearing from her other leg and knew the two women could not hold her entire weight suddenly the feeling came back then seeped away again then returned causing jennifer to bob up and down despite the effort of the other two women to keep her stable through misted eyes jennifer saw hall on his feet only vaguely aware of his returning a plea of not guilty on her behalf the women virtually carried her back to the chair again as they sat her down one said you sure you dont need a doctor as quickly as it had gone all the feeling although still with the numbness of janes presence rushed back and the voice said dont want any doctors taking you back to hospital and spoiling things maybe ill take a little rest but then again maybe i wont im all right jennifer said to the enquiring woman she felt physically drained the ache in her arms and legs and body worse than after the first attack now the tension had gone her legs were shaking although sufficiently below the wall of the dock for it not to be visible to anyone except the women now seated beside and slightly behind her as the older barrister rose ponderously to his feet and like the actor he was paused to get the attention of his audience jennifer forced herself to concentrate knowing that her future her everything depended upon every word and every nuance that was going to be uttered or conveyed in the coming days there was a lot of what jennifer supposed hall had meant by ritual the judge always addressed as my lord and keflinbrown describing hall as his learned friend and phrases like may it please the court used as verbal commas and parentheses before keflinbrown turned to face the jury to outline the case he assured them he would prove beyond any reasonable doubt indeed he intoned i will submit to you there have been few murders in the last hundred years even longer when the preponderance of guilt can be more strongly proved you listening jennifer jumped startled angry at herself for allowing one concentration to become greater than the other yes you did relax didnt you got to stay on your toes jennifer im going to destroy you everything about you the game is for you to try to stop me shall we do that winner takes all you or me fight to the death jennifer stiffened against any response and succeeded you may feel after having heard certain evidence that will be produced before you that there is a clinical explanation for this horrendous crime keflinbrown was saying upon that upon the law you must at all times be guided by my lord but from the outset you must know the prosecutions case it is that jennifer lomax before you in the dock the man performed his first obvious trick turning to extend an unwavering accusing finger in jennifers direction is a calculating premeditating murderess who killed her husband most horribly having discovered that he was having an affair with another woman a woman ladies and gentlemen of the jury whom jennifer lomax once regarded as a friend just as she believed her marriage and future with gerald lomax was untouchably secure dont worry jennifer noone will think youre that a month from now well have you safely tucked up with all the jesus christs and franklin d roosevelts and napoleons and catherine the greats just one big happy crazy party jennifer sat upright arms straight by her side anchoring herself by gripping the underside of the uncomfortable chair thinking again how much the prosecutor was making her sound like the signhere package that had been delivered that morning me she thought agonized its me me sitting here holding on here a person a body jennifer lomax me flesh and blood a person with feelings not her or the accused or this woman or a calculating abandoned wife who decided upon the ultimate punishment for a deceiving husband not true hadnt known tell them its not fucking true you lying bastard not fucking true you lying bastard jennifer was on her feet before she could stop herself the unpreventable shout reverberating around the court to the discernible echo of sharply indrawn breath she said no im sorry i didnt mean but her control was gone and the voice said dont let the shortassed judge stop you tell him to stay under his fucking mushroom where the pixies belong and as jarvis opened his mouth to speak jennifer stopped him by saying stay under your fucking before she managed to halt silence embalmed the courtroom every eye upon her hall was swivelled horrified perry was coming half bent crablike towards her the interrupted keflinbrown struck a pose head to one side bewilderment sculpted into his face sit down said the solicitor in a stage whisper heard by everyone but jennifer didnt sit down despite the wardresses plucking at her arms at the dock rail she said imploringly im sorry it wasnt me its never me its jane shut up and sit down said perry still loud mr hall demanded the judge i beg the courts indulgence my lord a problem from which my client is suffering which i intend bringing to your lordships notice during the course of this trial a problem this court does not wish to suffer cut off the tiny irascible man do i need to remind you about turning this court into a musichall no my lord do you wish an adjournment to advise your client how properly to behave in my court i do not think that will be necessary my lord dont have me make it necessary mr hall jarvis raised his head looking directly at jennifer do what your legal advisors tell you mrs lomax sit down and do not interrupt the proceedings of this court again as jennifer once more was put back into her seat jane said the dwarf doesnt like you noone likes you not even gerald liked you all alone poor little jennifer nofriends may i proceed my lord unnecessarily asked keflinbrown i wish you would said jarvis grimly keflinbrowns opening had been broken at his background sketch back to which he returned with a professionals skill jennifer stone had been born to privilege and known no other life the barrister resumed she was the only daughter of an army brigadier whose outstanding service as military attache first in washington and then in moscow at the very height of the cold war had culminated with his appointment as deputy chief of the britains defence staff and for a time permanent nato representative the accused travelled and lived in high places she knew no other life such echelons were her life nothing in that life had been difficult for her nothing barred to her she was a natural linguist fluent in german and french the oxford double degree in economics and mathematics had been gained with an appropriate double first before you ladies and gentlemen of the jury sits a woman upon whom life has always smiled the sun always shone and a murderess tell them youre a murderess jennifer was clutching the underside of the chair and tensed as the words and the desire again to leap up surged through her she kept her head tight against her chest and wrapped her feet around the chair legs the effort shuddering through her there was a stir from the press gallery and the jury looked hall jerked around face creased keflinbrown remained looking steadfastly at the jury his only concession a hesitation measured with stopwatch accuracy truly a beneficiary of the gods the man picked up on the absolute edge of hyperbole the transition from a brilliant academic student to an even more brilliant financial career was as flawlessly smooth as everything else that jennifer stone had ever undertaken in that flawless life she became ladies and gentlemen a commodity trader a vocation so far removed from the sort of mundane lives that you and i enjoy as to be difficult for us to comprehend in previous centuries such people would have become swashbucklers pirates even today they are the sort of entrepreneurs who daily pledge millions hundreds of millions upon their ability to forecast and predict the value of commodities metals oil grain meat money even in fact every essential of life in a month three months a year it is a piratical existence a hard unrelenting dogeatdog give no quarter occupation those who follow it are hard unrelenting unforgiving people which as the facts of this case unfold you might well bear in mind ladies and gentlemen of the jury it was overly theatrical and flamboyant but at the same time true thought jennifer thats exactly how she so nostalgically remembered encocorps priceassess before anyone else better than anyone else buy or sell before and better than anyone else forgive and forget noone else no mercy no excuses no escapes ready to kill to stop being killed kill to stop being killed jennifers mouth was open the words formed kill emerged although indistinctly and she managed to smother the rest in a choking cough there was a whatdidshesay coming together of heads among the assembled journalists and another nervous backwards glance from jeremy hall perry half rose then lowered himself again the judge remained poised longer waiting it was another opportunity for keflinbrown to demonstrate his finely balanced timing jennifer stone was such a person the barrister picked up once more in her first year at encocorps shed topped the inhouse chart of successful trades earned bigger profitrelated commission than any other dealer and maintained that supremacy every year until she left that departure was to marry gerald lomax a millionaire vice president of eurocorps american parent company and its head here in europe continued the prosecutor it was a marriage that took place just six months after the death of lomaxs first wife from what an inquest jury concluded to be an inadvertent overdose of insulin upon which as a severe diabetic she was dependent jennifer saw jeremy halls sharp sideways glance at the other barrister at the innuendo of the phrasing seconds before the voice burst through her head in a screaming echoing tirade murdered killed me the bastards killed me and then over and over the same roaring chant murder murder murder murder but jennifer was prepared more so than ever before alerted by the first reference to jane she clung desperately to the chair edge her body rigid pulling the control into herself and with her chin tight against her chest hopefully to prevent anyone seeing the bizarre eyesshut facesqueezed contortion against the engulfing noise as the facts of this case are outlined to you ladies and gentlemen of the jury one of the conclusions you may reach is that gerald lomax was a promiscuous womanizer keflinbrown was saying while his first wife was still alive lomax was engaged in an extramarital affair with jennifer stone his brilliant topachieving trader no thought jennifer outraged they were the facts but they werent the facts at all it hadnt been like that as it was being made to sound as if she and gerald had been rutting animals it wasnt sex it was love it was yes contradicted jane exactly what you were rutting grunting animals pigs on heat fuck fuck honk honk no protested jennifer forgetting where she was she came up with a start hall remained looking forward but was hunched almost as if he was trying to shield himself from her perry glared around and keflinbrown worsened the moment by halting in midsentence turning his head from the jury to look enquiringly at her mr hall said the judge exasperated i really will not allow this to continue as you well know my lord said hall rising i apologize once more to the court for the behaviour of my client which is in no way disrespectful but which is precisely how this court is minded to regard it stopped jarvis impatiently i would remind you there are ways open to me to restrict such behaviour i am so reminded my lord and i am obliged said hall meekly as i was saying restarted keflinbrown before their marriage before the death of the first mrs lomax jennifer stone and gerald lomax were lovers after their marriage the new mrs lomax gave up what had been a glittering career and chose to spend a considerable part of her time in the couples country estate in hampshire for part of every week however gerald lomax chose to remain and live in london which was after all his place of work the slight throatclearing cough and the sip of water was as timed as everything else at that place of work the place where this terrible crime was committed and witnessed by no fewer than sixteen people from all of whom you will hear was employed another female trader a fellow american named rebecca nicholls you will hear ladies and gentlemen that for some years maybe simultaneously with the affair he was conducting with the accused gerald lomax was also engaged in a relationship with miss nicholls indeed in new york which they had frequent occasion to visit and where miss nicholls retained an apartment the couple lived virtually as husband and wife doesnt that make pretty listening thats your bastard of a husband hes talking about jennifer this is gerald who used to come across with all that shit about love and happiness and how much he adored you and would do anything for you and rebecca your best friend listen up now i dont want you to miss a single word keflinbrown had turned to look at jennifer and by so doing brought most of the jury around with him he said after the hideous stabbing about which you will hear mrs lomax did not make what amounted to a full statement to the police did not explain herself but it is the crowns case that mrs lomax discovered the affair in which her husband was engaged with miss nicholls that she decided to wreak the most terrible revenge imaginable upon the man for his deceit and that in full and sound mind she set out just two months ago entered her husbands office and in full view of the entire staff stabbed cut and slashed gerald lomax so savagely and so severely that he died on the spot and that ladies and gentlemen is what i intend to prove to your satisfaction and i shall make you insane thats what ill do in the end of course really destroy that megamind of yours but slowly so very slowly ive got for ever after all so i want you to know how its happening when its happening every moment that its happening chip chip there it goes every little chip of the way and thats how ill leave you in the end jennifer a pisssoaked mindemptied imbecile dribbling down her front without knowing it jennifer was aware of perry at the dock edge for gods sake wipe your face spit is running all over you just like that chapter twentyone the diminutive judge was the main target of janes attempted abuse trying to get jennifer to call him a dwarf and santas little helper and a shortass but she also tried with every formal witness with whom keflinbrown opened the prosecution almost every time jennifer beat her lips clamped against the outbursts she did practically as well against any uncontrollable movement arms rigid by her sides to hold the chair edge her feet entwined around the seat legs had it not been secured to the floor to avoid its use as a weapon by a berserk prisoner that unbalanced posture would have worked against her bringing her crashing down entangled in the chair when her body lurched violently sideways as it was the movement the worst stopped the court again the motherly wardress whod kept a handkerchief ready since the dribbling episode managed to snatch out stopping jennifer being thrown off and jarvis warned jeremy hall yet again that was the occasion jane tried to make her call the judge santas little helper at the same time as telling him to keep his rattrap mouth shut keflinbrown even more adept at ingratiating himself with a judge than he was with a jury managed to create a very visible contrast between jennifers impromptu interruptions by the efficient quickness with which he called his technical witnesses a police photographer produced an extensive portfolio of pictures individual copies of which were distributed to the jury and among the assembled lawyers the man quickly itemized each print copies were not given to jennifer but she could see some open in front of the lawyers that included geralds bloodsoaked body and the goresplattered office and the lipclamped shuddering the sight caused her had nothing to do with jane the photographs were supplemented by the official plans of the encocorps office which were sworn by the architect as those hed drawn to rebuild the property after the ira bombing but which had been additionally marked for the trial showing the positioning of gerald lomaxs permanently visible office and its glasssided approach corridor in relation to the open trading floor from which the murder had been witnessed by so many people it was jennifers own revulsion that again shook through her at the evidence of the home office pathologist felix hewitt its awfulness worsened by the clinically unemotional way the man presented his postmortem findings he described the injuries as massive the aorta artery and ventricle chamber had been penetrated the aorta twice and one knife wound had entered the brain through the left eye inflicting huge damage to the frontal lobe and into the cortex the carotid artery in the neck was also severed as well as the femoral artery in the groin which was the worst of seven cuts and stabs to the genital area the face was also extensively lacerated the nose practically severed in hewitts opinion six of a total of thirtytwo severe stab and cut wounds would have been fatal there were numerous others less severe to the arms and hands consistent with attempted selfdefence death would have occurred in minutes from a combination of the fatal stab wounds extensive and immediate blood loss and shock tried to cut his cock off bastard deserved to lose it thought id managed it hed have felt it though been in agony like that one in the eye that would have hurt by the time of the luncheon adjournment jennifer felt totally exhausted her arms and legs cramped from the way shed forced herself to sit the muscles in her arms and legs trembled and she needed the support of both wardresses either side to reach the downward steps and for them to be at her front and back to guide her down into the cell the once crisp and pure white voile shirt was grey and limp from perspiration sticking to her back and shoulders like another skin sweat had soaked through into the suit too which was sagged with creases and damply uncomfortable her handkerchief was sodden with spittle too wet for her to wipe herself dry any more her makeup would be totally destroyed she realized she shook her head against the motherly wardress suggestion of food nausea churned her stomach bringing her close to vomiting she found it difficult even to look up at jeremy halls entry from the table at which she was slumped the solicitor was not with him are you all right of course im not all right shes insane everyone knows that shut up to hall she said shes saying im insane like she always does was it bad you saw how bad it was i meant how much did you manage to stop not enough a lot nearly all the outbursts a lot of the movement too but i know it wasnt enough ive annoyed the judge havent i do you want a doctor an adjournment no youve got to go on suffering what would that achieve hall made an uncertain movement tranquillizers might help no say you dont want them jennifer found herself clutching the underside of the cell chair are they permissible no wont stop you being my puppet i think so ill try to arrange something it wouldnt be possible for mason to hypnotize you hes to be called as an expert defence witness you didnt question any of the witnesses this morning jennifer challenged there was nothing to ask them the women you so carefully got on the jury were appalled at the photographs i saw their faces dont try to anticipate reaction i didnt have to try hall shifted discomfited hed come to the cells because hed felt he had to but perry had been right there was nothing he could say or do he hadnt expected to hope this soon that jarvis would terminate the trial anything you want anything i can do the tranquillizers might help waste of time ill find the court doctor and can you let me have a handkerchief this ones no good any more without her intending it to happen jennifers throat closed against the librium the court doctor offered she choked against regurgitating coughing afresh at the water she gulped to help swallow them she finally managed it her eyes and nose running she was still weakkneed and unsteady on her feet glad of the two women to help her back to the court wanting to anticipate each and every problem although do nothing to alert jane in advance she abruptly asked to use the toilet as they passed it even though she hardly needed to when she entered almost at once her bladder collapsed and she only just managed to avoid wetting herself difficult to keep up isnt it jennifer but you cant relax not for a moment not ever not until ive taken away so much of your mind that it doesnt matter any more jennifer clutched apprehensively at the dock rail her escorts tight on either side for the judges entry but no feeling was taken from her legs this time and she only had to remain standing for seconds she grabbed at once for the seat as she sat entwining her legs again she felt desperately achingly tired tremors constantly flickering through her muscles it all had to be from the strain of the morning the tranquillizer would not have had time to work yet she squeezed her eyes shut and then opened them wide against the desire to close them altogether tired jennifer want to sleep a little go on close your eyes jennifer stopped herself by continuously stretching and unstretching her face until she realized people were looking at her two women jurors were shaking their heads sadly abruptly she stopped the pain of biting the inside of her lips helped fight off the tiredness as well as keep them closed to stop herself being janes ventriloquists dummy cant relax not for a moment forgot again didnt you it was the prosecuting junior robert morley who took forensic scientist anthony billington through his evidence keflinbrown sat relaxed beside the man legs fully outstretched head sunk on his chest as if he too was about to sleep billington was a large fat man whod either put on a lot of weight since buying the overstretched suit or been misled over its size his deathly pale although heavily freckled face heightened the redness of his disordered hair as he began responding to the younger barristers lead jane said this is whats going to convict you so listen up you hear dont want to miss a word of it the body of a man identified to him as gerald lomax had still been in situ although already dead upon his arrival billington agreed to morleys opening question mrs lomax whom he recognized in the dock had also been there and identified to him both had suffered severe injuries the man far more extensively than the woman these injuries had caused widespread bloodstaining illustrated in the photographs which morley showed the man billington said he had taken numerous blood samples which he had later identified one ab rhesus positive was that of gerald lomax the other sample was o rhesus negative at morleys urging the scientist isolated three pictures from the portfolio showing finger and palm prints in a splayed arced pattern where someone with bloodsoaked hands had stood supported on outstretched arms at the scene was a germanmade kitchen knife heavily bloodstained on both blade and handle which he again identified from the picture file the fingerprints in the blood on the handle of the knife matched those on the window that overlooked the trading floor mrs lomax had substantial cuts to her hand the blood on the handle and the window was o rhesus negative on the blade there was also a considerable amount of ab rhesus positive jennifer had by now been lulled by the tranquillizer and janes absence for several minutes so the sharp return almost caught her out but oddly the slowing of her reaction at the same time gave her time virtually to hold it back as well as to keep her lower lip tight between her teeth tell him rhesus is a monkey and hes a fucking ape jennifer stopped the sentence halfway through and coughed to cover the words she did utter the urge was to throw her arms wildly up in the air and make the animal grunting sounds echoing through her head but she fought the movement by hanging on to the chair and for once the permanently irate judge did not appear to notice she thought some people in the court had detected it like theyd seen her contorted face there was a nudge from the friendly wardress who offered halls handkerchief hurriedly jennifer mopped her face conscious that saliva speckled her suit front she cleaned that off too get you a bib thats what well have to do and some adult diapers for when you piss yourself after his sceneofcrime examination billington said he was later given samples of debris scraped from beneath the dead mans fingernails by the pathologist professor hewitt it included o rhesus negative blood and skin particles consistent with a selfdefence struggle and with the extensive scratch marks on mrs lomaxs arms and hands couldnt stop me though could he demanded jane as morley sat down for the moment he had to go through the motions of presenting the defence demanded by his client thought jeremy hall rising for the first time did you take any further samples for forensic examination yes which you havent presented in court hall asked the question half turned accusingly towards the prosecution i was not asked about them reminded the scientist defensively then i shall ask you now said hall if you must intruded jarvis wearily hes going to be so pissed off at the end of all this its going to be unbelievable perhaps you would tell the court what other samples you took persisted hall there was considerable evidence of a struggle said the man the desk was greatly pushed out of the position indicated by indented pressure marks upon the carpet and what had obviously been mr lomaxs chair was overturned articles from the desk had been thrown to the floor and two decorative pots smashed i examined several of these articles for fingerprints to establish if anything had been used as a weapon had anything been so used broke in hall there was some hair adhering in blood to one of the broken pots whose hair mr lomaxs anything else there was other hair which matched both mr and mrs lomax on the chair and against the window at which mrs lomax was slumped when i entered the office im sure the prosecution are greatly obliged for your assisting their case mr hall broke in jarvis what about fingerprints continued hall determinedly widespread throughout the office of mr and mrs lomax yes but of noone else mr hall said the judge pained shut the fuck up you silly little bastard tell him jennifer had the first word halfformed before she was able to stop herself so the sound came out as a sibilant hiss billington hesitated unsure whether or not to answer at an impatient nod from the judge he said there was a third set of fingerprints which were found to be those of the cleaner not of any other person apart from the cleaner hes answered the question mr hall said jarvis with respect my lord i think it could be more fully responded to this time the nod of permission was accompanied by a heavy sigh red patches of anger were picked out on jarviss cheeks billington said apart from the cleaners fingerprints there was no forensic evidence whatsoever of anyone having been in the office other than mr and mrs lomax hed made the pretence thought hall gratefully sitting under the glare of the judge i call superintendent john bentley the arresting officer declared the younger prosecuting barrister and jane said im not going to be able to do anything here to make you sound more of a loony than you did yourself the detective entered the box only just short of a swagger and gave the smallest bow in the direction of jarvis before looking towards the press gallery and smiling to old friends jennifer saw several actually smile back having allowed his junior the crumbs of establishing the technical bottomofthepage evidence it was keflinbrown who stood to take bentleys account the suave superintendent flamboyantly immaculate in brown pinstriped suit complete with a deep red carnation recited his rank and position and followed the older barristers direction with accustomed ease a well rehearsed double act at precisely threethirty on the afternoon of the th he and detective inspector malcolm rodgers had responded to an emergency call to the city premises of encocorps off leadenhall street in the thirdfloor office they found the heavily bloodstained body of a man subsequently identified as gerald james lomax the managing director of the commodity trading company he was already dead from numerous wounds slumped against a floortoceiling window overlooking the offices working area they saw mrs jennifer lomax she was alive although bleeding profusely from a number of injuries and appeared to be in a state of deep shock because of that which was confirmed by an onthescene paramedic team mrs lomax was conveyed to st thomass hospital for subsequent interview did you form an opinion of what had happened in that office demanded keflinbrown i did sir replied bentley from my observations and from interviewing witnesses at the scene i concluded there had been a violent altercation between mr and mrs lomax culminating in mr lomaxs death mr lomaxs murder clarified keflinbrown resulting in mr lomaxs murder yes sir keflinbrown allowed himself a titfortat sideways look at hall before asking you came upon no evidence nor did you form the opinion that anyone else had been involved in this altercation no sir what did you then do after ensuring that statements were being satisfactorily taken from the large number of witnesses to the incident i went with my inspector to the hospital where mrs lomax was being treated for her injuries i established from the doctor that she was sufficiently fit to be interviewed there was no question of her fitness slowed the barrister wanting what he was sure to be the following mornings headline delivered at the pace he intended none sir in fact the doctor decided that mrs lomax was not after all suffering from shock what then knowing his part in the publicity act bentley concentrated everyones attention by laboriously taking a notebook from his pocket the accused identified herself as jennifer lomax i asked her if she knew why my inspector and i were there and she replied gerald nothing else simply gerald broke in keflinbrown again thats all sir i then formally cautioned her and asked her if she had anything to say bentley paused expectantly and what did she say bentley looked up from his notebook directly towards the press quoting he said it wasnt me it was jane there was an electric ripple throughout the journalists and a murmur from the public gallery above jennifer the jury exchanged frowned glances it wasnt me it was jane echoed keflinbrown that is correct sir help us if you will superintendent who is jane the first wife of gerald lomax said bentley jolting the media with another electric charge there you go jennifer off to the funny farm with the kind men in the white coats it took the choleric jarvis several minutes to bring the court to order throughout the delay keflinbrown retained a statuelike pose matched by that of bentley upright and expressionless in the witnessbox every member of the jury and all the press were looking at jennifer the two artists were sketching even more rapidly there was a hurried gesture from the wardress with the handkerchief which jennifer snatched to clean her face it meant she was only holding on to the chair with her left hand she was lurched furiously sideways to her left dislodging her grip she grabbed out frantically at first missing the wardresss offered hand and briefly disappeared from sight beneath the court rail as if trying to hide from the attention before they righted her again a fresh hubbub arose which the agitated jarvis once more shouted to control in jennifers head the voice chanted in rhyme peekaboo peekaboo cant see me if i cant see you i shall clear this court if this behaviour doesnt cease threatened jarvis proceed mr keflinbrown lets stop this nonsense were you subsequently able to discover from mrs lomax what she meant by that remark not one that made any sense to me no did she decline to make a statement demanded keflinbrown eyes wide with feigned surprise on the evening when i formally arrested her she refused to make a statement without the presence of her solicitor i made another attempt later to interview mrs lomax at the hospital prior to the taking of a formal statement at that time her barrister mr hall and solicitor mr perry were present you were pursuing your enquiries i was sir yes a particular line of enquiry yes sir agreed bentley alert for keflinbrowns guidance on how far he was expected to go this was in a policeguarded hospital ward but the attempted interview was to be taken in strict accordance with the required rules by which i mean there was an audio recording what was mrs lomaxs demeanour one of anger mostly she seemed upset that her legal advisors their having apparently earlier told her to say nothing had now agreed to our conducting the interview without prior consultation with her was that all there were some remarks from mrs lomax which were disorientated hall rose to his feet stopping the other barrister i wonder my lord if we are not endangering privilege here the witness has testified to having given mrs lomax an official caution and you were present said jarvis hall ran his hand over the papers before him there was no indication that this would be included in the prosecutions disclosures im prepared to admit it ruled jarvis im obliged my lord said keflinbrown as hall sat then he said angry and disorientated anything else she demanded the presence of a doctor to act as an independent witness so she was agreeing to be interviewed i believed that to be the case why should mrs lomax have needed an independent witness with her lawyers being present it was never made clear sir she seemed to believe she would be cheated at one stage she indicated she was dispensing with her legal representatives cheated said keflinbrown stressing artificial bewilderment cheated of what by whom i never discovered that sir was there a particular line of enquiry you were pursuing at this time it was coming thought jennifer and jane said you bet your sweet ass it is there was sir tell my lord and the jury what that was i had discovered mr lomaxs involvement with a member of staff and wanted to establish mrs lomaxs awareness of it you mean a sexual involvement an affair yes sir there was a stir from both the jury and the press what was mrs lomaxs reaction she became hysterical and collapsed were you able to resume that interview at a later date no sir when i attempted to do so i was told by mrs lomaxs legal advisors that she declined to speak to me further how long have you been in the police force superintendent twentyeight years sir a man of considerable experience yes sir including regrettably experience of murder cases speaking directly towards the jury again bentley said a total of twelve all of which have led to a conviction in that considerable experience have people collapsed under questioning before several times and in your opinion based upon your considerable experience was mrs lomaxs collapse genuine or faked in my opinion sir it was faked keflinbrown turned away from the detective to face the jury again as i told you at the beginning of this case you must at all times be guided on the questions of law by my lord but i would advise you that it has been the law in this country since that juries are allowed to draw inference of guilt or innocence from a defendants insistence upon remaining silent jeremy hall was annoyed but professionally so still totally under control keflinbrown had massaged the presentation to within a hairsbreadth of what was permissible and if hed been the counsel to attempt it mrjusticebloodyjarvis would have cut him off at the knees but then it had been a very long time since anyone had seriously tried to advance a case that the law any more than life was fair there is a lot more with which you can help the court isnt there superintendent hall spoke as he stood a keflinbrown type mannerism im not sure that i can no sir hall noted you were aware of something else at the time of the attempted interview about which youve told the court quite apart from any affair that gerald lomax might have been involved in werent you i am not sure repeated bentley trying to hold the kneejerk temper gauged hall that surprises me i am afraid i dont understand youre a police officer of twentyeight years experience youve successfully solved twelve murders a commendable record is there a point here mr hall demanded jarvis it was an attempt to help the detective but hall saw at once how to use it to his advantage very much indeed my lord i am seeking to establish the credibility of this witness credibility queried jarvis still to halls benefit although not intending it to be very much so my lord how beside hall keflinbrown stirred discomfited in the witnessbox the colour had begun to suffuse bentleys face hall said upon the very essence of detection i would have thought his observation about which superintendent bentley has already talked to this court and of an incomplete record of an encounter at which to the great benefit perhaps of my client i was fortunate to be present watch him drop you right in the shit jennifer tightened her slightly relaxed grip but there was no movement proceed allowed the judge reluctantly bentleys face was blazing and hall was surprised it had been so easy he said mrs lomaxs remark about jane didnt remain inexplicable to you did it expectation surged through the press gallery no did you not make some comment about it during the aggressive and unsuccessful interview with mrs lomax to which youve referred i may have done the qualification was a mistake which the man appeared to realize as soon as he spoke at once the impatient jarvis said well did you or didnt you superintendent yes or no i made reference to mrs lomax hearing voices in her head be quiet snapped jarvis at the noise that rippled through the media jane said jeremys on my side not yours hes making it easy for me i can relax once more there was no impulse to move remembering jennifer looked enquiringly at the handkerchiefholding wardress touching her mouth the wardress shook her head voices pressed hall or just one voice just one voice mrs lomaxs defence to this charge is that she is possessed by the first wife of gerald lomax isnt it the reaction which was varied but all noisy was general throughout the court and the judges fury wasnt specifically directed it still took several minutes to subside eventually bentley said that is what i understand it to be hall felt very much in charge enjoying himself do you believe in ghosts superintendent the tightfaced man allowed himself a frigid smile no or spirit possession no hes opening the door to the asylum for you and you didnt believe mrs lomaxs collapse was real either no despite the fact that a doctor a doctor who will be called during this trial to testify categorically assured you that it was within a very short time of it occurring no you have medical training then no so you are prepared to argue a medical clinical opinion with a qualified doctor in my professional opinion it was a faked collapse persisted bentley temper completely lost im certainly prepared to argue about ghosts and people being possessed you shall superintendent you shall promised hall abruptly sitting malcolm rodgers who followed bentley into the witnessbox loyally supported his chief that the collapse was phoney and even agreed the apparent intention to fire her legal team could have been intended as a diversion to avoid an interview conscious of looking remiss to a jury he intended to show hed overlooked nothing keflinbrown took the inspector in detail through every minute of every encounter with jennifer lomax who sat listening to janes mental reminders of how insane it made her sound although not needing to be told because that was precisely how every accurately recounted word made her appear did you properly and completely carry out every part of a murder investigation with the exception of a satisfactory interview or of obtaining a statement from the accused concluded keflinbrown i did sir agreed rodgers absolutely absolutely jeremy hall had no questions which jarvis seized to end the days proceedings as they were tidying their files the clerk hurried up to perry with a folded note from which the solicitor immediately looked up to hall jarvis wants to see us in chambers before we start tomorrow overhearing keflinbrown said ill still take the lesser plea if shell agree which jennifer didnt fifteen minutes later when hall reached her in the cell he thought jennifer looked more than simply drained she appeared hollowed out a shell of a person i wasnt sure where your crossexamination of bentley took us she said first stop the madhouse hall wasnt either it dented his credibility for which rodgers more than compensated its a long list so theres no guarantee well reach her but rebecca nicholls is listed as a witness tomorrow warned hall this weve both got to hear i think the tranquillizers helped today ill see you have them again tomorrow jeremy hall had a good note and an even better verbatim recall and went directly from court to chambers to compare what he considered relevant from the case notes with that days evidence it took him two hours and ended with a feeling of frustration he couldnt properly identify or even understand what is it he demanded of himself aloud and unembarrassed in the solitude of his cramped back room what the fuck am i missing fuck wasnt a word he normally resorted to but it seemed in very common usage these days his room was so remote that it was served by narrow back stairs so there was no collision as they left but he emerged at practically the same time as sir richard proudfoot humphrey perry and bert feltham leaving from the main entrance with two men he didnt know for several moments they remained looking at each other startled then proudfoot said working late yes said hall then uncaring you too something like that said the chamber head goodnight goodnight in jennifers oneperson prison ward the matron said theres the magic to make you sleep my lovely now nursey will just rub you very gently so youll relax give me the chequebook said jennifer chapter twentytwo so today she was going to face two enemies one she would be able to see as well as listen to the other only hear double torture double humiliation closing in almost overwhelming despair that for the last thirty minutes shed come near to giving in to quite apart uncaring even from jane being aware of every mental reflection jennifer found it difficult to hold any thought which wasnt the chlordiazepoxide that jane had again made her choke to the point of vomiting against taking that hadnt had time to take effect she was still thickheaded that cottonwool feeling from the drug the matron had given her the previous night her pubic hair had still been slimed with whatever the woman had used for the game shed played with her after making her unconscious with the injection but thered been no soreness so jennifer didnt think shed been fingered or abused by anyone other than beryl harrison still more humiliation the warning of rebecca nicholls being the first witness to the actual murder had come from jeremy halls cell visit after her arrival from prison that morning the barrister was still flushed from his prehearing encounter at which hed told the judge of jennifers continued refusal to change her plea sir ivan jarviss alternative to foreshorten what again hed called a musichall instead of a trial had been to cut by half the number of tradingfloor witnesses with virtually identical accounts of the killing the fastfooted headlineconscious simon keflinbrown had instantly agreed and nominated rebecca to be the first guaranteeing the continuation of coverage that had exceeded either his or john bentleys expectations and hopes that morning all the tabloids had led with the previous days hearing murder by possession was one slogan murder in mind another and almost every newspaper carried collected photographs of jennifer jane and rebecca inevitably the captions had referred to eternal triangles the motherly wardress its ann ann wardle ive got a son whos ill like you had shown her the daily mirror on their way from the prison all three photographs had been taken in happier laughing times assured confident women women upon whom no misfortune could ever fall despite the woollyheaded feeling and not knowing then that she would be confronting rebecca jennifer had tried as hard with her appearance as the previous day although she accepted bitterly just how far short she was of how shed looked in the pictures the newspapers had obtained shed bribed her way into the bathroom again carrying todays grey suit and black shirt which wouldnt so easily show her sweating or slobbering and not just to prepare herself behind a locked door but to douche herself from whatever shed been subjected to by the matron there was a sanitary pad dispenser and jennifer took one and lined her pants against janes threat to make her disgrace herself in the dock shed also brought several handkerchiefs two of which ann now carried escorting her along the corridor towards the dock steps the wardress also had the two jeremy hall had brought for her during their brief meeting just do your best hed said reaching across the battered cell table to squeeze her hands lightly in encouragement i ache all over from yesterday from trying to hold myself against what she might do anything he was glad perry wasnt in the cell with his unnecessarily impatient sighs there was no harm in humouring her in trying to help her through jarvis had been furious at the refusal to alter her plea he was going to be even more of a cantankerous bastard than he had the previous day shes been humming like shes pleased with herself i am pleased with myself every reason to be but whats all this bandholding someone else trying to get inside your pants going to get crowded in there isnt it just try your best repeated hall at a loss for anything else to say thats all you can do i am making myself look a fool arent i that was at the brink of despair i could go back to the judge even now offered hall hopefully no shed determined pulling back no and now she was walking towards the bear pit to be taunted and prodded and reduced to a sniggering pitiful joke at the bottom of the dock steps jennifer hesitated momentarily refusing frightened to ascend up we go love come on urged ann i dont want to you havent got a choice come on with leaden feet at last beginning to feel the librium jennifer climbed aware of the buzzed expectation as she got to the court level as she became visible the noise grew an excited moblike sound probably just like a bearpit anticipation she thought or maybe the entry into a roman arena of a victim who didnt stand a chance of escape you dont i keep telling you that i dont think well make a fool of you just yet not until rebecca lets keep them in suspense rebecca nicholls looked sensational and jane said holy shit shes fantastic and dressed to make you look a klutz rebeccas hair a darker artificial blond against jennifers natural colour was cut severely into her neck around which there was just a single strand of plaited gold the dress was black and figurehugging belted again by a gold strand she took the oath with her left hand resting prominently on the edge of the witnessbox displaying on her engagement finger a diamond ring that was her only jewellery having returned the bible to the usher she began playing with the ring with her other hand drawing attention to it she stood staring defiantly at jennifer the expression carefully balanced between haughtiness and contemptuous revulsion great tits gerald always was a tit man wasnt he that and cuntsucking you think he did that with her sure he did she probably gave him head too nose to tail like a couple of vacuum cleaners jennifer held herself in her rigid pose gripping the seat edge legs entwined the press concentration was entirely upon rebecca the same artists as the previous day sketching rapidly keflinbrown was on his feet the consummate ringmaster about to present his best act the barrister took rebecca smoothly through her eurocorps career demanding suddenly and now youre acknowledged its leading trader the question seemed to surprise everyone as much as rebecca she said ive achieved the highest commission over three successive years yes as mrs lomax did before her marriage i fail to see the relevance of that question protested hall quickly standing a question of resentment jealousy at being replaced in every way suggested the older barrister i see no problem with it began the judge and then oh mr hall really ann thrust a handkerchief into jennifers hand as she mopped her face she saw rebecca look at her lip curled in disgust now her makeup would be smeared jennifer thought like a clowns agreed jane jennifer felt her body being thrown to the left and tensed as hard as she could against it abruptly the sensation reversed and she went violently to the right propelled by her own strength ann grabbed her when jennifer righted herself rebecca was faintly smirking so you replaced mrs lomax in more ways than one scored keflinbrown i became the top trader said rebecca stiffly on top of the boss you were in fact working on the trading floor on the day of gerald lomaxs death yes some of the confidence went out of the woman describe it to us demanded keflinbrown it was twoforty were very conscious of precise time thats how trades are recorded there are clocks on the wall directly beneath gerrys office showing the time variations in every major financial centre of the world began rebecca her presentation perfect i bet shes rehearsed in front of a mirror look at her performing for the newspapers it was exactly what the woman was doing jennifer saw rebecca was turned slightly away from the judge more interested in addressing the scribbling gallery i wasnt aware of mrs lomax coming out of the elevator on the mezzanine floor above but i was conscious of other traders looking up so i did and i saw her through the allglass design of the office yes you were able to see everything in perfect and clear detail yes as she walked mrs lomax was tapping her fingers against the corridor wall thats what attracted the people who saw her first which hand was she tapping with her right it had to be because of the approach from the elevator where was her left it appeared to be inside a large shoulder bag did she look down at you not then she was staring straight ahead my little robot go on i saw her walk into geralds office he got up to meet her rebecca stopped putting her hand to her face shoulders heaving there were no tears worth a fucking oscar are you all right enquired the barrister rebecca nodded without replying after several moments she went on quietvoiced it was awful terrible she suddenly had a knife in her hand this knife interrupted keflinbrown gesturing the court usher who rose and offered the plasticenveloped exhibit to the woman there was still blood on the blade rebecca physically recoiled that looks like it what then i didnt see where it came from it was just there in her hand rebeccas lip quivered she began slashing and cutting him with it stabbing wouldnt stop she broke off again both hands up against her mouth the left hand on the outside with the ring visible she just wouldnt stop he tried to fight her but shed stabbed him a lot there was another gulped break blood everywhere spurting hitting the window say wonderful shouted jane jennifer was totally engrossed in the horror handhold even relaxed wonderf came out before she could prevent it sufficient for everyone to decipher the bitten off word perry swivelled making wavingdown gestures jarvis said mr hall one more outburst and i will send your client down into the cells and thats my last warning ah dont want that youve got to stay up here where everyone can see you santas little helpers just saved you jennifer what about that perry was at the dock rail i know its difficult but please try to control yourself the stage whisper easily reached the tightly packed journalists jennifer nodded she doesnt want me out of court the accused said something mr hall demanded jarvis perry bustled back cupping his hand to jeremy halls ear the young barrister turned back to the judge and said my client promises not to interrupt again my lord she doesnt have a choice said the small man nodding to keflinbrown go on if you can urged the barrister it was terrible obscene just stabbing and blood blood everywhere then gerald stopped fighting stopped moving what was the next thing to happen she came and stood at the window laughing just stared down at us and laughed and laughed christ i enjoyed that looking down at the stupid fuckers how exactly did she stand ms nicholls with her hands outstretched against the window supporting herself people began running then roger roger jones the floor manager began going upstairs someone had already rung the police what did you do stayed where i was why i didnt think there was anything i could do others were following roger was that the only reason you didnt go upstairs ms nicholls i was frightened im sure everyone was frightened was there any particular reason for your being more frightened than anyone else doesnt your heart go out to her perhaps said rebecca hushedvoiced again last time i saw a performance like this it really did win an oscar you were gerald lomaxs lover werent you said keflinbrown the tone almost as if he were confronting a hostile witness yes for how long four years not four and a half years perhaps how long had you been aware that mrs lomax had learned of your relationship with her husband objection my lord protested hall this court has had no evidence of mrs lomax knowing of an affair between her husband and ms nicholls lets get things in their proper sequence shall we mr keflinbrown sighed jarvis i beg the courts indulgence said the barrister a regrettable oversight allow me to rephrase the question too late for it not to have been heard and taken on board by every member of the jury did you have any reason to believe mrs lomax knew of your affair with her husband not positively not positively echoed the lawyer what then how then wed talked about it gerald and i talked about what his telling her he wanted a divorce no thought jennifer anguished please no wasnt true couldnt be true he wouldnt have abandoned her abandoned emily already decided that decided it was impossible just sex nothing else sex just like it was with me going to dump you just like the two of you dumped me what a shit think youd have lived jennifer just think i could have saved your life by killing him he had to die though everythings working out exactly as i planned in the well of the court hall was studying rebecca nicholls sworn statement to superintendent bentley did he asked keflinbrown i dont know youre wearing a very beautiful ring diamonds are they not around a central stone jennifer closed her eyes trying to shut out the sight of rebecca and the ring and the court shut out everything to curl up into the smallest ball that noone could see and die why fight any more no point give up plead however jeremy hall wanted her to plead and be sent somewhere as a sex toy to be played with emily she remembered had to survive to fight so there was someone to look after emily jennifer waited for the taunt but jane put no thoughts in her head youre doing fine torturing yourself who bought that ring for you ms nicholls gerry does it have a particular significance he bought it for me when we talked of getting married an engagement ring in fact yes what did you think when you saw what jennifer lomax did to her husband that dreadful day in the office of eurocorps that he had told her and were you too frightened to go up to where your lover your future husband lay dying because you were afraid shed try to kill you too yes rebecca looked away from the press gallery to stare directly and accusingly at jennifer there is a child a daughter from mr lomaxs marriage to the accused isnt there emily confirmed the woman a fury a hatred boiled up within jennifer she began physically to shake without encouragement from jane thats how i felt jennifer worse than you even thats why i killed gerald and why im doing what i am to you balancing the score an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth only fair after what you did steady hissed ann close beside her calm down you are in fact emilys godmother are you not yes a child you love like your own yes jennifers shaking worsened and she felt anns hand on her arm restraining her was there any discussion between you and mr lomax about emily he said whatever happened he couldnt give her up that emily was his life and that hed make jennifer agree to his having emily with us jennifer felt an emptiness a void he couldnt have been this cruel he would have had to hate her to be this cruel to have used her like the matron and emma and fran and harriet used her thats it jennifer thats what it was all the time still think youre the luckiest woman in the world what was mr lomaxs intention as far as you were aware rebecca remained staring straight at the dock the look of contempt on her face again as far as i was aware gerald intended divorcing jennifer and getting custody of emily and then we would marry left with nothing tossed out with the garbage and for the three of you to become a family yes rebeccas voice was soft again trembling with the uncertainty of a happiness shed now never achieve gerald would have told mrs lomax what he intended with the child as well as wanting a divorce wouldnt he objection protested hall there is no way the witness can speculate about a conversation if any between mr and mrs lomax mr keflinbrown rebuked the judge mildly i beg the courts indulgence and of course withdraw the question apologized the older barrister too late motive all sorted and made perfectly clear youre for the drop jennifer would have been if they still hanged murderers and i have no further questions the man concluded surrendering rebecca nicholls to crossexamination like a wellchewed bone upon which there was no meat left you havent the slightest idea any way of knowing if gerald lomax confessed his adultery to his wife have you attacked jeremy hall at once wed talked about his doing so but you dont know that he had done it no hall lifted rebeccas statement from the mound of papers in front of him hefting it as if testing its weight to attract the jurys interest what youve told the court today is at considerable variance with what you told superintendent bentley isnt it i dont remember you dont remember i had just seen the man i loved slaughtered in front of my eyes seen his blood burst everywhere no you hadnt your full statement was made to superintendent bentley several days after that i still dont remember there was a tug at jennifers elbow with the hand offering the handkerchief hurriedly she dried herself jane said im not going to have you taken out of court but everyones still got to think youre a drooling idiot then let me help you ms nicholls offered hall beckoning the usher ive marked a section at the top of the third page the page of a statement youve signed and agreed as an accurate account of your conversation with superintendent bentley doesnt that marked section say and i quote but jennifer never knew yes thats very different from what youre asking the jury to believe today isnt it ms nicholls i was still in shock ive had time to think about it since i quote again from a paragraph marked just a little lower from that to which ive referred doesnt that say she didnt kill gerry because of me yes but i told the police hed promised me he would get a divorce but didnt you also say in the third marked passage that gerald lomax had not told his wife of your affair or asked for a divorce and didnt you go on to say and again my lord i quote he said hed tell me before he did but he didnt say anything so he didnt i may have done ms nicholls its in a statement you signed as an accurate account of your conversation with the superintendent ive told you i was still shocked youd been with gerald lomax the night before he was killed hadnt you like you were every night when he remained in london yes in his flat yes did you make love mr hall interrupted the judge while keflinbrown was still only halfway to his feet is there a point to this line of questioning an extremely important one insisted hall he had no intention of considering it after the inevitable result of the trial because it would not be in jennifer lomaxs interest but he was convinced that by now the transcript would already show sufficient unfair bias for an appeal to be lodged be very careful mr hall i shall be paying particular attention said jarvis you slept with gerald lomax the night before he died resumed hall yes rebecca was tinyvoiced again you had no secrets from each other did you no and hed promised to tell you before he asked jennifer for a divorce yes and he did want to marry you absolutely to clear the way for you and he to marry a divorce would have been the most important thing in gerald lomaxs life at that moment wouldnt it hed promised to tell you you had no secrets from each other yet the night before he was murdered by a woman it is being suggested was driven to kill by insane jealousy in the intimate surroundings of the bedroom he said nothing to you whatsoever about having confessed his adultery to his wife no there was very little defiance any more and practically no voice so he hadnt told jennifer lomax what would have caused her to commit this terrible crime had he this whole my lord broke in keflinbrown how can this witness testify to what might or might not have taken place when she was not in hampshire the previous weekend that was an inept question mr hall criticized the judge questioning an inference that the jury have been asked to draw from uncorroborated testimony in ms nicholls evidenceinchief fought back hall refusing to be bullied but let me try to find my answer from a different direction to your knowledge had gerald lomax ever deceived you wonder who else he was screwing there would have had to be someone wouldnt there no doesnt know him like we do does she held anything back from you no broken a promise to you no he had promised to alert you in advance of his confessing everything to mrs lomax and demanding the divorce that would give him custody of emily yes but had not at any time prior to the murder told you that he had done so no that is a very beautiful ring when did you buy it i told you when we talked about getting married that wasnt the question what was the date when you bought it i dont remember ms nicholls youve told the court its your engagement ring the token of your intended marriage buying it was surely one of the most significant moments of your life we are meandering towards a point arent we mr hall demanded the judge bastard thought hall curbing the frustrated anger the moment it came hopefully my lord an ambition shared by us both then perhaps i can continue my lord hall allowed himself careless of the immediate tightening of jarviss face wasnt it a moment to remember ms nicholls yes so when was it five or six months ago still not sure said hall was it a surprise given to you over a candlelit dinner or did you buy it together we bought it together and youve worn it ever since for five or six months yes so people you work with would have noticed it it is after all a very distinctive piece of jewellery they would probably be able to give an even more reliable timing than five or six months i can see where hes getting to cant you clever bastard isnt he pity theres nothing he can do to help you maybe youll have to ask them i intend to ms nicholls every one of them whos called to give evidence after you you sure you cant give a more specific date no what shop did you buy it in the woman began nipping her bottom lip between her teeth garrards who will of course have a record of the sale so we can establish a positive date by simply approaching them cant we thats you fucked rebecca he really is a clever bastard i suppose so would it embarrass you if i did indeed obtain a sales receipt no there was no longer any defiance rebecca nicholls was blinking a lot constantly nibbling her lower lip several times looking nervously towards the judge who had stopped intervening wouldnt such a receipt show that your ring is a much more recent acquisition i said i cant be sure when i bought it you bought it pounced hall remembering before you answer that you are on oath ms nicholls isnt a far more accurate story of the ring that you did indeed buy it yourself not together with gerald lomax that its purpose and purchase was to strengthen the motive of jealousy for the crime of which my client stands accused no speak up ms nicholls demanded jarvis no repeated rebecca only slightly louder could i place on record my lord the possibility of my seeking to recall this witness after further enquiries are made he gave me the money shouted rebecca her voice snatched by a sob then the words rushed out gerald gave me the money and said it was for an engagement ring and when he died i bought it as hed intended me to so i could keep it always in his memory i dont think i need bother garrards said hall sitting down he did however ask each trader subsequently called if they remembered the ring being worn by rebecca nicholls none did there was little else he chose to examine them upon their accounts of gerald lomax being murdered were identical as were janes interventions which lessened anyway after a further warning from jarvis to have jennifer removed from the dock the only variation was the evidence of roger jones the tradingfloor manager who followed rebecca into the witnessbox he testified that when he reached the office jennifer was cradling gerald lomax in her arms and said geralds dead someone stabbed him geralds dead someone stabbed him echoed hall not i stabbed him because he was deceiving me with rebecca nicholls or some such words no was jennifer lomax in any way threatening no you never feared she might attack you at first when i got there but not when i saw what she was like what was she like bewildered as if she didnt understand what had happened because their accounts of the killing were virtually the same and jeremy halls crossexamination so minimal the evidence from the trading floor was completed by midafternoon it was the prosecution who called the hospital doctor peter lloyd whom hall had originally seen as a defence witness keflinjones did so to establish that when jennifer lomax was admitted she was not suffering from shock but appeared composed and aware of her surroundings lloyd had volunteered a lengthier statement than even the prosecution needed urged to do so by a hospital management anxious against any criticism to set out in minute medical detail every aspect of the treatment jennifer had received the awareness the abrupt recognition of the nagging doubt that hed felt but been unable to resolve exploded in jeremy halls mind halfway through lloyds evidence which hall was following from the copy of the doctors statement that had been made available under the rule of disclosure the significance was such that briefly the words fogged in front of halls eyes he heard lloyd say the words exactly as they were written down but then closed his senses to the rest of the mans evidence sorting through the papers in front of him so hurriedly that keflinbrown paused distracted looking accusingly sideways perry leaned forward nudging the younger man but hall was oblivious to anything but the evidence they had already heard and the notes that he had made his concentration was such that he was not conscious of keflinbrown sitting giving him the opportunity to crossexamine until jarvis said are you with us mr hall very much so my lord assured hall he rose slowly checking the time as he did so calculating he had fifteen minutes to fill before the adjournment of that days hearing you carried out every conceivable test and examination considered necessary upon mrs lomax consistent with her medical condition when she was admitted yes some of which were repeated according to clinical practice yes still ten minutes to go physical conditions illnesses not immediately evident can be ascertained from certain pathological examinations yes faeces and urine for example yes i think this has already been well established mr hall with the greatest of respect my lord i think there is something of vital importance to this case that has not been established and needs to be what the fucks he on about hall welcomed the time the judge remained looking at him before nodding curtly five minutes he saw spinal fluid yes temperature yes three minutes pulse yes blood yes how many times doctor were blood samples taken from mrs lomax lloyd went back to his medical reports in total five times do you have many more questions for this witness mr hall interrupted the judge possibly a very great many said hall satisfaction and anticipation surging through him then i think we will adjourn until tomorrow hall wheeled to humphrey perry before jarvis was out of the court have jennifer kept in the cells below i want an independent medical examiner our own forensic expert and well need the prosecutions technical people whove already given evidence here again tomorrow see theyre called dont let bentley or rodgers leave the court today and well need jarviss clerk hall turned sideways to keflinbrown id like you to be present too he stopped trying to think of anything hed overlooked urgently he said dont tell jennifer lomax what were doing in advance of doing it i dont want any warning given keflinbrown was gazing at the other barrister in openmouthed astonishment what the hell are you on about im not sure admitted hall suddenly he was chilled by fear physically shivering chapter twentythree sir ivan jarvis was incandescent with rage the fury worsened by it being obvious to everyone in chambers but to himself most of all that he had no alternative he was nevertheless still seeking one jeremy hall had endured the threats and gone through the musichall accusations quite unworried hed already decided there were grounds for appeal upon the judges courtrecorded animosity what had happened during the past twelve hours with only god knowing what was likely to emerge in the coming twentyfour guaranteed not just the legal overturning of everything if jarvis didnt comply but ensured an ignominious end to the old mans lifelong career jarvis knew that too i made clear my attitude to tricks mr hall and ive made clear my lord that these matters only came to my notice at the conclusion of yesterdays hearing this application is not based on trickery it is based upon fact it was hard in his excitement not to appear overconfident not too soon or too quickly to seek some personal satisfaction from how hed been demeaned in open court the facts were in a statement for all to see and challenge one was my lord corrected hall not needing to take the reminder further jarvis had prior access to peter lloyds statement as well as both prosecution and defence my lord intruded keflinbrown my learned friend very properly provided me with every facility and access after last nights conclusion from what has come to light overnight i must support his application most strongly in every way there was his practised mannered paused in fact subject to your lordships direction i intend suspending the prosecution until it has been resolved jarviss mouth became an even tighter line there could be an explanation for one of your disparities regrettable though such a mistake might be but not for the other argued hall easily since last night i am in a position to prove from the prosecutions own witnesses given your permission to recall as well as from my own that the second matter is incontrovertibly conclusive we heard yesterday from eight witnesses who saw your client murder her husband persisted the judge we also heard from those eight witnesses how she stood hands outstretched against the window after appearing to have carried out that murder each account of which further supports my request this morning there had been a chance for him to sleep after about am but the adrenalin had been everest high and he hadnt even bothered to try instead having found the key he had forced himself yet again through jennifer lomaxs entire file sometimes consciously mouthing the words he read in his determination against missing anything else by being dulled by his familiarity with what he already knew now he was absolutely sure there were no more oversights to keflinbrown the resistant judge said you have no objection to the introduction of a new defence witness none my lord said the older barrister at once what time is he due to land jarvis asked just after midday responded hall prepared for every query arrangements have been made to convey him immediately to court with hearsay evidence challenged jarvis hopefully another door he was going to enjoy slamming in the old bastards face it had been humphrey perrys suggestion to extend the enquiry which had produced the most dramatic as well as perhaps the most inexplicable and frightening evidence to support his application that morning it was hall knew what was unsettling everyone something none of them understood and didnt want to think about the court benefits from the time difference between this country and the united states of america it was only am in washington dc when your lordship rose last night the defence had already engaged an american lawyer prior to the developments before your lordship today he was able to locate the doctor who took the original samples and have him swear an affidavit before an american judge in chambers that his findings were a true and accurate record i would ask you to accept my lord that it is therefore legally admissable and not hearsay evidence closing the lid on the box hall finished if that is not your view then i will make arrangements to fly the doctor here personally to appear before you jarvis shook his head in defeated rejection he looked intently and individually at the two barristers then at perry and robert morley behind have any of you thought of the implications of this he demanded voicing the unspoken bewilderment of them all keflinbrown and hall exchanged looks each inviting the other to respond taking the responsibility as the applicant hall said i cannot explain what i believe i can prove your application is granted in full jarvis surrendered there was a pause im minded to add god help us noone considered the remark an exaggeration or out of place perry was actually thinking the same thing himself it had been one of the most horrific times of the total horror not as bad as having her mind taken over or the murder itself or the lesbian rape but close behind jane had erupted against jeremy halls refusal to explain what was happening screaming so loudly and so long jennifer had screamed herself at the physical pain it caused twice despite jennifers efforts to prevent it shed been thrown violently to the ground and had once been unable to stop herself suddenly striking out catching the barrister a glancing blow on the side of the face the fury had reached apoplexy at halls reaction to it all hed greeted every outrage as if he wanted it to occur making no effort to avoid the slap unnecessarily pointing the worst of her behaviour out to the people before whom she was paraded very often like an exhibit she recognized some like the two detectives and the prosecuting barrister and court officials but not others theyd ignored her too when jane had made her demand to know their names and what they were doing snipping a sample of hair and fingerprinting her and taking yet another blood test jane had made her jerk her arm when the needle went in breaking it off so she had another sore wound in her arm it had taken all her own effort as well as hall physically holding her arm for the sample and the fingerprints to be taken all that had been done by someone she didnt know in her cell although the prison doctor had attended as a witness hall and perry and some other strangers were there too and so much official activity had obviously frightened the matron jennifer had used it further to scare the woman after everyone had gone lying about an authority inquiry there hadnt been any cream residue when shed awoken that morning and jennifer hadnt detected anything during the night which she believed she might have done jane had maintained an unrelenting barrage of noise penetrating even the sedative so jennifer had always had a vague awareness of her surroundings it had been a pill not an injection further evidence the matron didnt intend drugging her beyond any awareness of what was happening to her and jane had succeeded in making her vomit the first one up before managing to swallow the second the tirade had continued that morning jennifers hand had been jerked and pulled when shed tried to makeup and dress her hair so the effort was very much worse than at the beginning of the previous two days although better than at their end after jane had made her drool shed chosen a dress today dark blue again to minimize the inevitable staining and intended trying hard to remember to have more clothes brought up from hampshire both suits were too crumpled and sweatandsaliva stained for a second wearing she doubted if cleaning would help the threats had approached hysteria on the way to court there was find out whats going on if you dont im going to make you do things you cant even begin to imagine and then forget the attack on emily gerald even youll go out with the biggest bang ever followed by you find out or by tonight youre in the funny farm for life and then that most familiar of all dont fool yourself jennifer you know you cant fight me resist me sufficiently before a return to the beginning i want to know whats going on so did jennifer desperately from the fact that keflinbrown and his junior were involved as well as the stonefaced bentley and rodgers and a lot of obvious specialists and experts it had to be important vital yet shed been in court all the time heard everything that was said and there hadnt been anything nothing that is that had meant anything to her so what was it find out i keep telling you to find out jennifer didnt have to talk thinking was enough really knocked you off your perch hasnt it jane really beating you this time said it would happen didnt i not as clever as you thought you were panicking dont know what to do now youre lost not me will lose hows that feel lost and going to lose a lot more finished jane not just dead once dead twice dream on bitch enjoy as long as you can which wont be long that docks really going to be your bear pit today youre going to dance to every tune i want to play and im going to play the lot should have kissed stickyfingered matron and your dyke friends goodbye you wont be going back to them got a special place for you in the looney tune chorus heres a joke just for you a celebrity goes into an asylum part of a compassion therapy experiment and says to the first man he sees hello do you know who i am and the man says no but ask matron shell tell you not good enough jane not even very funny panic not in control any more lost well see we will tough shit jane youre fucked there was almost a phosphorous whiteness from the intensity of the windowreflected camera flashes at their arrival jennifer descended confidently from the van but the moment she reached the ground all support left her legs only the quick reflexes of ann wardle kept her from collapsing on to the ground as it was she went down heavily to her left where the second wardress failed to catch her and hit her knee with sickening hardness against a kerb edge her tights tore and her knee began to bleed all strength and sensation gone from the leg jennifer was virtually carried into the building arms around the necks of both wardresses who in turn linked their arms around jennifers back to complete the bridge the duty doctor was crouched in front of her cleaning and dressing the darkly bruised cut when jeremy hall entered the cell ask him demand to know instead jennifer said she made me fall shes screaming to know whats happened im sure she is what she says shes going to make me do worse things than attack emily that ill be in a mental hospital by tonight he was somehow different not frightened of her he was one of the few who had never been frightened of her but somehow holding back he wasnt even leaning over the table towards her like hed usually done since the trial had begun the hesitation was obvious too before he said i want her to do everything possible she can jennifer looked at the barrister aghast what the more ridiculous she makes you look the more outrageous the actions or the words the better it is for us dont fight against any of it however bad it is do it and say it what shes screaming hurting my head again who or whatever is in your head is my defence witness now insisted hall whatever she does or says is going to prove your total innocence do you hear that jennifer i can prove youre not guilty not just that prove youre not mad either nooooooooo the gossip of an impending although unidentified sensation inevitably came from the court officials and the anticipatory electricity was tangible when jennifer entered the dock the limp immediately became a cause for speculation several journalists standing in the absence of the judge to crane over the dock rail in an effort to see the reason jennifer was tensed nervous of an abrupt attack from jane but nothing came although she still had the tingling burn of janes presence more uncomfortable than usual her knee throbbed and had swollen tightly against the dressing she was ready when the judge entered the court grabbing out for the rail and glad of the wardresses close behind but there was no weakness in her legs despite what hall had said in the cells below it was instinctive for her to grip the underside of the chair ann had the first handkerchief ready in her lap at jennifers look the wardress shook her head reassuringly jarvis cleared his throat staring fixedly at jennifer for several moments before turning to his right in his strangely sonorous voice he said ladies and gentlemen of the jury since the adjournment of this trial yesterday certain matters have most forcibly been brought to my attention he looked briefly down at jeremy hall who was visibly hunched like a runner eager to get off the blocks in the light of what has emerged overnight it is necessary in my view to allow these matters to be fully and properly examined in your presence and for that examination to be conducted at this stage of the trial instead of waiting for the prosecution to conclude its case and for the defence to present theirs which would be the normal course of events the judge paused to clear his throat again and jennifer was startled to see perry turn and smile encouragingly at her she was too surprised to respond to that end resumed jarvis certain witnesses who have already given evidence will today be recalled for their evidence to be explored more fully than it was when they first appeared i will do my best to ensure that this is done in a comprehensible manner to prevent this extremely unusual course causing you any confusion briefly jarviss attention switched to hall as if in warning if however something emerges that any of you do not understand i require you at once to advise me through the court officials at which time it will be clarified is that quite clear to all of you there were uncertain nods throughout the jury the press beehive hummed we will pick up however with the witness who was giving evidence at the conclusion of yesterdays hearing announced jarvis doctor peter lloyd the hospital doctor reentered the box agreeing with a nod that he understood he was still bound by the oath hed taken the previous day hall was already standing waiting doctor lloyd said hall your answer to my final question yesterday was that during the time she spent under your care a total of five separate blood tests were taken from the accused that is correct taken by you three were did you take the first upon her admission yes that first test upon her admission would have been for a particular and specific purpose would it not yes what mrs lomax had quite severe injuries to her arms and hand shed lost blood it was necessary to give her a transfusion before which you had to establish what her blood group why was it you who took that first sample i was the duty emergency doctor that day how long did it take pathology to identify jennifer lomaxs blood group lloyd shrugged maybe thirty minutes as ive said it was considered an emergency theres a fasttrack system by the time the wounds had been cleaned and mrs lomax prepared for surgery we had the results which were that mrs lomaxs blood group is b rhesus positive which was the blood you transfused lloyd appeared surprised by the question of course what effect would there have been upon mrs lomax if blood other than b rhesus positive had been transfused the doctor appeared even more confused an extremely severe reaction anything else would have been incompatible she would have gone into shock could even have died from renal failure but mrs lomax did not go into shock or suffer any adverse effects from your transfusion lloyd shook his head bewildered no during the pathological examination of blood samples subsequently taken from mrs lomax would the group always be identified yes the check system requires it do the medical records in front of you show the blood group of those four other separate tests yes what are they the only group they could be of course b rhesus positive thank you doctor i am extremely obliged said hall sitting as he did so he turned invitingly to keflinbrown who shook his head against any reexamination after the constant groundswell of noise with which jennifer had been surrounded on the previous two days the court was now breathlessly silent as everyone tried to understand what was unfolding the burn of janes presence was definitely hotter and jennifer felt herself sweating again she reached out herself for the everready handkerchief using it to dab her upper lip and forehead there was an unintended jerk a twitch of frustration but jennifer easily kept her hand steady i call professor hewitt announced hall he was enjoying himself savouring the reversal refusing to be distracted by the underlying uncertainty jarvis was according him every consideration no longer interrupting and there had been nothing from jennifer in the dock at the thought he turned to look at her smiling slightly this time jennifer did smile back although doubtfully the home office pathologist was a thin bespectacled man with mousy receding hair he entered the witnessbox briskly a busy man irritated at being bothered a second time discerning the mans mood hall said there is only what you may regard as a small matter upon which i am going to ask you to assist the court professor but i must ask you to accept my word it is of vital importance gerald lomax had been the victim of a violent and sustained attack had he not yes during which he had received wounds and injuries described by you during your earlier testimony as massive yes as well as examining those massive wounds about which youve already told us and ascertaining that gerald lomax was not suffering any medical condition that might have contributed to his death did you also take a sample of gerald lomaxs blood yes did you have it pathologically analysed i did not do it personally it was forensically analysed by doctor billington quite so he would have advised you of his findings though to complete your report yes can you tell the court the grouping hewitt flicked through the manila folder he had carried into the box ab rhesus positive it is a customary forensic practice in such cases of violent attack and death for a pathologist to take samples of detritus that may be found beneath a victims fingernails is it not yes help the court by telling us why that is done it is invariably instinctive for people to try to fight off their attackers do something in selfdefence it is very common to find skin or blood particles or hair beneath a victims fingernails did you carry out such tests upon gerald lomax yes and recover the evidence you sought yes some skin particles and blood there was no hair an idea of what more he could do burst upon jeremy hall so startling that for several moments he remained unspeaking lost even to his surroundings it would be absolutely conclusive and sensational far more sensationally conclusive than he was already sure he could prove jennifers innocence but he needed time and consultation to decide whether to go that far he was brought back to the present by a cough from the judge jarvis said mr hall there was none of the irritability of before i beg the courts pardon my lord apologized hall what did you do with these samples professor passed them on for forensic analysis do you know the results of those analyses the blood was o rhesus negative i do not know about skin comparison there was a sound in jennifers head like a sharp intake of breath at the same time as a stir of growing although still doubtful realization from the press outwardly audibly throughout the court the disturbance was very brief quickly shrouded in total silence fuck that was quiet too not even addressed to jennifer in your expert opinion professor would those samples from beneath the fingernails of gerald lomax have come from his attacker in his desperate attempt to fight that attacker off unquestionably i want to challenge you upon that professor unquestionably beyond any reasonable doubt in your mind unquestionably beyond any reasonable doubt again keflinbrown did not reexamine anthony billington came into the witnessbox wearing the same taut secondskin suit his freckledotted face creased with curiosity at his recall because of its importance jeremy hall began by taking the forensic expert through his qualifications and years of experience in his highly technical science you head the home office forensic pathological investigation team yes billingtons face coloured slightly at the acknowledgement i would like to explore more fully than i did earlier upon what you found when you entered gerald lomaxs office on the day of the murder his body and mrs lomax were still in situ yes you told us you took blood samples yes how both were in the case of the man had been bleeding profusely i took slide provision explain to us what slide provision means i quite simply took samples of blood from both people later to transfer on to slides for scientific examination externally from their weeping wounds not by intravenous extraction it was not necessary to draw blood off by needle wouldnt that open the possibility of error picking up for example blood that might have splashed from another wounded person and not been that of the person to which you later ascribed it the circumstances of this case of my sceneofcrime examination were extremely unusual the victim and his attacker were still there noone else had been involved i lifted blood samples not from just one but from several open wounds of both people by taking more than one sample and from separate sites i ensured no splash error could contaminate my analysis the silence hall intruded now was intentional and very mannered he was he accepted performing like keflinbrown when it had stretched almost to break point hall echoed the circumstances of this case were extremely unusual noone else was involved are you sure about that doctor of course im sure about it said billington irritated by the doubt i was there took the samples and i am extremely glad that you did placated hall how many blood groups did you identify from the scene of the crime two what were they ab rhesus positive and o rhesus negative the press gallery was in a tightly controlled frenzy and the burn on jennifers skin was so bad now she had surreptitiously to scratch her arms and her legs ann wardle was at once alert beside her jennifer whispered its all right identify each to the persons from whom you obtained those samples dr billington gerald lomax was ab rhesus positive mrs lomax was o rhesus negative in his satisfied excitement it was frustrating for hall to hold back his presentation in the necessary stepbystep order you took blood samples other than from the wounds of gerald and jennifer lomax did you not yes what about from the window overlooking the trading floor several samples there were some fingerprints in blood on that window were there not yes did you take a sample from those bloodied fingerprints where the blood might have run down the window yes i did but not in any way to affect the definition of the fingerprints of course not said the scientist affronted can you tell the court the group of the blood you took running down from the fingerprints o rhesus negative you are absolutely sure of that there is no possible doubt o rhesus negative is an unusual blood group is it not yes one you would be unlikely to confuse or make a mistake over i do not make mistakes in my analyses jennifer couldnt properly recognize the noise in her head it was a groaned near wailing sound despair almost jennifer didnt want to challenge at that moment was still nervous of challenging but she thought jane has lost not me that beat her jeremy hall but shes lost and then she waited for a diatribe but nothing came there was still a tingle but her skin was much cooler no longer physically irritating or sensitive to the touch im greatly obliged to you for establishing that in the court you just didnt lift blood from the window you lifted the fingerprints picked out in that blood didnt you doctor yes whose fingerprints mrs lomaxs what proof did you have that they were mrs lomaxs they couldnt have been anyone elses why not thats where shed stood with her hands splayed against the window youd seen her stand like that dont be ridiculous how do you know thats how shed stood less belligerently billington said i was told by the police by whom of the police exactly detective inspector rodgers he was there with superintendent bentley when i arrived and they pointed out to you mrs lomaxs fingerprints on the window she was slumped directly beneath them that wasnt my question doctor said hall letting nothing slip past did superintendent bentley and inspector rodgers identify fingerprints in blood upon the window as those of mrs lomax yes did they later provide officially taken fingerprints of mrs lomax for you to make a scientific match billington hesitated looking for guidance to keflinbrown who remained unhelpfully with his head sunk against his chest finally billington said no so there was no proper scientific forensic comparison between the bloodstained fingerprints upon gerald lomaxs office window and fingerprints taken from mrs jennifer lomax billington was no longer deathly pale his face blazed in odd contrast to his red hair he looked hopefully again to the prosecuting barrister who steadfastly refused to answer the plea no that means doesnt it doctor that your evidence of the bloody fingerprints being those of mrs lomax has no forensic or scientific basis or value the police told you whose they were and you accepted it entirely upon their word billington didnt reply doctor billington demanded jarvis all his waspishness transferred yes it does finally admitted the forensic scientist there were two types of blood upon the knife at halls gesture the usher offered it to the perspiring witness what were they ab rhesus positive and o rhesus negative and fingerprints persisted hall relentlessly the same as those upon the window as the home offices first choice its leader in forensic examination would you consider yourself an expert in fingerprint comparison it is not my particular discipline but i am practised in it qualified the scientist you have a chart of those bloody fingerprints among the documents in front of you do you not yes i fully accept that these are not what you would consider proper scientific conditions but would you compare these prints against the chart you claim to be mrs lomaxs fingerprints asked hall gesturing again to the attentive usher to take the offered sheet to the scientist billington spent several minutes studying the two sheets side by side at one stage taking a pocket magnifying glass from his strained suit at last he looked up and pronounced they do not match you mean they are the fingerprints of two different people persisted hall yes do you need to take them away to a laboratory for more detailed examination i will of course do so if the court orders it but i do not think it is necessary he waved with his pocket device like a flag of surrender even under this magnification the difference is obvious one set is peaked the other whorled and the linear difference between the two is obvious almost to the naked eye you also found and eliminated another set of fingerprints in gerald lomaxs office those of the cleaner yes would you compare what i have just handed you with those prints you lifted it did not take the man as long this time again they are quite different you found some hair strands in gerald lomaxs office did you not yes agreed billington cautiously whose were they billingtons sigh filled the hesitation i was told they were mrs lomaxs shes blond so was the hair by whom were you told superintendent bentley did you make comparison tests from proven samples of mrs lomaxs hair the earlier halfformed idea was hardening in halls mind hed been demeaned humiliated and shat upon by a pompous legal establishment and he wanted every ounce of revenge and humbled recognition that he was owed none was made available to me answer the question doctor billington no i did not make any comparison what about a b rhesus positive blood group demanded hall abruptly and intentionally going in yet another direction i dont understand that question did you from anywhere in gerald lomaxs office lift blood subsequently identified as b rhesus positive no from the extensive sampling you took do you believe you would have found b rhesus positive if there had been traces in gerald lomaxs office yes from your forensic examination of gerald lomaxs office how many people were in it at the time of his murder two noone else no it isnt possible doctor billington what explanation can you give the court when i tell you that the fingerprints i have just made available to you are those of mrs jennifer lomax taken last night in the presence of a number of witnesses including the police and that mrs lomaxs blood group again taken last night to confirm five different earlier samplings is not o rhesus negative but b rhesus positive or that the hair you early testified before this court to be that of mrs lomax is quite different in colour from that taken last night and which is as we talk being subjected to dna analytical comparison the scientist shook his head that isnt possible its more than possible doctor billington they are unarguable facts witnessed among others last night by my learned friend for the prosecution mr keflinbrown it was several minutes before billington was able to reply then he said i cant explain it its beyond explanation he looked apprehensively across the court at jennifer its too frightening to explain everyone else in the court was looking at jennifer at that moment and there was very little noise there was a great deal however in the cells during the lunchtime adjournment twice the force of jennifers convulsions threw not just herself but both wardresses trying to support her off their feet the harangue in jennifers head was so loud it made her scream with pain she defecated and urinated at the same time but because her dress was up around her waist in a struggle with the wardresses it wasnt stained jennifer was too distraught too possessed to be embarrassed that it happened in front of hall and perry or that the corridor outside was crowded with onlookers everything hall tried to say to her was drowned beneath obscene shouted invective and so he stopped trying it ended as abruptly and dramatically as it began with the arrival of the duty doctor and the librium shed refused earlier dont want that not working things out properly please go pleaded jennifer to the two lawyers wrinkling her nose at her own odour this is disgusting im all right nervous of the reaction it might cause hall nevertheless said its going well remember dont worry about anything happening in the dock jarvis wouldnt like that happening in the dock said perry as they both left the cell hall herding the bystanders away neither man felt like eating it was automatic to make their way to the canteen but having reached it they turned away going back into the court corridors perry said you believe it dont you that theres another person jane in her head dont you said hall avoiding the answer perry ducked a response too have you any idea what this could lead to i mean theres only one direction jarvis can order the jury now and thats before he hears from forest ross hamilton forest ii was the washington lawyer at that moment airborne over the atlantic i worked all that out last night and early this morning said hall and all right if you want me to say it i will i dont understand it and im not sure i want to and im frightened and im not sure what favours were doing jennifer lomax ive had some messages said perry who had come to the cells after hall and was reluctant to continue their present conversation forests plane is on time geoffrey johnsons meeting him personally they should arrive here by the time the court resumes perfect said hall and there was another from bert feltham theres a conference tonight with sir richard about jennifer lomax queried hall or about whatever it is that made it so important for this case to be dumped upon me in the first place humphrey perry didnt reply chapter twentyfour jennifer cleaned herself up but had to discard her already ruined underwear without which she felt naked defenceless revulsed by herself and as she tried to restore her hair and repair her makeup the voice said thats what you are jennifer bareassed defenceless and revolting you smell like a pig and theres really no end to what i can make you do people are believing me now she thought so what youre still a freak but not a murderer the show aint over till the fat lady sings people know its you singing not me still a freak jennifer made a positive effort to stop the mental conversation shed hit her leg opening the wound during the convulsion and when hed redressed it the doctor had said it needed to be stitched but that it couldnt be done there to the wardress jennifer said i hope i didnt hurt you weve had worse said ann speaking for both of them no you havent not yet go away thought jennifer not until ive finished and ive got a lot to do before ive finished its pretty unusual up there whats happening i mean said ann for the first time jennifer was conscious of a change of attitude from the motherly woman who had befriended her and couldnt understand it there was a caution a distancing that hadnt been obvious before freak i didnt do it said jennifer replying to the wardress were proving i didnt do it eerie said the second wardress smiling uncertainly better get used to it ive been doing this for eighteen years said ann ive never seen anything like it it isolated jennifer she was becoming an it not a human being thats what you are honey an it would you do something for me asked the second woman tentatively what asked jennifer the woman offered a sheet from a notebook she took from the top pocket of her uniform sign an autograph my names kathleen the accent was irish hah jennifer flushed and ann said to the other wardress dont be so bloody daft of course said jennifer selfconsciously taking the paper theres a place for you in a carnival along with the bearded lady and the fattest man in the world if you dont mind then smiled ann taking out her own pocket book jennifer signed for the second time both women held the paper towards her at arms length please stay close to me in court in case anything happens they think youre contagious sure said kathleen doubtfully do you know when its going to happen when youre going to be thrown about asked ann i know when shes with me is she with you now yes both women stared at her openmouthed dumbstruck this is going to be the story of their lives the only story of their lives how asked kathleen breathlessly i dont want her to know jennifers face was burning and not from janes presence she did feel a freak what the hell was she doing going along with this inane conversation responding to their inane stupid questions youre the woman with two heads thats the billing roll up roll up see the woman with two heads one inside the other jennifer saw the two wardresses exchange awed looks and i dont want to talk about it any more no of course not accepted ann immediately deferential its time we were moving anyway jeremy hall and humphrey perry were beside the dock when jennifer reentered putting themselves between her and the press who were noisier than ever before four journalists were outside the gallery waiting for her to appear when she did they surged forward to be intercepted by police and a blackgowned court official perry moved to meet them each thrust pieces of paper at the solicitor who accepted them more autographs demanded jennifer what frowned hall whats all that about she demanded nothing for you to worry about is everything all right how do i know jennifer was at once aware of the selfpity yes im ok youre going to be fine am i hall wasnt standing as close to the dock edge as he could have done not if i can prevent it from the bench there were demands for silence from the clerk hall hurried towards his place as jarvis strutted into court glowering towards the media he remained looking in their direction when he sat your editors are already aware of my feelings about press intrusion if your behaviour in this court offends me then i shall conduct the remainder of this trial in camera excluding you all i want what i have said reported verbatim by whichever of you represent news agencies so that all editors are aware of my feelings i want that done now i will not reconvene this court until it is done two men and a woman rose sheepishly from their places and hurried out there were four court artists now all sketching jennifer was conscious of every single person in the court staring at her and that despite their undertaking neither ann nor kathleen had their seats as close to her any longer freak not going to get me convicted of murder thought jennifer never intended to remember jarvis had so subdued the court that the return of the news agency reporters was audible before they came into jennifers vision to regain their seats mr hall invited the judge with the briefest grimaced smile there was no swagger this time when superintendent bentley approached the witnessbox the suit blue was as immaculate as before but there was no buttonhole carnation you headed the investigation into the murder of gerald lomax yes sir sir noted hall there are certain standard procedures in such investigations are there not yes sir is one of those standard procedures taking fingerprints from an accused once that accused has been charged yes sir bentley wasnt addressing the assembled journalists nor smiling in their direction did you or one of your junior officers do that in this case no sir why not mrs lomax declined to make a statement after i charged her tried the detective that refusal was confirmed by her solicitor and by you hall stretched the pause as long as he felt able then superintendent we are not discussing statements here are we we are talking of standard operating procedures in murder investigations yes sir you ignored the standard operating procedures you should have followed in the case of mrs lomax didnt you she was too ill to be fingerprinted on the day of the murder bentley fought desperately after that our enquiries were obstructed obstructed seized hall obstructed by whom my officers and i were denied the opportunity of interviewing or taking a statement from mrs lomax by yourself and by her solicitor hall wasnt perturbed the crossexamination was temporarily going sideways the detective was damning himself with virtually every answer did you at any time approach myself or mr perry my instructing solicitor with a request to fingerprint mrs lomax no sir admitted hall miserably all the bombast gone perry mason shit whos impressed i am you should be thought jennifer guys an amateur dumped on you did you instruct any of your junior officers to make such a request no sir so no official police fingerprints were obtained of a person whom you had charged with murder no sir that was a grave mistake wasnt it superintendent a clear failure to follow standard operating procedures yes sir conceded bentley his face was blazing i didnt hear that protested jarvis glaring down yes sir repeated bentley yes sir to what it was a grave mistake for us not to have taken fingerprints bentley practically choked on the words in your evidenceinchief you were obviously proud of your conviction record twelve was it not yes sir do you consider yourself an expert in murder investigations superintendent bentley did not immediately reply fervently seeking an answer that couldnt be turned against him in the end hoping formality would save him he said i have brought to a successful conclusion twelve murder investigations an enviable record agreed hall so murders are a crime you have wide and long experience of investigating yes sir after the conclusion of yesterdays hearing you were present with myself and others when the fingerprints of the accused fingerprints you had failed to obtain were finally taken bentley squirmed yes he could be forgiven for finally omitting the sir but for nothing else hall decided were you given the opportunity last night to compare mrs lomaxs fingerprints with those lifted from the glass wall of gerald lomaxs office i was and were you in court this morning to hear the evidence of the prosecutions forensic scientist doctor billington i was they dont match do they no you also heard doctor billingtons evidence about blood type and grouping yes mrs lomaxs blood does not match any of that found in gerald lomaxs office does it no sir superintendent said hall allowing the patronizing tone as an expert in murder investigations a man who has successfully brought twelve murderers to rightful justice would you have charged mrs lomax with murder if youd properly carried out the investigation you should have done from which you would have realized the fingerprints upon the bloodstained murder weapon were not those of mrs lomax sixteen people witnessed her do it protested bentley writhing her fingerprints are not on the knife are they persisted hall no her blood isnt at the scene is it no so answer my question would you have charged her with murder i would have referred it to higher authority said the detective superintendent who in your expert opinion and now with the benefit of the forensic evidence you did not earlier have do you believe murdered gerald lomax bentley looked desperately around the court as if seeking inspiration as with billington earlier keflinbrown steadfastly refused any rescue because no rescue was possible answer the question superintendent demanded jarvis a bully with a new target i dont know sir bentley finally capitulated you do not know who killed gerald lomax echoed hall triumphantly no i am grateful finally for your honesty said hall to keflinbrowns headshake against the offer to reexamine as malcolm rodgers was summoned the older barrister leaned sideways and said quietly youre not taking prisoners are you not as readily as everyone else was prepared to do said hall hed made his decision upon that mornings idea perry would probably argue against it so most definitely would the heavy breathing unctuous feltham along with sir richard proudfoot so they wouldnt get the opportunity theyd be presented with a fait accompli inspector malcolm rodgers was an ambitious career policeman whod hitched his wagon to superintendent bentleys unstoppable express but who now detected the vibrations of an impending fatal crash and who had decided the previous night and then again listening in court so far that day that it was time to disconnect the coupling he studiously avoided the staccato and truculent answers that bentley had given repeating again and again that hed gone through every stage of the investigation under the command of a superior officer he regretted that superior officer had not insisted upon mrs lomaxs fingerprints being taken and would obviously have himself ordered it done by a junior officer or done it himself had he not automatically assumed the order for such basic routine had been given while he was otherwise engaged he could offer no explanation or suggestion for the disparity between the fingerprints and the blood certainly from none of the sixteen eyewitnesses was there evidence of anyone other than gerald and jennifer lomax being in the totally visible room at the time of gerald lomaxs death who then in your opinion killed the man demanded hall i do not know sir dutifully replied the responsibilityavoiding detective which brought jeremy hall to ross hamilton forest ii senior partner in the washington dc law firm of forest pilton and camperstone a whitehaired cultivated man with practised courtly manners and a clipped new england accent forest had reached the court fifteen minutes before the afternoon resumption giving hall ample time to read and discuss the documentation the man carried it was in fact that documentation that finally decided hall upon the application he intended making but which now while forest was being formally sworn and thanked by sir ivan jarvis for his atlantic dash an act of unprecedented legal cooperation between our two countries and our two legal systems to forests repeated assurance that it was nothing nothing at all sir jeremy hall had stomachhollowing second thoughts he had sufficient to create reasonable doubt the cornerstone of defence to seek more which he could would turn what the following days newspapers and television would build into a legal and public phenomenon for which there wasnt an adjective extravagant enough to describe and for whom would he be doing it by going further for jennifer whose categoric instructions had been to prove her not guilty of murder or for his impatient ambitious self cynically grabbing the opportunity to polevault ten maybe fifteen mundane ladderclimbing years with one mighty leap to the sir richard proudfoot icecapped echelon yet more questions for which he couldnt find an answer maybe never would after the pleasantries from on high hall went through the ritual at his level tempering the sycophancy by coupling it with the establishment of ross hamilton forests legal qualifications that done hall said at the request of my instructing solicitor mr perry did you some time ago establish in the united states of america the marriage of gerald james lomax to jane mary herbetson in jennifers head there was again the sound of sharply indrawn breath i dont want to hear this you dont have a choice isnt that what youre always telling me thought jennifer shut up tables turned i did sir beamed forest he had the tanned face of a man who conducted a lot of business on a golf course or from a yacht on the potomac jane mary herbetson was gerald lomaxs first wife she was indeed sir the daughter of one of the most respected families in virginia proud history going back over two hundred years according to my enquiries one of the founding fathers of our great and good country said the american lawyer proudly her father was the episcopalian bishop theres a bust in his cathedral commemorating the work and the impact he made within his diocese mrs herbetson was an extremely rich woman and throughout their lives together and after her unfortunate death the bishop was an extremely generous benefactor he personally paid for two schools and a clinic for the disadvantaged in his will he left a substantial bequest in trust to benefit the poor what do you mean by mrs herbetsons unfortunate death the poor lady drowned in a boating accident when jane was just fifteen years old pompous legal prick probably first generation descent from some irish shitkicker as i understand it mr forest there is a certain statutory health requirement in your country certainly in the state of virginia prior to marriage there most certainly is sir bastard bastard bastard of particular importance in view of a condition from which jane mary herbetson suffered from birth the poor child was a diabetic poor child my ass quite so as this court has already heard what is the requirement were talking about blood tests sir to ensure compatibility a protection for offspring and for any hereditary disease such tests were conducted upon gerald lomax and jane mary herbetson despite the judges earlier warning there was a growing murmur of anticipation from the media coral jarvis looked sharply towards it the noise lessened only very slightly they were sir and are retained on file for a statutory period you were able to gain access to those records and have an affidavit from the doctor who compiled them sworn before a judge in washington dc yesterday and which you produce to my lord and to this court today on cue the american took an impressively bound folder from his briefcase and handed it to the waiting usher would you tell the court the blood group registered as that of gerald james lomax ab rhesus positive here we go thought hall the moment of noturningback commitment saving jennifer from one fate without any idea of what other she might be thrust into by what he was going to say and do and would you tell the court the blood group registered as that of jane mary herbetson o rhesus negative the court exploded beyond any control the predominant reaction was predictably from the media in a virtual mass exodus from the room but there was a lot of noise discernible gasps from the jury an aviary of sound descended from above from the public gallery the time it took to restore order gave jeremy hall the opportunity finally to make up his mind his primary duty always was to jennifer and the only course open to sir ivan jarvis was now a positive direction that to proceed upon the newly available evidence would be unsafe in law which fell short of a verdict of not guilty so hall convinced himself he had to press on he turned to smile at the strainedfaced jennifer aware as he did so of several of the returning journalists bunched around humphrey perry who was making rapid dismissive hand gestures there was still some noise when jarvis hurried hall on but it ended abruptly when hall turned back to the american noone wanting to miss a single word of the exchange those findings are written ones the result of pathological examination carried out prior to the marriage hall resumed the actual samples themselves no longer exist no sir storage would be an impossible task mr forest you have travelled an extremely long way for what may seem a very short period of time to give evidence in this court but in thanking you i assure you your help and your evidence has been invaluable once again keflinbrown declined to examine and there was a hiatus of several minutes while jarvis effusively thanked the american lawyer who equally effusive insisted it had been a pleasure mr keflinbrown invited the judge after forest stood down as i made clear to you in chambers this morning my lord i am subject to your direction i am minded mr hall to make a certain recommendation to the jury is there anything further upon which you feel it necessary to address me before i do that there is my lord but with the greatest respect anticipating your lordships possible feelings i wonder if my submission might be made in the absence of the jury whats the sneaky little bastard up to now something else to screw you hes just building up penalty points against you youll be sorry hall was aware of keflinbrowns sharp look and of jarviss face closing against him the judge said i trust you can infer the way my mind is directed and i have allowed you considerable leniency mr hall which i must assure your lordship i have not nor will abuse you are insisting i am humbly requesting members of the jury said jarvis turning towards them you will be taken to a room assigned for your deliberations while i hear a submission from learned counsel you are not being excluded indeed if i so decide i will fully acquaint you upon your return with what mr hall has said the purpose of asking you temporarily to leave is to prevent anything wrongly said during legal exchanges adversely to affect your final deliberations i hope it possible to recall you very shortly as the jury filed away hall felt a tug at his gown and leaned back towards humphrey perry what are you going to do demanded the solicitor it was obvious he was going to rule the prosecution unsafe weve won im going to prove her totally innocent said hall he hesitated guessing from how close and attentive keflinbrown was holding himself that the man could probably hear and identify the real murderer jarvis held up his hand against hall speaking going again to the media you should all of you be aware of the restrictions when a jury is out of court but i will once again remind you not one single word of what is said in their absence can be reported i will have my clerk and other court officers read every newspaper listen to every radio transmission and watch every television broadcast if i recognize one word from what is about to be discussed the provider of that report and his or her editor will be jailed for contempt he turned back to the barristers mr hall it is my submission my lord that upon the evidence i have brought before you today it would be legally unsafe to continue the prosecution for murder against my client which it was unnecessary to send the jury out to make broke in the judge and precisely the guidance i intend to make to the jury im obliged for that advice my lord but it will not constitute a verdict of not guilty for my client of course it will in everything but pronouncement mr hall youre nitpicking with respect my lord there is something more that could be done publicly and totally to exonerate my client of any guilt for the crime upon which she has been arraigned jarviss face was furrowed into a frown that made him appear more wizened than ever what the fuck now what is that mr hall as your lordship has already heard the shank of hair recovered from gerald lomaxs office is a different colour from that of mrs lomax last night with mrs lomaxs agreement samples were taken of her hair both are at this moment being subjected to dna analysis and comparison not just by doctor billington but by a separate forensic expert engaged by the defence i am hopeful of a result within the next twentyfour hours some of the o rhesus negative blood is also being subjected to dna matching your submission mr hall your submission the grave of mrs jane lomax is in mortlake cemetery i am applying to you my lord for an exhumation order for that grave to be opened for dna tests upon the hair and bone that the coffin will still contain and for the findings of those tests to be compared with the dna found in the blood and hair currently being examined by defence and prosecution forensic specialists no jennifer stopped herself echoing the deafening scream but couldnt prevent being hurled bodily across the dock so violently that she crashed into its side her breath was knocked completely from her and the duty doctor who examined her in the dock guessed at two cracked ribs when the doctor insisted upon xrays which later confirmed three hall immediately applied for bail with a condition of residency in hospital within an hour she was back in the same private ward at st thomass to which shed been admitted after the murder completing the coincidence she was put under the care of dr peter lloyd who travelled from the court with her in the ambulance with difficulty wincing against the pain jennifer said im glad its you theres something i need to know she wasnt going back to prison to be used as a sex toy she realized jarvis continued in jennifers absence the fully cooperative keflinbrown hurriedly supported halls application totally aware of the incredible events and inevitable publicity in the wake of which he was being borne along and the judge issued the exhumation order with a further injunction against press intrusion warning that he was extending the precincts of the court for a radius of five hundred yards around the grave of the first mrs lomax when he arrived at st thomass hall realized hed made an error in not anticipating what would be happening there and by failing to ask the judge for an additional precincts order the hospital authorities had already complained and adding to the irony of jennifers return superintendent hopkins was again in charge of the police unit confronting the press siege there was none of the officious belligerence hed shown towards hall for emilys disastrous visit they were doing their best to prevent any media person entering the premises he reported formally and there were uniformed officers in the corridor outside jennifers ward intercepting anyone who approached four journalists and two photographers had already been arrested and charged with behaviour likely to cause a breach of the peace one an italian had been wearing a white coat and insisted he was a doctor is it a fact that shes genuinely possessed by the first wife demanded the policeman incredulous i think so whats going to happen to her i dont know he wished he did thought hall moving through the hospital his responsibility towards jennifer lomax ended with the conclusion of the trial extending beyond that only to any outstanding legal formalities but the end of the trial was hardly going to be the end of her problems but they werent legal he warned himself they were personal medically or perhaps more accurately psychiatrically personal not his consideration then he was challenged twice at the level of jennifers ward once directly outside the elevator and again at the police barrier outside the individual room there it needed dr lloyds intervention to persuade the suspicious policeman he really was jennifers lawyer she smiled wanly up at him as he entered the room here we are again she plucked at the hospitalissue nightdress and the fashion hasnt changed and im still here too how are you asked hall it hurts when i breathe hed moved the chair away from the bed not closer when he sat frightened of you frightened of me cowardy cowardy custard his balls are made of mustard the judge granted the order jennifer was ready gripping the side of the bed the movement vibrated though her and the voice screamed motherfucker id get you too if i could she called you a motherfucker shes got a dirty mouth taunted hall will i have to go back to the prison hospital hall shook his head i got jarvis to agree to bail on condition you resided here well arent you the smarty pants never demanded jennifer intensely whatever the result of the exhumation jarvis is going to direct the jury that its unsafe to convict jennifer closed her eyes thank god for that doesnt matter a damn she says it doesnt matter a damn whys she so hysterical then kiss my ass cocksucker you believed me from the beginning didnt you said jennifer noone else believed me but you yes lied hall he did now he accepted finally confronting the phenomenon he was talking to a woman inside of whose head there was another woman a woman he knew all about a murderer believed it so much he was talking to jane as if she existed was a real person in the same room he shivered visibly whats the matter frowned jennifer scared shitless thats whats the matter someone walked over my grave hall said inadequately leave mine alone jennifer held his eyes for several moments then nodding to the corridor outside she said theres more police than before hall shifted further discomfited the hospital is virtually under media siege the police outside are to keep them away from you theres a lot more downstairs freak i hadnt thought of that neither had i not until now everythings happened very quickly there was another wan smile you did what i asked you proved me not guilty thank you she reached out her hand towards him hall hesitated then took it wheres the fucking violins and pink doves i was testing you confessed jennifer testing me to see if youd take my hand to see if you were frightened of me she says you are hall retained her hand then shes wrong about that too isnt she it wasnt a lie he wasnt scared he was he didnt know what he was but it wasnt fear disbelief perhaps no it couldnt be that hed already decided he did believe it was he supposed how someone would feel confronting a creature from outer space although the analogy offended him because jennifer lomax wasnt an alien creature despite what shed gone through was still going through she was a very beautiful and physically attractive woman he released her hand not that he felt any physical attraction to have allowed that would have been unprofessional he had to behave like a doctor in that respect im not wrong hes scared everyones going to be scared youre going to be a pariah for the rest of your life well get you a drum thats what it means you know a drummer because thats what hindu pariahs do beat a drum as a warning for people to get out of the way when theyre coming ive got to think of emily havent i you havent ever stopped i mean about getting back with her properly ive told you annabelle says shes virtually forgotten what happened here shell remember when i go home you dont know that im frightened thats how it will be youll have to take it a step at a time said hall hating the cliche how long before its all finished with the court depends how long the dna takes just days its been a lifetime and its only just beginning now its over i wont have to go back to prison to get my things hall shook his head again ill have them collected and taken back to hampshire or to the flat here if youd prefer now jennifer shook her head but much more positively thats where he went with rebecca in our bed my bed i dont want to go there again not ever ill sell it in fact she paused ill certainly be here all day tomorrow yes ask geoffrey johnson to come he can make arrangements to put it on the market immediately ill fix it undertook the barrister it all sounded very normal so very ordinary would it ever be possible for jennifer lomax to know normality to be normal again jennifer looked abruptly to the bedside cabinet and what was on top of it and i can use the telephone whenever i like cant i yes agreed hall guessing the point of the question so i could telephone emily if you want to i want toi said jennifer hesitantly there was a pause then she said but i dont know what to say to her there was a further silence before she added and theres something else hall waited for jennifer to finish but she didnt jeremy hall wasnt conscious of being followed from the hospital until he parked along the embankment and was immediately surrounded by people who leapt from three separate cars which screeched to a haphazard halt behind him there were seven reporters three women among them they all began talking and shouting at once drowning each other out and for several moments hall was totally bewildered who are you what the names of the newspapers were the first thing that positively registered he didnt bother to match the identification with the representatives is she all right whats she say whats jane telling her can jane make her do whatever she wants shes a frankenstein isnt she will she always have to be locked up as a danger hall used his bulk to shoulder his way through shaking his head but saying nothing envelopes were thrust at him and instinctively he took them thats not final well negotiate call us first before anyone else well be sympathetic put jennifers side of the story the cordon was much bigger around his chambers when the crowd saw him approaching there was the blinding whiteness of cameras and television lights and hall actually stumbled into people he could not see it was impossible to distinguish anything from the shouted screaming questions more envelopes were thrust towards him which he let fall to the ground it wasnt until after he bulldozed his way through and was admitted through the briefly unbolted door by the uniformed porter that hall realized he was still clutching those that had first been forced upon him everyone was already assembled in proudfoots room the qc and bert feltham were in shirtsleeves mickey mouse figures were propelled up and down felthams braces by the heaviness of his breathing humphrey perry looked mournful proudfoot said what the hell have we opened up here pandoras box suggested hall after the previous night entirely without sleep he was suddenly extremely tired ive never known anything like it its incredible weve called the police to clear them said proudfoot choosing partly to misunderstand hall said theres never been anything like this thats why theyre here its as bad at the hospital i was followed back he looked uncertainly at the envelopes in his hand and thrust them towards perry itll be more offers predicted the solicitor holding up a sheaf of already opened letters the sunday times heads the list at the moment quarter of a million they all say theyre prepared to negotiate and that theyll be sympathetic whatever that means proudfoot indicated the open cocktail cabinet and said to the younger barrister help yourself hall wasnt a drinker but he poured whisky deciding that night he not only needed but deserved it he wondered if there would be any congratulations for representing a client as he had he said i hadnt thought this far ahead anticipated the reaction i dont want it to continue declared proudfoot accusingly im wondering what the bar council attitude will be disappointment among its members that theyre not involved guessed hall cynically and i dont see how i could have avoided it applying for exhumation was unnecessary insisted proudfoot if the dna is the same as that at the scene jennifer lomax will be officially and fully declared not guilty instead of the trial closing because the evidence is unsafe which means gerald lomax was murdered by a ghost said proudfoot contemptuously yes said hall with flat simplicity the court has already accepted evidence that proves that a heavy silence encompassed the room it was broken by the wheezing bert feltham ive gone through the transcript of todays evidence thats exactly what it proves precisely a pandoras box said perry distantly hall helped himself to more whisky uninvited we can only go on a day at a time he said remembering it was the cliche hed used at the hospital because he couldnt think of anything proudfoot smiled in sudden affability thought i might sit in at the resumption wigged gowned and ready for recognition inside and out of the court guessed hall bitterly im sure mr justice jarvis would welcome someone rumoured to be his successor he was tired and fed up and didnt care it might not be a good idea for that and other reasons cautioned feltham reasons that might affect my case demanded hall considering the impertinence justified if it did although he couldnt imagine how he slightly stressed my proudfoot looked sharply at his chief clerk who flushed in unaccustomed and rare embarrassment dragging an inhaler from his pocket proudfoot said its of no consequence i dont think i will attend it is of consequence if it is in any way connected with my client insisted hall curious at the obvious feeling between the two men proudfoot sighed heightening felthams colour with another look the older barrister said we have accepted the brief to represent encocorps in a civil matter some derivatives dealing in copper predominantly on the far east market and persisted hall dissatisfied now proudfoot looked at humphrey perry we understood at the outset there was no question of culpability on the part of encocorps that they were acting in genuine good faith for asian dealers it would seem however that there might be some doubt hall waited gerald lomax was inflating prices on offer to hong kong and singapore finally admitted proudfoot manipulating the buyin prices it created a snowball effect artificially heating both exchanges dealers panicked continuing to buy high to cover their losses will it become public demanded hall the deal he recognized at once his uncle had allowed the jennifer lomax murder to be dumped on to the chambers and personally on to him whose career was still too new to be of any importance to gain a civil brief that would take months to prepare and months to litigate all at a fee of a day in my opinion any british prosecution will have died with gerald lomax himself said proudfoot rebecca nicholls name is on some of the sell orders but she says she was acting on lomaxs instructions theres nothing criminally to link her and with gerald lomaxs death went the hope of all that money thought hall satisfaction warming through him thank you for advising me i would have done so had i considered it had any relevance insisted proudfoot now it was he who coloured i have no doubt whatsoever that you would have done said hall maintaining the sarcasm what shall we do with all these offers perry hurried in to the rescue waving the letters in his hand like a flag were mrs lomaxs agent reminded hall were required to pass on any correspondence he paused i doubt shell be interested moneys the one thing she isnt in need of at the hospital peter lloyd said there was something you needed to know i was lesbian raped in prison they used something an artificial penis if it had been used on someone else someone with aids could i have been infected lloyd swallowed swamped with pity i doubt it but youre not one hundred per cent sure would you like to be hiv tested yes now heres a whole new ball game are there really ghosts of course not said annabelle margaret roberts says there are well there arent margaret roberts says mummy is a ghost how can your mummy be a ghost shes your mummy shes not here though is she she will be soon chapter twentyfive conducting the exhumation in the traditional early hours just before dawn to minimize public awareness and offence was totally pointless there needed to be practically a shouldertoshoulder cordon of police to enforce the judges fivehundredyard radius order around jane lomaxs grave and beyond that barrier night was transformed into day by the permanently switchedon film and television lights it was made even brighter by the constant flicker of flashes for cameras that looked more like field guns from the length of their zoom and magnifying lenses and the noise was almost at battleground level too the screens were totally inadequate diaphanous and far too low and concealed practically nothing it was equally crowded around the burial plot two gravediggers toiled under arc lights swarmed by insects carefully shovelling earth on to canvas protecting the surrounding interments a blackcassocked vicar stood at the gravestone jane lomax much loved and missed wife of gerald always in my heart his lips moving in silent prayer felix hewitt and anthony billington were encased in sterile white plastic sceneofcrime tunics complete with fully enclosing head cowls and overshoes so were the forensic experts whom jeremy hall had engaged a slim and unexpectedly young woman named phylis shipley and beside her a man to whom he had only just been introduced harold carter looked old enough to be the girls father but visibly deferred to her there were two uniformed police superintendents one standing permanently with the exhumation group the other acting as liaison with the outer police cordon hall wasnt sure the liaison officer needed to go back and forth as often as he did but at every approach to the media there was a flashlight explosion which hall supposed provided the reason standing slightly apart from the superintendents was a police photographer at the moment the only such operator in the cemetery with an unused camera hall had been unsure how to dress and settled for cords and heavyweather anorak which was a mistake because it was too hot under the arc lights now he stood with it open as wide as possible he hadnt expected keflinbrown but understood the other barristers presence the moment he saw the size of the press invasion the older man wore a gaitered plusfour shooting suit with highly polished brogues and topped off by a peakless cap humphrey perry was dressed for court keflinbrown said ive got the newspapers in the car found a shop open early astonishing absolutely astonishing youll be beating clients off with sticks from now on im not sure i want to make a reputation this way its happened whether you like it or not youre made old boy famous halls flat had been surrounded when hed finally arrived home the previous night among the inevitable envelopes in his pigeon hole had been three invitations to television chat shows had been the highest bid for his personal story but all the other offers nine in all had insisted they were open to negotiation among a lot of messages on his machine from newspapers and publishers thered been a message from patricia asking him to ring her he hadnt two cars had followed him when hed left an hour earlier to drive to the cemetery he hadnt opened their envelopes yet and wasnt sure if hed bother pointedly hall said mrs lomax broke three ribs oh yes of course said keflinbrown reminded painful things broken ribs to go with all her other problems but youve solved her biggest one have i asked hall seriously looking at the milling scene beyond the police line im not sure we even know the full extent of her problems how many there are even you know the rules old boy do your best in wig and gown but say goodbye at the court door you forgot to mention the fee said hall sarcastically never dear boy never forget the fee and yours should take care of the rent for a year or two there were some muted calls from the grave and almost at once an instinctive move forward the cleric immediately halted it indicating a cleared area of canvas to be left for the coffin one of the diggers lowered himself gently into the grave to thread lifting straps beneath the casket after several grunted minutes he reemerged to call for help the second gravedigger eased himself into the hole and the vicar said be careful do be careful its probably very rotten by now for the first time hall became aware of a smell hed never experienced before an odd combination of sour mustiness which was at the same time sweet at first it was almost pleasant an unusual perfume but very quickly it became overwhelmingly sickening and halls stomach began to churn at the very moment everyone around the grave with the exception of the two men inside and the vicar puiled back hall saw phylib shipley and hewitt put on nose clips ready declared one of the diggers clambering out of the grave two other cemetery workers who had been standing apart came forward hefting the lifting straps the vicar was bowedheaded again praying aloud now the count of one two three clashed irreverently every camera light came on at the emergence of the coffin as it swung on to the waiting canvas the police photographer at last had something to do hall became aware of the sound of one and then another helicopter overhead the graveside police superintendent immediately glanced up then began talking urgently and loudly into his radio hall overheard licence revoked and bugger off to the waiting forensic teams he said is it going to interfere not at the height they are at the moment said hewitt but itll blow everything about if they come much lower added phylis shipley the officer went back to his radio talking and listening he said weve got their registrations from their flight plans theyve been warned warn them also that if theres the slightest interference from their downdraught with what were doing here ill sue them in a civil court said hall and ill also ask mr justice jarvis to include them in his precincts ruling for whoever they represent to be jailed there were several more minutes of muttered exchanges and then a perceptible lessening in the overhead noise as the helicopters gained height the distraction of the helicopters momentarily took all their attention from the contents of the grave there was bewildered astonishment when they looked back it was keflinbrown who spoke the exclamation without any religious connotation jesus christ the coffin was pristine no earth attached to it the pale oak glistened as it must have done on the day of the burial the brass fittings dazzled the reflected light from all around i dont think jesus christ has anything to do with this said hall the two men who had redug the grave had recoiled from its smell hands at their faces urgently keflinbrown said it shouldnt be opened thats what were supposed to understand that we shouldnt open it he stepped back the vicar had launched into a confused jumbled litany hall recognized forgiveness and mercy and a lot of references to evil the permeating sick sweet cloying miasma enveloped everything and everyone wrapping around them like an embalming shroud layer after layer lingering from the open grave but seepingly far more overpoweringly from the still closed coffin someone retched and there was the raucous sound of vomiting everyone groped handkerchiefs from their pockets billington and carter finally but very hurriedly attached their noseclips the judges order says the coffin has to be opened insisted the superintendent voice muffled through his handkerchief but making no effort to perform the duty with which he was officially entrusted unnecessarily he said but i dont think i can do it were certainly not going to said the first grave digger the vicar mumbled on standing well back here demanded hall reaching out for the screwdriver being offered to the unresponsive police officer there seemed a solid although invisible wall of fetid putrid stink against him having gone forward he was at once forced back bile stinging his throat hall inhaled as deeply as he could then held his breath to approach again the wood gleamed at him the brass glittering there was almost a physical sensation of something the smell being wound around him again and again and again it stung his eyes making him squeeze them almost shut so it was hard to connect with the real lid screws beneath their artificial decorative caps hall was alone now isolated and oblivious in his total concentration three times like a boxer pulling back from a punch actually feeling dizzy on the very edge of unconsciousness hall had momentarily to retreat to breathe out and inhale less stinking air the bolts unscrewed with the smooth newness of the rest of the container just before he was driven back gasping for the fourth time hall managed to push against the lid skewing it to provide easylifting handholds from beyond the barrier there were camera flash fireworks and from the helicopters above startling them all two separate piercing spotlights stabbed into the scene i cant lift the lid by myself croaked hall noone around him spoke noone moved help me get the lid off still noone spoke or moved you said hall demanding finger towards the police superintendent you have by law to enforce the judges order the policeman didnt think to hold his breath as hall was doing the retching caught the mans breath became a spasm and finally he began to hyperventilate in one panicked heave they lifted the lid free the superintendent staggered back gasping the overhead fluttering of the helicopters and the rumble beyond the police line totally hid the audible reaction from the graveside group although a lot of their horrified facial reactions were caught on film the police photographer was frozen the noise was a whimpering mix of gasps and groans and even some barely heldback screams all of incredulous terror the agonized vicar fell to his knees hands cupped before his face and audibly said oh dear lord protect us from this evil and from mysteries we do not understand and began reciting the lords prayer head bent refusing after the first instant to look inside unhesitatingly the cemetery workers followed loudly joining the invocation with their hands clasped before them two crumpled to kneel to pray they all averted their eyes from the coffin once more hall inhaled as deeply as he could before biting into his handkerchief and pinching his nose beneath it to lean forward better to focus perry did the same but keflinbrown still held back making choking gagging sounds hall didnt have any anticipation at most hed expected a properly defined skeleton all the bones in their normally accepted and physically proper place none was so in the coffin apart from the fleshless grinning skull adorning that appearing freshly combed and dressed and very full was abundant hair still visibly blond despite the artificial discolouring caused by so much light nothing else was intact instead running the entire length of the coffin still lined in perfectly preserved and plush vivid red velvet fuck you was spelled out straight bones like the tibia and fibula and femur and humerus and radius and ulna and larger fingers forming the upright letters the curved but individually separated ribs fashioned into the us and the c and the o there had been sufficient even for the rejection to be finished off as if forming an exclamation mark with what was clearly a stiffly upright middle finger thats not began keflinbrown from behind but hall impatiently closed him down for gods sake stop telling me what is or what is not possible youre seeing it with your own eyes i wish i hadnt so do we all said hall abruptly he realized that the stink had completely disappeared the meeting was already scheduled but jeremy hall had not originally intended it to be anything more than an apology for their psychiatric analyses no longer being necessary coupled with the assurance of their being paid in full despite their not having been called the seemingly uncontrollable but now understandable media hysteria by the time he returned to the temple that morning there were four book publishing offers one from america opening at and the unavoidable revelation of the coffins contents made him change his mind they could after all work for their fee the temple inn yard is a public daytime thoroughfare and although there was a police guard directly outside the proudfoot chambers there were pockets of loitering media representatives circling in ambush like medieval skirmishers and julian mason the first psychiatrist to arrive entered shaking his head in bemusement i didnt imagine it would be like this despite what ive read and seen on television noone did it is unimaginable flexing his newly developed muscle hall had told not asked bert feltham that he needed the main conference room which hed got without question in addition to which feltham had politely asked not autocratically decreed if he could attend despite keflinbrowns cemetery opinion of his unstoppable future career which he had anyway already assessed for himself hall realistically acknowledged felthams unique position and influence within chambers and went as far as saying hed welcome the mans presence he was at masons arrival already by the window overlooking the thames in headtogether conversation with humphrey perry at that moment johnson was on the telephone hall presumed arranging the collection of jennifers belongings from jail i heard on the radio coming in that there was a sensational discovery at the cemetery although they didnt know what it was lets wait for the others suggested hall the american milton smith whom hall had intended calling as an authority on multiple personality disorder was the next to arrive hall was in the process of introducing him to feltham when steven denning and walter elliott his other two psychiatrists entered together the introductions completed and the already prepared coffee served hall quickly disposed with the original purpose of the gathering asking each to submit their bills to feltham theres no doubt about the outcome of the trial queried denning a heavily tweeded and bearded bear of a man it had been denning whod used the truth drug scopolamine during one of his sessions with jennifer and been totally satisfied with the honesty of her answers not after this morning said hall the four psychiatrists listened without any exaggerated reaction to his account of the exhumation neither feltham nor johnson already briefed by perry showed any surprise have you realized yet that youve made history demanded walter elliott like mason he was a laidback exponent he wore open sandals jeans and a rollnecked sweater the sweater had a heavy darn in the left elbow its being thrust upon me said hall making a general arm movement in the direction of the outside yard but thats not what i want to talk about not directly after what we found in the grave the dna comparison is largely academic im going to make history by having an english court of law rule that jennifer lomax is physically possessed by a ghost and that it was the ghost of jane lomax that murdered her husband jesus intruded denning where the hells that going to take you demanded mason hall shook his head against answer instead he went on that disposes of the charge against jennifer shes not guilty of murder he paused looking around the assembled group but shes still possessed by a homicidal maniac whom she cant always control completed elliott so demanded hall youre the experts how do we get rid of jane he asked the question looking at milton smith so did everyone else woa cautioned smith an angularly featured sparsebodied man its becoming accepted legally recognized in some states in america that a persons mind can consist of two or more sometimes many more separate personalities and that each personality each different person if you like can at any one time control the body its in be the person theres medically and clinically recorded and analysed cases but were not talking multiple personality here theres an alien presence inside jennifer lomax shes been invaded he returned the attention being concentrated upon him by the other three psychiatrists ok you guys ive never heard of anything like it before encountered anything like it before and quite honestly i wouldnt know how to begin helping or treating this lady any of you got a contribution one by one the three men shook their heads denning said i asked to speak to jane did you said hall for what it was worth it was just foul mouthed thats what it is most of the time said perry mason sniggered despite himself i talked to her too how many people have been told to go fuck themselves by a ghost noone laughed briefly into halls mind came keflinbrowns cutoffatthecourtdoor cynicism earlier that day he said how can we any of you working separately or all together as a group if necessary rid jennifer of her ghost i dont even began elliott didnt until now he corrected believe in ghosts i dont think any of us did said hall now we do so lets try to answer the question ive already told you i cant said the american i dont know how to if anyones got any idea ill go along with it again one after another the other three psychiatrists said the same you cant say that protested hall theres nothing else for us to say insisted mason in return were psychiatrists not exorcists we suggested exorcism reminded perry she refused hall told the other men she said she didnt helieve in god i said i didnt believe in ghosts repeated elliott i think exorcisms worth trying whether she believes or not anythings worth trying the jam shes in said smith he paused but id like to spend a lot more time with her he looked vaguely embarrassed like a culture under a microscope accused hall think of what she is we cant begin to imagine her clinical value to psychiatry psychology every science of the brain urged the american im not going to think of her as an experiment refused hall in sudden realization he said but shes sane isnt she thats what we were all going to tell the court agreed mason so there couldnt be a committal order for her own protection the psychiatrists considered the question elliott said she could admit herself thats what she told me jane was trying to do get her declared insane and locked up in an asylum remembered denning me too said mason so jane could win after all hall felt a frustrating surge of impotence i just cant leave her he said a remark more to himself than to anyone else your legal responsibility ends with her acquittal said perry i know what my legal boundaries are said hall sharply but i havent practised law long enough yet to lose my moral or humane responsibilities perry flushed dont we have to face the fact that theres nothing we can do to help her you know where to find me if you think theres anything i can do offered mason exorcisms the only thing i can think of i agree said elliott and ill help if anyone comes up with an idea ill talk to some guys back home see if theyve got any thoughts offered smith but im not holding out any hope there was another pause if she were to agree to a period under analysis id appreciate being involved you never know it might produce something like a nobel prize said hall bitterly geoffrey johnson waited until the psychiatrists had filed out before saying and theres another problem he nodded towards the telephone by the window i spoke to annabelle the foreign press dont consider themselves bound by any order jarvis has made the place is under siege too the police are doing what they can but she says emilys terrified well move her decided hall at once and get her involved in the sort of car chase we had before challenged johnson the memory of that morning came to hall helicopter he decided the grounds are big enough tell annabelle to get everything prepared so theyre ready to move the moment it lands the press wont be able to catch up that mornings memory remained but dont let it land where youre going to hide her theyll trace her from the flight plan have it put down somewhere where youre waiting then you go on by road but not in that bentley its too identifiable johnson blinked at the flurry of instructions perry said where the hells it all going to end i dont think it is going to said hall at the hospital jane said they were terrified when they opened my grave you know what weve done weve made everybody believe in ghosts chapter twentysix jennifer was surprised annoyed even as she had been throughout the previous day by his lack of contact at jeremy hall arranging for her to travel to court in a police van and under front and rear police escort her uncertainty lasted only until they attempted to leave the hospital the embankment outside in both directions seethed with people more public than press through whom it was practically impossible to move it took thirty minutes to move as many yards the outside of the van constantly banged and hit her name shouted again and again in an echoing chanted demand for her to put herself at the narrow window from which in fact she recoiled it was far worse at the approach to the court the solid block of a baying gawking mob began to form a quarter of a mile away jamming every street they tried and they only reached it finally edging along in the middle of a linkedarm guard of walking policemen with others forming an outer barrier physically forcing a path jennifer finally closed her eyes altogether against the camera lights careless of how shed look in any picture that might be snatched it was clearly impossible for her to use the public access which she was entitled to do on bail instead she entered as she had on all the previous days through the gatedoff rear doors hall was already there waiting jennifer was shaking frightened and said this is incredihle awful do something before hall could reply jane said this is how its going to be hall began walking with her along the corridor hand cupping her elbow careful not to come into contact with her strapped side i spent yesterday trying to think of something well sort it out believe that and youll believe anything wheres emily i phoned home yesterday afternoon mrs jenkins said annabelle had taken her away by helicopter what the hell for the same reason you had to be brought here by the police we had to get emily away annabelles with her of course johnson too emily thinks shes on holiday jennifer shuddered flinching at the pain from her ribs i want it to end for everyone to go away its just beginning i keep telling you lets get today over i saw what was inside the coffin declared jennifer the contents had been photographed from both helicopters by television as well as still cameras and in the majority of cases published without the obscenity being airbrushed or blanked out it had first been shown on the previous evenings television news todays really just a formality but theres a lot of surprises still left the two regular wardresses were waiting at the bottom of the court steps reminding her youve got everything from the prison johnson has to the wardress hall said keep close to her tell him not to worry ive got a different surprise today one youre really going to like she says shes got another surprise ann wardle visibly stood back as the irishaccented kathleen did the same she said what surprises are surprises jennifer shook her head against the question hall said theres nothing that can go against you in court youre provably innocent weve been beyond that for the last two days havent we demanded jennifer objectively she didnt have to stress the weariness her injured ribs and knee ached and peter lloyd had told her that morning that the result of the hiv blood test might take longer than hed first thought although hed made it a priority request jane had been noisily in the background throughout her sedated halfsleep and shed had her first real experience of how mobs would react told you youd be a freak from now on didnt listen did you to that reflection and jennifer at that moment wasnt sure how much longer she could go on fighting didnt know wouldnt know after today what she had to fight the court the murder charge had been a reality an actuality she could confront understand and shed had someone believing her supporting her she wasnt faced with any reality from now on and her defender wouldnt be around to help her she wouldnt be in any court and so jeremy wouldnt be there to rely on he hadnt tried to distance himself from her today actually held her arm helped her along the corridor and been careful he didnt jar into her side to hurt her she didnt want to lose him be without him didnt want to be alone apart from her tormentor but im all youve got honey think of it like a marriage the worst marriage in your worst nightmare then double it here it is announced hall the last time youre going to have to stand in a dock ready steady go yet again jennifer had to force one foot in front of the other to ascend into the dock the approaching noise was practically deafening louder than it had ever been but at her appearance it died into an awed silence that was even more disconcerting police were shoulder to shoulder around the dock but today there was no darted media approach for her own satisfaction jennifer stood at the dock rail for the first time not trying to withdraw from the incredulous fascination but gazing defiantly challengingly back at her onlookers briefly she was tempted to say something anything go on go on to see how frightened the reaction would be but she didnt lots of time later jeremy hall turned and smiled and she smiled back even jarviss expression was less gargoylelike when he entered and he extended it in the direction of the media and jennifer thought everyone desperate to ensure their little place in the history of the supernatural bizarre how many other people would want her autograph like the wardresses who sat behind her now with what they regarded a safe distance between them why not sign for both of us we could do doublesided photographs jane and jennifer jennifer and jane said jennifer softly but aloud watching the shocked reaction the awareness that she was talking to the ghost inside her from around the court not funny she corrected herself at once playing games stupid insane games thats it insane and thats how ill do it take your mind away and you wont even notice it until its too late oddly or perhaps befitting the complete unnaturalness of the moment the moment a staid undemonstrative unhysterical british court of law legally established and recognized the existence of the supernatural there was a strange anticlimax about the conclusion of the trial the scientists contributed with the formality of their findings which they presented in microscopic detail anthony billington even insisted throughout his evidence upon referring to dna by its full name deoxyribonucleic acid and following his lead phylis shipley did the same although there was no possibility of prosecution challenge or appeal upon technicality hall allowed both to introduce charts and diagrams showing the formation and relationships between doublestranded molecules and nuclei and chromosomes which they illustrated in hugely enlarged detail and asked each virtually identical questions when they came to the end of their esoteric explanations in jennifers head jane hummed jennifer thought she recognized snatches of small town girl wrong how about ive got you under my skin describe in laymens language what deoxyribonucleic acid provides for you hall demanded from the prosecution expert a unique and individual genetic picture responded billington a body fingerprint suggested phylis shipley when she followed into the witnessbox each different from any other the same only in identical twins qualified billington have you prepared photographs of the dna you extracted from the blond hair and o rhesus negative blood samples found in gerald lomaxs office billington said yes phylis shipley offered sufficient individual folders for the entire jury in jennifers head echoed the sound of a protracted yawn did you successfully extract comparison dna from the hair and bones in the coffin of jane lomax ruined the spelling i did said billington what was that comparison although it was already obvious there was a loud and disbelieving intake of communal breath when billington indicated his photographic charts and said there is absolutely no doubt the hair and o rhesus negative blood from gerald lomaxs office contains deoxyribonucleic acid identical to that i found in the bodily remains in the grave of jane lomax the sound echoed around the court again when phylis shipley repeated the finding hall remained standing as the woman scientist left the witnessbox he said my lord is it your wish that i make a submission that will not be necessary refused jarvis it took him only minutes to direct the jury formally to return a verdict of not guilty to the background of rising noise throughout the court it quietened only slightly when jennifer was called to rise jarvis said jennifer lomax you leave this court having been found not guilty of the charge of murder brought against you it having been admirably legally and scientifically proved by your learned counsel that the crime was perpetrated not by yourself but by the spirit of jane lomax who possesses your body and your mind you are jennifer lomax a woman to be greatly pitied and in need of help that none of us can begin to understand there was in a certain period of british legal history a phrase utilized at the conclusion of some murder trials that seems to me to be very fitting today may god have mercy upon your soul you know what youre going to do now that this is all over dont you said jane youre going to be reunited with emily and one day when i feel like it im going to make you kill her wont that be fun jennifer emitted an anguished strangled scream ann wardle only halfcaught her so jennifer still hit the dock floor hard but she had fainted too deeply into unconsciousness to feel the fresh pain in her ribs geoffrey johnson was waiting for annabelle in the bar of the wiltshire theme park when she came down from the room she was sharing with emily annabelle accepted the waiting glass of wine and said shes asleep but ill need to keep checking her shes started wetting the bed kids of that age do mine did geoffrey annabelle erupted she hasnt seen her father for months and doesnt know whats happened to him her mother tried to kill her she thinks the bad men who invaded hampshire wanted to take her away and to escape them she had to leave in a helicopter and at four helicopters arent exciting theyre bloody frightening emily wetting the bed isnt a thing that kids do shes developing psychological problems jennifers not guilty shes free so shell be back with emily in a day or two is that how long shes going to stay in hospital they dont know yet theyre not sure why she fainted apart from the obvious relief johnson poured more wine i spoke to humphrey while you were upstairs and ive booked in theyve asked me to stay make sure youre not found apparently the scenes in london were incredible humphrey said it had to be like the hysteria of a medieval execution when people were hanged drawn and quartered ive unplugged the television i didnt want emily waking up and putting it on just in case she sipped her drink its not going to be as easy here as it was at home keeping newspapers from her i know she cant read but she can see the pictures there were a couple of bad situations at home jeremy asked me to thank you for what youve done and are doing annabelle looked seriously at the solicitor im not sure for how much longer you cant quit now protested the man you think ive enjoyed it of course you havent none of us have but its all over now shes still possessed isnt she and you told me the psychiatrists couldnt help jeremys trying to think of something i dont want to live in a house with a woman whos got a ghost in her head and i dont think we can allow emily to after what happened at the hospital lets wait until we know why she collapsed pleaded johnson chapter twentyseven jeremy hall didnt want a celebration found it difficult at that precise moment to believe he had anything to celebrate but as he had in allowing bert feltham into the conference with the psychiatrists he considered his future in the chambers and accepted the prelunch invitation to sir richard proudfoots rooms the decision was made easier by peter lloyd who during their prior telephone conversation told him jennifer was still heavily sedated and wouldnt be able to respond properly to visitors until that afternoon at the earliest lloyd admitted still not knowing the cause of the collapse and agreed to julian mason coming as well mason immediately agreed to midafternoon after asking with professional jealousy if the other psychiatrists were also to be involved to the obvious satisfaction of being told they werent it was feltham who organized the chambers gathering humphrey perry was included and hall was briefly curious that all eight senior members were able to attend at such short notice from none was there the resentment hed known previously at the nepotism of his joining his uncles firm not even from sir patrick piltbeam whose chambers they would become upon proudfoots elevation to the bench or jonathan cappell both he knew had voted against his penniless admission now everything changed his acceptance went far beyond being effusive to be cloying to the point of sycophancy there was the artificiality of individual handshakes and backslapping congratulations and the embarrassment of a eulogizing speech from proudfoot there was a lot about his potential being recognized from the start and of the fame hed brought to the chambers as well as to himself there seemed a contest among the qcs to be the first to take him to lunch and cappell who until now had barely acknowledged his existence suggested proposing him for membership of the garrick or the reform or both it was decided hall like being the dog to win the supreme championship at crufts everyone wanted to take him for a walk to show off it was henry kerslake another junior who asked the question whats she like a frightened woman said hall unhelpfully i mean does it show physically she doesnt look any different from any other woman just one head immediately despising the cynicism which sounded as if it were directed at jennifer and not kerslake he added the only physical evidence is when she cant resist being forced to do something good lord said kerslake as if hed had a revelation she looks beautiful in the newspaper pictures she is i told you theres no outward manifestation you frightened of her it was like a courtroom crossexamination hall thought there was a frightening episode in the hospital when she attacked the child prompted piltbeam hall looked accusingly between perry and feltham supposing it was inevitable yes what an experience enthused kerslake actually being close to someone like that incredible actually its very sad when does the lecture tour start demanded piltbeam half joking to lighten the moment as a matter of fact there was an approach from an agent this morning admitted hall it had been one of the five new offers in the pigeonhole of his still beleaguered apartment patricia had called again as well as five newspapers all of which increased their initial offers for interviews and personalized stories and ive got four briefs specifically asking for you by name mr hall disclosed feltham i havent made any commitment yet wanted to discuss them with you first more consideration than you show us bert complained cappell the offers to mrs lomax herself are astonishing came in perry an american publisher is offering the equivalent of for a book jennifer lomax could become an industry said cappell in another attempted joke she wont hall said positively why did they think it was so amusing still no trouble with the fees though suggested hugh norton he was the oldest qc in chambers a passedover lawyer who never appeared in criminal court and only took sufficient civil litigation to support the middle of each day at his regular groundfloor corner table of el vino unlikely in the first place quite apart from our being awarded costs assured perry i had johnson anticipate the verdict make an assessment mrs lomax was already wealthy in her own right and lomaxs will makes her a millionairess and having been found not guilty she qualifies for all the insurance policies company as well as private and theyre worth a fortune hes still working it out hall shifted uncomfortable with the bonestripping dissection arent we being premature practical old boy defined cappell you pulled off a brilliant defence earned your fee everyone should be well and truly satisfied he wasnt hall abruptly realized he supposed they were right although their attitude offended him hed fulfilled his function and owed jennifer lomax nothing more if anything her debt was to him but he wasnt going to leave it leave her hed chosen the four psychiatrists because of their expertise and wanted mason with him later for the same reason but it had only been four there were others he could consult until he found how to free jennifer the answer might even come from milton smith when he talked to people in america who might be able to help and exorcism he definitely had to discuss that with jennifer irrespective of any initial reluctance were certainly more than satisfied said proudfoot as the other barristers began drifting from the room looking more towards the solicitor than anyone else feltham said i suppose we should start on the paperwork then dont see why not agreed perry cheerfully i do stopped hall i dont want any bills submitted until i say so he was he acknowledged directly challenging feltham on the mans own territory a cardinal offence quickly he added i dont consider the case is finished yet so as i said it would be premature not too long though jeremy urged proudfoot misquoting he said time and tide in the affairs of men and all that sort of thing berts got an orderly queue waiting for your services by the sound of it what do you want me to do about them mr hall mr hall from the inchamber legend sir from an arrogant police superintendent recognized hall things had very clearly changed ask them to wait bert if you would anything that couldnt be held for a few days i dont think so mr hall ill leave it to your judgement he smiled aware of his own hypocrisy thats what everyone else does here isnt it feltham smile back leave it to me sir hall declined all the immediate lunch offers and was glad because he was in his rooms to receive both panicked calls superintendent hopkins he already knew peter lloyd initiated the second approach verbally to introduce the hospital administrator hector beringer hopkins complained that the crowd around the hospital had become so bad that twice already that day theyd had to close westminster and lambeth bridges and seal off the westerly approach to waterloo station to maintain the barest minimum of a totally interrupted rail service i stopped counting after wed issued three hundred breach of the peace and obstruction summonses said hopkins theres been assaults upon my officers people just wont leave even after theyre officially charged more than once and ive suspended actual arrests to prevent a riot the man paused for breath theres actually a group of about forty who say they belong to the resurrection of life church trying to set up a bivouac encampment alongside lambeth palace theyre claiming janes ghost has summoned them over a hundred extra officers have had to be seconded in whats your point superintendent hall cut in i would have thought that was obvious sir its becoming difficult for us to cope even with mounted assistance were on the verge of losing control your responsibility is to maintain order reminded hall i dont need to be told what my responsibilities are sir im trying to get some idea how much longer this nonsense is going to continue he paused imagining the nearest he could come to a threat and also to find out to whom officially to address a formal notification that i am going to suggest to my watch committee that we attempt to recover from mrs lomax the money all this is costing i havent an answer to your first question address your letter about costs to my instructing solicitor humphrey perry it will of course be strenuously resisted hopkins sighed defeated havent you any idea when mrs lomax might be discharged at that time hall had not been contacted by the hospital administrator not yet i might get an indication this afternoon he got it in fact just five minutes later hall listened patiently to hector beringers description of the chaos outside the hospital guessing hed rehearsed the protest and needed to vent the obvious anger its become impossible effectively to run the hospital emergencies cant get through every ambulance is surrounded by mobs who believe shes inside one was almost turned over an hour ago i understood this morning from doctor lloyd that she is still seriously unwell in the opinion of consultants senior to doctor lloyd she is not too ill to be moved im responsible for the care of a great many people not just one and the health of a lot of them is being endangered i have to ask you to take mrs lomax to a private hospital when you come here this afternoon which i understand from doctor lloyd you intend to do with a psychiatrist agreed hall and when im independently satisfied that mrs lomax is fit enough to be moved then i will make arrangements but not before mr hall i dont want there to be any misunderstanding about this you dont have a choice i dont want any misunderstanding either mr beringer and i do have a choice i have the choice of going before a judge to ask for mrs lomax to be placed under a courts protection against being ejected from your hospital into the sort of uncontrolled mob youve just spent fifteen minutes describing to me thats ridiculous it would be if you attempted to do it i sympathize with the stress youre under and whats happening at your hospital but threats arent the way to resolve it ill expect to see you there this afternoon it was worse than hall imagined worse even than the scenes that completely dominated the lunchtime television news bulletins that he watched before he left he decided to walk disregarding the entourage of bobbing questioning and envelopethrusting media who ignored his demands to be left alone encountering the buildup as soon as he crossed blackfriars bridge to the south side of the river stamford street was lined either side by barriers in an attempt to keep the road open but theyd been pushed forward by the crush of people reducing the thoroughfare to a single line that was being controlled in a stopandgo system by police radio cars at either end it took hall almost fifteen minutes to find a sergeant and to identify himself to be escorted along the road on the outside of the barriers by that time the protesting media pack forbidden to follow and held behind a police block had drawn sufficient attention for hall to be recognized his name became an immediate meaningless chant he ignored the outstretched hands not knowing what they were reaching for but was abruptly pulled sideways by someone managing to snag his pocket which ripped at once he was overwhelmed by a flurry of hands grabbing and pulling at him his tie tightened garrotting him it snapped when he desperately yanked it loose and it disappeared into the crowd one of the two policemen wrenched him free taking him into the middle of the slowmoving line of traffic beyond the tendril wave of snatching hands twice people the first a girl then an immediately encouraged boy inexplicably stripped to the waist tried to leap the barrier at him both were simply knocked roughly back into the crowd by his escorts alerted by radio superintendent hopkins was waiting for him at waterloo station believe me now the man demanded i didnt disbelieve you before i just couldnt imagine it theyre bringing soldiers in from wellington barracks york road could not be cleared sufficiently for cars policemen were positioned every ten yards desperately trying to keep in place the metal fencing to maintain a passage barely wide enough for hall and hopkins to walk between a tight linkedarm encirclement of more riotuniformed officers despite that protection there were still snatched attempts to touch him a snowdrift of paper thrust at him to sign built up on the ground when he refused to take it two mounted policemen joined the phalanx at the addington street junction for what became a final dash into the hospital forecourt they didnt stop running faster without obstruction into the final safety of the hospital reception hall became aware that he was shaking and wasnt able to prevent it and realized surprised that it was his first experience of real fear he couldnt remember how the top pocket had been torn almost out of his jacket to match the early rip in stamford street both cufflinks had vanished and his cuffs now hung clear of his sleeves covering his hands he started back when lloyd came very close to examine his face the doctor said youve got a couple of scratches but theyre only superficial here hall took the offered antiseptic wipe and after rubbing his face used it to clean what looked like spit off his right sleeve as lloyd introduced him to the hospital administrator hall said to both the police controller and beringer i dont need to be told again that its unacceptable of course it is totally he concentrated upon the hospital official like it would be to think of discharging mrs lomax out into it i never suggested that and you know it rejected beringer i want it solved today is mason here lloyd nodded he was lucky he didnt get to court to be photographed and recognized it still took him an hour to get through hes already with her how is she hall asked as they went to the elevators lloyd hesitated looking towards beringer before saying id like her to be a lot better the sedation hasnt totally worn off but i dont think its physical thank god she didnt do any more damage to her ribs when she fell whats she said virtually nothing other than keep asking for you hall frowned conscious of the immediate apprehension from beringer at the question but not embarrassed at asking it he said what about jane shes saying something over and over again bur jennifer wont say what it is why not thats what mason is trying to find out now the doctor paused when they reached the level of the private ward i really dont think shell be able to hold on to her sanity much longer neither does mason but this is a medical not a psychiatric hospital warned beringer from behind jennifer was lying in bed the covers drawn up to her chin as if she was trying to hide she was very pale there was no makeup and her hair was unkempt and her eyes dulled from medication were blackringed again she didnt smile at halls entry but there was some slight animation in her face at once she brought a hand from beneath the sheet and held it out to him he took it sitting as he did so on the chair mason pushed towards him the action was to draw halls attention the psychiatrist shook his head against having learned anything how are you feeling he asked inadequately youve got to do some things legal things her voice was drug slurred but urgent like what keep emily safe what is it jennifer whats happened tell him tell them all shes going to make me kill emily thats what she said in court what shes been saying ever since there was a stir from lloyd and the administrator hall didnt bother to look beyond any surprise how in gods name was he going to help her the vague unformed idea that came was mad but they were in a totally mad unreal unknown situation youve got to have her legally taken away from me jennifer stumbled on weakvoiced i can never know where she is see her again i know that just do it dont tell me about it just do it dont be a spoilsport ill do something his hand hurt from the tightness with which she was gripping it physically needing to hold on to force herself to abandon her baby not something do what i ask you get her taken away from me please shell never be safe if you dont she swallowed heavily unable to go on for several moments then it can be all over no refused hall fearing he understood the final remark its not going to be all over there were five of them in beringers office but when the proposal to get jennifer out began to take shape hall kept a telephone line open to perry because it was easier for the solicitor to make their part of the arrangements from his end hopkins used another extension to coordinate the police participation and mason a third it took three hours and they spent a further hour objectively criticizing each others contribution in the hope of exposing unforeseen flaws you sure about the security hall asked the psychiatrist thats what you pay for and how they can afford me as a consultant assured mason theyve treated a cabinet minister and two pop stars in the last six months and not a word leaked out he made a vague gesture through the window overlooking the chaos outside what youre seeing there is mass hysteria strangely something like a mass religious hysteria theres already the cult camped outside lambeth palace itll grow far beyond any police or army control unless we get her away for hundreds of people hundreds who are going to become thousands jennifer lomax is the equivalent of someone from outer space or the second messiah i wish we could use a helicopter again hall said to hopkins so do i but we cant the crowd should get smaller after midnight and weve kept the sightseeing ferries and boats away all day lets hope it stays that way only mason and lloyd accompanied him when hall returned to the small ward to explain to jennifer what was going to happen she listened blankeyed disinterested shrugging when lloyd asked her if she physically felt up to it she said i suppose so it hardly matters does it lloyd remained in the ward insisting upon personally restrapping jennifers ribs and making a final medical examination as hall and mason walked back towards the administrators office which was to act as the control room hall said what do you think jennifer meant by saying it would all be over when i got a protection order for emily that she intends killing herself of course said the psychiatrist without any hesitation are you going to take emily away legally its not necessary at the moment theres no way jennifer can get to her what are you going to do then take jane on said hall simply insane ideas for insane situations he thought again back in jennifers ward lloyd said ive got something youre going to want to hear the blood test is absolutely negative not a trace of hiv i was hoping there would be said jennifer it would have imposed a time limit on what im going to do but it would have been a wonderful way to see you finally die wouldnt it chapter twentyeight it worked when the moment came noone truly believed that it would because too many uncertainties were compounded at the outset despite the examination and reexamination of what they were going to attempt they hadnt allowed for equipment failure or interference the police radio linking halls group to everyone else wouldnt work from the belowbasement boiler room isolating them completely we cant go back decided hall at once everyone else will already be moving just keep trying there were five of them hall and mason like the two escorting policemen wore hospital maintenance overalls as additional disguise the barrister wore a yellow hardhat jennifer wore a nurses cloak over a regulation uniform the shoes pinched the headscarf was ready for when they emerged through the heating service door jennifer was shuffling along automatically engulfed in apathy moved by hall and mason either side two oclock was start time agreed mason its five past three floors up at ground level it had started although not from the hospital itself a route for vehicles had been forced through by the army reinforcements particularly across westminster bridge because it was visible from the albert embankment across it promptly on time streamed a cavalcade of motorcycle outriders lights on sirens blaring the three police vans and two range rovers burned their sirenconnected lights too police and soldiers shoulder to shoulder pushed back against a crowd smaller than during the day but still large enough to block the entrance reacting to the prearranged signal of an ambulance emerging from the hospital garage to park directly outside the main entrance following it from the garage came a squad of soldiers at the double to form another shoulder to shoulder wall between the vehicle and the crowd jennifer jennifer was an isolated shout at first but at once was taken up to become a repetitive howl a lot of people tried to kneel in prayer but almost at once started screaming when they were trampled on everything was in fact made ghostly white by camera lights again from circling helicopters lights stabbed down the noise was so loud that it reached them close to the boilerroom door although the radio remained dead hall gently touched jennifers arm as if to rouse her to confront the problem they had recognized but couldnt anticipate whats she saying nothing is she there no what about the sedation i feel all right quite clear my chest still hurts the two policemen edged back despite their personal selection by hopkins one was a sergeant the other an inspector my best hopkins had called them try to give me a warning hall told her if it works at all the diversion wont last long shell do something she has to hah shes back it had been abrupt the numbness practically at the same time as the triumphant exclamation tell me what she says demanded hall urgently trying to maintain a timetable tor which hed attempted to make allowances for janes inevitable interference although not able to judge how long theyd need if jennifer erupted in attentionattracting convulsions the intention was to retreat back into the hospital and everything would have been a waste of time every word as she says it throw you to the wolves how about that theyd tear you apart like a pack frightened of the unknown and youre frightened too arent you demanded hall addressing jane cocky little scumbag you talking to me yes and you are frightened not sure of yourself any more not sure what you can make jennifer do you want me to show you what i can make her do three minutes estimated hall unable to check the timing and still unable to discover any setbacks above what would that prove that i still call the shots which i do i disgraced you in court disgraced the memory of your father exposed you as a murderess and destroyed the herbetson family name hed discarded the destroyed jacket but wore the boilersuit over the rest of his clothes he was saturated by sweat it had to be five minutes by now who gives a fuck you should you fouled your family name didnt prove anyone murdered you jennifers free couldnt keep a husband when you had one you failed all the way down the line didnt you jennifer had both arms clutched around her holding her sides mason was intently forward determined against missing anything of the exchange the two policemen were pebbleeyed in astonished bewilderment it had to have been going on for eight minutes by now what the fuck are you saying that i can defeat you whenever i want and that youre too scared to admit it so youre going to make a scene when we get outside like a spoilt child he looked to the policemen shrugging lets go back its a waste of time hed been sure of julian mason but not of the other two men so they hadnt been rehearsed but the psychiatrist had although he hadnt thought this dialogue remotely possible it was of them all the greatest uncertainty mason matched the barristers shrug and set off back along the metalled walkway pausing after a few steps to turn back arent you coming he asked the uncertain policemen bullshit and bluff how you going to get her out from the emergency helicopter pad on the roof lied hall whenever we choose any time later today when its light what the fucks all this about in the first place then youve seen the television pictures of whats happening outside said hall knowing from lloyd that jennifer had watched the police wanted to end the chaos as soon as they could now theyre going to have to wait he took jennifers arm and began to follow the psychiatrist he had lost he admitted to himself the fifteen minutes hed built into the timing had to have expired by now what do you think you can do its not important now tell me now jennifer jerked her arms up to cover her ears at the shouted demand crying out at the pain it caused but still gasping out the reply fuck off jane another failure how about that now hall continued walking jennifer back into the hospital behind julian mason there was the clatter of footsteps on metal as the policemen followed he didnt reply i mean lets go now no you dont said hall not pausing jennifer was brought to a halt stopping him you want a fight youre not up to it you want a fight jennifer whimpered at the pain of trying physically to close her ears off again yes i want to fight then lets go asshole far above the assembled waggon train was also ready to go the final trigger that brought the jennifer howl to a throbbing crescendo was the sight of a blanketembalmed figure the nurse whose uniform jennifer was wearing far below being stretchered between attentive hospital staff into the ambulance it only just negotiated the lefthand turn back on to the attentiondrawing westminster bridge before the police and soldier line burst under the irresistible pressure of frenetically mindrobbed people but by then the procession was already halfway over the bridge quickly turning south west past the houses of parliament on to millbank in an obvious direction back to hampshire it had already crossed and was out of sight when one of the st thomass overalled policemen cautiously eased through the gullysubmerged oil delivery opening and even more cautiously climbed the steps to look around his hand raised in readiness for the downwave that would tell his colleague who had finally established radio contact at ground level to slam shut the scarcely open door already the crowd on the riverbordering albert embankment was thinning and they and those that remained still all gazed and crushed towards the bridge over which they appeared to expect the autocade to return others strained to follow the identifying searchlight beams of the helicopters pursuing along the other side of the river there was still a loud jennifer wail the prepared door slamming gesture turned into an urgent beckoning they came out together mason and hall either side of jennifer the remaining policeman close behind all three ignoring her scarfmuffled pleas to slow because she was hurting the launch is there were all right reported the radioman at the top of the stairway but without pausing anxious now for them to get into the concealing ebbandflow of people the two hundred metres to lambeth pier was a barefoot walk on glowing coals only hall could sensibly remain as close as might be necessary to jennifer the others had to become gawking sensationseekers although within a seconds leap mason actually joined in the stillexisting excitement pointing up like others were needlessly doing tracing the distant progress of the convoy from the helicopters searchlight fingers they were constantly jostled because the majority of people were going in the opposite direction still towards westminster bridge but the apologies when there were any were invariably automatic made without looking several times jennifer groaned from the sudden pain of a collision with fifty yards still to go jennifer said desperately shes taking my legs away i cant walk much further cant run back and hide now too far away so she couldnt risk a fight after all said hall even more desperately the bitch but he should have guessed just testing flexing muscles its all right said jennifer its better the boarding was another potential and anticipated flash point the launch that perry had hired but which was crewed by casually dressed river police had been unobtrusively moored at the bottom of the steps for two hours in total darkness and apparently battened down an obvious and official police boat one of four that throughout the day had kept the river between the hospital and parliament clear of a wouldbe armada of waterborne sightseers burbled about ten yards offshore like a growling guard dog just holding itself in position against the tide the lookout policeman reached the chainedoff steps first seeming to loiter and then expansively stretched at the signal there was shadowed movement from below the faintest footscrape at the moment the rest of them drew level on the embankment a figure rose from the river steps to release the chain careful the steps are slippery they were in and descending within seconds hall groping down backwards to reach up with both hands against jennifers shoulders mason trying to balance her from behind twice hall slipped the second time grating his shin against the edge of the step the surprised exclamation came when they were half way down then a shout they were at the pontoon jennifer handed in first and unseen before people appeared above at once there was a blinding obscuring beam from the police launch as it swept in under sudden power the subterfuge was brilliant a rehearsed performance they hadnt been told about with jennifer hall mason and the two escorting policeman huddled unseen in the cabin there was a shouted argument between the uniformed and plainclothes river police quickly concluded with an even louder shouted announcement that the boat was under arrest by the time the civilian boat moved off obediently in the wake of the launch the embankment level embarkation stage had cleared of people jennifer had burrowed into halls shoulder shivering quietly she said hold me please hold me as he did so jane echoed in a smallchild voice hold me please hold me humphrey perry was waiting at the designated berth at richmond which hall had chosen because he rowed from there although not from that specific boat club they finally parted from their police escorts with whispered hurried thanks anxious to get on the road before their arrival was seen already the sky was lightening coffee had been waiting once they had got underway and just before they arrived jennifer had managed without any choking rejecting difficulty the painkilling pills lloyd had provided within minutes of the car beginning to move she was lolled against halls shoulder occasionally moving fitfully but most of the time snoring mason made an exaggerated liftedeyebrow expression but didnt speak hall answered the look but didnt say anything either it was completely light by the time they reached the private psychiatric clinic at hertfordshire although the only people apart from the nightstaff were the medical doctor and two nurses whom mason alerted from the car phone just before they arrived there was a wheelchair for the halfasleep jennifer but the efficient smoothness of her immediately being swept into her private suite was broken by her abruptly twisting seeking hall who for once had retreated into the background the imploring hand came out again youre not leaving me no i dont want you to i told you im not im not leaving you either there was still too much adrenalin for either of them even to consider sleep hall sat through the formal admission procedures which mason completed with the resident doctor charles cox he was a pipesmoking slowtalking man who showed neither surprise nor awe at jennifers presence what about you three he asked in a strangely highpitched voice id like my usual room accepted mason at once i havent thought about it admitted hall from what ive seen on television youre going to need somewhere to hide too i suppose i am accepted hall thanks you looked bloody scared among all those people yesterday i was he hadnt been aware of any television cameras i wont be staying refused perry hurriedly no agreed hall just as quickly im going to want you back in london am i still professionally engaged demanded the solicitor yes sighed hall upon whose instructions mine which will be confirmed by mrs lomax tomorrow or rather later today when she wakes up what is there legally left to do at the moment im not sure but it could be a lot after perry left with the doctor mason said you really think you can drive jane out make her leave jennifer hall felt a flicker of embarrassment were not talking reality here so its as sensible in a nonsensical situation as anything else i still think you should try exorcism theres a chapel here a priest im willing to try anything what about me i dont understand am i being professionally retained again you told me there was nothing you could do psychiatrically that was to get rid of jane jennifers now in a depressed suicidal state that is treatable and should be treated shouldnt it of course but can it be despite jane i dont know admitted the psychiatrist weve obviously got to try then id like you to be the one to do it to organize the exorcism as well attempted exorcism warned the psychiatrist he didnt immediately continue although it was obvious he wanted to finally he said outright id like her permission and authorization to do a paper another vulture picking at the carcase thought hall except that jennifer wasnt a carcase yet and it was unfair to criticize mason as a vulture what was he going to do when it came around to considering all the media and book offers not a question needing an immediate answer there were a lot of others to be settled first he said ill talk to her about it we both can in fact i can give you one early diagnosis what one of the commonest treatment methods for mental illness is for a psychiatrist to gain the utter reliance of his patient so its going to be hard for me to do that with jennifer shes already transferred her total dependence on to you in her adjoining room through the drug haze and exhaustion and despair jennifer was distantly aware of jane singing to her own tune and adjusted words three little piggies went to market one little piggy went to the slaughter another little piggy makes two a third little piggy is waiting by the door who can we find to make four chapter twentynine they did finally sleep but only for two or three hours and then fitfully hall was glad jennifer was still asleep henot house he discovered was not specifically a psychiatric hospital although it had a dedicated and fully staffed wing but a drug and alcohol dependency clinic for the ultra rich and very famous set in wooded grounds at least three times as big as those in which the hampshire mansion was set these complete with an eighteen hole golf course he took particular note of the helicopter pad within the building there was a shopping mall he charged a designer track suit trousers and shirt underwear and shaving gear to an account he already found opened for him although against his suite number not his name he checked at once with charles cox reassured it was all part of theaday system and that jennifers identity was similarly protected while he waited for humphrey perry to get into his office hall watched breakfast television it was almost totally occupied as it had been for the past five days by jennifer hector beringer repeated in a live interview with superintendent hopkins in insistent support beside him that jennifer was no longer at the hospital every channel had its own reporter whod taken part in the previous nights chase talking over the helicopter film of the decoy ambulance driving as far as basingsroke before returning without stopping for the nurse dressed in jennifers clothes very publicly to get out and actually pose for photographs at the hospital entrance there was ground footage of her doing that and a lot of that mornings film of a disbelieving crowd buildup which already looked as large as it had been the previous day soldiers were still there every station featured their resident psychiatrists two of whom thought jennifer could be freed of janes possession by treatment they offered to provide against three who insisted jennifer would be possessed for life the latter view appeared to be the opinion of newspaper contributing psychiatrists whose views were also discussed in detail one tabloid held up to the camera had the headline twinned for life to a murderer there was a lot of psychiatric references to religious hysteria that had attracted the crowds and footage of the cult squatters by lambeth palace there was on every channel discussion about the book and media offers as if they were being seriously considered by jennifer and her legal advisors on a commercial station the last to which hall turned a pop group performed a country and western style ode to jennifer with a prediction from a disc jockey that it would be in the charts by the end of the week the repeated chorus was that jennifer was doomed for life despite having had little sleep himself humphrey perry was in his office promptly at nine waiting for halls call it took the solicitor fifteen minutes to take down halls instructions which included having collected from geoffrey johnson and delivered the clothes and belongings hed collected from the prison when hall told the solicitor what he wanted from both the defence and prosecution sections of the murder file perry said that absolutely dont even bother to say it stopped hall we actually know bentley a trained murder squad detective looked into it still protested the man the same detective who didnt properly carry out the investigation at the scene of the crime rejected hall it was all too obvious they laid back leave it to the priests and the psychiatrists just have what i want sent down but not by courier someone you can trust from your office who wont be recognized and followed mason and the clinic doctor were in deep conversation when hall emerged for the second time ive managed a preliminary medical examination said the squeakyvoiced doctor i dont like all the medication shes been having what st thomass administered was fine but god knows what was pumped into her in prison im going to put her on detox to clean her out hall flinched at the brutality of the doctors expression in daylight cox was an unusual looking man hall guessed the hooded eyes were normal but werent helped by the man waiting up for their arrival you consider shes medically unwell shes not in good physical shape said cox i dont think shes eaten properly for weeks the knife wounds have barely healed the cut on her leg is still open and im going to take xrays later to see how the ribs are knitting and thats before i get involved or we think about exorcism said mason were wondering just how much more at the moment jennifer lomax can take physically and mentally surely its a measure of how strong jennifer is mentally that shes been able to withstand it said hall theres a limit warned the psychiatrist i think she might be close to reaching it which is why id like to know what you think you can do before hall was halfway through explaining mason and cox were exchanging looks the moment hall finished mason said flatly i dont like it youve no basis for believing that it would work and itll put a hell of a strain on her any greater strain than shes already under additional i outmanoeuvred jane to get us away from the hospital youre talking of more than outmanoeuvring her now are you telling me on medical or mental health grounds not to try it both doctors were momentarily silent cox said id want to detox her first and after that give her some time to rest mason said and id like to start treating her for the depression i wouldnt be able to do anything for some time hall paused forcing the admission perhaps never what if both of you fail demanded an unimpressed cox it was the psychiatrist who answered then shell probably kill herself which maybe she should be allowed to do before jane makes her kill someone else even if she isnt allowed to get near emily jennifer was wearing a track suit too grey against halls deep blue her hair was combed but her face was devoid of makeup shiny and sallow there was a hollowness to her cheeks hall hadnt noticed before and her eyes still blackringed were redrimmed too incredibly startling him it actually made jennifer look ghostlike she looked up disinterestedly through glassy eyes at their entrance the animation was brief with her first demand is emily safe hidden absolutely promised hall noone can get to her wanna bet it seemed an instinctive movement for jennifer to reach out for halls hand unquestioningly almost just as instinctively he took it her skin was clammy but at the same time cold feverish she said i saw what was happening at the hospital hall located the television close to the window louvred doors enclosing the screen it was a huge suite by comparison to the wards she had been in the furniture was predominantly comfortable appealtoeveryone modern with a few pieces a sidetable and a bureau that could have been antique and from the cost of the clinic probably were there was a profusion of flowers mostly roses and lilies in the sittingroom in which they were and more in what he was able to see through the open door of the bedroom youre out of it now when we were getting out jane said they would have torn me apart if theyd got to me reminded jennifer would they have really you betcha it didnt happen said mason placating they didnt get the chance and you dont need to think about what didnt happen whats going to happen from now on but would they have done insisted jennifer it was an uncontrollable mob said mason they might have tried to hurt you others would have wanted to worship you dont i always tell you the truth remember the slogan you heard it here first hall frowned at the psychiatrists directness and at the fear that shuddered through jennifer making her hand tremble forcefully he said the past is just that past were planning a future now weve got a lot to talk about lets hear it big boy shes talking to me all the time mocking as usual and i want to talk to her like i did last night but not immediately he indicated the psychiatrist dr mason wants to try to help get rid of jane dont waste your time whats lover boy want with me she says dont waste your time said jennifer stopping short of repeating the entire remark hall ignored the interruption i know we talked about it and you dont believe in any god but he wants you to try exorcism theres a chapel here a visiting priest rather high church of england hell try to help picked up mason it doesnt matter that you dont believe and i want us to spend a lot of time together on other things youre giving up you mustnt give up i want to stop you thinking like that i dont know how to think any more too tired i won im in charge no youre not too tired not really just for the moment were going to get you better ive never felt better how can i be got better by letting me help you by letting us all help you insisted the psychiatrist he looked pointedly towards the lawyer dr mason has helped us a lot already responded hall not just last night before he wants to treat you help rid you of jane but he also wants to write a clinical report on it a technical paper that other psychiatrists and psychologists can read and learn from freaky freaky freaky jennifer gave a weary sigh there was a discussion about books on television this isnt wont be a book stressed mason urgently it will be a technical account of everything thats happened not sensational at all jennifer gave another sigh why not in his urgency mason had been leaning forward elbows on his knees now he eased back smiling and hes got his piece of flesh youre going to make a lot of people rich jennifer theres another reason you dont feel well said cox involving himself your bodys full of chemicals im going to wash them all out make your body clean as well as fit again hall was glad it was better expressed than before breathing in preparing himself he said and now its time to talk to jane again like i did last night just me and jane her words coming out of your mouth exactly as she says them got you by the halls scumbag before you start you cant read my mind just jennifers so how do you know what im going to do dont need to know what youre going to do oh you do otherwise youll never prove a lot of things dont need to prove a lot of things didnt prove that anyone murdered you did you so what im getting my revenge hes dead shes a freak you saw the television this morning demanded hall as the recollection and the opening it offered came to him what about it hear what they were calling you what the papers were saying homicidal maniac on the channel i watched that true jane you a maniac a homicidal maniac people can understand a wife driven to despair by a cheating husband sympathize even but not someone who kills for fun thats what theyre calling you a maniac who kills for fun janes rage began shaking through jennifer and her hand slipped from halls she snatched out for it again not mad jennifers going to be mad but not me the bastard deserved to die murdered me so he had to die eye for an eye tooth for a tooth thats the rule you dont know that challenged hall you know he was cheating on you with jennifer like he was cheating on jennifer with rebecca but you cant prove he murdered you he doubled trebled my insulin id been selfadministering since i was a kid old enough to hold a syringe i knew my dosages i never never never overdosed mason was sitting back familiar with the scene although professionally intent on every word but cox was open mouthed the hooded eyes appearing wider than normal there was an unlit pipe cupped between his hands like a comfort symbol or a talisman it didnt have a decorative bowl like those johnson preferred he doubled trebled my insulin echoed hall what thats what you said he gerald not he and jennifer wheres the proof she had anything to do with your death she had the motive to get married to him a motive isnt proof where is the proof the proof that was overlooked or missed at the inquest that she had anything whatsoever to do with killing you if indeed you were killed hed read the inquest material that the efficient perry had provided but only as part of the general background not as something essential to the main defence and his recollection was hazy perhaps he should have waited until hed read the duplicate hed asked perry for that morning i was there remember i witnessed my own death he lied at the inquest over and over again and noone challenged him because it was all too cleverly done and people were frightened of him respected him because he was rich he killed me with what jennifer provided i didnt provide anything said jennifer weakly if everything is so easily proved i cant see why you are so frightened for me to go into it unless of course the tv and newspapers are right about your sanity there was a desperation that didnt show in his voice he had no argument left in reserve everything depended upon janes response halls initial thought was that jennifers fingertightening was the beginning of another uncontrollable fit but nothing came and he realized it was jennifer tensing as he was tensed against a physical and verbal tirade that would overwhelm them but there was nothing when they came the words were even measured with no anger or hysteria i am getting justice for myself justice i was denied momentarily hall took his hand away not believing he could prevent the tremble of excitement at her reaction and the argument it made possible just as you are denying justice to jennifer i wonder how your father would have felt about that she had a proper trial and was found not guilty not guilty of killing gerald lomax she hasnt faced trial for killing you how can she be by letting me reexamine the inquest evidence but not as it was examined at the inquest as it would have been examined in a court of law if jennifer lomax had been on trial for your murder and present it to you like a trial here he briefly swept his hand out in front of the doctors if you like who decides guilt or innocence the weight of evidence you could cheat and youd know if i did youve just said you witnessed your own murder and jennifer would know if i tried to cheat and she cant think anything without your being aware of it can she there was another protracted silence and if theres no evidence you expect me to leave give up my possession yes what if there is evidence now the long silence was halls for several moments he held jennifers eyes before saying then it becomes a police matter to be properly prosecuted in court as she was properly prosecuted for the murder of gerald wouldnt that be better revenge for her to be rearraigned on a provable murder charge in a public court brilliant oh yes absolutely brilliant ill go along with that hall still held jennifers eyes are you prepared to accept it too trapped her there havent you jennifer relayed janes words but didnt answer halls question jennifer he prompted youre separating things making it sound like gerald might have done it by himself shes scared im not scared protested jennifer answering an accusation she hadnt mouthed verbatim i didnt murder her neither did gerald then agree to my doing what i want there was still a hesitation before jennifer said all right do it i should have prevented it insisted mason after cox had taken jennifer to begin the complete medical examination before her first meeting with the priest youre putting her through what amounts to a second trial itll be intolerable not if it gets rid of jane theres no guarantee it will no guarantee jane would leave her alone even if you did prove jennifer innocent its a gamble conceded hall with a sick persons sanity protested the psychiatrist it gives you time to do what you can for her professionally and for the exorcism to be attempted mason shook his head unpersuaded would you really tell the police if you thought there had been a murder conspiracy between jennifer and lomax i believe shes totally innocent i wouldnt have started any of this if i hadnt been totally convinced of that that isnt an answer to my question would you im not sure after what shes gone through but it still isnt an answer im not sure either whys mummys picture in the newspaper annabelle and johnson either side of the child at the luncheon table each looked expectantly at the other neither wanting to reply sure it was her asked johnson falling back on well practised legal avoidance of ducking a question by asking another course it was her said emily indignantly there was a man by the pool this morning reading about her there was another picture of lots of people and there was an m word but it wasnt mouse i can read mouse it might have been about people being happy that shes getting better suggested annabelle floundering emily looked doubtfully between the two adults will she be coming home soon then if she gets better will she be nasty to me again no said the girl i dont want her to be nasty any more i didnt like it i told you it only happened because she was very ill now shes getting better it cant happen again good said emily brightly then everythings all right i want to go to the pool again this afternoon while she and johnson were watching an armbanded emily thrash in the shallow end annabelle said ive just broken a cardinal rule ive told a child a lie thats bound to be found out chapter thirty the inquest had returned an open verdict the only one possible from the evidence and it was unclear from local hampshire newspaper reports the only public record available how much of that evidence had been considered by the coroner solicitor james davies against the prepared statements of witnesses hall read the newspaper reports first for a general understanding of how deeply janes death had been examined gerald lomax had been the main witness and his evidence made up the major proportion of each account his wife had suffered diabetes from birth and had always needed to take insulin she injected herself usually without any problems although on two previous occasions before their move from america to england there had been two serious overdose incidents fortunately there had been people with her on both occasions and doctors had been quickly summoned on the second she had been admitted to hospital to be stabilized in the hampshire chronicle which carried the longest account the report had been broken here by a series of questions and answers between the coroner and lomax was your wife careless about her injections the coroner had asked sometimes lomax had replied she also ate too irregularly for her condition what about alcohol which i understand can contribute to an imbalance that had greatly reduced since our move from america you mean she drank immoderately rarely since our transfer to this country but before sometimes would you say your wife was careless of her condition i would say she had grown too familiar with it familiarity breeding contempt cliched the coroner that is so was your wife in any way suicidal because of her condition absolutely not she loved life did your wife take sleeping pills no you are aware that some were found and that traces were found in your wifes body i cant account for that the pills were mine an old prescription they should have been thrown away it was his working practice usually to spend at least three days a week in london on the day of her death a friday he had arrived home in midafternoon the house had appeared to be empty which had surprised him because he had telephoned the previous evening to give her his time of arrival he had assumed jane was out shopping or with friends hed actually telephoned a particular acquaintance the wife of an american on an exchange secondment from ibm to see if she was there it was not until an hour after his return that hed gone upstairs to find his wife in bed in a coma he called her doctor at the same time as the ambulance and travelled in it to hospital with her shed died an hour after admission police constable harry elroyd testified to being automatically called to the mansion by the ambulance alarm mrs lomax had been in bed still wearing her nightdress that and the bedding was soiled where her bladder had apparently collapsed on a bedside table he found an insulin pack with four ampoules missing two both empty were on the table hed found the other two also empty in the bathroom waste bin in the bathroom cabinet he had found a halffilled bottle of temazepam sleeping tablets on the bedside table was a syringe with a needle still attached close to it was a goblet still containing sufficient brandy to be identified by its smell hed found a twothirdsfilled bottle of brandy on the downstairs kitchen table together with the uncleared remains of an evening meal for one person there was the residue of red wine in a glass and in the kitchen waste bin an empty margaux bottle he had located no note to indicate mrs lomax had intended to take her own life dr allan greenaway said he had been mrs lomaxs physician since her arrival in hampshire considering her diabetes she was a woman in reasonably good health although she had consulted him about stomach pains he had prescribed mebeverine hydrochloride for irritable bowel syndrome but had feared she might be developing stomach ulcers not uncommon in her condition for that he issued repeat prescriptions for the insulin he identified from the pack shown to him because of her long history of diabetes he had never thought it necessary to warn her against heavy indulgence in alcohol it was a precaution of which she would have been permanently aware pathologist michael bailey described jane lomax as a woman in general good health apart from some pancreatic atrophy consistent with the history from childhood of her diabetes his autopsy had also disclosed the evidence of impending ulceration suspected by dr greenaway which again resulted from her condition her blood sugar level was radically out of balance which would have inevitably caused shock not just to the virtually inoperative pancreas but to the liver and heart forensically that imbalance was caused by an excess of insulin compounded by alcohol and the lactose and sucrose ingredients of the specific meberevine hydrochloride tablets that had been prescribed it had been impossible for him to calculate with any accuracy the excess of insulin that had proved fatal he understood her daily dosage to be twenty units twice a day the discarded ampoules represented twice that amount and should not additionally have been present during what had evidently been a nighttime period he had found substantial traces of temazepam in mrs lomaxs body and agreed with the coroner that a dangerous but common side effect of sleeping pills was for someone to awaken forget they had already taken some and ingest more in your opinion could this have happened in this case and further disorientated mrs lomax so that she selfadministered a totally unnecessary and lethal injection of insulin the coroner had asked i consider that the most likely explanation for what happened replied the pathologist his phrase a fatal cocktail had provided the headline in two separate newspapers it had also been used and justified the headline by james davies in his summing up although not part of the quote that appeared there are many facets of this tragedy for which i cannot find a satisfactory explanation because of which i feel i am prevented from anything other than an open verdict but all the evidence before me indicates an unfortunately afflicted woman neglecting through familiarity the medical condition with which she had been born mr lomax is a new but already respected member of the local community and to him i express my sympathy in his sad loss jeremy hall was swamped with pointless unresolvable frustration at once objectively reminding himself of what he was trying to achieve he suppressed the distraction as he would have suppressed a flicker of anger in a court the coroners remarks had done more than sum up the inquest indeed the concluding words had thrown up in neonbright clarity the entire formularized direction of the inquest sadly bereaved there were three photographs of a darklybespectacled blacksuited headbent lomax hurrying from court charity supporting pillar of the local community robbed of an adored medically afflicted wife through a combination of small but fatal misjudgements by a pasthisprime country doctor who himself had died six months later and an occasionally wilfullychallenging woman prone to disregarding her illness all the statements read and filleted beforehand a verdict determined sorry gerry accidental or misadventure just wouldnt have been right in advance to get the legally required but painful official business over and out of the way in the shortest acceptable time in his eagerness he was making the mistake of examining the inquest evidence as he would have done in a far more rigidly structured court of law but the inquest hadnt done that inquests rarely did nine times out of ten maybe slightly less they were occasions of commiseration which is what jane lomaxs had been her death had been investigated and decided upon in the familiar nonadversarial surroundings of a village hall with flower show and horticultural exhibition flyers on a tattered notice board and foldaway chairs stacked at the back amidst smells of paraffin and dust and chalk he had to come from the totally opposite direction the criminally minded suspicious believenothing direction the way of john bentley and malcolm rodgers thinking the worst of everybody and every situation until proven wrong sometimes not even then jeremy hall determined upon a middle course refusing the easy criticism of a country inquest but rejecting too a guiltyuntilproven innocent approach as he picked his way with methodical care through the written statements he had consciously to keep that determination in mind so easy would it have been to veer wildly across both selfimposed guidelines when he finished he had seven closely handwritten pages of reminders believed anomalies seeming contradictions and outright inconsistencies it had taken most of the day and occupied a further hour separating his own uncertainties into a list of positive requests to humphrey perry they still occupied four pages and after telephoning to ensure the man would be at the receiving end preventing anyone else identifying the source hall faxed them for convenience and to ensure there was no verbal misunderstanding between himself and the solicitor hall allowed a further hour for perry to read everything before he telephoned london for the second time you sure you want all this demanded the solicitor at once i wouldnt have asked if i hadnt been ive read the same file as closely as you have it was a scarcely adequate inquest but then a lot of inquests are scarcely adequate none of the statements not even of witnesses who werent called incriminate lomax in any way whatsoever and it doesnt take you one step further to what youre trying to prove jennifer isnt involved at all thats what im trying to prove that wasnt what i meant and you know it said perry irritably there were a lot of questions that should have been asked but werent six years ago thats when jane died the time were talking about the time youre talking about id like the answers as soon as possible bert called me he wants to know where you are did you tell him i promised youd call i will agreed hall ive got five more offers all for books three are repeats upping their first offers hold them have you discussed any with her yet thats way down the list weve got a bill for police time and for damage to equipment twentythree thousand ignore it if they issue a writ file a necessity defence under the public order act anything else you tell me not for the moment colin dawson perfectly suited the opulence and ambience of his surroundings a whitehaired pinkfaced avuncular gentleman priest of independent means who had never believed his genuine religious piety needed to be reinforced by secular hardship he rode to hounds on one of his two hunters favoured burgundy over claret in a wine cellar the envy of the county and donated his entire church salary to save the children his cassocks were tailored he came curiously but sincerely concerned into jennifers suite made totally unafraid of encountering a woman possessed by a murderous ghost not just by his belief in the protection of god but by never having known a life without a financial armour through which no harm or ill had ever penetrated the jesus jockey jane greeted the man had been well briefed by julian mason he said it doesnt matter what she makes you do or say she cant frighten or shock me im stronger than she is because i have god and she is evil the devil incarnate let her fight me ill fight her back and i will win the fuck he will jennifer had found it easier a relief even simply to be the conduit between jane and jeremy hall and she did it now with dawson too exhausted too apathetic any longer to censor the words dawson laughed at the obscenity and st matthew said the blasphemy against the holy ghost shall not be forgiven unto men and exodus teaches life for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot burning for burning wound for wound stripe for stripe he laughed again and the prayers say keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips that they speak no guile eschew evil and do good seek peace and ensure it which is what ill do if you help me jennifer ill eschew the evil that possesses you and give you peace if only you could said jennifer verse romans ah said the priest interesting forgotten it the man shook his head let us do evil that good may come so you know your bible jane therefore you must believe or did believe once philippians be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath jane recognized immediately all right accepted dawson so i have a formidable adversary youd better believe it i can outargue you creed for creed ritual for ritual when did you lose your way jane when i lost my fucking life become a catechumen again jane said the priest urgently be my pupil learn to believe again to love again and leave this child whose mind you occupy and whom you want to destroy this child conspired to kill me took part in it then hers will be the punishment on the terrible day of judgement he was sweating his face pinker than usual no way pops id rather do it myself my way the psychiatrists briefing had been total dawson said youve chosen judgement without proof been talking to people havent you will you listen to me until i get bored will you listen to the lawyer whos trying to prove you wrong he wont will you go leave her if he does thats the deal easy one for me to make maybe ill persuade you to leave first then again maybe you wont jennifer could you learn to believe in god love god i dont think so will you go through the services with me pray with me try yes hypocrite though ye believe not me believe the works retorted the man ok pops show us the works i will said dawson sincerely ill make you believe again even if i cant make jennifer nah rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth said the priest quoting again corinthians identified jane as quickly as before i can guide you back lets make it a challenge like it is with jeremy hall it was in the lawyers rooms thirty minutes later that dawson who could find his way around the establishments wine list with the surefootedness of a tightrope walker crossing niagara falls selected the roederer crystal the krug theyve got is too buttery and announced ive found the weakness what demanded mason and hall almost in unison jane believes in god or did very devoutly her father was an episcopalian bishop remembered hall ah exclaimed the man a mystery solved this might not be as difficult as we thought it was going to be you think you can do it demanded the lawyer im more confident now than i was an hour ago which only leaves me to do what i have to do accepted mason dawson nodded and jennifer will be saved chapter thirtyone the well established and practised discretion of the clinic extended to a pool of cars registered to henot house which avoided jeremy hall having to hire one in his own name and risk disclosing their whereabouts he had to identify himself by telephone though to get the meetings he wanted and from the quickness with which people even the police agreed he decided the danger of being publicly recognized was outweighed by the speed with which every door opened to him and he was in a great hurry despite the psychiatrists warning of jennifers dependence upon him hed been confused by the strength of her reaction to his leaving he only bothered to tell her at all at julian masons urging and was glad the psychiatrist was with him when he did she at once came close to tears which he realized for the first time shed rarely done during a lot of the horror shed suffered and needed the handholding assurance repeated several times that he was not abandoning her but would return immediately from talking to people it was imperative he see today tonight shed insisted it should be tonight everythings arranged youre not sure if i dont manage to see everyone ill come back and go again tomorrow dont leave me i told you im not leaving you and where and why im going which you know ive got to hall had been disconcerted but mason had called it valuable think what shes gone through without breaking that showed me just how deep the depression is can you lift her out of it the psychiatrist pulled an uncertain face ive probably got a more difficult job than either you or the priest the incident delayed him but he still arrived in good time for his first appointment uncomfortable in the jacket hed had to buy from the clinic outfitters which didnt stock clothes in his chest size he was unhappy too that michael bailey had decreed somewhere as public as winchester hospital although the nearby railway station car park was convenient to hide the hire car against its number being noted at the hospital and traced to the hertfordshire clinic he walked the intervening distance and grew unhappier at the obvious attention from the suddenly busy corridors with their opendoored offices along which he had to pass to get to the pathology department there was a lot of activity there too it had been wise to abandon the car bailey was a tall gangling man with a stutter which worsened with the intensity with which he leaned forward to get the blocked words out jeremy hall went through the quadrille of thanking the pathologist for seeing him so promptly and being told in return it was in no way inconvenient bailey patted the dossier in front of him and said he had recovered his original statement from the archives at humphrey perrys pretrial request and of course hed followed the sensational events it took longer agreeing the case of jennifer lomax was absolutely incredible earth shattering was the phrase it took the pathologist three attempts to say threatened the very foundations of conventional imagination and even religious belief hall went through the routine recognizing that it was indeed every one and more of those things but that perhaps most incredible of all hed become so closely involved that hed ceased thinking so and was now accepting the totally abnormal as the totally normal he invoked professional confidentiality to avoid talking about jennifer personally supposing this encounter to be a rehearsal for those to follow you want to reopen the inquest anticipated bailey i dont know that would be possible or whether any useful purpose would be served what then it is as you say an astonishing case said hall the lie carefully prepared everything about it has to be compiled and assessed for legal and academic study and that includes any reassessment that might be necessary of what happened in the past i understand assured bailey getting stuck halfway through the word all ive been able to do is compare newspaper reports with written statements its not clear to me how much of those written statements were actually introduced as evidence or how much the coroner took as read from access to the statements beforehand the usual way smiled the pathologist uncertainly he just picked the relevant points to put to me from my statement everything decided in advance hall thought again in your report you refer to aspects of the puncture wounds where mrs lomax injected herself was that finding examined or taken as read actually i discussed it with mr davies before the inquest began admitted the pathologist he felt it would be distressing for mr lomax for us to go too deeply into it at the hearing itself hall swallowed the sigh go through it with me if you would the puncture mark in the left arm was larger than the others on the body and was dangerously close to the vein the other three were much smaller and properly injected subcutaneously what did you think about that the largest puncture mark would have been the last injection she selfadministered by then i believe she would have already overdosed on insulin and additionally have taken one lot of temazepam after another she would have been extremely unsteady the majority of the injections were to the right of the body two to the right arm one in the right thigh thats right you referred to skin hardening because of the length of time mrs lomax had been injecting yes it happens to diabetics particularly those who take soluble insulin which she did in which side of the body was that hardening most prevalent the right or the left into his mind abruptly came a fact that could have greatly contributed to jennifers innocence at the trial if the other evidence hadnt been so overwhelming bailey frowned needing for the first time to go back to the file on his desk it was several moments before he looked up smiling not a great deal in it really but on balance the right what about the left arm what was the extent of the hardening there the pathologist went back to his file although more briefly this time very little the softness of the skin was a contributory factor i decided to the puncture wound being larger than the others something else not in the newspaper reports but mentioned in your statement was how long mrs lomax had been unconscious bailey breathed in sharply and the irritation made it even more difficult for him initially to respond mr davies was furious with the policeman for talking about the bladder collapse that was most unnecessary most distasteful how long repeated hall a considerable time the bladder collapse was an early indication of organ deterioration working back from the time she was found threetwenty in the afternoon according to gerald lomax what time the previous night would she have become deeply unconscious twelve hours at least the evening meal had been steak very little had been digested the blood alcohol content was also extremely high there was no mention whatsoever in any report i read but in your written statement you talked of an abrasion inside mrs lomaxs upper lip bailey nodded something else that didnt need to be brought out to cause mr lomax any further distress in my opinion it resulted from mrs lomax in a very unsteady condition accidently striking her lip between the glass and her teeth when she attempted to drink from the brandy goblet that was found on the bedside table as a medical expert whats your opinion of mrs lomax being prescribed meberevine hydrochloride bailey gave the impression of considering the question as you know a diabetic makes excess glucose some proprietary brands of meberevine hydrochloride have lactose and sucrose added to them i dont think its an ideal preparation for a diabetic but the two by themselves and with the instructions being strictly followed wouldnt be overly dangerous but with an excess of alcohol and insulin it is as i said at the time a lethal cocktail he smiled expectantly but hall didnt respond instead tightly he said thank you and stood up how many deaths crying out for a proper investigation as this had been were dismissed by platitudes quick chats between fellow members of the local golf club and preconceived unsubstantiated opinions bailey frowned but i havent told you anything enough assured hall hall considered recovering the car but decided against it instead taking a taxi from the station the recognition took longer than he expected and was encouragingly disinterested youre the lawyer arent you yes she coming home maybe lots of stuff on television i saw some of it lot of people believe in ghosts you know my doris does so do a lot of other people now suppose youre right considering hall was relieved to get to the oneconstable police house at four marks which was the closest to the lomax mansion he was early but harry elroyd was already waiting in a front parlour with chintz loose covers on the furniture and long ago photographs of the man stiffly upright in army sergeants uniform elroyd sat nervously with a tattered yellowing notebook on his knee with him was paul hughes the police inspector whom hall had confronted over the press intrusion and who had been called before mr justice jarvis a third narrowfaced man very formally offered a card attesting that derek peterson was a solicitor at law protecting the interests of the constabulary declared the man do they need protecting weve no indication of the purpose of this meeting the personal curiosity went far beyond the professional but there wasnt the awe of the hospital and hall was glad he recited the same explanation hed given the pathologist and at once peterson said are you alleging professional negligence or incompetence no i simply want to talk to constable elroyd to understand a few things more clearly whom do you represent asked the solicitor i cant let this proceed unless i am sure you are representing someone mrs jennifer lomax who is the unencumbered heir to the estate of gerald james lomax said hall matching the formality peterson nodded the reluctance obvious mrs elroyd came hesitantly in with coffee and biscuits on a tray she was so intent upon hall that she jarred the tray against the table edge spilling the coffee and hurried out muttering apologies she was a lot fatter now than shed been in the wedding photographs on the sideboard the irritation at the solicitors attitude was fleeting if there were oversights in the investigation into jane lomaxs death and hall was becoming increasingly convinced there had been then this man was responsible was there anything after so long to learn from a portly rubicund country policeman who could probably spot an illegally shot pheasant through thick canvas but miss an inconsistency that might have led to a murder charge did you know mrs lomax before you went to the house that afternoon knew who she was said the man the voice blurred by his local accent she and the mister theyd made themselves well enough known since moving in he looked uncertainly at the senior officer not perhaps as much as the new mrs lomax though i hope shes going to be all right so do we all said hall but lets stay with the first mrs lomax what sort of things did you see her at village show she was high church so she worshipped in alton but she gave a lot of money over to the church roof appeal here in the village even attended services there sometimes so she was well liked oh yes what about the pub pub there is a local pub isnt there did she ever go there no they never did things like that you hear a lot in a village like this a man in your position elroyd smiled proudly keep my ear to the ground eyes open if only thought hall did you ever hear that mrs lomax drank i never did thats what surprised me that day all that drink around not enough to mention it to anyone a senior officer maybe peterson stirred i didnt know she had an illness that she shouldnt protested the man what people do in their own house is their business as long as its not breaking the law isnt it that sounds perfectly satisfactory to me said hughes in quick support it did conceded hall i know what you found in the kitchen and in the bedroom but what about the rest of the house was it tidy or untidy very tidy mrs simpson was the housekeeper then shes a very neat person her cottage is a picture mrs lomax was in her nightdress in bed when you entered the bedroom dr greenaway and the ambulance people were trying to revive her this is all in constable elroyds statement reminded peterson hall ignored the interruption what about the clothes mrs lomax had been wearing before she changed into her nightdress was there any sign of them around the bedroom elroyd shifted uncomfortably squinting down into the ancient book looking up doubtfully he said i havent made a note here of any day clothes would you have done asked the inspector irritatingly ahead of hall i think so sir i was very careful that day i realized how important it was no you didnt thought hall so whats the answer constable there couldnt have been any visible in the bedroom so mrs lomax must have put them away before getting into bed presumably said the policeman even more doubtfully is there any importance in whether or not mrs lomax left her day clothes lying around said peterson again hall ignored the solicitor to elroyd he said what about underclothes the constable visibly blushed ive no note of any sir and you would have done if you had seen any i took a careful note of everything like the sleeping pills the temazepam in the bathroom medicine cabinet yes sir said the constable brightening did you take a note of the chemist who dispensed the sleeping pills he felt a quiver of excitement at something that occurred to him from gerald lomaxs written statement and wondered if he was interpreting it correctly if he were this could be the most vital question of the day it could also be he realized the most damning for jennifer hemels bury street ec read out the man triumphantly and the date of dispensing june thirteenth thank you said hall sincerely that was most helpful and there was the empty wine bottle in the kitchen wastebin you even recorded what wine it was margaux the plump man checked his notes thats right sir margaux he mispronounced it stressing the x apart from the margaux bottle having been put in the bin would you describe the rest of the kitchen as messy only the table there were even food scraps on the table but everything else was in its proper place do you intend trying to reopen the inquest upon some new evidence demanded peterson im not sure there would be sufficient certainly not now that mr lomax is dead said hall i dont even intend seeing the coroner what then is the point of all this hall hesitated im not sure yet whether mrs lomax shared the housekeepers love of tidiness i intend to ask her but i dont understand why mrs lomax would have discarded an empty wine bottle in a wastebin but left the rest of the dinner even food scraps uncleared on the table or why she went to the trouble when she got upstairs still it would seem with a glass of brandy in her hand presumably to hang up her clothes or why some insulin ampoules were properly thrown away in the bathroom where the temazepam was neatly in a medicine cabinet but others on a bedside table from my reading of the inquest evidence mrs lomax was clearly drunk broke in hughes drunken people do inconsistent things which was unarguably true hall cautioned himself he still wasnt sure if there was the remotest chance of his achieving anything with what he was doing insane idea for an insane situation echoed in his head but he had to be careful against turning discrepancies into incontestable facts had you been involved inspector wouldnt those inconsistencies have prompted you to question gerald lomax a little more closely than he was no said hughes at once mr lomax wasnt there how could he have helped us beyond telling us how he found his wife is that all demanded peterson hall was reluctant to be dismissed could imagine the solicitors anditooknononsense dinnertable anecdotes that night but there wasnt anything else about which he wanted to satisfy himself im sure youll help me further if something else comes up that i want clarifying are you going to the house asked hughes hall shook his head i didnt intend to were still having to keep officers there all the time and its not just all the media people whore hanging around for mrs lomax to come back theres a lot of souvenir hunters now the house nameplate has gone and we caught a family three days ago digging up plants to take home and put in their own garden weve charged them the gardener says hes lost some tools what is it you want inspector a private security firm well perform a police function but wed like the general protection taken over by someone else ill arrange it promised hall elspeth simpson lived just two miles along the same road as the village policeman who hadnt exaggerated the womans houseproudness even the garden flowers were in order of colour and in regimented lines and inside everything looked as if it were arranged soon to be packed away for safekeeping the tiny birdlike woman was as neatly packed as her belongings her white hair tightly netted the white collar of her uncreased paisleypatterned dress hard with starch she appeared relieved that hall refused tea but looked anxiously at a man of his size occupying one of her bestroom chairs he did his best not to ruffle the protective loose covers on the arms for the first time that day he discerned no attitude at all towards him elspeth chattered like a bird and he let her eager for the gossip of which he quickly guessed she was the selfappointed village archivist jane lomaxs death had been a tragedy awful poor mr lomax had been very brave theyd been devoted there was a sniff at how quickly he had married again and at jennifers name but it wasnt for her to criticize the second mrs lomax had fitted every bit as well into the village and local life apart from the church although she supported its events and had put money towards the new organ she didnt understand how the murder that awful thing could have happened but thought everything in court had been all wrong no disrespect to you of course sir because ghosts werent natural said without a suggestion of a smile and it wasnt gods way there was only one ghost the holy ghost perhaps it wouldnt have occurred if the second mrs lomax had gone to church not that she was criticizing of course why didnt you stay on as housekeeper to the second mrs lomax george my late he was ill before they got married i had to leave to look after him all the time emphysema mr lomax was very good to me gave me when i left and for the funeral and the second mrs lomax used to call by sometimes to see if i was all right by then alice thats mrs jenkins had been engaged so there wasnt any cause for me to go back you made a statement after the first mrs lomaxs death but you didnt give evidence at the inquest i went but the policeman not harry elroyd the one who organized it all said the coroner didnt want me because i hadnt been there that day why was that it was my day off a friday mr lomax always came home early on a friday so mrs lomax wasnt too long alone because of her diabetes yes and they were devoted like i said lomax must have been a consummate actor you knew she was a diabetic of course thats why i couldnt understand a lot of what was said at the inquest hall breathed deeply what exactly didnt you understand mrs simpson mr lomax saying she was careless with her treatment she never was as far as i was concerned shed always done it you see it was automatic like washing her hands as if in reminder the woman checked her own to ensure they were clean didnt you tell anyone at the time harry elroyd he said i couldnt really know which i suppose was right i mean she never did it in front of me always in the bathroom attached to the bedroom but she always said something when she went to do it she had to do it twice a day you see morning and night said something like what pincushion time thats what she called it none of this was in your statement ive read it i wasnt asked and if you dont ask you dont get thought hall what about something else mr lomax said at the inquest about mrs lomaxs drinking i didnt understand that either the elderly woman chirped at once tell me why encouraged hall id never seen her drink hardly at all there used to be church council meetings at the house did you know she was on the church council no she was and used to let there be meetings at the house midweek on the nights mr lomax was in london there was a pause i thought sometimes she was lonely in that big house all by herself tell me about the meetings i was on the church council myself then mrs lomax was very generous they both were she used to serve drinks before the meeting started all sorts of drinks anything you wanted she always had sherry as if she was joining in but usually id see she never finished it never finish one glass the woman nodded i asked her about it she said it wasnt good for her to drink you used to stay behind on church council nights always george wasnt so bad then but on the other days what time would you come back here five usually certainly in the week when mrs lomax was by herself although i used to stay later when the mister was home and they had people in i thought that was only fair for the way they let me go early other times because of george hall patiently let her finish i dont want to talk about the nights when people were in not even when the church council met after a night when mrs lomax had been by herself and you arrived the following morning did you ever find empty wine bottles like the one harry elroyd discovered after mrs lomax was found in a coma she shook her head not that i can recall her small sharpfeatured face creased into a frown is there something wrong about what happened i mean no said hall quickly its just that everything is so unusual its got to be gone into more thoroughly than usual you understand that of course of course agreed the woman invited into a confidence hall looked around the polishedforapproval room in obvious admiration youve got a very nice house mrs simpson perfectly kept thank you sir you kept mrs lomaxs house like this of course what about mrs lomax i dont understand as far as you were concerned she wasnt careless about her medication did she rely upon you to keep her house like this hall swept his hand admiringly around the room or was she messy never how often did you arrive in the morning to find the remains of a dinner like the one described at the inquest never not even when thered been a party they always brought in caterers so nothing was ever left sometimes things were put away wrongly in the kitchen mrs lomax would tell me about it the following day how shed had to put it in the right place in the right place echoed hall letting his thoughts coalesce did you come into the house on the saturday the day after the tragedy not the day after the same day mr lomax came to the house the night it happened asked me to come in to clear up actually drove me there in his car momentarily hall closed his eyes in despair thar would have been what time just before seven george and i were settling down to listen to the archers on the radio it hadnt started four hours after hed found mrs lomax unconscious and shed been taken to hospital i cant tell you how shocked i was it was terrible the bed was soiled poor love you changed it of course i did said elspeth with a trace of indignation mr lomax didnt intend to sleep there of course he slept in another room what else had to be done to mrs lomaxs bedroom to tidy it up there were things all over the cabinet a syringe and ampoules i knew what they were of course but youd never seen them before not scattered about like that no another idea came abruptly to hall tell me about the bed itself was it a double in which they slept together or two singles the woman pursed her lips as if she was reluctant to disclose an intimacy which he was sure shed never been double which you made every day yes on what side did mrs lomax sleep left or right she frowned left so it would have been with her left hand that she reached out for anything on the bedside cabinet i suppose so what about the clothes mrs lomax had worn it would have been the thursday the day you were there wouldnt it a grey dress with a very faint yellow pattern remembered the housekeeper doesnt sound like it but it was beautiful it was hung up in the closet she always hung her clothes up i told you she liked things neat and tidy almost as much as i do what about underclothes where they always were in the laundry basket in the bathroom put away she frowned thats what you do with dirty underclothes put it away to be washed did you see much of mr lomax when you were back at the house that night he was lost devastated he just wandered about from room to room not knowing what to do how did you see a lot of him if he wandered about from room to room and you were working in two specific places the bedroom and the kitchen the question surprised the woman because he was always where i was i suppose i hadnt thought about it how long were you back at the house not very long there really wasnt much to do but obviously he didnt want to do it himself no more than an hour i suppose mr lomax had taken you there did he drive you home she shook her head he was too upset he got a taxi for me fred knowland works out of alton he was the man mr lomax always called took people to the station at winchester or alton things like that all the way to london sometimes briefly believing he could indulge himself hall tried to imagine what the carnation buttonholed superintendent john bentley the hitherto successful investigator of every murder would have done now elspeth the gossip to whom any verbal silence was torture said it was funny about fred what was said hall he collects cars knows about them hes got an old opentopped bus he restored and hires out for weddings its ever so popular he saw the misters car when he picked me up it was one of those big american ones then and said it was unusual for him to be home so much during the week and that hed seen him arriving the previous night hall looked steadily at the woman the previous night you mean the thursday thats what he said he was working a contract picking up someone from winchester station and hed seen the misters car turning off the m what did you say that he had to be mistaken that the mister had been in london that night like always mrs lomax told me he was going to be before i left and that he never came home on the m anyway he always said the a was quicker and there werent so many cars did you tell anyone this harry elroyd why should i have done it wasnt right because i knew the mister was in london it was daft thats how knowland described it bloody daft had to be didnt it when he responded to elspeth simpsons call the mans recognition was instant the reaction brighteyed greed and hall immediately guessed fred knowland had profited hugely from the press invasion of the area and imagined even greater financial benefit from this encounter the man fat from sitting permanently in a driving seat sparsehaired and quick to smile asked as many questions as he answered and hall didnt doubt he would alert the press posse before hed had time to get back to winchester station elspeth was visibly distressed at having another chair seat dented picking up and moving ornaments and picture frames and then putting them back in their original place it was exactly that a mistake she said more than once trying to hurry things on so she could polish and tidy away their intrusion what car was it hall persisted cadillac de ville said knowland beautiful car had one once sorry i got rid of it what colour mr lomaxs black you must have known the number the systems funny the filter off the m is from a roundabout on to the road to get into winchester i was actually going in the opposite direction on to the roundabout as this car came off i was never in a position to see a number it was dark it was past ten i was going to pick up a contract customer and it was raining i just recognized the shape of the car knew it immediately as mr lomaxs why is it important im clearing up the estate theres some dispute about whether it was a company car or personally owned lied hall improvising no responded knowland answering the question i recognized it as a de ville how many people were in it whats that got to do with whether it was a company car or not mr lomax would have been alone wouldnt he if there were several people it couldnt have been his it was by me in a second but one person i think you must know most of the unusual cars around here driving all the time as you do and having the interest the man smiled not many i dont see so around the time were talking about how many other cadillac de villes were there in the area the smile went none as far as i know thats why i thought at first it had to be mr lomax until i talked to elspeth i think youre right agreed hall ive been wasting my time knowland would obviously lead the media horde to elspeth simpson who was looking visibly confused at his questions about the car it was going to be a confused story far to go asked knowland london i could drive you back drove people around a lot for mr lomax i could tell you a few stories all of which had already been told and retold and embellished hall was sure ive got a return ticket winchester station taxi said knowland showing off his local knowledge and nodding to the retained vehicle outside hed understand if you paid him off its more comfortable by car give you a company rate like i used to give mr lomax no but thanks you got a number i can call you on if anything else occurs to me sure agreed hall at once offering a card with the chambers number knowlands hand snatched out and enclosed it like a lizards tongue capturing an insect will you be down again maybe the mans hand was shaking with excitement as he offered his own card you need a car just give me a ring ill meet you anywhere come to collect you if you like ill remember that said hall accepting it a relieved elspeth hurried them to the door and said she hoped mrs lomax would soon be back in the village and knowland quickly said the same he drove out on to the main road ahead of them risking a barely sufficient gap in front of an approaching lorry to a blast of protest whats she like demanded the driver taking up the earlier conversation as if it had never been interrupted who the ghost theres nothing to see can you talk to her i cant avoided hall unwilling to spend the entire journey under interrogation she talks to mrs lomax shes going to have to be locked up for the rest of her life isnt she in an asylum shell be going abroad soon said hall the font of all false rumours to a special place in the sun i suppose she can afford it with her money agreed the driver miserably they reached the station ahead of any pursuit hall had the fare ready thrusting it into the drivers hand and avoiding the main ticket office cutting into the underground tunnel to reach the londonbound platform the train already there hid him from the main entrance opposite he didnt go on to the platform but to his right out into the car park he drove without direction away from the city not bothering to look at a map until he reached stockbridge and was sure there was no pursuit only then did he begin to review his day trying to get it into perspective the circumstantial evidence begged for a proper investigation that could never be carried out now that gerald lomax was dead but jennifer couldnt have been involved he was sure she couldnt or could she he wondered remembering a particular phrase in gerald lomaxs statement eleven to one one to eleven eleven to one one to eleven incanted mason his voice measured even soporific he held the watch in front of jennifer as he had the first time hed hypnotized her eleven to one one to eleven why not go along with it humour the idiot cant hurt me after all cant make me go anywhere can you hear me jennifer yes and jane yes shes not trying to stop me this time help anyway i can honey do you believe we can get rid of jane no right so youre not going to try any more no point you told me the last time how strong your mind was always better than anyone else not any more right again do you want to die yes do you want to kill yourself yes you havent lost your strong mind jennifer janes there so youre giving your mind over to her letting her have it she already has it not if you dont abandon it to her too tired no youre not you fought in court made jeremy fight you beat jane because you stayed strongminded you can beat her again rid yourself of her but you must stay strong what a load of crap i cant get rid of her ever do you want emily cant have her wont you fight to have her dont listen yes but youre not fighting youre letting jane take over she wants to hurt emily she cant emilys safe nothing can happen to her if jane wants to hurt emily throw jane out dont know how could you believe mr dawson not really jane could believe him couldnt she shut up when jennifer didnt reply the psychiatrist repeated couldnt she dont bother to listen its crap she doesnt want to listen because shes afraid shut up shes getting angry no jennifer shes getting scared mason was excited at the animation that was emerging through the hypnotic trance try with dawson jennifer try as hard as you can its not just that what then jennifer i dont want to talk about it youve got to talk about it if im to help you too awful oh go on shock him was it something that happened in prison mason guessed dont want to talk about it were you attacked in prison sexually horrible she physically shuddered youre not in prison any longer never will be again what happened cant hurt you jeremy wouldnt want me if he knew would he hall didnt try to establish any contact hurrying directly to his rooms at the clinic to telephone humphrey perry before the solicitor left for the day youve got the name hemels bury street therell never be a record after all this time protested perry we wont know until we try to find one and take a photograph of jennifer with you what could it prove anyway we dont know that either anything from america if there had been i would have told you youve got to admit it was an inadequate inquiry all right conceded the solicitor reluctantly falling back on his most frequent complaint he said but youre still clutching at straws and as i keep telling you thats what weve been doing from the beginning hall bumped into the psychiatrist almost immediately outside his door i was coming to see if you were back said mason i was just going to see jennifer i think you should ive been on all the rides said emily lots of times and been in the pool every day what would you like to do now asked annabelle go home to mummy and daddy and go to school with my friends chapter thirtytwo is she there no jennifer knelt in the chapel as dawson told her and bowed her head under the pressure of his hand the chapel smelled heavily of the incense smouldering in the burners despite the softness of the wellpadded hassock her knee hurt where shed cut it i want to speak to you jane declared the priest when there was nothing he said dont be afraid you know you dont have to be afraid of god when there was still no response he began the exorcism ritual with oil and holy water and salt and said hear me oh lord not in the name of this supplicant but in the name of the spirit that possesses her a spirit in need of release and of your succour stop jennifer relayed the word according to the previous arrangement ennui embalmed her pray with me jane i dont want to pray with you you do you want to pray for forgiveness for the sins you have committed to release yourself from the terrible torment of hell im not in torment youre in terrible torment to be saying what you are behaving and threatening as you do not true wont listen dawson sprinkled holy water and intoned and in philippians it says work out your own salvation with fear and trembling the priest hesitated god exacts his vengeance jane not mortals im not mortal she scored im dead killed without the chance of salvation i could save you if youd pray with me give you absolution there was nothing for several moments jennifers knee was throbbing rhythmically like a heartbeat not for what ive done yes jane said the priest almost too urgently the beginning of the apostles creed was too hurried as well i believe in god the father almighty i dont want to hear it the ache wasnt any longer confined to jennifers injured leg it was suffusing her entire body as if she was straining to oppose the man who was conceived by the holy ghost dawson pressed on stop i wont listen as well as pain jennifer felt frightened although strangely not for herself she couldnt wouldnt think it was for jane dawson ignored the interruptions from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead it was a discordant moaning chant a rhythmless noise to drown out any other sound i believe in the holy ghost the holy catholic church the communion of saints the forgiveness of sin the resurrection of the body and the life everlasting the priests face ran with sweat like his hand against jennifers head god can forgive the most terrible sin any sin he hesitated again remembering jeremy halls account of the hampshire visit you know that jane you dont believe in one creed one denomination you believe in god the total love of god no yes pray with me jane our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name the moaning chant started again thy kingdom come thy will be done the closingout sound in jennifers head wavered as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them who trespass against us and lead us not into temptation hut deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory for ever we can do it jane said the priest exultant but physically as close to the exhaustion that jennifer now felt he was crying well pray together worship together and find your way back im frightened confessed jane the voice distant like somebody hiding so quickly and at times so confusingly did events unfold that day that even for someone with a trained lawyers mind it was difficult for jeremy hall to differentiate explicable inconsistency from outright contradiction and before he reached that comparable analysis there was the first telephone call from humphrey perry which began with an apology for questioning the check hall had asked for the previous day its not important dismissed the barrister its what you found that matters and i think it matters a great deal said perry youve got the doctors name demanded hall the moment the solicitor finished telling him ian halliday i can be there you dont need to be stopped perry i spoke to halliday an hour ago harley street naturally what did he say lomax had always been a private patient he was an american remember didnt qualify for national health even if hed wanted it the prescription was filled on the same day as the temazepam and collected by the same person confirmed perry it should have been obvious to me but it wasnt hemels is an independent chemist not part of a chain been there for more than fifty years and they still keep their records on the premises part of their history hall paused curious at the strange hollowness in his stomach who collected it i didnt need the photograph of jennifer it was elizabeth mcintyre and ive got a photostat of her signature from the ledger shes i know who she is said hall as impatient as the other man she was one of the ones never called youre assuming its the basis for janes accusation youve read everything i have did you find another no hall accepted perrys insistence it was impossible for them properly to discuss the latest responses from washington dc from ross hamilton forest ii without having a transcript in front of him he had the solicitor fax it personally to the clinic to prevent its location becoming known throughout the solicitors office that mornings media coverage maintained the hysteria and the pursuit at fever pitch hed succeeded in causing some confusion by the different stories hed given but the consensus was that the death of jane lomax was being reopened as a murder inquiry although the police and the coroner denied it pathologist michael bailey had been traced as well as inspector hughes and pc elroyd everyone was photographed and extensively quoted hall felt sorry for the avalanche that would have engulfed elspeth simpson fred knowland appeared on all five breakfast television channels forests report from america ran to twentyfive a pages including two signed affidavits and took the barrister two hours to digest as fully as he wanted when they spoke again perry who had monitored the media as closely as hall said we probably could get an investigation reopened on the strength of what weve found out id take a bet on a posthumous murder verdict thats not what were trying to prove reminded hall what do you want me to say if theres an official approach from hampshire lets hear what it is first we wouldnt be legally bound to hand our evidence over but i dont see any reason why we shouldnt jennifer wouldnt be involved any more they might try to involve her dont forget the motive of an affair lets wait for an approach you think youre ready as ready as ill ever be you thought what lifes going to be like when its all over no admitted hall honestly sometimes i cant imagine that it ever will be or he mentally added in a thought that surprised him that he particularly wanted it to be he was certainly anxious to get rid of jane but not jennifer dr cox confirmed the priests insistence that jennifer was too exhausted by being janes conduit to face what amounted to a quasitrial and mason deferred to their opinion and also abandoned any analysis that day they used halls room to talk through what he intended and cox said hed wait until tomorrow before deciding whether jennifer would even then be able to stand the strain its an attempt to persuade jane to go after all the doctor reminded unnecessarily the most important thing in her life shell be wound up tighter than a spring i couldnt be more encouraged by how shes responding enthused dawson i know i can exorcize jane if this doesnt work its not important which of us does it as long as its done said hall jane prayed with me said the priest and theres no obscenity not any more i wonder if itll be any different when shes talking to me said hall gerald lomax was quite a bastard wasnt he said cox mason sniggered cynically i think he had more of a multiple personality disorder than some people suspected jennifer of suffering chapter thirtythree that evening they walked together in the grounds the first time jennifer had ventured outside the clinic her first unguarded outing in fact since the murder it was her suggestion seized by the psychiatrist whom she pointedly told she didnt want to come with her just hall just the two of them jennifer held his right hand tightly in her left and reached across herself to clutch at his arm with the other so that he was always close their bodies touching there was still a faint shimmer from the heat of the day encouraging insect clouds encouraging too other patients out into the grounds hall started out carefully to avoid getting recognizably close to anyone before realizing jennifer was being just as cautious always keeping anyone else at a distance he noticed too that in whichever direction they went she always kept the buildings in sight needing their reassuring nearness jane isnt here no reason to think about her then nor talk about her it had been a prompt from julian mason before theyd set out there had been others he felt her shrug beside him do you know what this is what being normal ordinary it was blissful almost as if she was floating she tried to hold the sensation her own special drug blocking out the reality of the unreal he squeezed the hand holding his arm against his body rehearsing what he was going to say not wanting to break her mood with the wrong word its a good feeling id forgotten it she squeezed back were you angry at me when at the beginning when i said i didnt want you that i wanted a qc no that was professional your choice can you always be impartial like that its an essential of the job are you impartial now she looked intently sideways at him he wasnt sure how to answer wasnt sure what she even meant by the question im not going to abandon you leave you by yourself she looked away and walked without speaking for several moments thank you for what you did then at the trial i mean i havent thanked you before have i you havent seen my fee yet he said trying for lightness did you always believe me truth or lie truth mason had dictated no other way blunt truth in fact of course not not at first it was too absurd what did you think was going to happen keep to the truth that the judge would stop the trial order the jury to return a verdict on mental incapacity which would have achieved what you wanted all along yes sneaky bastard she actually laughed the first time hed ever seen her do that the first time since theyd met that shed ever had the slightest cause he supposed and hall came close to faltering i thought it was the best outcome the only outcome and still might be he thought worriedly the television is saying that youre famous now in demand she veered off the path on to the grass to avoid a rapidly approaching tracksuited jogger well see bert feltham hadnt been happy at his continuing to delay a response to the offered briefs the total as of the previous evening stood at twelve they walked unspeaking again in the general direction of a display of oaks bowed and gnarled by age they were there hundreds of years before we were born and theyll be there after we die she said the remark unsettled him he said but in between we have a life and at once regretted the remark do we she turned away from the treeline towards the clinic to have gone around the coppice the other way would have taken the refuge out of sight do you know what i thought on the day it happened before it happened before jane i remember thinking that i was the happiest luckiest most contented woman in the world she snorted an empty laugh can you believe that yes did you believe rebecca in court that he was going to divorce me and take emily away i thought we were trying to forget things just for a moment we cant can we honesty he reminded himself not for very long so whats the answer she was performing wanting the jury to make a comparison she couldnt be challenged still not an answer i cant give you one if id had anything to challenge her with i would have done he followed her lead again accepting they were returning to the clinic he waited for her to lead the conversation too did gerald do it she demanded abruptly gently to warn her might lessen the shock according to the psychiatrist there are a lot of things that dont add up things the police would have investigated if theyd known do you believe i wasnt involved yes can you prove it to her if its based on the remark i think it is yes what if it isnt then at least ill know where to go on looking why is she letting me alone now because of what happened in the chapel he suggested wouldnt it be jennifer began then stopped yes he agreed not needing her to finish jane wasnt there the following morning of all the setbacks and reversals jeremy hall attempted to anticipate accepting as he tried to forearm himself there were too many unknowns possibly to insure against hed never imagined that when he came to argue janes possession with legal objectivity she wouldnt be there to argue back cox had declared jennifer fit for the ordeal and all of them hall dawson and julian mason were startled by the visibly obvious recovery it was not so much physical although her face still free of makeup had for the first time in weeks a glow about it and her freshly washed hair still hung with the flow of expensive if long past attention it was more in jennifers demeanour the apathy had lessened lessened not gone completely to give way to something hall held back from identifying as an eagerness for the confrontation jeremy hall was frightened far more apprehensive than he had been entering the old bailey that first day to argue ghostly possession as a murder defence to a hostile godfearing judge the desperation of the whole idea which had seemed reasonable even logical in those adrenalinexploding first hours of their anythingspossible escape from hospital now seemed preposterously absurd jennifers words the previous night normal ordinary echoed in his mind which hall acknowledged to be his difficulty for two days three because to begin with night had merged into new day and new day into night hed been normal and ordinary a lawyer immersed in the normal and ordinary defence of a client so immersed inconceivable though it now was for him to concede that hed dismissed from conscious thought who that client was and the circumstances and to whom he would be presenting her defence hed lapsed relaxed into becoming ordinarily normal which nothing was or could be he had to step back into the supernatural into the unknown and the unpredictable unable to judge anything by the safe and logically enshrined rules and process of law and now he was being offbalanced before hed started i reached her argued dawson hopefully she prayed renounced evil she didnt come afterwards not at all during the night agreed jennifer just as hopefully eager for omens she was devout before she died accepted hall although less convinced incredibly so but i cant imagine it could have been this easy you hadnt tried god before reminded the priest critically we hardly had the opportunity protested the barrister we were arguing a murder charge what do we do demanded mason delighted at jennifers very obvious mental recovery although secretly disappointed there wouldnt be more to take to its exaggerated limit his participation and the honourawarding thesis that would come from it we wait decided hall for how long asked the priest as long as it takes mason was about to protest the glib nearcliche but stopped at the thought of how it might sound to jennifer instead he said yes we wait which they did every day jennifer attended services in the chapel and underwent analysis sometimes under hypnosis with julian mason who even dangerously invited jane to join them jeremy hall read and reread everything hed assembled actually glad of the opportunity the delay gave him to search for something that incriminated jennifer that he might have missed and found nothing his solitary walks with jennifer in the clinic grounds each evening grew longer the building not needing to be in view any more and afterwards the four of them ate together sometimes joined by cox and jennifer did eat hungrily and the priest boasted his knowledge of the wine list showing off in front of a beautiful woman on the second day hall had bert feltham send him the outlines of the four most urgent briefs simply by posting them care of dr cox he instructed geoffrey johnson to arrange the private security protection for the hampshire mansion he didnt even consider telling jennifer of the problems with emily or of annabelles growing reluctance to continue the role of surrogate mother all five of them were at dinner on the sixth night as usual in jennifers suite it was dawson who ordered the roederer crystal with the promise to pay for it himself declaring a celebration for the complete return of jennifers physical health that had just been announced by dr cox jennifer insisted upon joining in her own toast heres to janes departure i know shes left me i havent said the familiar american voice ive had a lot to think about depression swamped them jennifer was devastated although she didnt fall back into immediate apathy legally it was a recognized ploy acknowledged hall protract a case to unsettle its participants and then spring the surprise of a hearing ive been looking forward to this it was virtually automatic for jennifer to mouth the words as janes puppet so have we said hall im right arent if i was murdered jennifer sat with her head slightly bowed both hands gripping the table edge if jane threw jennifer into a fit shed probably upend the table over all of them hall calculated how they would stage this was something else he hadnt anticipated as they were encircling a table actually made it look like a seance or what he imagined a seance to be like although he thought people were supposed to link hands im not sure i havent heard your argument you first prosecution before defence my rules not yours making me the prosecutor as well as the defender with me as the judge the way it always had to be dawsons head was more bowed than jennifers he had his hands clasped before him and his eyes tightly shut his lips moving in silent prayer julian mason was tensed forward eyes bright with excitement cox appeared frozen transfixed your death wasnt properly investigated conceded hall it was murder there wasnt a proper investigation repeated the barrister reluctant to concede anything do you think youve conducted one better than that carried out at the time so tell them i want everyone to hear it i want my trial not the trial there should have been but for the truth to come out at last jennifer was panting shortbreathed from gabbling janes insistence the words that followed were measured a threat the barrister didnt need to hear and i do hope youve got it right found it all out i shall be very angry if you havent he didnt have any of the carefully listed notes the points enumerated any of the inquest statements or the replies from the american lawyer to the specific queries hed raised everything was back in his own rooms at the far end of the corridor i have to collect some papers what the evidence you need could he risk the courtroom ploy of engendering anger or dont you want to hear and see evidence to prove you wrong careful the real truth or the truth according to jane lomax not interested in hearing any story other than that she wants to believe i told you to be careful not the trial there should have been but for the truth to come out hall quoted throwing janes words back at her hurry be very quick before i lose my patience hall indicated the cluttered table to julian mason as he rose conscious of jennifers pleading eyes upon him he walked normally to his own suite refusing to be panicked it was all prepared waiting for a few moments just seconds he remained there composing himself or delaying he demanded positively he strode out of the room and back along the corridor the table was cleared except for water the dinner debris piled carelessly on to the coffee table by the television the priest still prayed jennifer looked up at his entry imploringly hall poured water first for her then for himself you planning any more delays none are you jennifer looked up at him again shaking her head she doesnt think you can save her we need an undertaking dont we what undertaking if i make the case youll free jennifer pressed the barrister hed left normality and the ordinary behind again he accepted he wished he knew where that put him now make your case it wasnt the commitment hed wanted but it would have to do hall breathed in deeply again readying himself he sipped some water let me make yours instead i think you were murdered hah a gasp came from jennifer too her look towards him now wasnt any longer imploring it was accusing and at the same time bewildered the expression of someone who had been deceived and couldnt understand why almost in fact one of guilt the other three men were regarding him with varying degrees of astonishment hed discussed some but not all of the inquest disparities with them but said nothing about humphrey perrys findings if he was to be the prosecutor jane had to be his witness the realization the full incredible awareness momentarily held him speechless he was about to crossexamine the victim about her own murder he did come home that night didnt he the night before you died he forced himself to ask hey whats this the way it has to be if you want the priest and cox and mason to hear your story hear the truth and the only way youll be able to judge whether i am going to get to the truth or not so gerald came home that night yes after ten about tenthirty were you in bed just going what did he say wed spoken on the phone earlier i told him i had one of my bad headaches i got them sometimes greenaways treatment for the stomach pains could have been contributing gerald said hed driven all the way home to make sure i was all right youd already eaten supper steak and cleared away i dont like leaving a mess but you got something for him hall pushed her water closer to jennifer she ignored it steak there was a lot left over in the refrigerator and wine margaux gerald opened it he liked wine did you sit with him while he ate the commission earnings had been calculated that week he said there was a break he said jennifer stone had come out on top again even though shed been away from the office jennifer began to cry soundlessly tears edging down her face she grabbed for the water at last gulping it you shared the wine while you talked i only had one glass didnt drink all of that the headache had begun to go gerald drank the rest he enjoyed wine drink didnt affect him and he had a brandy afterwards yes did you go to bed straight away i started to clear up put the wine bottle in the bin but he told me hed finish doing it that he wanted to go to bed there was another break it was obvious he wanted to make love jennifer squeezed her eyes shut still crying the other three men were locked on to jennifer speaking for jane coxs mouth hung open so you went up ahead of him put your clothes away like you usually did yes and put your underwear in the laundry basket yes and took some insulin id had problems since dr greenaway prescribed the stomach pills as i told you nausea as well as headaches sometimes i thought there might be a slight imbalance id told gerald downstairs and decided i could correct it it was quite safe after so long i knew exactly what i could and couldnt do how much did you inject twenty units two ampoules each of ten units yes what did you do with the ampoules put them into the disposal basket and then got into bed yes you didnt take the syringe into the bedroom with you and put it on the side table of course not or any ampoules no or a glass of brandy no tell us what happened when you got into bed i shouldnt have drunk what little wine i did the headache came back i told gerald when he came up i didnt want to disappoint him after hed come all the way from london he had to crush every feeling hall decided stick always to the truth according to the psychiatrist disappoint him about making love you mean yes jennifers shoulders were heaving but still she wasnt making any sound she drank again what happened hall drank too he got me something from the bathroom something for the headache yes what was it gerald didnt bring a bottle back just some pills in his hand did he say what they were paracetamol i could safely take that you saw they were paracetamol the headache had got bad again i was keeping my eyes closed against the light although it wasnt very bright so he gave you pills and you took them without looking to see what they were yes what then he said it didnt matter about making love he just held me he got into bed to hold you no not then he sat on the side of the bed not then what about later i dont remember later i went to sleep dont you remember anything about later vaguely that there was something against my face hurting me and a smell of something strong and then of choking was it brandy you smelled i dont drink any spirit never have i told you it was only vague it could have been brandy it must have been from what was said at the inquest hall paused at the next question held this time by the inanity of it telling himself that nothing could be inane you were at your own inquest only cox showed any reaction shaking his head there was no facial reaction i wanted to know but it was all lies i know some of them promised hall youre left handed arent you all the stab wounds to geralds body were from a lefthanded person and jennifer is right handed yes im left handed could you inject with your right hand it wasnt easy did gerald ever inject you i didnt like him doing it i always thought it was a private thing and he didnt like doing it but he could in an emergency id taught him how but he was clumsy it hurt that night you injected yourself in your right thigh yes twice yes not three times that was a lie at the inquest i didnt administer the third the most obvious one what about the even more obvious one the big puncture mark in your left arm no ive never ever injected myself in my left arm i couldnt obviously did gerald do it he must have done i was asleep unconscious hall pushed across in front of jennifer the copies of the american enquiries that humphrey perry had faxed him theres your american medical records and another affidavit from your family doctor up until you moved to england you were never hospitalized for an insulin overdose were you youve never ever overdosed never it was another lie and you never had a drink problem in america how could i have had with diabetes as severe as mine jennifer was slumping lower and lower over the table pressed down again by exhaustion hall was drained too but wouldnt stop there was a momentum he didnt want to lose he was doing more than follow the basic legal precept of never asking a question to which he didnt already know the answer lle was intently listening too gauging his knowledge against janes he was sure he was ahead now he was about to go beyond the established precept to grope out for answers he didnt already know and needed to guess precisely the right questions to ask its all guesswork though isnt it you cant prove gerald killed you its what the police would consider circumstantial more than circumstantial everything at the inquest was lies the police would have investigated if theyd known of course they would agreed hall and i believe they would have found enough for a murder charge like i believe i have so wheres your argument wheres yours to prove jennifer was part of it his mistake what he said in his statement it was too soon for any satisfaction where precisely in his statement about the temazepam which i know now he gave me instead of paracetamol drugged me to make everything else possible read it it says i had it collected not i collected it had it collected by her by jennifer stone he was there thought hall euphorically hed guessed correctly had humphrey perry agree with him and now he had his defence i had it collected hall repeated yet again returning the quote not i had it collected by jennifer stone you dont know who collected it do you had to be her she had the motive the reason you didnt know about the affair with jennifer stone when you were alive did you no you went to bed that night wanting to make love to him thinking he loved you he did always did the denial of the cheated wives isolated hall sadness mingling with the satisfaction jane refusing to admit losing to jennifer and jennifer refusing to admit losing to rebecca how many other lives of other women would gerald lomax have shattered if he hadnt died and you hate jennifer dont you hate her not because you think she had anything to do with your death but because she stole your husband from you yes for the first time there was a discernible emotion the word hissing out in snakelike loathing whos ian halliday demanded hall abruptly there wasnt an immediate answer then geralds doctor never yours i spent most of my time in the country i needed a local doctor halliday never treated you no never prescribed for you no did you ever meet him no hall went to a paper in front of him lifting it this is a signed statement made to humphrey perry eight days ago by doctor ian halliday of harley street london it sets out the history of his medical association with gerald lomax part of it reads two months before the death of his first wife the actual date of the consultation was june gerald lomax i wasnt there jennifers interruption croaked out the sound so strained and unexpected that everyone jumped she gulped from her glass again spilling some water down her chin she didnt bother to wipe it i wasnt there she repeated stronger voice in june of the year jane died in fact throughout may and june and part of july i was on secondment to new york she sniggered disbelievingly it was there that time that i met rebecca isnt that ironic therell be proof i have it promised hall not wanting to lose control he went back to hallidays statement it goes on gerald lomax complained of having difficulty in sleeping blamed the pressure of work and asked for sleeping pills i prescribed temazepam hall slowed unnecessarily building up the moment at the same time he said he was worried about his wife who was a diabetic although not a patient of mine he told me she was extremely careless about her medication sometimes even forgot to bring it with her when she came up to their apartment in london it was impossible to tell whether the sound a whimpering groaning noise was initiated by jane or jennifer hall waited for the sound to become an identifiable word when it didnt he went back to the statement quoting again he said shed done it the previous week and theyd had to cancel everything and go back to hampshire he asked if i could issue a script for emergencies something that he could keep in london if it happened again i gave him a prescription for a months supply of tenunit strength soluble insulin the type he told me his wife used all three men were looking at hall now the awareness registering only mason spoke he said good god and then looked apologetically at the priest he did it i knew he did it i havent finished yet said the barrister determined to maintain the pace jennifer was in new york all that time and you knew it youve told us that gerald said she was away when he talked of her commission the encocorps records which are part of this pile prove it in black and white jennifer stone didnt get back to england until july just two weeks before your death the prescription for the temazepam and the insulin was made up on june by an independent chemist in bury street in the city of london named hemels who still have the dispensing record signed by the person who collected it he slid a photocopy across the table the person who collected it was elizabeth mcintyre gerald lomaxs secretary hall stopped drythroated all the water gone desperately searching his mind for something anything hed overlooked just the final accusation he decided you never thought jennifer conspired in your murder you wanted to kill her because she stole gerald from you thats the truth isnt it jane the truth you didnt want to admit jennifer said shes crying thats the sound in my head crying she didnt go jeremy hall was slouched over the table drained his arms and legs too heavy for his body his head lolling the heaviest weight was the feeling of defeat she didnt swear not once get angry or make jennifer do anything and in the end she cried said mason enumerating points for his own benefit he looked across at the lawyer and you did what you promised youd do but she still didnt go repeated the barrister dawson was the only other man still in the room with them having weaned jennifer completely from drugs during janes absence dr cox had decided that night she needed a tranquillizer and was still in the adjoining bedroom it had needed hall as well as the doctor virtually to carry jennifer away from the table they hadnt been sure whether it was her own or janes tears she was shedding there is nothing more i can do admitted the barrister which only leaves me accepted the priest dear god please help me please help us both chapter thirtyfour your father taught you to love god yes and you do love him dont you i did and you still do jane as always dawson stood with his hand on jennifers head his eyes tightly shut his whole will concentrated upon the woman kneeling before him a woman who would be for ever damned by another if he failed feeling he too would be damned if he failed hed not slept at all hed spent the whole night prostrate outstretched before the altar in prayer pleading for guidance and for a miracle and for jennifer to be released from a living purgatory two hours before hed anointed her with oil and marked the cross upon her in holy water and spread the salt and gone through the exorcism ritual until there were no prayers left to be said as part of it jennifer hadnt slept either and not because jane had filled her mind she hadnt needed to jennifer knew this was the last chance the last hope now she prayed too eyes as fervently shut as the man above her her desperation even greater not caring that jane would know the agony of her fear that she was giving jane a target to attack despite her daily periods with the priest jennifer still couldnt believe although she wanted to told herself she had to and mouthed the litany to the priests dictation and made her own childlike vow if you grant me this one thing i will worship i truly will im frightened god can help you save you noone can help me god can forgive all things all sin why were the words so empty so trite he could not forgive me iii be for ever in purgatory in hell i know the teaching you dont want to cause any more suffering do you no then you must leave this woman i have sinned too much to stay would be the greater sin not enough never enough there had to be more to say a way to convince someone who had once believed as jane had believed i am beyond forgiveness please prayed jennifer make her go away leave me alone im sorry so very sorry i cant believe in you but please make her leave me alone dawson held back from the forgiveness of the lords prayer instead he said her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much saint luke wasnt talking of murder and i wanted to send jennifer mad for taking gerald said id kill the child i cant be forgiven for that none of it i am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance preached the man hands shaking with emotion repent jane truly repent youll descend into hell which you know we all must but then youll rise again into heaven you know thats true the way i will kill myself decided jennifer no other way dont want to live not living a body for someone else destroy the body destroy the horror i have done such terrible things now i am so very very frightened do you love god jane i abandoned him for evil do you want to love him again yes so you want a way back there cant be a way back not for me do you truly repent jane there was no immediate reply finally yes then trust god you know you can you always did in life how better can you show your true repentance than by freeing jennifer to remain is to go on sinning to continue evil and deserve an eternity in the fires of hell there was no response the only sound was their breathing the priests heavy from his effort jane she deserved to suffer for taking gerald dont you think she has ill only ask for gods forgiveness for gods mercy not her its only god we have to ask he could pray for his own forgiveness for that later there was another long silence nothing left thought jennifer no way to stop it die then pills pills wouldnt hurt and she didnt want to be hurt not hurt any more just i repent oh dear merciful lord forgive me a fraying thread of excitement held jennifer and the priest from total collapse cox had worriedly taken both their pulses and dawsons blood pressure he still wore his vestments even his shawl he sat holding it running it through his fingers as he talked which he did haltingly in short bursts with not enough breath for what he wanted to say shes gone hasnt she jennifer definitely gone hed asked the same question a lot since helping her from the chapel a reassurance they all needed jennifer nodded at first shed spoken agreeing but now she just moved her head as if to repeat herself would risk bringing jane cackling back it was god insisted dawson another repetition gods work gods mercy she disappeared before reminded hall cautiously he wanted it to be true as much as any of them was as anxious as any of them for it to be true but couldnt accept it this soon this easily the priest made an angry gesture of denialits over now all over hall found the possibility of that the most difficult of all to believe it was too quick too sudden but how else could it have been exorcise meant to cut out to remove evil which was what the priest was insisting had happened there was no process apart from the service no prolonged treatment and after that a period of recuperation or wouldnt there be not the recuperation after an illness although what jennifer had suffered was as bad as the worst imaginable illness an adjustment then a time who knew how much time to become normal ordinary would it be possible for jennifer ever again to become normal and ordinary for the rest of them perhaps for dawson it was a religious miracle that proved the power of god and would sustain him for the rest of his life for charles cox and julian mason it was the most incredible clinical experience of their lives mason would become world famous from his thesis and hall supposed he would in time accommodate the curiosity and notoriety but how could life ever again become normal and ordinary for a woman whod been possessed physically occupied even by the spirit of someone else and been used as a vehicle for murder perhaps this was where the prolonged treatment began the counselling and the guidance not over at all in fact for julian mason and jennifer but over for him if jane had definitely gone at once came the objective balance over for him even if jane hadnt gone there was nothing more he could do there were still some things to tidy up perhaps two or three weeks work maybe a month and after that after that what his difficulty he at last realized wasnt that it was all over it was at the thought that after that time after a month at most he wouldnt be seeing jennifer again have any reason to see jennifer again too soon to think like that despite the conviction of the priest and of jennifer none of them yet knew were convinced beyond doubt that jane had gone and there was still a lot to do if she had hed let things take their own course at their own pace there wasnt any hurry he smiled across at jennifer at the thought and she smiled hesitantly back its so wonderful she said faintvoiced im so she shook her head unable to finish too tired for the words to form we all want it to have happened warned the psychiatrist joining halls caution but we dont know for sure not yet what do we have to do now frowned cox what wed already decided said mason we go on waiting chapter thirtyfive which they did nervously with jennifer in those early days the most nervous of all the convinced priest the least jennifer very much needed his conviction to sustain her own hope after the immediate elation of the exorcism but as those days passed it became easier for her the confidence growing imperceptible layer by imperceptible layer she kept her vow and maintained her religious instruction under dawson eager to pray although unsure to whom for the freedom to be permanent she continued her treatment under julian mason too surer that shed come through the horrific mental ordeal with her sanity intact but realistically accepting she needed that agreed and confirmed by a trained psychiatrist a mind doctor just as much as she needed to be guaranteed physically to have recovered by charles cox least perceptible of all was the gradual preparation each provided unconsciously at first and each in their own specialized way to equip jennifer for her return to the closest shed ever come to life among ordinary people who would never consider her anything but abnormal apparently free of jane or not mason identified jennifers unprompted acceptance that she needed him as one of the most important indicators of her mental health she has come through it he told jeremy hall she could still be damaged wrecked even if jane comes back thats the key which its always been but basically shes as solid as a rock what were seeing what im seeing is the determination always to win to be the best that wed heard about but never properly been able to see until now isnt that a pretty quick prognosis queried hall what are you talking about demanded the psychiatrist ive been with her night and day for weeks remember shes been my only patient and she never had a mental problem she had jane inside her head trying to give her one and it didnt work what about thinking of killing herself thinking of doing it is very different from actually doing it wouldnt you have considered suicide if youd been the victim wanting to make his practical contribution to jennifers rehabilitation secretly disconcerted that he wasnt doing as much as the other three men hall said theres been quite a few things left in limbo is it too soon to involve her in making decisions it cant be soon enough one thing thats got to be restored is her total confidence the arrogance if you like that she had before people become confident making decisions for themselves its about confidence that im concerned i need to go back to london get a lot of things on course we talked about it last night out walking she asked me not to go got upset at the thought mason nodded that dependency is something weve got to deal with so do i just go it was a clinical question his only concern to do nothing to cause jennifer any setback he still couldnt imagine everything coming to an end that there was a finite point and that it was fast approaching no decided mason shes making giant strides but at her speed not ours shes still in a cocoon here shes got to be eased off her dependency upon you and me and upon mr dawson not have anything snatched away what needs to be settled is still largely about her how about bringing people here involving her that way good nodded mason a very good idea jennifer thought it was too guided by the psychiatrist hall gave her two days warning and hopefully briefed everyone else just as thoroughly against anything she wasnt prepared for bert feltham was to be the only stranger and jennifer said she was quite happy with his inclusion too my first singleminded contact with someone from the outside world she said mason was as pleased with the joke against herself as he was with everything else jennifer was doing and saying but not as pleased as jennifer she felt alive vibrant a sensation she could scarcely remember it was going to be all right everything all right best of all most of all with her and emily jennifer abruptly stopped the reflection refusing it the chambers chief clerk unaccustomably subdued in dark grey arrived with humphrey perry well briefed perhaps too well briefed was halls initial thought by the solicitor feltham tried overly hard to behave as if there had been nothing whatsoever unusual about jennifer but couldnt quite carry it off at the moment of introduction offering and then withdrawing his hand jennifer laughed openly at the man and said i dont bite any more and i no longer have an alter ego that does it either geoffrey johnson got to the clinic fifteen minutes later burdened by briefcases and files inevitably the plump family lawyer was smoking one of his carvedbowled pipes he paused by the bentley to knock out the dottle before coming into the clinic although she had already agreed hall again queried felthams presence at the meeting and again jennifer insisted she had no objection lets get as much done as soon as we can there must be a lot to catch up with things to do said jennifer eagerly back in control of herself she thought in control in charge of everything concerning her jennifer lomax was jennifer lomax again what she wanted what she decided these men would do follow her instructions and her wishes from today shed go forward pick up the pieces rebuild a life shouldnt be frightened to be by herself julian mason had told her at their last session the previous day more than strong enough to cope and she was she was sure she was jane had gone wasnt coming back ever thats what dawson said the man she had to believe because hed driven jane away and god god too it was still easier to believe the priest so there was a lot to do there was the rest of her life her life and emilys life to work out make safe and secure and never endanger again she hadnt talked about emily to peter yet hadnt talked to anyone not even dawson or jeremy had to soon the big decision the biggest talk about it and then plan the reunion not reunion pompous word mothers didnt have reunions with baby daughters the meeting then plan the meeting but not yet not today formalities was how jeremy had described the purpose of this gathering settling the formalities she looked expectantly at the barrister who took the cue hall said a lot of today is going to be taken up with money this isnt the way this is normally done certainly not between barrister and client so its going to be an exception to the rule encouraged by jennifers selfmockery he said but then everything has been an exception to every rule he looked to the family solicitor which sets the stage for you geoffrey johnson cleared his throat a smokers cough as he unloaded his briefcases hall was glad hed had a larger conference table moved into his suite johnson said to jennifer with your power of attorney ive had to expend rather a lot of money im anxious you should see the accounting and approve it he smiled briefly its not an essential decision today providing youre satisfied with my discharge of my duties but you also might like to decide whether you wish me to continue with power of attorney now that youre the man stumbled to a halt now that janes gone finished jennifer helpfully im very glad youre better said johnson still awkwardly you and me both geoffrey you and me both said jennifer with bright glibness she was actually enjoying herself amused at the apprehension everyone apart from jeremy was finding it so difficult to hide she was seized by the urge suddenly to say boo to see what theyd do the solicitor burrowed protectively into his bank of paper isolating separate sheets like a bombardier laying out his ammunition the financial outlay had necessarily been extremely high johnson warned firing his first salvo the regents park apartment had sold within days of being put on the market for its full asking price instead of stating the price the man slid the first of his prepared papers across to jennifer but completion had only just been concluded until five days earlier the estate had been responsible as it was for the hampshire mansion the running of which cost considerably more another account sheet followed the first across the table towards jennifer against that maintainence had also been put the cost of removing emily and annabelle by helicopter and their accommodation since here johnson hesitated looking to hall who shook his head unsure if jennifer saw the gesture shed been gazing down at the figures also included were the costs of the private security firm now necessary to protect the hampshire house and all the costs being incurred at the clinic more invoices slid across the table and then there are very considerable legal expenses said johnson and why mr feltham is here those expenses have officially to be submitted to my firm of which mr perry is a partner and which in turn represents mr hall i cant obviously approve payment from your estate to a firm of which i am also a partner it constitutes a conflict of interest it is necessary for you personally to authorize that as if rehearsed feltham pushed the account sideways to johnson who passed it unread directly to jennifer she sniggered and said surely its not too heavy to pick up she lifted it looking at the amount but then again hall was embarrassed and thought the other three men were as well seems to me like everything adds up to around said jennifer furthering all their discomfort and knowing it you guys do even better than i as a trader and i thought i was good there is no difficulty said johnson hurriedly you are extremely well provided for geoffrey youre tying yourself in knots trying to be discrete interrupted jennifer why dont we talk figures make it easier for you i dont give a shit she looked quickly at hall that was me swearing not jane hall grinned back at her very much liking a jennifer lomax he hadnt known before johnson pushed doggedly on the legal fees have not yet been put against any account they will be more than covered from the sale of the london apartment there was no outstanding mortgage and the sale price was there is a swiss deposit account in yen amounting to i transferred from deposit to current here so all the other bills have been settled as of today that still leaves you with in your joint current account with on deposit your personal account which i have not touched is in credit for there are share portfolios which on yesterdays stock market quotations amount to and there are company and private insurance policies totalling i have applied both to the private companies and to encocorps for the discharge of those policies in your favour your late husbands will still has to be admitted to probate but there is a trust fund in emilys name with yourself and myself as trustees it becomes operable when emily reaches the age of eighteen he straggled to a halt those are the main items which i want immediately to bring to your attention at least im financially secure agreed jennifer hall wondered if anyone else noticed the suggestion of uncertainty in jennifers voice at the remark and wished he hadnt johnson had covered everything they had discussed by telephone under general headings although the solicitor had not itemised the financial outlay until that day hall said i dont think its anything that needs an instant decision but there are a lot of offers outstanding that legally we should put to you offers frowned jennifer for books original screenplays magazine and newspaper serialization listed perry weve had twenty the highest from an american publisher is for weve had five in chambers in the last two days that i havent yet passed on said feltham and ive heard two british publishers are bringing out books of the trial jennifer laughed nervously what do they want he should have given her better warning decided hall what it was like for you he said lamely it was horrific for me which is what people want to know about suggested perry thats thats ghoulish voyeurism she stopped blinking rapidly its what jane said shed do that shed make me into a freak damn damn damn thought hall its nothing we need to talk further about not now like i said just something we had to tell you about as your legal agents i dont know i dont think said jennifer haltingly her attitude in the beginning something close to ebullience was slipping away thats all people wanted to do look at her and laugh at her like people used to go on family outings to laugh at the unfortunates in victorian mental asylums well leave it determined hall positively it had been his mistake and he was angry at himself he wanted to finish it all quickly now to try to recover he looked briskly around the room theres nothing else is there yes said johnson back among his papers and missing the look that hall gave him the bank quite rightly have raised a query about your personal account mrs lomax he smiled up having found what he wanted attached to the letter were a number of cheques these in all total all from the dates while you were in prison obviously you had difficulty in writing because of your injuries but four are quite obviously forgeries the bank have refused to pay out on them whos beryl harrison no no no i dont want it taken any further its a police began johnson but jennifer talked over him only if i choose to make a complaint which i dont i dont want any more discussion about it its ended had to get away get away and hide the men in the room sat regarding her in varying degrees of surprise at an attitude that had run the gamut from recovered confidence through brief uncertainty to seemingly forceful angry authority jennifer shuffled through the papers finding the legal invoices she extended her hand towards johnson and said peremptorily give me a pen please let me sign a cheque for this everything will be paid up to date then right right agreed johnson chastened but not knowing why jennifer quickly scrawled her signature beginning to stand as she finished thank you all for coming and for everything each and every one of you have done for me i greatly and very sincerely appreciate it now you must excuse me i have another appointment quickly while she could still hang on none of them were fully to their feet before she swept out of the room what the hell exclaimed perry we tried to cover too much said hall he knew jennifer did have an appointment another instruction session with dawson but that it wasnt for another two hours but we achieved a lot very satisfactorily said feltham picking up and looking at the cheque that jennifer had signed in full settlement of the legal fees to date he went directly to the barrister i charged you at an hour mr hall with refreshers of course thats what im quoting from now on with no assurance that well accept the brief he smiled sideways at perry you might keep that in mind humphrey he came back to hall as of today youre officially finished here sir although of course i dont know what your personal plans are but i thought i might as well bring some work down for you to consider a hospital negligence on behalf of a child damaged by oxygen deprivation insurance company need their wrists slapped heroin possession by the youngest son of an earl says it was planted on him because his elder brothers a registered addict dodgy but i think it could be true thereve been two police complaint investigations in the division in the past three years for stitching people up and a grievous bodily harm black kid says he was defending himself against a racist gang four against one and he gets charged back to normality thought hall i hope to be in the office in a few days ill look at them before then let you know itll be good to see you there sir whats it like the siege i mean still pretty bad said feltham and i suppose itll get worse when the word gets around that youre back surprised you got away so easily when you went to hampshire so was i admitted hall i didnt need the reminder frown not to mention emily complained johnson where is she johnson shrugged theyve gone to disney in paris and shes wetting the bed all the time now annabelle is genuinely worried have you told annabelle whats happened here she said shes glad its all over she thinks it would be best for emily if they went back to hampshire after france that living under a security screen would be better for the child than wandering about from theme park to theme park any more talk of her quitting at least thats stopped said johnson but solicitors for the metropolitan police have offered a compromise over their policing claim for the hospital theyre suggesting an independent assessment by a fee draughtsman rubbish rejected hall thats presupposing an acceptance of responsibility on our part which there isnt draughtsmen dont come into it someones playing with legal words they dont understand tell them we dont consider theres anything to negotiate its going to seem strange getting back to other work mused perry im sure you can hardly wait its certainly going to feel different conceded hall it might have been a lot at one session conceded julian mason its not a setback you dont seem surprised challenged hall curiously maybe im not so you know what its about i think i probably do and i can probably guess jennifer said it was closed didnt she something like that are you going to tell me of course not and you should know better even to think i would im concerned for her thats all want to guard against a repeat of what happened today you can do that by forgetting about it she was upset by the idea of a book too i can understand that as an initial reaction but i think it could be thought about more fully it would make her into the freak jane threatened what shes terrified of come on said the psychiatrist brutally shes always going to be that its something shes going to have to learn to live with and dont ask me how because i havent got a clue have you told her that yet she doesnt have to be told but she wont admit it thats why it might help to write about it how if she committed herself to one publisher or one outlet whatever the others might eventually go away but more important than anything the very act of writing about it would be a catharsis actually benefit her you mean probably more than im going to be able to should i talk to her about it its all part of encouraging her back into the real world isnt it the real world she hasnt been in for a long time the psychiatrist looked very directly at the other man but jennifer is always going to be a freak i ran away she wasnt telling him anything he didnt already know she didnt want to tell him the reason risk everything your choice said hall she wished he hadnt sounded so disinterested you sound like julian have you discussed it with him always honesty he remembered yes what did he say he didnt tell me why obviously just that it was a matter for you it was their evening walk to the outer perimeter now although she was still careful to avoid close contact with anyone else hall didnt think jennifer being there was a secret any more obviously not among the staff and was glad that julian masons assurance about money buying silence had proved true the danger then had always been other patients i dont want to tell you then dont i still shouldnt have run i panicked she felt so safe on these walks enjoyed the warmth of his hand feeling his closeness it was your first time in a group like that it wouldnt have happened once she hoped she wasnt sounding selfpitying youve got to learn again they walked on in silence jennifer said could you help me learn im not sure that would be helping you the silence lasted longer this time he broke it would a book be such a bad idea i wouldnt know how to begin she protested you dont have to study or pass exams to do it do you thered be editors people like that to shape it for you youd probably get a lot of guidance before you even got started it would be like letting people stare at me he searched for the right reply or stop them doing it i know thats going to be a problem she admitted you dont thought hall you havent any conception i think you should think about it quite seriously i hardly need the money im not thinking about the money it would get the whole thing out of your memory i dont imagine anything could ever do that jennifer said soberly i wasnt talking about forgetting i was talking about adjusting thats something else i know ive got to learn how to adjust it was time he himself adjusted hall decided past time so he had to stop putting it off chapter thirtysix his going burst her bubble noone knew of course not even julian mason with whom she had always been totally open and honest she supposed being one hundred per cent better which was what mason and cox with dawson smiling beside them had just declared her to be meant she could successfully lie now without anyone guessing like dawson hadnt guessed about her conversion that wasnt so much an outright lie any more than her not telling the psychiatrist the aching loss the feeling that something had literally burst she felt at jeremy leaving it was more retaining some privacy which everyone did in fact she was probably more honest than most people always had been she did believe in something because when everything else had failed shed been set free by a miracle with a priests hand on her head so there had to be some higher authority some supreme being and if dawson represented it then it was to his god she had to be eternally grateful so she would be it was the most sincere promise shed ever made and shed keep it shed probably need to there was a huge difference between talking to dawson and julian mason but talking was the operative word jeremys departure had signalled the beginning of the end now mason and cox had told her there was nothing more they could do so their contact was virtually over as well so she needed the church as much maybe even more than people who insisted they didnt have the doubts which wasnt badly dishonest either more a compromise which again everybody did about a lot of things religion most of all the important thing was keeping her promise she wished it was as easy to rationalize her feelings towards jeremy hall julian had done his best to prepare her not about jeremy alone but about all of them himself and dawson and dr cox and shed recognized at once that her dependence upon them had to be broken but it wasnt the same with jeremy it wasnt dependence what then it couldnt be love that was ludicrous their closetogether walks had been kindness nothing more just his helping her get better and she didnt think love any sort of relationship had a place in her life any more she was still unsure what did apart from emily and that remained the biggest stillavoided uncertainty of all she wasnt sure either whether his daily telephone calls werent adding to whatever it was that was troubling her they werent specifically to her she reminded herself he always spoke to the two doctors sometimes even the priest and there was always a practical reason for their conversations shed needed to confirm she still wanted geoffrey johnson to retain her power of attorney for instance and it had seemed important for him to tell her the metropolitan authority had dropped their claim for the cost of policing st thomass hospital and to remind her she still hadnt made a decision about the media and publishing offers did her uncertainty the prickedbubble feeling really have so much to do with jeremy hall or was she transferring on to him lying to herself the true reason for it wasnt it quite simply the terror of going back into the outside world of being alone with noone to rely on none of them mason or cox or dawson would have made the decision if they hadnt been totally convinced individually and collectively that she was ready for it it was jennifer herself who wasnt convinced so she had to convince herself about her readiness as she had to convince herself about a god there was no cause to be ashamed embarrassed by how she felt nor try unnecessarily unfairly to involve jeremy it wasnt even the unknown terror of what awaited her jennifer was terrified about only one person she was going to meet and from whom because of what mason had just told her she no longer had to be parted jennifer jumped at the telephone momentarily hesitating before picking it up ive already spoken to julian announced hall excited frightened id be surprised if you werent i can leave whenever i want stop avoiding it she told herself i know there was a long pause jennifer i can go back with emily be her mother again the words sounded odd artificial yes where is she hampshire she arrived back last week from paris is it safe for her to be there were employing a lot more security people annabelle thinks its best does she know im better ive only just heard myself its going to take me a day or two to get ready is it hall asked pointedly emily will have to get used to the idea as well as me just a day or two ill probably need that to set things up jennifer felt a jump of excitement through the apprehension youre going to fix things for me would you like me to yes please she said hurriedly and come with you yes id like that very much welcome back he said yes she said doubtfully jeremy hall had discerned her mood and understood it with more practical cause to be apprehensive than jennifer could yet imagine the circus had begun again the very moment hed arrived back at his neglected mailboxoverflowing apartment a media ambush still awaited him and he literally ran the envelope gauntlet there were more letters inside there were also two from his bank which coincidentally he opened in the right order in the first the manager assured him he had no cause whatsoever to worry at being overdrawn because the man fully understood the preoccupying circumstances and cordially invited him to lunch the second thanked him for the cash infusion so substantial that the lunch would be a good opportunity to discuss investments the tape on his answering machine was exhausted with messages some from people he hadnt heard of since university others from girls claiming to have met him at functions and parties he couldnt remembering attending there were three calls from patricia boxall the chambers were besieged the following morning and one by one the forgotten luncheon invitations from proudfoots celebration party were pressed upon him during the morning experimentally he accepted sir richards they had to force their way out of the building and led a pursuing road race to pall mall he was asked three times for his autograph in the reform club which proudfoot insisted hed never known before and promised to complain to the membership committee when he returned to chambers hall had his home telephone number changed and made exdirectory he took all three briefs bert feltham had offered at the clinic a police line had to be formed to get him into court to defend the earls son on the heroin charge which he won in a single days sitting which ended with the case being dismissed and the magistrate referring the evidence of a drug squad officer to the metropolitan police commissioner with a suggested internal enquiry the hospital insurers had doubled their original outofcourt settlement offer which hall considered satisfactory but the parents of the child urged him to take it to court its not as if you can lose is it mr hall said the father who wouldnt be persuaded otherwise his rowing club had been discovered in his absence and he was followed there the first saturday anyway he was hopelessly out of condition and the pursuing press launches created waves and wash that engulfed him he watched himself on television that night paddling waist deep and waterlogged back to the pontoon glad the cameras unmistakably caught him calling the photographers bastards and telling them to fuck off and he missed jennifer he told himself in the beginning that it was unavoidable his having been thrust into such close proximity with her for so long and for such a reason but gradually he changed his mind it wasnt the situation he missed it was jennifer herself he felt responsible for her worried about her he appreciated the guidance he got during his daily calls to mason and cox and even the priest calls he always routed through them so there would apparently be a reason for his later speaking to her but he wasnt entirely satisfied jennifer was yet ready to leave the safety of the clinic which today theyd insisted she was so the final moment had come and hed consciously intentionally intruded himself into it right that he should seeing a case through to its proper conclusion earning the exorbitant fee demanded by bert feltham he had geoffrey johnson alert the security company greatly to increase the manpower at the mansion and ordered the helicopter to fly her from the clinic directly into the grounds of her home he telephoned annabelle several times after she got back from paris with emily initially disappointed but then accepting the nannys subdued reaction shes been medically and psychiatrically declared totally recovered he insisted it cant be a moment too soon for emily have you told her of course i have she needs as much preparation as mrs lomax more maybe hall wasnt interested in debating the greater need hows she reacting to all the security ive tried to make it into a game told her they are her soldiers and a lot of them are nice enough to go along with it its not brilliant but its the best i could think of im running out of things to think of is she excited there was a pause before annabelle responded she says she doesnt want her mummy to be nasty again hall briefly considered driving to hertfordshire to fly down with jennifer but decided against it for the sake of the clinic it would have been poor recompense for the way theyd protected jennifers anonymity to lead the media of the world to whoever else was seeking privacy it was a wise decision by the time he came off the m towards alton ironically following he realized the same route gerald lomax had taken on the night hed murdered jane he headed a line of at least fifteen identifiable press and television vehicles most during the journey pulled out of the convoy to draw level to photograph and attempt to talk to him through their open window worryingly by the time he did turn off there were two helicopters fluttering overhead he was glad hed had the forethought personally to speak to inspector hughes before setting out that morning the scene outside the mansion was reminiscent of the roadblocked approach to st thomass hospital it required a police range rover front and back and walking policemen either side for him to cover the last hundred yards to the mansion entrance and a squad of security men had to come out to complete the wedge in the middle of which he was finally able to get inside annabelle was waiting for him at the entrance emily was beside her curly hair loose in jeans and mickey mouse sweater a forlorn attempt by annabelle to make it seem an ordinary day the child held annabelles hand and stood with one foot awkwardly on top of the other twisting precariously listen demanded annabelle as he got out of the car there was an audible roaring hum from the road like bees or maybe even the distant sound of approaching hooves it was worsened by the hovering helicopters and the roads more than a mile away completed the girl like the zoo suggested emily with childlike prescience you were at the hospital with my mummy yes shes coming home shes better i know i dont know about daddy do you no maybe hell come too maybe he looked helplessly at annabelle who looked expressionlessly back offering no help theres another one said the child pointing up ive been in a helicopter she pronounced it elcopter it fluttered down far enough away for them not to be buffeted by the downdraught but it didnt save its passengers from that of the pursuing media machine they came in low and their cameramen had ample time to picture jennifer who was hurried towards the house by colin dawson by the time they reached it annabelle had already carried the suddenly frightened emily inside away from the noise and the artificial gale every effort jennifer had made for the homecoming was totally wrecked her dress and jacket were in disarray her hair churned into a birdsnest and her nose as well as her eye was running from the dust that had blown in streaking her makeup before she could even speak the priest had to pick out a piece of grit with a handkerchief tip it did mean though that jennifer had the perfect excuse for the real tears that started the moment she was able properly to look at emily hello darling jennifer said mummys home but not daddy said emily no said jennifer not daddy it was the unexpected presence of the wealthy priest perfectly accustomed to such opulence and sincerely believing himself chosen to be gods vehicle for miracle who saved the situation noone else knew what to do or say emily had instinctively started back when jennifer moved as if to kiss and hug her so shed stopped and annabelle ran out of words after saying it was nice to see jennifer back hall couldnt think of any contribution at all so dawson sipped the earl grey and ate the triangle sandwiches served by alice jenkins as if afternoon tea there was a regular ritual and talked to emily who seemed to welcome the relief as much as the rest of them playing up to it even does your collar hurt like that no daddy doesnt have a shirt like that this is because i am a priest whats that mean i work for god not for my daddy no do you know god she demanded seemingly genuinely curious yes does he really have a beard hes got a beard in the picture on miss singletons wall shes my teacher g stands for god the pictures of his son do you know him too i know of him but you havent met him not like im meeting you now youre very clever to know what g stands for ventured jennifer as the tension eased i know all my letters now annabelle taught me while we were away weve been away while youve been ill i saw mickey mouse she plucked at her sweater to dawson she said seriously hes real you know no i didnt said the priest he is i met him and goofy and pluto and minnie i met them all she looked back to jennifer but im glad im home now im glad too said jennifer hopefully and im glad most of all to be home with you are you glad that im home hall saw the fleeting frown cross annabelles face emily remained serious for what seemed a very long time finally she said i think so but i wish daddy was here too jennifers face began to crumple more but she managed to stop it ive missed you she blurted emily didnt say anything its getting late darling said jennifer while everyone else is having their tea here why dont we go and have ours in the kitchen and after that i can give you your bath and then read you a story and you can show me all the letters you know on the page emily looked between her mother and the nanny i want annabelle to give me my tea and bath and read to me but with mummy as well said annabelle all right agreed the child uncertainly the excuse of grit in her eye had almost gone by the time jennifer asked hall and the priest to stay as she followed annabelle and emily out of the room hall said not at all what she expected i wouldnt think she said shed tried not to imagine anything itll take some getting over suggested hall hardly with her resilience said the priest it could have been better but only just theyve got a lot of catching up to do are you here to help queried hall dawsons shoulders lifted and fell she asked me to come with her at the last minute said she wanted moral support he smiled ive never been in a helicopter before easier than getting here by road we saw what it was like when we came in incredible i think i might get a lift back with you come back and get the car later purely for the immediate convenience he told himself it was ridiculous even to think of trying to drive through that melee again dawson made another vague gesture through the lounge window in the direction of the distant road inside it wasnt possible to hear the animal roar theyre not going to be able to live like this noone could not for long hall was still trying to think of a reply when jennifer came back into the room she didnt try to hide the fresh tears she was frightened of me being too close to her in the bathroom so i came away she paused i saw what i looked like in the bathroom mirrors a mad woman none of them wanted to eat hall and the priest drank whisky jennifer didnt drink anything and neither did annabelle when she came down to say emily had gone to sleep they were all too anxious to reassure jennifer it was always going to be difficult at the very beginning each insisted again too eagerly that it had in fact gone far better than theyd anticipated none of it helped jennifer agreed at once to hall leaving in the clinics helicopter and said theres something we could discuss in detail when you come back for your car although i might as well tell you now what ive decided to write the book and i want you to negotiate the contracts for me im not a literary agent hall protested weakly literary agents arrange deals were having deals shovelled at us i need a lawyer to pick the best and negotiate the best she smiled through the sadness and you jeremy hall are the very best lawyer ive ever met in my life and by acting for me she thought youre staying in my life jeremy hall was thinking the same id be pleased to he said chapter thirtyseven jeremy hall didnt collect the car on his first return nor on the second and when he tried on the third the battery was flat and it had to be jumpstarted from the gardeners landrover he learned to enjoy helicopter travel and tolerate the unremitting curiosity and media hounding unthinkingly on his part the routine became his spending the week in london before coming down to hampshire on a friday although there were telephone calls in between it was emily who said it was what her father did briefly creating an awkwardness that jennifer handled better than hall did by then the relationship between jennifer and emily had almost completely reverted to what it had been before emily stopped bedwetting the second week and by the fourth she had practically lost any attentionseeking precocity it was during the fourth week the week when hall finally persuaded the parents of the braindamaged boy to accept the hospital insurers newly increased outofcourt offer that jennifer suggested he stay for the weekend instead of flying back the same day which was what hed always done until then i might need support she said and ive started to write it id like you to see what ive done so far jennifer recognized the risk on several levels and was nervous of each nervous one would collapse and destroy the still secret hope of the others and still wasnt sure if she would positively force the issue although she wanted to wasnt sure even if she was correctly reading the signs because thered scarcely been any he always came laden with papers and faxes and letters from publishers and newspapers and they always spent part of his visit sometimes the majority comparing the advantages of one contract against another but she didnt think hed needed personally to come so often unless hed wanted to her satisfaction that he did went beyond the unspoken hopes she had figures and percentages and subsidiary profits to think about and calculate and it was like a door opening on to a dusty room in her mind although the dust quickly blew away she was far better at the financial assessments than hall who said so openly when theyd pared the approaches down to a final three you dont really need me he complained were not negotiating yet were necessary together as a team said jennifer intentionally ambiguous lets see said hall which didnt help her it was the fourth full weekend visit as usual he came heavy with briefcases although by then they both knew the figures from the three favoured publishers all american ive been thinking about that she announced consciously boasting her financial acumen because she wanted him to be impressed these three are all for world rights one upfront payment the highest at the moment each contract gives them the right to sell individually to other countries but weve got offers of from england and from japan and approaches from all those other countries in europe which the americans will pick up if we sell outright theyre not spending anything theyre into profit before they start why dont we sell just the american rights to the americans and negotiate ourselves and separately with each of the other countries that way we make the profit emily had long since been put to bed and annabelle was in her separate annexe theyd eaten dinner duck in the kitchen and carried the remainder of the wine through into the lounge hed shaken his head against brandy uncomfortably aware of the similarity with the night of jane lomaxs death jennifer didnt appear aware of it he smiled at her and said i didnt think you needed the money i dont she said coming forward in her facing chair its never the money its the deal shaving a point gaining a percentage like the old days he suggested seriously close enough itll involve our having to discuss a lot more after we close the american contract he said looking directly at her i know said jennifer holding his eyes meet me halfway she thought id like that far enough still room to retreat i hoped you would i would too he was as relieved as she was almost too eager we could create a lot of new problems for ourselves there was no misunderstanding that you want to see my cv theres a whole page listed under problems your terms if you decide i dont want ground rules she stopped just for once for the first time since i cant remember when i want something to happen as it happens ok ok but there are things to get out of the way it wasnt an immediate contradiction she had to tell him it would be her barrier if she didnt she had to risk it becoming his i dont think you do he said cautiously its for me she admitted ok he said again although more doubtfully this time jennifer had tried to rehearse it to take away the vileness but there were no words that could she talked staring intently at him seeking the twitch of revulsion that would tell her shed lost before it began his face remained blank she almost wished it hadnt for there to have been something whatever it was doctor lloyd made the tests at the hospital im not its all right im all right hall nodded but didnt speak i wanted you to know say something please say something and now i do not enough still blank faced noncommittal and i can understand it being your problem its not mine there was a flood of relief the smile was still hesitant she had to get everything out of the way a fresh start or whatever cliche it was and we havent talked about gerald do we need to i dont want to begin with any she stumbled to a halt sniggering nervously ghosts he suggested smiling back i cant imagine i was going to say that julian mason would probably think it was good that you were jennifer became serious again her emotions on a switchback i dont feel anything i supposed i should wish almost that i did because its not right to feel nothing but thats what it is nothing not hate or sadness or regret nothing its as if he never happened never existed does that make me strange she managed another faint smile stranger than i have been that is a question for julian mason im asking you you were married to a man you never knew whom noone knew how can you feel something for someone you never knew jennifers smile broadened thank you that makes some kind of sense as much as anything does is that the end of the ground rules that never were yes i dont expect another miracle god but make this work please make this work do you want any more wine no neither do i your room emilys taken to coming in to mine if she wakes up it didnt work jennifer was tense rigid and hall couldnt relax either and was too relaxed because of it its my fault he apologized mine its noones fault itll be all right it will be wont it she said anxiously youre not frightened of you know im not frightened of anything im very excited which is the problem and i love you and everything is going to be wonderful theres one more thing we havent talked about what i think its time emily knew about gerald hall felt an intruder when jennifer discussed it with annabelle trying to decide a good time and concluding between them there wasnt one and even more awkward when jennifer pulled the child on to her lap and said she had something important to tell her its about daddy jennifer said would she feel anything about gerald now not about gerald she thought for emily about gerald perhaps whens he coming home demanded the child pulling away from jennifer and grinning up at her thats what ive got to tell you he wont be coming home darling not till when not ever not ever ever no hes got to you know when i came home with the man who told you he knew god began jennifer anxiously emily sat with her lip between her teeth tiny face creased in uncertainty she nodded and you told him about miss singleton and the picture of him on the wall it was becoming too long too convoluted emily nodded again has miss singleton told you about heaven its where god lives thats right encouraged jennifer and thats where daddy is now god needed someone to help him and asked daddy to go so he has thats not fair protested emily eyes brimming i want him i want him to come back he cant darling tell the man who knows god to make him send daddy back the tears started and jennifer had to swallow against her own he cant do that i want daddy demanded emily through the tears slapping out rudely at jennifer daddy has gone said jennifer as firmvoiced as she could manage hes not coming back because he cant i want him its just going to be the two of us now you and me said jennifer looking solemnly over emilys head to jeremy hall emily pulled away from her mother again looking in the same direction youre not going to be my daddy i know said hall that night emily wet the bed jennifer and hall still didnt manage to make love properly until that week jennifer had not maintained her promise in a church instead a priest in alton an anxious young man named tomkins had twice a week braved the outside multitude to come to her and with inadvertent naivety provided three days of tabloid headlines the worst of which had been god to the rescue that sunday jennifer decided to go to him and to his church for the first time considering himself a hardened expert hall warned inspector hughes suspecting as he did so that police leaks resulted in the very media invasion he was seeking protection against and there was a familiar cordon around the church when they arrived after battling through the throng immediately outside the house in the pew emily positioned herself very positively and suspiciously away from jeremy hall between annabelle and her mother the row behind them remained empty only two people stayed in the one in front crushed together at the far end tomkins took his sermon from the book of proverbs and quoted let us solace ourselves with love for the good man is not at home he has gone on a long journey which hall thought appropriate for their reluctant acceptance by the congregation he expected her to take communion but she didnt seeming aware of his surprise she said on the chaotic ride back im not ready yet my baptism and confirmation will be my acceptance before he got into the helicopter that came that night to collect him hall said its been quite a weekend jennifer said id wanted it to be better therell be a lot more that are chapter thirtyeight jeremy hall did not consider himself a literary judge but he was impressed by what jennifer had written when he got back to london that night she wasnt hurrying it hadnt in the first seventyfive pages hed brought back with him yet reached the moment of janes possession jennifer was being brutally scathingly honest about herself and her affair with lomax a casual adventure to begin with growing guiltily into love and hall accepted how fully her confidence had returned for her to want him to read it now that their affair had begun if not yet been properly consummated he amused himself with the impression of the president of the american publishing company trying to crawl down the telephone to get to him when he called to finalize the contract as it was the man insisted on catching an evening flight to london despite halls warning that he wouldnt be available the following day because of a court appearance that might occupy him for the remainder of the week in the event it didnt humphrey perry was again the instructing solicitor and had obtained copies of the national front membership cards of two of the four white youths upon whom his black client was accused of inflicting grievous bodily harm hall broke one of the youths in crossexamination to admit setting out to ambush the boy who in blind panic had stabbed one of his attackers with his own wrestledaway knife a typical caption under his newspaper photograph the following day called him jeremy the unbeatable he told bert feltham he didnt really want to increase his fees to a day so soon they compromised by reserving the figure for lengthy cases to which he had to devote his entire time hall promised to tell the chief clerk by the end of the week whether he would defend a murder charge as mercy killing wilbur blake reminded hall of the american lawyer whod provided so much valuable background defence material about jane lomax like ross hamilton forest ii the patricianlike publisher wore his pure white hair long and had the same clipped new england accent the lawyer with him craig beaumont was an immaculately dressed and comparatively young black man whom hall guessed from his height to have been a college basketball player blake put up only a token resistance against abandoning his demand for world rights hall surrendered the englishspeaking provinces of canada and south africa but retained australia and hall suspected he wouldnt have attempted to reduce the if beaumont hadnt prompted him they pingponged figures across the table and settled at hall had been prepared to drop the further and wished jennifer had been there to witness the negotiation particularly when he specifically excluded any film television or videorecording rights it had been jennifers suggestion to lessen the tax liability for the money to be assigned in tranches to an acculumation and maintenance trust in emilys name hall allowed it to appear the americans bargaining success while hall went legally line by line through the american contract he let blake read jennifers first seventyfive pages occasionally distracted by the americans very visible excitement it was beaumont who insisted jennifer not anyone with power of attorney sign such a large contract and they flew down the following day blake was courtly and congratulatory about what hed already read its hardly going to need any editing at all and the practical beaumont worked hard to include a clause in their agreement guaranteeing jennifer undertaking a countrywide promotional visit to the united states tied in with a lecture tour just prior to her books publication it was left to jennifers final decision nearer the time neither american regarded or treated jennifer as an oddity nor did the individual publishers who followed them in succeeding weeks although the japanese publisher wanted several photographs of himself with her on the day of the american signing hall issued a public statement detailing the deal although withholding the figure he repeated it with every contract in every country that followed and by the end of the first month had managed to divert the offers and the moblike attention away from jennifer and himself to the organizations with reproduction rights a hard core of paparazzi remained but the siege was virtually lifted in london and hampshire emily was even able to go back to miss singletons playschool although driven by annabelle and initially escorted by security men jennifer was no longer ostracized in church on sunday her first public outing with jeremy hall in london to a restaurant in chelsea harbour was a mixed ordeal of curiosity distancing apprehension and autograph demands but jennifer confronted it then and every time afterwards until the intrusion became bearable they adjusted to the need for permanent bodyguards inevitably because hall was always photographed with her newspapers and magazines linked them romantically they refused to deny or confirm it he went with her to the plastic surgeon who advised that she wait another three months for cosmetic surgery to her arms halls plea of mitigation gained a suspended sentence for the mercy killing mother he was almost glad to lose a case a fraud charge against a company chairman whose lies he didnt learn about until they were in court and those that followed but on average he won more than he lost and the newspaper eulogies and the briefs continued unabated jennifers manuscript grew and grew its not perfect but out of ten ill score life at the moment at nine said jennifer she made the remark on a saturday just the two of them at dinner but in the dining room because they were celebrating the completion of her manuscript shed refused to let him read any more than those first seventyfive pages its still rough needs polishing youll have to let it go eventually shed already revised it once the writing had consumed her which was hardly surprising but he suspected she was having second thoughts about the initial honesty any particular problem ive got two endings she admitted two one where jane finally goes the other with us and were kind of in limbo arent we theyd become lovers although still with difficulty the weekend after the american visit now the sex was perfect every time but they still bedhopped because of emilys nocturnal wandering hall recognized an awkward apology what makes you think i want to marry you anyway he said trying to lift the seriouness jennifer made the effort to respond i dont give a damn about you i want to marry you and im going to lets give her more time he said seriously shes coming around gradually seeing me as part of the furniture i want you to be more than that to her i want that too but its got to be at her pace not ours weve got all the time in the world havent we she smiled i hope so you know so i want to have a party jennifer announced excitedly smiling at him eagerly im being baptized in two sundays time ive asked dawson to do it tomkins understands and i want julian mason and dr cox and lloyd too everyone who helped me as much as they did and humphrey and geoffrey as well i suppose the house is big enough for everyone hows that sound ill be keeping my promise she thought debt paid to everyone wonderful if thats what you want youre not keen itll be another media bun fight if it leaks out when i ask the police for additional protection i dont see why it should be and if it does i dont give a damn about that either it didnt leak the adhesive paparazzi were alerted by the sudden influx of helicopters and then the emerging convoy of cars but theyd resigned themselves to some media pursuit at the church with dawsons agreement jennifer actually invited three in to photograph the ceremony emily wore a new party dress and the laidback mason had made a supreme effort by wearing a suit the pews were filled all around them and quite a few people came up to jennifer afterwards to congratulate her some even shook hands emily was allowed to stay up for the start of the dinner and showed off although not irritatingly so the only dip was when she asked dawson to tell god to send her daddy back but jennifer refused to be depressed even by that agreeing when it was time for emily to go to bed that as it was a special occasion emily could sleep in her bed jennifer only just managed to avoid looking at jeremy hall as she did so when she finally caught his eye jennifer grinned and he grinned back and she didnt care if anyone around the table saw the exchange or not it had given her an idea hall perfectly performed the role of host but it was jennifer who proposed the toast with roederer crystal for dawsons benefit and enjoyment she acknowledged each of the men around the table by name and reserved calling her recovery a miracle until she got to the urbane priest annabelle had been included in the dinner and jennifer embraced her in the gratitude thats all over now she declared and because of you all i have a future a future that i am looking forward to more than i can properly express in words although ive tried to express everything else in words over these last few months she hesitated looking directly at jeremy hall its a future i am going to share with the brilliant lawyer who can you believe i once told i didnt want in my life and now without whom i couldnt live so i am very glad i wont have to she raised her glass ive just drunk to you all so now i invite all of you to drink to jeremy and i and to our future together there was a babble of congratulation and dawson demanded to perform the wedding ceremony and they agreed at once there were more toasts to the success of the book and it was gone midnight when the two doctors helped the unsteady priest to bed before he went upstairs hall managed to separate himself sufficiently from those who remained downstairs to say he wouldnt expect her that night jennifer who was slightly and happily drunk retorted that she wouldnt be denied anything on her official engagement night and would come if she thought emily was sleeping soundly enough shed had caterers in for the evening and spent some time seeing them off the premises finally checking the kitchen before going upstairs herself emily still slept with a low nightlight which annabelle had moved into jennifers bedroom when shed settled the child down emily was sprawled sideways across the bed and stirred and muttered something from her growingup dream when jennifer lifted her back to one side so that she could get into the other having done so jennifer remained propped up on one arm looking down emilys hair was curled out on the pillow and shed put her thumb in her mouth and was sucking noisily jennifer felt an engulfing overwhelming rush of love so perfect she thought so perfect and beautiful and wonderful emily she whispered softly my emily i love you my darling her arm began to numb from the way she was supporting herself so she lay back to take her weight off it and then the numbness seized her paralysing her hello jennifer said jane chapter thirtynine jesus ive been bored almost couldnt wait several times glad i did though this is perfect everyone i want all in the same place at the same time here where it happened the first time there have been a few bright moments but not a lot difficult not to have hysterics at all that exorcism shit from the priest the voice deepened mockingly this my child is a miracle proof that god loves us and what a hypocritical cow you turned out to be pretending you believed it i know what believing is and you sure as hell havent got it it was fun conning the old motherfucker though conning you all remember how clever i was how i stopped swearing and pretended to be contrite repentant there was another voice change deep again pray with me my child seek gods forgiveness then high childlike oh yes please forgive me god for i have sinned and dont i know about sin im a practising expert learned it all from dear daddy beloved bishop the man of god taught me all the lines all the bullshit and was like every other man preached from a pulpit on sunday and fucked every woman he could lay his hands on every other day of the week while he spent mummys money impressing everybody what a good guy he was mummy didnt die in a boating accident she committed suicide drowned herself for what she couldnt tolerate not the fucking of every other woman when she saw him hit on me he never fucked me hut he wanted to was panting for it so i set the whole thing up asked them both but separately to see my confirmation dress on the day of the ceremony asked him to come to my room first i was waiting for him naked let him feel so hed be doing it when mummy came i wanted her to divorce the bastard cut him off without a penny so he couldnt buy his respect any more but she killed herself instead for the rest of his life i kept him never knowing if id tell anyone and at home i always walked about naked taunting him with what he couldnt have drove him mad and i loved it loved torturing the dirty lying cheating bastard a cheating bastard of god thats when i decided the devil was more fun all those years ago thats how i amused myself when i got here used to pretend to all the jesus jockeys and kneel among them and when they prayed to their god i prayed to mine for my father to burn in hell in more agony than anyone else imagine that i became a bigger better hypocrite than bishop daddy which is what he made me call him think what ive done jennifer dawson was right i really am the devil incarnate i left my blood and fingerprints and hair for dna on purpose i really did i planned it ive legally proved in a court of law that ghosts exist ive fucked religion when ive finished tonight there are going to be devil cults all over the world praying to me thats the most brilliant part of everything ive done but it was fun torturing you like i tortured bishop daddy you really believed youd worked out the numbness to tell you when i was with you all by yourself didnt you i did it on purpose shitforbrains all of it made you numb when i wanted to didnt bother when i intended you and the idiots with you to imagine you were free youve never been free there hasnt been a moment when i havent been there knowing everything thats been going on never will be christ i cant believe how stupid you all were jennifer struggled to move but couldnt her mouth was frozen half open but no sound came when she tried to scream she couldnt even move her tongue dont tire yourself honey youre not going to do or say anything for yourself any more just for me what i want to do your boyfriends not much good in the fuck stakes is he ive seen bigger dicks on newborn babies hardly knows how to use it either you did a good job faking orgasms jennifer best supporting role in our own very special oscar nominations how about that not a bad lawyer though i was frightened noone was going to pick up on the clues id left behind thought i was going to have to have you do it wasnt that phoney trial a scream another time i could hardly stop myself laughing interesting what he found out though would have put gerald in the gas chamber where he belonged and he got it right about why im doing this to you nothing at all about my murder always knew you werent involved in that emily stirred turning in her sleep and throwing an arm out as she did so jennifer could feel the warmth from the little hand that book youve spent so much time on not bad by the way is going to round it all off very nicely isnt it im going to be the one to provide the ending you could not make up your mind about one you never thought of my very own bible for all my waiting worshippers now heres what were going to do jennifer were going to kill emily first and then jeremy hes expecting you after all after that well just take them out as they come simply wander down the corridor helping ourselves the priest and cox and lloyd and the psychiatrist and those other fucking lawyers might as well include annabelle while were about it how manys that eight and the brat thatll do and dont think youll be able to stop me oh and dont think ill let you commit suicide either ill stop you ever doing that youre going to suffer until youre a very old lady for taking gerald away from me that really was your crime taking him from me mine was believing he was any different from all the other men but then that was yours too wasnt it now just so youll understand everything youre going to be able to move your head just your head sideways but not speak see it thats a kitchen knife just like the one you used on gerald you carried it up here tonight and you didnt even know id made you did you here we go then im taking over now jennifer taking over until i want you to realize what ive made you do emilys got to know before you do it of course hate her mother for the last few seconds of her life emily wake up emily
